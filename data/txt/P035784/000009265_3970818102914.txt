I. COUNTRY AND ENERGY SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Country Context
1.1          Georgia has 5.4 million people in an area of 69,700 km2 bounded by Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkey and the Black Sea. At independence in April 1991, Georgia was relatively
well-off with an educated labor force, a long tradition of entrepreneurship, and substantial natural
resources. Georgia's economy traditionally revolved around Black Sea tourism; cultivation of citrus
fruits, tea, and grapes; mining of manganese and copper; and a small industrial sector producing wine,
metals, machinery, chemicals, and textiles. The country also benefitted from transit fees, serving as an
important trade and transit corridor between Europe and Asia. Georgia's economy was highly integrated
within the former Soviet Union (FSU): total external trade - the average of imports and exports -
amounted to almost 43% of GDP in 1988-90, of which about 86% was with other FSU republics. The
country imported most of its energy fuels, including gas and petroleum products. Its only sizable domestic
energy sources are hydropower and woodfuel, providing about 16 percent each of its primary energy
needs.
1.2          The economic decline in Georgia has been dramatic, even in comparison with other FSU
countries. Since 1990, widespread conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia have magnified the economic
crisis resulting from the disintegration of the Soviet command economy in December 1991. The
cumulative decline in recorded output for the period 1990-1995 is estimated at more than 70%. Lax
fiscal and monetary policies led to large budget deficits and high inflation. Diminishing exports, due to
shrinking export markets and falling domestic output, and deteriorating terms of trade driven mainly by
the increasing costs of energy imports', quickly led to the accumulation of significant external debt and
payment arrears. Throughout 1993 and 1994, much of industry was functioning at only 20% of capacity;
heavy disruptions in agriculture took place; and tourism was shut down. The country was precariously
dependent on EU and US humanitarian grain shipments. Georgia is still suffering from an energy crisis,
as it is having problems paying for the necessary energy imports. Georgia is pinning its hopes for
recovery on reforming the economy along open market lines, reestablishing trade ties and on exploiting
its advantageous geographical position by developing international transport through the key Black Sea
ports of Poti and Batumi.
1.3          The severe economic decline has been caused largely by the break-up of economic ties
with other FSU republics and by ethnic and civil strife Georgia has suffered since independence. A
cease-fire went into effect in South Ossetia in 1992, and in Abkhazia in 1994, improving the political
situation. The government introduced a program to stabilize and reform the economy, including: stricter
monetary control; fiscal reforms with new tax measures and reduction of subsidies; strengthening the
financial sector; acceleration of privatization process; further liberalization of prices, foreign exchange
and trade regimes; and maintenance of a minimum social safety net. Implementation of the program has
been supported by the IMF and the World Bank. The IMF approved two purchases under the Systemic
Transformation Facility of US$40 million, in December 1994 and June 1995, and a Standby Arrangement
of US$104 million in June 1995. The World Bank (IDA) approved a Rehabilitation Credit of US$75
I     The price of oil and natural gas increased over 500% in dollar terms between 1991 and 1993.

million in March 1995, and a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) of US$60 million in April 1996.
Recent political events, including approval of a new Constitution, and the presidential and parliamentary
elections in November 1995, further stabilized the political situation and strengthened the economic
reforms. However, no long-term solution has yet been found for the status of Abkhazia and South
Ossetia.
B. Overview and Perspectives of the Energy Sector
1.4          Energy Demand. In the late
1980s,  the  primary  annual  energy          °°° Hr    0
consumption per capita exceeded 2.5 tons of  6000-1                          79000
oil equivalent, almost three times the average    0,.
of lower middle-income countries, indicating  000                            - 8000
a high energy intensity of the economy. The    D                               0_ ooo
steep downturn in the economy, combined                                       60.0
with severe energy supply shortages, resulted  0°                             600007
in  a  steady  decline  of gross  energy      000 -.                           000
consumption since 1990 (see Figure 1.1 and         I
Table 1.1). Given that economic output        000 H                           4000
declined faster than energy consumption, the    0               -   d          000
intensity in energy use actually increased.         990 99  99  99  994 99
Despite the energy supply constraints, little
evidence exists of attempts to improve energy                e g °   plo
efficiency or conserve energy.   To the                     DP
contrary, the shift in the structure of energy Fig. 1.1 GDP and Energy Consumption
consumption toward non-productive sectors
(households, budgetary organizations) - another indicator of inefficient allocation of available energy
resources (Table 1.1) - points to a worsening in energy intensity.
1.5          Primary Energy Resources. Georgia's main energy resource is hydropower. The
technical annual hydropower potential is estimated at about 88 TWh, of which only about 10% has been
developed. Coal reserves in the three mining regions (Tkvarcheli, Akhaltsikhe, Tkhibuli-Shaori) are
estimated at about 400 million tons. The coal industry, which used to produce 50% of primary energy
supply, has been constantly shrinking for the past 30 years, with only 4 mines in the Tkhibuli-Shaori
region currently operating. Estimates of proven oil reserves stand at 12 million tons. Oil production has
also declined significantly, from 3 million tons per year in the early 1980s to less than 70,000 tons in the
last few years, due to drying-up of the wells and increasingly difficult extraction conditions. Domestic
natural gas production is small, as well as the proven reserves (about 10 billion cubic meters). In
addition to hydro, renewable resources include wind, geothermal and solar energy.

Note: To convert a 1000 toe into natural units, the above numbers should be multiplied by the following factors: 4.0 for
hydropower and electricity imports and exports (in GWh); 1.74 for coal (in 1000 tons); 1.24 for natural gas (in million
cubic meters); 1.0 for crude oil (in 1000 tons); 0.92 for LPG (in 1000 tons); 1.0 for Kerosine (in 1000 tons); 1.04 for fuel
oil (in 1000 tons); 1.0 for other oil products (in tons); 5.37 for woodfuel (in 1000 cubic meters, solid).
1.6            Energy Supply. Georgia has been meeting a declining share of its primary energy needs
from domestic production, from close to 50% in the early 1980s to only 10-15%  in the pre-crisis years.
The decline was largely due to the rapid decrease in domestic oil production and substitution of domestic
coal and lignite with then-cheap gas from other republics. After the break-up of the FSU and the sharp
increase in prices of energy imports, Georgia quickly accumulated significant external debt and payment
arrears, and could not sustain the needed level of energy imports and supply. Domestic energy
production also declined, although its share in total primary energy supply increased by 1994 to 34%,
but at the expense of major energy shortages.  There was a consequently large increase in the
uncontrolled use of woodfuel, damaging the environment, especially the forests. Inadequate energy
supply has become a major impediment to economic recovery.

1.7           Energy Prices. With the exception of prices for oil products imported by private traders
which are liberalized, energy prices are regulated by the Ministry of Economy. The prices have been
historically kept much below the economic supply costs and energy consumption was heavily subsidized.
The problem has been exacerbated by the extremely low collection of payments for gas and electricity
(see Chapter IlI. B). Only in 1994 did the Government eliminate subsidies and start closing the gap
between prices and costs, but significant problems, particularly with electricity prices and collection rates,
still persist.
1.8           Macroeconomnic and Energy Demand Prospects.  The prudent economic policies and
implementation of the stabilization program over the last two and a half years have resulted in
stabilization of macroeconomic conditions. The overall budget deficit (on accrual basis and including
grants) was reduced from 16.5%  of GDP in 1994 to 5.3%  in 1995 and 3.9%  in 1996. The average
monthly inflation rate fell from 64 % in 1994 to about 4 % in 1995 and 1.1 % in 1996. The exchange rate
has remained stable since the end of 1994. Economic growth resumed in 1995 (2.4%), and further
increased in 1996 (10.5%), building on the recovery of agriculture and the service sectors observed in
1995. The progress was supported by improved institutional and political conditions, and the continuous
progress in privatization, restructuring of the infrastructure sectors and by the steady increasing trade with
neighboring countries. GDP is expected to grow at about 10 percent during the next several years
followed by a gradual return to more modest growth of about 5 to 6 percent. Improvements in living
standards will also be gradual, and only by the turn of the century will private consumption levels recover
to the pre-1993 levels. Energy demand is expected to follow the general pattern of economic output.
Improvements in energy efficiency, particularly in the medium-to-long term, should keep, rates of
increasing energy consumption below the economic output rates.
1.9           Sector Organization and Institutions.  Georgia's energy sector organizational and
institutional infrastructure is still dominated by Soviet-era establishments --large monopolistic government-
owned enterprises/departments2 which, in addition to exercising business and ownership functions, have
major roles in policy making and regulation. Between 1993 -- when the Ministry of Energy was
abolished -- and 1996 -- when it was re-established -- there was no clear institutional responsibility for
energy policy. As result, day-to-day crisis management and reactive measures, rather than active
management of energy issues, have characterized the recent period. The weakness of the administrative
structure has contributed significantly to the slow pace of reforms in the energy sector concerning sector
restructuring, commercialization and privatization.
1.10          In spite of this, the economic and political changes did start to make some inroads into
the energy sector. Oil product marketing has been liberalized and open to the private sector, although
more needs to be done to make the market more competitive and transparent. There are a number of
joint ventures with foreign private companies in oil exploration and production. Gas transmission is
moving toward an open-access regime. The power sector is making an earnest attempt to reform, as
described in more detail in Section D.
2     The following are main government enterprisesldepartments in the energy sector: Sakgaze (gas transmission and
distribution), Saknaftobi (oil production and refining), Saknaftoproducti (oil product distribution), and Saknahchiri (coal
production). Sakenergo - former department of electric power -- is being restructured.



Country and Energy Sector Background                                                                       5
1.11            Energy Sector Financial and Operational Issues. Failure to adjust domestic energy
prices to increasing supply costs, coupled with extremely low collection of payments for gas and
electricity over a prolonged period3, made the energy enterprises insolvent and significantly contributed
toward accumulation of large external and internal debts and payment arrears. Debt for energy imports
increased significantly: total government debt to Turkmenistan for natural gas imports grew from zero
in 1991 to US$440 million in 19944. In the context of high inflation eroding domestic debt this
amounted to a significant subsidization of consumers at the expense of energy enterprises, creating major
distortions in the economy and accumulation of external debt. The financial problems led to maintenance
backlogs, disrepair, accelerated dilapidation of physical assets, and substandard operation of energy
facilities. Both technical and commercial energy losses increased as well.
1.12            Investment Priorities in the Energy Sector.  While in the FSU, Georgia developed
significant, although suboptimal, energy infrastructure. Part of it is run down and may be beyond repair,
but still a significant part is operational or can be rehabilitated. Rehabilitation of the existing facilities,
particularly in the electricity and gas sectors, should be generally more cost-effective than investment in
new ones. Investment objectives, in the short-to-medium term, should focus on alleviation of energy
shortages through rehabilitation and repairs, and on strengthening commercial functions, through reducing
commercial losses and supporting financial recovery through improved metering, pricing, billing and
collections.
1.13            Other Energy Sector Issues. The internal and regional political problems have created
major difficulties in energy supply as well. The civil upheavals in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well
as elsewhere in the region (Chechnya) - the areas through which major transport and energy network
routes are passing - made energy imports impossible or extremely difficult and expensive. Access to
the largest hydropower plant in Georgia, the Inguri plant with 1300 MW nominal capacity, located in
Abkhazia and in need of urgent repair, is limited, which makes it difficult to operate and maintain and
raises the issue of the safety of the plant and dam5. Imports of electricity to Abkhazia and South Ossetia
3       Until September 1994, domestic tariffs for gas and electricity were several times lower than the supply costs. Since
then, the tariffs have increased, but are still below the cost recovery level (see Section III.B).
4       Gas imports in 1995 were sharply reduced, and handled by commercial enterprises rather than through the
intergovernmental agreements. As a result, the Government debt for gas imports should not have increased significantly,
although the figures are not yet available. Negotiations with Turkmenistan on rescheduling the existing debt are still going on
although haltingly.
5       The Inguri plant generated between 2.3 and 4.3 TWh electricity annually, or almost 50% of domestic hydropower.
Although the plant is in Abkhazia, its dam and water reservoir are outside the Abkhazia region. The reservoir, with a volume
of 1110 million m3, has a dual curvature arch dam, 272 meters high (the world highest) and 728 meters long at its crest. In
an accident in November 1994, while trying to raise a 200-ton slide gate which isolates each of the seven low-level outlets (180
m below the dam crest), a gantry crane rail ruptured, rendering the crane unusable. Five workers lost their lives. The gate
seals are in poor condition but cannot be repaired until the slide gate is restored. Water leaks through the gates at a rate of about
25 cubic meters per second, equivalent to about 1.8 GWh of electricity per day (657 GWh annually, worth about US$20 million
if valued at US c3/kWh). A large portion of equipment and instrumentation at the dam was destroyed or stolen during the civil
strife in the area. Given the size of the reservoir and the dam, measures to repair the damage and install additional equipment
for safety monitoring are of highest priority.

from Russia are not controlled by Sakenergo - Georgia's power utility company - but Georgia accepts
financial obligations for these imports, although Sakenergo cannot collect payments6 (see para. 3.17).
C. Power Sector Conditions and Priority Needs
1.14         Electricity Demand. The share of electricity in final consumption was about 36-38%
in the late 1980s-early 1990s, falling to less than 25% by 1995. This decline is largely explained by the
sharp drop in outputs and incomes in the economy, and partly by the severe electricity shortages that have
beset the electricity supply industry due to the dependance of generation on imported gas and the unabated
deterioration of the industry's assets. Total gross consumption of electricity fell from 17.4 TWh in 1989
to 7.6 TWh in 1995 (Table 1.2). End-user demand fell even more because of increased losses. Sectoral
shifts in electricity consumption reveal increased share of household consumption - from about 16% in
1988 to more than 40% in 1994 - in spite of the fact that households kept paying less than 10% of what
they owed. Electricity, in the absence of gas and district heating, was the only available energy (even
if intermittently) to many households in larger cities, which used it for space and water heating, often
with makeshift appliances. Lack of any serious enforcement of payments through cut-offs (or otherwise)
kept electricity demand relatively high and above available supply. This, in turn, led to rationing of
electricity by the government according to political priorities rather than its allocation by commercial and
economic principles. Government's priorities have favored households at the expense of productive uses,
worsening the already precarious financial position of the power sector, further eroding the power
industry's ability to maintain its assets and supply electricity on an economic and reliable basis. This
destabilizing downward spiral has not yet been stopped.
1.15          Electricity demand in 1997 is assumed to be supply-constrained, because of both the
limited domestic electricity production capabilities and limited capability to pay for imports of fuel and
electricity. On the basis of expected available supply, demand in 1997 was set at 6.9 TWh. Demand
for the period after 1997 was forecast7 on the basis of expected economic growth. To account also for
the expected real increases in effective tariffs, a dynamic model was developed. From 1998 to 2000
demand is expected to grow at close to 10 percent per annum, and at 5.2 percent afterwards (Annex 3).
1.16         Electricity Supply. Georgia's domestic power generation -- i.e., generation based on
domestic primary energy resources -- has been based since the early 1980s entirely on hydropower, and
amounted to about 50% of total domestic consumption. The rest was generated using imported natural
gas and oil (about 30 %), and directly imported (about 20 %). Total annual hydro generation in the period
1989-1995 declined from about 8100 GWh in 1989 to 4600 GWh in 1994 and 5600 GWh in 1995;
thermal generation decreased continuously from about 6400 in 1989-90 to 703 GWh in 1995; and imports
also continuously declined from 4000-4300 GWh in 1989-90 to 754 GWh in 1995. Some electricity was
exported (1700 GWh in 1989), but these exports were seasonal, in periods of high water inflows and full
reservoirs (late spring-early summer); in the past few years even such exports disappeared. Dependence
on  electricity  imports  and  domestic  generation  based  on  imported  fuel  increased
6      In 1995, Abkhazia consumed 707 GWh and South Ossetia 118 GWh, which amounts to about 13 % of total consumption
at the distribution level.
7      The forecast was made for the total domestic demand, without self-consumption of power plants.

8                                                             Country and Energy Sector Background
with the late 1970s-early 1980s conversion of power plants from using domestic coal to firing imported
gas and oil. The increasing difficulties in financing imports of gas, oil and electricity in the aftermath
of the FSU break-up and the disrepair of the Gardabani plant, caused a sharp decline in the import-related
electricity supply. In 1989, direct electricity imports and domestic generation based on imported fuel
amounted to about 10.3 TWh; the same figure in 1995 stood at about 1.5 TWh. Internal civil conflicts,
particularly in Abkhazia (where the Inguri hydro plant is located), and deterioration of hydro plants and
power system facilities in general due to lack of maintenance and sub-standard operation, led to a
decrease in domestic generation and increased losses, further reducing the amount of electricity available
to end-users. During the last several years electricity was strictly rationed. Supply in the winter was
available even in Tbilisi for a few hours only, and some regions have been continuously disconnected.
1.17           Electric Power Infrastructure. Georgia has an extensive electric network coverage -
practically all households are connected to the network. Its generation and transmission capacities were
developed in the context of the FSU economic and power system planning, and operated as a part of the
integrated power system of the FSU.8 Both the fuel mix (share of hydropower, coal, oil, gas etc. in
electricity generation) and the capacity mix (size and type of generating units - base, intermediate,
peaking) were optimized relative to the Transcaucasus Integrated Power System (IPS) and the FSU
system, and are sub-optimal for Georgia's power system taken alone.
1.18           Total installed nameplate capacity of power plants in Georgia is about 5,090 MW, of
which 2,088 MW belongs to three thermal plants with 15 units (Gardabani - 1,850 MW, 10 units;
Tkvarcheli - 220 MW, 2 units; Tbilisi CHP - 18 MW, 3 units); 2,843.5 MW is in 103 hydro plants with
182 units (of which 6 are large storage plants and 17 are larger run-of-river (RoR) plants; others are
small RoR plants), 5.4 MW are diesel units, and about 153 MW industrial plants ("block stations"). The
available capacity, however, is much lower, because of disrepair and damage caused by the civil wars
and improper operation. The currently available thermal capacity is only about 400 MW, while the
available capacity at hydro plants ranges between 400 MW and 1,000 MW, depending on water
availability and maintenance status. Average production of all hydro plants would theoretically be about
10,000 GWh per year, assuming all were operational and in good condition; maximum production,
however, was 8,777 GWh in 1988, and average production between 1985 and 1993 was 7,480 GWh;
in 1994 it reached only 4,500 GWh.
1.19           The power transmission network consists of 500-kV, 330-kV, and 220-kV lines. The
500-kV line is the transmission backbone, connecting the western part of the country, where most of
hydro generation is concentrated including Inguri, with the Gardabani plant in the eastern part. It was
also meant to be the main regional transmission link, connecting Georgia, Russia and Azerbaijan.
Georgia has another 220-kV link with Russia, a 220-kV link with Armenia, a 1 10-kV with Turkey, and
220-kV and 330-kV connections with Azerbaijan. The network of 220 kV and higher voltage has 18
substations; including the 1 10-kV network (part of which has a transmission role as well), the number
of substations rises to 260. The transmission network suffers from the lack of regular maintenance and
S      Together with the power systems of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Georgian system constituted the Transcaucasian
Interconnected Power System (IPS) - one of the 11 IPSs in the FSU - controlled and dispatched from the Transcaucasian
regional dispatch center in Tbilisi (subordinated to the main system dispatch center in Moscow), to which the Georgian national
dispatch center (also in Tbilisi) was subordinated. In the regional context, Georgia had been developing hydro plants, Azerbaijan
oil-based plants, and Armenia built a nuclear plant (in addition to a mixture of gas-fired and hydropower plants). In all three
countries, as in the FSU in general, investment policies in the last 15-20 years favored use of natural gas in electricity
generation. The Transcaucasus region, as a whole, was an energy and electricity importer in the FSU, although net direct
electricity imports, unlike fuel imports, were not significant.



Country and Energy Sector Background                                                                    9
theft of the material, and has very poor reliability9. In addition to the problems characterizing the
transmission network (lack of maintenance, pilferage), the distribution network has been subject to more
difficult operating regimes during the hours when electricity was available as the only energy to
households and, therefore experiencing surges in demand frequently above the design capacity, which has
led to damage of the equipment.
1.20            The main national dispatch center (NDC) is located in Tbilisi, with a regional dispatch
center in Kutaisi serving as its backup. The real-time data acquisition system -- rudimentary by design
with no remote control capabilities -- is practically inoperable. Dispatchers at NDC have to rely on
verbal phone conversations with the field operators to monitor and control the system. However, this
mode of communication is also unreliable because of the poor telephone system, and dispatchers
sometimes do not have even a phone connection with some hydro plants for days.
1.21            The power system in Georgia operates in permanent semi-emergency mode. Not only
is it cut off from the neighboring systems'", but it often operates several electrically independent
subsystems, with certain power plants supplying certain limited geographical areas. With demand
exceeding the available supply, dispatchers are continuously struggling to maintain the electric balance
by switching-off consumers and rationing electricity. The generation/consumption balance is usually
maintained at a system frequency of less than the optimal 50 Hz, which enables supply to be provided
to a somewhat larger number of customers, although with poorer quality and at the cost of accelerated
deterioration of power system's and users' equipment. With such poor control and commnunications,
system frequency is also very unstable, which has additional negative effects on the equipmentu.
Technical and commercial losses in the transmission and distribution network are high -- about 25 % for
the first ten months in 1996, without supplies to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and 34 % if supplies to these
regions are accounted for as commercial losses. Other problems include low availability, reliability and
efficiency of the Gardabani thermal power plant, high water losses at hydro plants and their low
efficiency, and lack of spare parts and qualified maintenance personnel. Poor communications facilities
are preventing full dispatch control of the system.
1.22            Investment priorities.  In the short-to-medium  term general investment priorities are
to restore the system capacity through enhanced maintenance, repair and rehabilitation. This would
alleviate the electricity shortages and create conditions to connect the system with neighboring electricity
networks, enabling better electricity trade and parallel operation, and improving the quality and reliability
of service. Analysis of system generation capacity and demand forecast (Annex 3) leads to the conclusion
that, most likely, no new generation capacity is needed before the year 2002. Based on Sakenergo's
9       The transmission system experienced 114 incidents of line outages on 500-, 330- and 220-kV lines in the first 8 months
of 1995. It was reported that the line faults were a major cause of these outages, which often led to regional or country-wide
blackouts (27 country-wide blackouts were reported in the same period).
10     Imports are effected in so-called "radial" regime where consumers, fed through an import line, are cut-off electrically
from the rest of the Georgian power system which, consequently, continues to operate in the "island" mode.
11      During the last two winters frequency was kept mostly at about 45 Hz, occasionally decreasing as low as 42 Hz.
After the rehabilitation of unit 9 at Gardabani, the frequency is not allowed to go below 48.5 Hz (otherwise the unit would trip).
Because of unstable frequency, however, which continuously changes by several tenths of a Herz within several minutes - an
extremely undesirable and unstable regime - the newly rehabilitated 300-MW unit 9 at the Gardabani plant cannot exceed
generation of 180 MW.



10                                                            Country and Energy Sector Background
assessment and some preliminary system studies"2, rehabilitation of 300-MW units (no. 9 and 10) at the
Gardabani thermal power station, and rehabilitation of larger hydro plants Inguri, Ladjanuri, Khrami-II,
Tkhibuli, Vartsikhe, Rioni, Gumatai and Jinvali -- should be given highest priority'3. Several options are
available for system expansion in the medium-to-long term (after year 2001), with large hydro potential
of the country playing the most important role.
1.23           Similarly, operation of transmission and distribution networks could be significantly
improved through a number of low-cost measures, such as replacement of circuit-breakers, air
compressors, accumulator batteries, etc. Priorities should be given to the substations connecting the
network to major power plants and load centers, and interconnecting system to the neighboring countries.
The replacement of windings, cores and oil for transformers, and other items, based on an in-depth
inventory of problems in distribution, could be of great benefit in enhancing reliability and quality of
service. The improvements will have to be implemented over time and selectively, with first priority
given to major load centers and improvements in metering and load management capabilities.
1.24           Urgent measures are needed to restore at least basic communications with power plants
and major substations to ensure a minimal level of system integrity and reliability. In the medium-to-long
term it would be necessary to install modern communications, data acquisition and monitoring systems,
and to upgrade control and dispatch to a technical standard common in today's power systems.
1.25           The total investment needs for the generation system until the year 2005 have been
estimated at about US$800 million of which about US$300 million would be used for rehabilitation of
the existing plants (mainly until the year 2002) to recover about 1500 MW, and the rest for the
construction or completion of new plants (after the year 2000). Under the assumed demand projection
scenario (Annex 3), new capacity will not be needed before the year 2002. The needed rehabilitation
works could be financed initially, in large part, through borrowing from international financing
institutions. International financing institutions have committed or are considering allocation of about
US$180 million for investment in the power sector in the 1995-1998 period (Annex 5). As the system
restores its capacity and financial health, and with general economic recovery, investments would be
increasingly financed through privatization, internal resources and commercial borrowing. Since the
financing needs will increase as new projects come on stream, it will be necessary to attract more capital
from the private sector, both domestic and foreign. The commercialization, corporatization, and
restructuring of the power industry, establishment of a modern legal and regulatory framework, and
privatization of sector enterprises which have already been initiated, should encourage private sector
investment, either directly through various independent power producer schemes, or through lending.
1.26           Sector Financial Crisis. The entire electric power sector is in a deep financial crisis.
Due to low tariffs and, particularly, low collection of payments (only about 20% in 1995, and about 50%
in 1996), the power industry has incurred heavy financial and asset losses, accumulated large debts and
payment arrears, and suffered persistent shortage of working capital. The low collections were due to
several factors: (i) inadequate social safety net in the context of the sharp economic contraction and
12     "Development of an Energy Policy in Georgia - Rehabilitation and Extension of the Hydroelectric System",
Kantor/Seed Consortium, 1994;
13     Rehabilitation of the Inguri plant should probably be first priority on technical grounds (see footnote 5). Because of
the political problems in the region, however, the risk associated with launching a major rehabilitation project at this time would
be very high. Once the political situation in Abkhazia is stabilized, both the Inguri and hydro plants which are downstream of
the Inguri, should be rehabilitated

income decline, and tolerance of non-payment from all consumers, particularly residential; (ii) inefficient
sector organization and management, (iii) political interference with its operation, resulting in failure of
electricity enterprises to fully enforce payments through disconnection of non-payers or other legal means;
(iv) inadequate or delayed budgetary transfers to organizations that are financed fully or partially by
central or local government budgets (schools, hospitals, water and sewerage companies, etc.); and (v)
political problems, particularly those related to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The ability of domestic
banks to provide credit for working capital was, and still is, very limited. Shortage of working capital
becomes particularly critical during winter periods, when fuel requirements of the Gardabani thermal
plant -- providing 40-50% of electricity supply to the country in the winter -- are highest. This creates
severe shortages of electricity during the critical winter seasons and results in serious political problems
for the Governmnent, making it difficult to implement the reform program  calling for significant
improvements in collections and increase in tariffs.
D. Goverrnent Policy and Strategy in the Power Sector
1.27          Stemming the energy crisis and improving the energy supply is one of the highest
priorities for the Government of Georgia, as it would remove a major constraint on economic recovery
and cause of hardship to the population. The main objectives of the Government policy in the power
sector in the short-term are to increase power supply and improve collection of payments -- the two major
premises for resolving the current energy crisis. The first objective is to be achieved mainly through
rehabilitation projects, which would recover the production capacity -- lost by lack of maintenance and
improper operation of the existing facilities -- and improve supply efficiency. Several rehabilitation
projects have already been initiated or are under preparation -- all financed by the international
multilateral and bilateral agencies. Improved collections would also lead to immediate improvement in
power supply by enabling more financing of fuel and electricity imports. Furthermore, improved
collections are the necessary element to any sustainable strategy to arrest the energy crisis and recover
the sector.
1.28          The Government is aware that more than physical rehabilitation needs to be done in order
to improve operation of the power sector on a sustainable basis. With assistance from the World Bank,
USAID, Government of Germany (via KfW), EBRD, EU, and other international agencies, the
Goverment has been developing a reform strategy for the sector, which addresses its institutional,
financial, and structural problems. The main objectives, principles and policies of this strategy are
outlined in the Government's Letter of Sector Development Policy (LSDP). The LSDP (Annex 1) states
that Goverment's strategy to achieve sustainable efficiency in the power sector will be based on: (i)
corporatization, commercialization and decentralization (unbundling) of the power industry; (ii)
implementation of commercial practices and enforcement of payments; (iii) economic pricing of electricity
with due regard to poor residential users; (iv) establishment of a legal and regulatory framework to
promote competition and private sector participation, including instituting an independent regulatory
agency; (v) optimization of the use of resources by fostering least cost development plans; (vi) focusing
investments in the short and medium term on the economic rehabilitation of existing facilities and
completion of economically viable but partially completed projects; (vii) promotion of efficient use and
conservation of electricity; and (viii) protection of the environment in electricity production and use.
1.29          The Govermment started to implement some measures related to its new policy. In June
1996, Parliament established a Ministry of Energy (which had been abolished in 1993) -- as the main
agency for implementing and coordinating Government policies in the sector. In July 1996 the President
issued a Decree on Power Sector Reforms (Annex 2). The Decree stipulates:



12                                                         Country and Energy Sector Background
(i)    preparation of an electricity law;
(ii)    establishment of an Electricity Regulatory  Commission  and development of a
methodology for setting electricity tariffs;
(iii)   restructuring of the power industry through separation of generation, transmission and
distribution activities;
(iv)    commercialization of sector enterprises;
(v)    development of privatization strategies for generation and distribution companies.
1.30          Implementation of the Decree is in progress.  The Electricity law, satisfactory to IDA,
was presented to the Parliament on May 6, 1997. The electricity regulatory agency -- now attached to
the Ministry of Economy -- should become independent after adoption of electricity law by the
Parliament. Sakenergo -- formerly vertically integrated state power utility company -- has been separated
into distribution, transmission-and-dispatch, and generation companies. A number of municipally-based
distribution companies have been established.  Sakenergo has become a transmission-and-dispatch
company, a state enterprise which operates the transmission network and controls dispatch, and acts as
a wholesale supplier. There are two newly created generation companies: (i) Tbilsresi, a joint-stock
company which operates the Gardabani thermal power plant, and (ii) Sakenergogeneration, a state
enterprise which operates all other generation capacities which belonged to Sakenergo before
restructuring. A number of independent power suppliers -- a few small privatized hydro plants and
several industrial cogeneration plants -- continue selling their electricity to Sakenergo.
1.31          The electricity market in Georgia is also in transition. At the wholesale level it currently
operates predominantly in the central-purchasing-agency mode, with Sakenergo -- the power purchasing
agency for domestic generation and imports and the wholesale supplier to distribution companies and
direct consumers -- acting as a central purchasing agency. However, some generators (some hydro plants
within Sakenergogeneration and some private plants) sell their electricity directly to industrial consumers.
At the retail-sale level, residential, commercial and most industrial customers buy electricity from the
local distribution companies; some industrial consumers, however, buy electricity from Sakenergo or
from power plants directly. The market structure is expected to evolve further toward increased
competition in the generation sector, as well as in the end-user supply market.
1.32          The Government and the sector enterprises have taken steps to resolve the problem of
payment arrears, low collections and low tariffs.  During the period September-December 1996,
Sakenergo, Sakenergogeneration and Tbilsresi, together with the Government, prepared a Financial
Rehabilitation Plan for the power industry, restructured payment arrears and strengthened contractual
relationships. Collections, although still low, have steadily improved during 1996, reaching the average
level of about 56%, compared with less than 20% in 1995. A further major improvement in collection
rates is needed, particularly in the residential sector, but the trend is very encouraging. The Government
has also increased residential tariffs in December 1996 to 3.5 tetri/kWh, bringing them closer to the level
of 4.5 tetri/kWh charged to other users. The Government intends to increase residential tariffs after the
1996/97 winter to 4.5 tetri/kWh, bringing the average end-user tariffs close to the full cost-recovery
level.

1.33          The Government is developing a privatization strategy for the power sector.  A
privatization decree, setting some general principles for privatization of generation and distribution
companies, was issued by the Government in December 1996.
E. World Bank Strategy and Experience
1.34          The World Bank's lending experience in Georgia dates from FY95, but already nine
projects have been approved. Five projects are under implementation, two have closed, and two recently
approved are not yet effective. Three operations were approved in FY95: an Institution Building Credit
of US$10.1 million equivalent (July 5, 1994), a Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation Credit of US$18
million equivalent (November 8, 1994), and a Rehabilitation Credit of US$75 million equivalent (March
30, 1995; closed). Following strong implementation of the Government's 1995 economic reform program
supported by the Rehabilitation Credit, a Structural Adjustment Credit of US$60 million equivalent (April
18, 1996; closed), aimed at deepening structural reforms, was approved, along with a Structural
Adjustment Technical Assistance Credit of US$4.8 million equivalent (April 18, 1996) to facilitate
implementation of these reforms through provision of technical assistance. Two investment projects were
approved in FY96, one in the transport sector in the amount of US$12 million equivalent (January 18,
1996) to cover urgent rehabilitation needs, and the other in the health sector in the amount of US$14
million (April 25, 1996) to assist in the implementation of the Government's ambitious health sector
reform program. Two operations were approved in FY97: an Agriculture Development Project of US$15
million equivalent (March 25, 1997) and an Oil Institution Building Technical Assistance Project of
US$1.4 million equivalent (April 8, 1997). Georgia is also benefitting from the GEF-funded Black Sea
Environmental Program.
1.35          Overall portfolio performance is good despite the relative lack of experience in
implementing World Bank projects.  The three most important contributing factors to this good
performance have been strong ownership of the program by the Government, extensive efforts aimed at
strengthening project implementation capacities through training of local staff and provision of consulting
services, and strong structural reforms performance enabling the development of sound investment
programs.
1.36          The proposed Power Rehabilitation Project would be the second IDA credit to the Georgia
energy sector"4. A limited Country Assistance Strategy, whose objectives are to help reverse economic
decline, assist in the transition to a market economy, and to alleviate the poverty which has emerged in
Georgia in recent years, was discussed by the Board on March 30, 1995 as part of the President's Report
for the Rehabilitation Credit (Report No. P-6797-GE). The proposed project is consistent with that
strategy, which identified the energy sector as one of the key constraints to economic development. The
strategy recognized the needs for rehabilitation of the existing electricity infrastructure and for policy and
institutional strengthening of the power sector. The preparation of the project took into account the
lessons learned from past operations. Government support of the energy sector reform program and of
the identified investment needs to be financed under the proposed project has been very strong. The
proposed project results from a closely coordinated effort among all involved partners, both within
Georgia and among financial institutions and bilateral donors. Some most important elements of energy
policy and institutional reforms, including elimination of direct and indirect subsidies (in the form of
tolerating non-payments, maintaining low tariffs and their inappropriate structure, and tolerating soft
14     The other project in the energy sector is the Oil Institution Building Project (US$1.4 million equivalent), whose objectives are to
enhance the local capacity to undertake intemational negotiations in respect to oil pipeline transit; this project is at the negotiation stage.

budget constraints), demonopolization and privatization of energy enterprises, and legal and regulatory
reform were supported under the Structural Adjustment Credit. The reforms in the power sector
progressed rapidly throughout 1996.
1.37          IDA's objectives in the power sector are to support Georgia's effort to arrest the energy
crisis and reverse deterioration of physical assets, improve cost recovery in electricity supply, increase
supply to productive sectors through economic allocation of electricity (i.e., through adopting cost-
reflective tariffs and enforcing payments), and accelerate institutional and structural reforms to promote
and sustain efficient allocation of investments and efficient use of energy. These objectives would
facilitate economic growth and promote the transition of the country to a market economy, supporting
wider objectives of IDA's involvement in Georgia. Achieving the objectives will require opening of the
policy environment, commercialization and demonopolization of electricity supply and use, diversification
of ownership and accelerated privatization, rehabilitation of physical infrastructure, and extension of the
social safety net to cover minimum energy consumption of needy families.
1.38          IDA's on-going dialogue with the Government concerning financial and institutional
problems in the power sector focuses on:
a.     financial rehabilitation of the sector through improved collection, enforcement of payment
discipline, establishing cost-recovery tariffs, and debt restructuring; and
b.     support to the sector reforms, designed to unbundle, demonopolize and commercialize
the power industry, diversify ownership and attract private capital, and create a suitable
regulatory and legal framework.
IDA is providing technical assistance in these areas under the Structural Adjustment Technical Assistance
Credit (SATAC), and is coordinating its work with other international agencies actively involved in the
energy sector in Georgia supporting the reforms, most notably USAID and the European Union. The
proposed project would support the stated objectives, and facilitate the on-going reforms in the power
sector.
1.39          A review of several decades of the World Bank's worldwide lending for the power
industry found a declining trend in the industry's overall technical, institutional, and financial
performance, mainly due to governmental failure to address the industry's fundamental structural
problems ("The World Bank's Role in the Electric Power Sector", a World Bank Policy Paper,
Washington, D.C., 1993). Conflicts between the government's role as policy maker in the sector and
as owner, regulator and operator of utilities have led to poorly defined and conflicting developmental,
commercial and social objectives, opaque comrnand and control management of the sector, inefficient
operation, lack of managerial and financial autonomy and poor financial performance. The review
recommended that Bank lending for electric power should focus on countries with a clear commitment
to improving the performance of the power industry by commercialization, corporatization, and
establishment of a transparent regulatory framework, clearly independent from power suppliers. A World
Bank Policy Paper "Energy Efficiency and Conservation in the Developing World" (Washington, D.C.,
1993) stated that the highest priorities, on the supply side, "...will be to make supply-side institutions
responsive through institutional and regulatory reform and to make investments in efficiency-enhancing
activities, such as plant rehabilitations and reducing transmission and distribution losses". The proposed
project is consistent with these policies.



The Project                                                                              15
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
2.1           The principal objectives of the project are to:
(i)   increase the operational capacity and electricity generation of the power system, reducing
shortages and improving the security, reliability and quality of power supply;
(ii)   stabilize electricity supply by increasing fuel reserves at Tbilsresi;
(iii)   establishment of Tbilsresi as a commercially independent and financially self-sufficient
generation company;
(iv)   improve the local capability and assist in:
(a)    project management;
(b)    corporate management and commercialization;
(c)    privatization of power enterprises.
B. Project Components and Description
2.2           The project consists of the following components:
(i)    Rehabilitation of a 300-MW  unit (unit 10) at the Gardabani thermal power plant,
operated by the Tbilsresi joint-stock company;
(ii)   Increase in working capital at Tbilsresi;
(iii)   Technical assistance to Tbilsresi for:
(a)    Project management;
(b)    Corporate management;
(c)    Development of a privatization strategy for the company.
2.3           Rehabilitation of unit 10 at the Gardabani Thermal Power Plant. Unit No. 10 (300
MW) although installed in 1994, is in a very poor condition, due to improper operation (unclean water,
low output, frequent start-ups and shut-downs, low and unstable system frequency, etc.). In addition,
a fire in January 1995 destroyed the instrumentation and control system of the unit. Inspection revealed
that replacement and repair of major components are necessary to restore the unit to the original design.
The rehabilitation will include: (i) repair of boiler heating surfaces and fuel burning systems; (ii) repair



16                                                                                   The Project
of intermediate and low pressure turbine rotor sections and turbine instrumentation; (iii) rehabilitation
of plant auxiliaries (pumps, motors, motorized valves, actuators, compressed air system, water treatment
system, steam pipes, fire extinguishing system, etc.); (iv) installation of a new instrumentation and
control system;  (v) rehabilitation of the electrical system (generator, excitation, cables, switches,
accumulators, lighting, etc.); (vi) miscellaneous (spare parts, engineering support, etc.).
2.4           Increase in Working Capital. The fuel to be financed by the working capital component
would be procured in two separate packages: the first, in the amount of US$10 million, would
retroactively finance fuel for the winter 1996/97, which has already been procured using Government
credit. The second fuel package would be procured toward the end of 1997, subject to compliance with
financial performance targets agreed during negotiations. The smaller allocation for the second winter
reflects the expected improvement in sector performance in 1997.
2.5           Reliable operation of the Gardabani thermal plant is of critical importance for operation
of the Georgian power system, particularly in winter months, due to:
(i)    increased demand during winter;
(ii)    progressively lower production of hydro plants in the November-March period, because
of lower inflows;
(iii)   low reliability ana frequent outages of other plants due to disrepair and lack of spare
parts;
(iv)   difficulties of importing electricity caused by lack of working capital, disrepair of
interconnection lines and their low reliability (especially of the main interconnection line
with Russia passing the Caucasus), and lower export capabilities in the neighboring
countries due to similar problems in their systems.
2.6           In this situation, an increase in fuel reserves at the Gardabani plant is vital for a stable
electricity supply during winter. Tbilsresi was established without adequate working capital to finance
its fuel inventories. Extending a loan to the plant to increase working capital would facilitate the
following objectives: (i) help Tbilsresi build up fuel reserves and stabilize generation at the Gardabani
plant and electricity supply; (ii) make the necessary adjustment in electricity prices and collections
(Chapter 111) more acceptable to the consumers; (iii) establish Tbilsresi as a commercially independent
and financially self-sufficient generation company; and (iv) support the ongoing power sector reform
through the transition period. Improved supply during winter would increase public tolerance of
increased tariffs and better enforcement of payment through disconnection of non-paying customers,
which are the main elements of the financial recovery of the sector, as well as major components of
sector reforms.
2.7           The working capital funds, financed by the IDA credit, would be used for increasing the
inventory of fuel to maintain a 30-day production reserve for 600-MW capacity at the Gardabani thermal
plant (equivalent to generating about 430 GWh of electricity). To sustain benefits of better availability
stemming from increased fuel reserves, the plant will be expected to keep them as a combination of mazut
inventory and funds earmarked for purchase of natural gas, kept in a special account or as a pre-paid gas



The Project                                                                              17
supply. The 30-day reserve should be maintained throughout the November-February period each year,
with mazut portion of the reserves of not less than 65,000 tons.
2.8           Technical Services. This component includes the following activities:
(a)    Project Management and Implementation: support project management and
implementation, including training of the staff in modern project management
principles and techniques;
(b)    Corporate Management of Tbilsresi: strengthen management capacity using
internationally-experienced consultants and training, with specific emphasis on
corporate structure and staffing, sales contracting, financial management and
investment planning, operations management, and accounting and reporting.
(c)    Development and implementation of a privatization strategy for Tbilsresi,
including defining and building consensus on the optimal privatization
methodology, and advising on implementation of the strategy.
C. Project Context
2.9           The project was selected to address the most pressing problems in the Georgian power
system, and to maximize the impact of IDA's contribution. The project is consistent with IDA's energy
strategy to promote improvements in energy efficiency and adaptation of energy utilities to the
requirements of the market economy. The project fully supports the Government's reform program in
the power sector, whose main objectives, principles and policies are stated in the Letter of Sector
Development Policy (LSDP), which has been discussed during preparation of the project, and was
finalized at negotiations (paras. 6.1(1)).  The reforms have begun in earnest by issuance of the
Presidential Decree on Power Sector Reforms (see Annex 2). The Decree stipulates preparation of an
electricity law, which would establish legal basis for new institutional organization -- including
establishment of an independent regulatory agency -- and commercialization and privatization of the
power industry. The Energy Law was presented to the Parliament on May 6, 1997. The Government
is also seriously pursuing privatization of the sector, and a general privatization decree of the power
industry was issued in December 1996. During credit negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government to prepare a privatization plan for Tbilsresi, acceptable to IDA -- by June 30, 1998, and
begin implementing this strategy by December 31, 1998 (para. 6.1 (g)). The project is also consistent
with the limited Country Assistance Strategy, which identifies the energy sector as a key constraint to
economic development, and recognizes the need for rehabilitation of energy infrastructure and for policy
and institutional strengthening of the sector.
2.10          The Gardabani thermal power plant, as the only major thermal plant in operation in
Georgia, plays a crucial role in meeting electricity demand. Unit 10 will add 1700-1900 GWh annually
(more than 25% of total domestic generation in 1995). The plant is strategically located in eastern
Georgia near the largest load center (Tbilisi), and is a base-load plant, complementing the hydro plants
located mainly in the western part of the country and providing intermediate and peaking capacity. In
the absence of unit 10, units 1-8 -- which are old, very inefficient and costly to maintain -- have to be
used, since unit 9 alone would not be sufficient to meet the demand. Unit 10 is relatively new, can be
restored to its original parameters, and is expected to be much more efficient than the old units.
Economic analysis (Chapter V) shows a high rate of return from the project.



18                                                                               The Project
2.11          The Government increased residential electricity tariffs from 2.0 UScents/kWh to 2.6
UScents/kWh on January 1, 1997. A further increase in residential tariffs planned for June 1997 will
bring electricity tariffs for all consumer categories to the same level of 3.5 UScents/kWh, sufficient to
cover cash operating costs and depreciation. Through a more strict policy of disconnecting non-payers,
the average overall collection rate was increased from about 20% in 1995 to 53% in 1996. Additional
fuel purchases for this winter, to be retroactively financed through the IDA credit, resulted in a tangible
improvement in electricity supply, which made the harsh measures of increasing tariffs and enforcing
payments through disconnections socially and politically acceptable.
2.12          Low collections from households -- 27% average for 1996 -- in large part caused by
limited affordability, are the main reason for still low overall collection rates. Further improvements will
require a significant effort to enforce full payment discipline in the residential sector over the next two
years. Taking into account the lack of alternative energy sources, low household incomes and the
inadequacy of the social safety net, it would not be realistic to expect collection rates higher than 75 %
and 85% in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Without including the working capital component in the
proposed credit, further deterioration in the reliability of supply would be unavoidable in the short run.
This would make it more difficult to implement the planned price and collection increases and other
reform measures, undermining the effort to restore the financial viability of the power industry. The
energy crisis would continue to worsen, forestalling and reversing economic recovery, with serious
political and social consequences.
2.13          The Investment Program. This project is part of a priority investment programn in the
power sector which the Government of Georgia and former Sakenergo identified with assistance from
various multilateral and bilateral organizations (World Bank, KfW, EBRD, USAID, OECF of Japan,
Government of Switzerland, Government of Italy, etc.). The program includes: rehabilitation of: (i) a
300-MW unit (no. 9 and 10) at the Gardabani thermal plant, and the Gardabani water treatment plant;
(ii) six hydropower plants (Khrami II, Vartsikhe, Tkhibuli, Lajanuri, Rioni, Inguri); (iii) system dispatch
and control; (iv) cormmunications; (v) several key transmission substations and distribution networks,
including electricity metering. The components of the investment program which are still to be
implemented, with a total cost estimated at about US$183 million, have been segmented into a number
of separate projects which are, or are planned to be, financed by the various institutions, as described in
Annex 5.
D. Participatory Approach
2.14          The project, as well as the entire investment program, have been widely discussed with
the power industry's management and experts, as well as with Government officials and consumer
groups. Several meetings, conferences and seminars involving main stakeholders (Tbilsresi, Sakenergo,
Government ministries, managers and experts of the facilities included in the project, management of
distribution organizations, members of the Parliament and environmental non-governmental organizations,
representatives of major industries, administrators of local regions, etc.) were held to discuss project
objectives and priorities, as well as general problems in power sector performance and organization.
The proposal for the project originated in the power industry, and was strongly supported by the
Government, ensuring a strong sense of ownership. This participatory approach will continue to be
employed during project implementation as well.



The Project                                                                             19
E. Environmental Aspects
2.15          The Gardabani thermal power plant is limited by the Ministry of Environment to a
maximum size of 2000 MW. The total name-plate capacity of the plant's ten units is 1850 MW;
however, five of the 8 older 150-MW units (units no. 1-8) are out of commission, so that the total
nominal capacity of the plant after unit 10 has been rehabilitated will be 1050 MW -- well within the
limits set by the Ministry of Environment. The plant must also operate within specific emission limits
(as part of its "ecological passport") and is charged a "user fee" of approximately 12,000 lari per year
for its gaseous emissions within the "passport" limits. If the plant were to operate in excess of the
permitted emission limits, it would pay a penalty of up to 5 times this "user fee" for each episode.
2.16          The Project has been assigned a "B" environmental ranking. The Project is anticipated
to have a positive environmental impact by improving efficiency of the Gardabani Unit 10. Power from
this unit would substitute for the inefficient and more polluting older units, two of which (out of the three
remaining) are scheduled for closure or rehabilitation once Unit 10 resumes operation. An environmental
assessment has been prepared and reviewed by the Ministry of Environment (Annex 6). The assessment
found that operation of Unit 10 would not result in violation of ambient air quality standards, provided
that mazut comprised no more than 40% of the fuel mix (natural gas being the other component of the
fuel), and that the sulfur content of the mazut did not exceed 3%.  IDA proposes the following
environmental management measures: (i) mazut should not comprise more than 40% of the fuel mix; (ii)
concentration of sulfur in mazut should not exceed 2%. Acceptance of these measures was reached
during negotiations and recorded in the Minutes of negotiations. The fuel specifications are expected to
result in emission compliant with the following World Bank guidelines, which limit emission of sulphur
dioxide to ambient standards of 100 milligrams per cubic meter (annual average of 24-hrs means), and
to 24-hrs maximum of 500 milligrams per cubic meter. In addition, the following emission standards of
the World Bank guidelines are expected to be met: emission of sulphur dioxide limited to 500 tons per
day for unpolluted areas (background level less than 50 milligrams per cubic meter), and to 100 tons per
day for polluted area with the background level more than 100 milligrams per cubic meter), with linear
interpolation between these limits.
F. Enviromnental Monitoring
2.17          It will be necessary to undertake an ambient air quality monitoring program to ensure the
effectiveness of the management measures taken to mitigate environmental impacts, and to ensure that
unforeseen impacts do not jeopardize expected project benefits. The location of sample sites should be
determined with the assistance of the ambient air quality modeling (points where expected elevated
SOx/NOx concentrationa are near human settlements or environmentally sensitive areas). The Regional
Environmental Monitoring Center should also be consulted in regard to the sample sites and sampling
frequency.
2.18          Tbilsresi does not, at present, have the staff, equipment or training needed to undertake
a long-term monitoring program. Equipment needed to implement the environmental monitoring program
will be procured as part of the project. The monitoring program will be developed with the assistance
of an expatriate consultant, financed under a PHRD grant (draft Terms of Reference in Annex 6). A copy
of the environmental monitoring program, satisfactory to IDA, should be submitted to IDA by August 31,
1997 (para 6.1 (a)).

G. Cost Estimate and Financing
2.19          Project Cost: Total project costs, based on October 1996 prices, and including physical
and price contingencies, are estimated at US$75.8 million equivalent, of which US$71 million equivalent
is the foreign exchange cost. Physical contingencies were estimated at about 12% of base cost. Price
contingencies for foreign costs were estimated using an average price increase of 2.3 % per year. Price
contingencies for local costs were estimated by using the projected local inflation and price changes (10%
in 1997, 7% in 1998, and 6.2% in 1999). Based on information from the Ministry of Finance that
imports of equipment under the proposed project would be exempt from duties and value-added taxes,
these have not been included in the cost estimate. A summary of project cost estimates is presented in
Table 2. 1; more detailed estimates are given in Annex 4.

2.20          Project financing. Financing arrangements are presented in Table 2.2. The proposed IDA
credit of US$52.3 million equivalent would cover about 69% of project costs and would be lent to Georgia
on standard IDA terms. The Government of Georgia would on-lend the Credit proceeds to the project
beneficiary, Tbilsresi, under a subsidiary loan agreement for a period of 20 years. Credit proceeds would
be on-lent at a variable annual interest rate, to be established by the Government by January 15 of each year,
equivalent to the prevailing IBRD variable lending rate for currency pool loans (as there is no functioning
market for long-term credit in Georgia at the present time). Corresponding to the estimated construction
period, a grace period of 3 years would be given to Tbilsresi (from signing of the subsidiary loan agreement)
during which the company would not be required to make principal or interest payments. Tbilsresi would
assume the foreign exchange risk and make payments to the Government in Georgia's national currency at
the prevailing relevant foreign exchange rate. Agreement on the proposed on-lending terms was reached
during negotiations (para. 6.1(1)). The draft subsidiary loan agreement was submitted to IDA before
negotiations; the signing of the subsidiary loan agreement is a condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 6.2
(a)).
2.21          The project would be co-financed by the Government of Germany in the amount of DM30

of effectiveness (para 6.2 (b)). Tbilsresi would fund local costs, which would be mainly associated with
supplying some parts and with work to be carried out by force account or local contractors.

III. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
3.1           This chapter presents the financial condition and projections of Tbilsresi, the main credit
beneficiary, which was separated from the Sakenergogeneration company and registered as an independent
joint-stock corporation on November 29, 1996. Draft opening financial statements were reviewed and
finalized during negotiations and, as discussed below, agreement was reached with Tbilsresi on key
financial performance targets and the company's power sales agreement with Sakenergo.
3.2           Generation and transmission functions, previously integrated within Sakenergo, were
separated in mid-1996, as described in Chapter I (para. 1.30). Because the financial condition of
Tbilsresi will be affected by sector performance, financial data and projections for the power sector have
been compiled by consolidating projections for Sakenergogeneration and Sakenergo (transmission). The
bulk of distribution assets were spun off from Sakenergo in 1995 and are excluded from the financial
statements. Opening statements of June 30, 1996 were used to prepare a financial rehabilitation plan
aimed at restoring the financial health of the power sector over the next 2-3 y ears. A consultant study
on debt restructuring 'or the consoli-ated Sakenergo and Tbilsresi s available in project fiM.t. During
credit negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the key remaining actions of the
financial rehabilitation plan, electricity tariffs for 1997-98, mechanisms for continued improvement in
collections, and regulations on tariff-setting, accounting and audits.
A. Tbilsresi
3.3           As a part of Sakenergo, Tbilsresi's financial results were not reported separately.
Therefore, the company's financial condition and projections are based on opening financial statements
as of June 30, 1996, restated to an accruals basis, and on official closing statements for 1996. Accounts
receivable and payable have been written -off and restructured in accordance with the sector financial
rehabilitation plan (para. 3.20) and are reflected in the closing statements of December 31, 1996 and in
the financial projections. Given the sector's difficult financial condition, and the absence at this stage of
a suitable legal and regulatory framework, initial sales prices have been structured to cover projected cash
operating expenses, including debt-service, depreciation and local costs of the capital investment program.
These costs have been incorporated into a power sales agreement with Sakenergo, expected to be
Tbilsresi's main customer for the next 2-3 years. Compliance with supply and payment terms will be
monitored during project implementation. Revaluation/retirement of fixed assets, and profitability
margins, will be incorporated into the price structure in conjunction with the privatization of Tbilsresi,
a strategy for which is to be prepared by June 1998 (para. 2.9).
3.4            Financial Highlights.  The poor financial condition of Tbilsresi is reflective of the
condition of the sector as a whole. Over the last four years, insufficient revenues to cover even basic
operating and maintenance costs or fuel inventories has taken its toll on the physical and financial
condition of the plant. By 1995, available capacity had declined to only 14% of the installed capacity
of 1800 MW. As only the older, less efficient units were operated in 1995, net plant fuel efficiency
dropped to about 20%, compared with the design of about 27%. Poor collections resulted in Tbilsresi
having to take short-term loans of about 30% of net revenues during 1996 to finance working capital at
interest rates of 40-60%.

24                                                                         Financial Analysis
3.5           Although demand projections are prone to a higher than usual level of uncertainty given
the transitional nature of the economy, the prospects for Tbilsresi are good. The rehabilitation of the
newer units 9 and 10, and limited operation/retirement of older units, is expected to raise the plant's net
fuel efficiency to 32.3% in 1997, reducing direct generation costs from 8.8 tetri/kWh (US cents 7.0) in
1995 to around 3.6 tetri/kWh (US cents 2.5), excluding VAT, thereby making the plant competitive with
imports (expected to be priced in the US cents 4.0-5.0 range). Maintaining these improvements at the
plant level will require adequate (but competitive) tariffs, timely collections, and competent financial and
operations management. Highlights of the financial projections are presented in Table 3.1 and the main
assumptions discussed below. Detailed projections are presented in Annex 7.
3.6          Investment Program  and Business Plan.  A 3-year investment plan to improve
Tbilsresi's operating efficiency and market position has been agreed with the Government and is included
in the company's business plan (para. 4.25) and in the sector investment program (Annex 5).
Rehabilitation of Unit 9 (300 MW) was completed in 1996, with partial financing from KfW; upgrade
of the water treatment and auxiliary supply for Units 9 and 10 is being financed by EBRD and KfW; and
the rehabilitation of Unit 10 is to be financed by IDA (under the proposed project) and KfW. Units 3
and 8 of the older eight units (150 MW each) are to be maintained as reserves. No additional capital
investments are envisaged in the planning period and contract prices agreed with Sakenergo will be set
to allow Toilsresi to self-finance the local part of the proposed investment program (para. 3.13). The
Government has indicated that completion of Unit 11 (300 MW) by 2001-2, if justified, would be
undertaken by the private sector.
3.7           Capital costs. Fixed assets have not been revalued and depreciation allowance is an
average 3% of net asset value based on historical costs. However, not all assets have a market value,
either because of their age and condition, or because of lack of demand. An indicative revaluation of
useful assets is to be completed by June 1998 within the scope of technical services included for
management consulting. Assets are to be revalued in conjunction with Tbilsresi's privatization, for which
a strategy is to be prepared by June 1998 (para. 2.9). Depreciation based on revalued assets, and
profitability provisions are to be incorporated into the price structure by December 1998 (para. 3.13).
3.8           Operating costs. As indicated above, fuel efficiency is projected to improve from 20%
in 1995 to 33.7% when Unit 10 is recommissioned in 1999. It is assumed that gas will remain the fuel
of choice and that mazut will be used only in emergencies or if gas prices become uncompetitive.
Operating cost assumptions for 1997-2001 are summarized below:
(i)    Gas price: Plant gate prices of $70/thousand cubic meters (mcm), in current prices, have
been assumed. This is based on World Bank projections that European border prices will
remain at $92/mcm (in current US$), transportation costs will be about $30/mcm lower
than supply to Europe, and Georgian transport and handling costs will be $7-8/mcm;
(ii)    Labor costs: Based on trends already prevalent in the region, average wages are
projected to increase significantly in real terms. A 60% increase has been estimated
between 1996 and 1997, and about 20-25% annually between 1997 and 2001, equivalent
to a nominal increase in wages from Lari 55/month in 1996 to Lari 300/month in 2001.
Staffing levels are projected to decline by 10% per year over the next 3 years. More
reductions are possible as generation capacity is retired and the maintenance needs are
reduced for the rehabilitated units. Normal attrition has already reduced staffing from



Financial Analysis                                                                      25
1,000 to 860 over the last 3 years (260 in operations, 500 in maintenance, and 100 in
administrative positions). Labor costs are estimated to account for about 3% of total
costs. Staffing levels and the company's organizational structure will be more precisely
addressed under the management services included in the project; and
(iii)   Annual maintenance costs have been included only for the capacity for which demand
is projected. Unit 9 is not expected to require any major maintenance expense until 1998
and Unit 10 until 2000-1. Maintenance cost estimates provided by Tbilsresi are sufficient
for 1997-99 requirements, but are low (about half) for subsequent years compared with
international industry standards.  These estimates would be reviewed under the
management services included in the proposed project.
3.9          Interest and Debt-service coverage. Interest charges during construction have been
waived on state loans funded by EBRD, KfW, IDA and OECF and a grace period of 3 years has been
agreed for repayment of principal. Debt-service coverage is not expected to be a problem under the
projected scenario. However, during negotiations, it was agreed with Tbilsresi to maintain a debt-service
ratio coverage of at least 1.5 during the term of the IDA credit (para. 6.1 (b)).
3.10         Working Capital and Collections. With the provision of US$15 million of long-term
credit (under the proposed project) to finance about 60 days of fuel requirements, the need for expensive
short-term borrowing from the budget and commercial sources to finance working capital, is expected
to be virtually eliminated in 1997. US$10 million of the IDA credit will be used to retroactively finance
fuel supplied for the 1996-97 winter and US$5 million to partially cover any short-fall in working capital
for the 1997-98 winter (arising from payments from Sakenergo below 100% during 1997). If full
payments during 1997 reduce or eliminate the need for additional financing for fuel, the balance from
the US$5 million could be applied towards other plant investment needs.
3. 11         Given that Tbilsresi is the main generating plant in Georgia dependent on fuel imports,
and that the plant will have limited control over its revenues for the next few years, agreement was
reached with the Borrower and Tbilsresi during negotiations to:
(i)   take all actions necessary for Tbilsresi to be fully paid by Sakenergo for electricity
supplied at the rates established under the Power Purchase Agreement (para. 3.14)
between Sakenergo and Tbilsresi (para. 6. 1 (m));
(ii)   to treat as a grant at the end of each calendar year, in 1997 and 1998, that portion of
the sub-loan for financing working capital which the company is not paid for by
Sakenergo during the year (para. 6.1 (n)).
3.12         Accounts Receivable and Payable. As part of de-consolidation of sector enterprises and
financial restructuring, receivables and payables apportioned to Tbilsresi as of December 31, 1996,
consisting mainly of arrears from units of the former Sakenergo and dues for gas supply, were Lari 35.5
million and Lari 28.3 million respectively. This stock of receivables and payables is to be fully retired
by 1999 (para. 3.20 (v)). During negotiations, agreement was reached with Tbilsresi and the Borrower
to ensure that new accounts receivable and payable (from January 1, 1997) not exceed 90 days of sales
and expenses respectively by December 31, 1997 and 60 days by December 31, 1998 and 1999, and that



26                                                                         Financial Analysis
the company maintain a current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) of at least 1.3 during the term
of the credit (para. 6.1 (c)).
3.13          Tbilsresi Tariffs and Power Sales Agreement. Average sales prices for Tbilsresi,
estimated based on production and cost assumptions discussed above, are presented in Table 3.1. The
projected prices cover plant operating costs, depreciation (based on historical asset values), interest and
the local costs of on-going capital investments, but are sensitive to actual payments received from
Sakenergo, Tbilsresi's only customer. Inclusion of a bad-debt provision of 25 % of revenues incurred in
1997 would result in an increase of about 0.75 tetri/kWh in 1998. Projected prices are to be supported
by a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Sakenergo, Tbilsresi's main customer, which would include:
(i)    annual capacity and energy to be contracted, and proportion from old and new units;
(ii)   capacity charge and projected fixed costs covered by this charge (depreciation,
maintenance, interest, provisions for bad debts for the previous year, and wages);
(iii)   energy charge covering fuel costs (including fuel consumption per kWh) and other
variable costs, and provisions for adjustment;
(iv)   metering, reporting and auditing requirements;
(v)   invoicing requirements, supply and payment terms, and penalties and remedies for non-
compliance with the contract.
3.14          The key PPA elements defined above (para. 3.13) have been incorporated into the PPA
for 1997, signed by Sakenergo and Tbilsresi and approved by the Government's Regulatory Authority.
The PPA was submitted to IDA on March 15, 1997. During negotiations, agreement was also reached
for Tbilsresi to submit to IDA, not later than October 1, 1997, 1998 and 1999, for IDA's review and
approval, the PPA for the next calendar year approved by the Borrower's regulatory authority along with
supporting financial projections for the current and following fiscal years (balance sheet, income
statement and cash-flow statement (para. 6.1 (o)). Furthermore, the sales prices which will become
effective on January 1, 1998 and 1999 respectively, should be sufficient to at least cover reasonable
operating costs, depreciation, interest payments, and bad debts (defined as accounts receivable in excess
of 90 days), and allow the company to satisfy its debt service and current ratio covenants (para 6.1. (p)).
Signing of the PPA for 1998, agreed with IDA and approved by the sector Regulatory Authority, will be
a condition of disbursement for the remaining US$5 million for working capital (para. 6.3 (a)).
3.15          Corporate Management. As a newly-independent enterprise, Tbilsresi's management
needs to be strengthened through additional recruitment and technical services. The business plan
prepared for Tbilsresi identified the need to add and strengthen specific functions of financial
management, procurement and operations planning. Modern accounting systems also need to be added
to manage power sales contracts and to provide timely and useful information for management decisions.
Contracting of key experts is already underway (with donor financing) and a three-person "Cost
Efficiency Team" is expected to be in place by mid-1997. Provisions for additional technical services
are included in project costs; terms of reference will be agreed upon by June 1997 and necessary
consulting services contracted in coordination with other donor support.
3.16          Accounting and Reporting. Tbilsresi's financial statements presented in this report are
based on opening financial statements as of June 30, 1996 and closing statements for 1996, restated to
an accruals basis. Official statements are reported on a cash basis but a phased adoption of International
Accounting Standards (IAS) is expected to begin in 1997 in accordance with sector-wide rules and

scheduled to be defined by September 30, 1997 (para. 3.20 (vi)). Of particular issue are the rules for
treating rehabilitation expenses; present legislation requires these expenses to be treated as "maintenance"
costs and be expensed in the calendar year. Capitalization of rehabilitation costs needs to be supported
by legislation and is to be addressed during the preparation of sector accounting rules. In order to
monitor compliance with financial covenants under the proposed project, Tbilsresi will be required to
submit its audited financial statements to IDA by June 30 of each year (para. 4.20). Technical services
to assist with this restatement will be provided by the corporate management consultants hired under the
project.
B. Power Sector Financial Issues
3.17          The financial condition of the sector, as reflected by the consolidated statements of
Sakenergogeneration and Sakenergo, has deteriorated over the last few years owing to the following
interrelated causes:
(i)    electricity supplied and accounted for ("billings") has declined as a share of the power
supplied to final consumers (from around 90% in 1991 to 70% in 1995-6);
(ii)    collections, as a share of "billings", dropped to less than 20-25 % during 1993-95, largely
due to the reduced ability of consumers to pay, and have left the sector with a sizable
accumulation of arrears. For political reasons, electricity supplies to Abkhazia and South
Ossetia, constituting about 10-12% of total supply, cannot be discontinued for non-
payment. Non-payments are also high from large quasi-budgetary enterprises such as
water and sewerage companies, transportation, etc.;
(iii)   technical losses have increased due to under-maintenance of supply facilities, decline in
demand, and a higher share of household consumption. Reported technical losses for
1996 in transmission and distribution were about 20-22%;
(iv)   tariffs are set to nominally cover operating costs, but do not include adequate provisions
for high losses and arrears, which are often outside supplier control, or the higher costs
of deferred maintenance and capital replacement.
(v)    absence and/or inaccuracy of metering between sector enterprises and final consumers.
This is of particular importance given the separation of generation, transmission, and
distribution, and raises uncertainty over the quality of available data;
(vi)   insufficient incentives for enterprises to reduce supply costs and commercial losses, or
to improve accounting systems and general financial management.
3.18          Present Status and Actions Taken. The prospects for the sector improved in 1996.
State and sector authorities have acknowledged the importance of rehabilitating the financial condition
of sector enterprises in parallel with rehabilitation of physical assets. A special Commission, headed by
the First Deputy Minister of Finance, was created in September 1996 to develop measures to improve
payment discipline and to prepare a comprehensive financial rehabilitation plan for the power sector
aimed at restoring the sector's financial viability by 1999 (para 3.20).   The unbundling of sector



28                                                                         Financial Analysis
enterprises has increased transparency and accountability, and is contributing to financial discipline. A
Presidential Decree (No. 363 of May 30, 1996) strengthens the legal basis for enforcing payment
discipline; financial recovery will be further aided through strengthening of the legal and regulatory
framework under the Electricity Law which was presented to Parliament on May 6, 1997. The
Government has already taken the following actions which have contributed to improving the sector's
financial prospects:
(i)    Collections, which are reported to IDA on a monthly basis, have increased from 35 % of
supply in January 1996 to 66% in December, with an average of 53% for the year,
excluding supply to Abkhazia and Ossetia. Collections were sustained at about 61 % in
January 1997, which is considered a lean month and typically has a 10-15% drop in
collections. Improvements have resulted largely from better organization and
accountability within sector enterprises, stricter application of disconnection policies, and
growing consumer awareness of the commercial nature of electricity supply;
(ii)   until targeting of vulnerable groups is improved"5, beginning from January 1997, the state
budget will make direct payments to Sakenergo of about Lari 3 million/month (or about
17% of projected 1997 revenue) to compensate for certain categories eligible for
subsidies under Georgian law. Compensations include: (i) 60 kWh/month of household
consumption in Abkhazia (Lari 300,000/month); (ii) consumption of 40 kWh/month by
934,000 pensioners (Lari 1.2 million/month); (iii) consumption of 40 kWh and 60 kWh
per month by migrant and settled refugees respectively (Lari 460,000/month); (iv)
consumption of 60 kWh/month by 360,000 employees of budgetary organizations (Lari
720,000/month); and (v) consumption by budgetary organizations (Lari 300,000 to
500,000/month).
(iii)   Presidential Order (No. 829 of December 19, 1996) raised residential tariffs from 2.5
tetri/kWh to 3.3 tetri/kWh on January 1, 1997, raising the average retail tariff to about
3.9 tetri/kWh and the wholesale tariff to about 3.0 tetri/kWh.
(iv)   Presidential Order (No. 826 of January 1997) defined the actions taken to regulate
financial relations between the power sector and the rest of the economy and to
restructure sector debts. Sakenergo's receivables and payables as of June 30, 1996 were
reduced by about 50% (from Lari 285.0 million and Lari 285.9 million respectively to
Lari 138.9 million and Lari 142.3 million) through conversion into sovereign debt to
Turkmenistan and Iran (Lari 96 million) and transfer of past receivables from Abkhazia
and South Ossetia (Lari 47.6 million) to Energia-Plus, a limited liability company which
has also assumed the liability of repaying Russia for past supplies to Abkhazia. Future
supplies from Russia to Abkhazia, which in the past were billed to Sakenergo, will now
be billed to Energia-Plus. Settlement of these accounts is expected to be part of the
political settlement of the Abkhazian dispute. In addition short-term credits to Sakenergo
from the Ministry of Finance (Lari 15.4 million) and the National Bank (lari 4.2 million)
made in mid-1996 have been rescheduled for repayment over the next 2 years. Actions
15    The Government ordered the relevant authorities to complete the identification of the poorest households by March
1997 with the purpose of preparing a program to better target subsidies.

already taken and those proposed are reflected in Table 3.3 showing the dynamics of debt
reduction.
(v)    Of Sakenergo's remaining receivables and payables as of June 30, 1996, Lari 112 million
of receivables (81 %) and Lari 105 million of payables (74 %) have been rescheduled and
are supported by signed agreements (113 in number) and are to be retired over 2 years,
beginning in the 2nd quarter of 1997.
3.19          Financial highlights of the power sector, as represented by Sakenergo's consolidated
financial statements (generation and transmission) are summarized in Table 3.2 and detailed in Annex 7.
For 1996, the main conclusion is that, on an accruals basis, the sector has a positive operating income
but is loss-making because of accumulated bad debts.

3.20           Financial Rehabilitation Plan. Risks remain high that the improved payment discipline
of the last few months will not be sustained and collection targets will not be met. These risks are
contributed to by budgetary constraints, the condition of the economy, the need for a political settlement
of the conflict over Abkhazia (which is both a source of 30-40% of Georgia's power supply and a
consumer of about 12% of production), and difficulties in enforcing collections from residential
consumers (accounting for 50-55 % of national consumption) without sizeable investments in distribution
and metering, and a better targeted social safety program. The actions already taken by the Government,
agreed under the proposed project and to be included under the second Structural Adjustment Credit
currently under preparation, are designed to mitigate against these risks.  Furthermore, during
negotiations agreement was reached with the Borrower on a Financial Rehabilitation Plan (FRP) for
Sakenergo, including specific financial covenants, to be monitored through quarterly reports submitted
by the Borrower to IDA (para 6.1 (h)). The FRP objectives are to: (i) improve collections; (ii) revise
tariffs to full-cost recovery levels with incentives to reduce supply costs; and (iii) retire the receivable
and payable arrears that had accumulated on Sakenergo's and Tbilsresi's balance sheets (as reflected in
the consolidated statements of December 31, 1996). Key elements of the Financial Rehabilitation Plan,
to be implemented over the next 2 years, include:
(i)    Payments from state enterprises serving national interests (estimated to account for
5-6 % of national electricity consumption). To improve payments by these enterprise, by
June 30, 1997, the Government will issue a decree which: (a) lists the state enterprises
deemed to be of national importance and which cannot be disconnected in the event of
non-payment for electricity supplies; (b) defines the actions to be taken by the suppliers
to secure payment from these enterprises; and (c) defines the remedies available to the
suppliers to secure timely payment in the event of non-payment by the enterprise.
(ii)    Collection targets. It was agreed at negotiations that, through the above mechanisms and
on-going reorganization of sector enterprises, all actions would be taken to ensure that
Sakenergo's average collections for the year (excluding from Abkhazia) are raised to at
least 70% of supply by December 31, 1997, 85% by December 31, 1998 and 90% by
December 31, 1999 (para. 6.1 (i));
(iii)    Supplies to Abkhazia and South Ossetia will be billed to Energia-Plus (para. 3.18 (iv))
and non-payments for this supply, together with historical arrears, will be settled as part
of the overall political settlement over these two regions.
(iv)    Electricity Tariffs: By end-1997, electricity tariffs are to be set by an independent
regulator based on the government's tariff policy, accounts submitted by sector
enterprises, and other auditing and licensing procedures. The adoption of an Electricity
Law and the creation of a suitable regulatory framework, and technical services to be
provided under the proposed project, will better define the methodology and rules for
tariff-setting'6. In parallel with refinement of the tariff methodology, it was agreed
during negotiations to:
16     Average wholesale tariffs are estimated at 3.3 tetri/kWh (cost-recovery tariff, including an average generation cost
of 2.1 tetri/KWh, VAT, technical losses of about 12% and provisions for bad-debts equivalent to 25% of gross revenues); it
does not take into account the revaluation of assets. Average generation cost is based on the 1996 supply mix (hydro - 78%,
thermal - 19%, and imports - 3%).



Financial Analysis                                                                       31
a.    increase average residential tariffs to 4.5 tetri/kWh by June 30, 1997 (para 6.1
(j)fi)) at which time the average wholesale tariff will be 3.5 tetri/kWh and will
fully cover operating and maintenance costs, depreciation based on historical
asset values, interest on borrowed capital, and partial provisioning for bad debts;
b.     by September 30, 1997, the Government (and the regulatory authority) would
issue a decree defining the rules for setting regulated electricity prices, and the
schedule to achieve full recovery of reasonable costs and eliminate any remaining
cross-subsidies between different categories of consumers by December 31, 1998.
The decree would include rules for asset revaluation, depreciation, profit levels,
allowances for technical losses and writing off of bad debts;
c.    by December 31, 1998 set regulated tariffs to at least cover all operating and
maintenance costs, interest on borrowed capital, full provisioning for bad debts,
and depreciation based on revalued assets (para 6.1 ( ) (ii));
d.    to the extent that other measures have not been effective in securing payments
from Abkhazia, South Ossetia and state enterprises of national interests,
Sakenergo's average wholesale tariffs effective on January 1, 1998 and 1999 will
be set to recover unpaid electricity bills (defined as accounts overdue by more
than 90 days) for the previous year from these entities (para. 6.1 j ( iii))).
(v)    Retirement of arrears. Supported by debt rescheduling agreements already signed and to be
negotiated over the next few months, it was agreed at negotiations that Sakenergo's remaining
accounts receivable and payable, equivalent to Lari 138.9 million and Lari 142.3 million
respectively, and Tbilsresi's remaining accounts receivable and payable, equivalent to Lari 35.5
million and Lari 28.3 million (as of December 31, 1996) will be retired (through collections and
repayment) according to the following schedule: at least 35% of historical receivables and
payables by December 31, 1997, 50% by December 31, 1998 and the remainder by December
31, 1999.
(vi)   Accounting and Taxation. In order to harmonize the power sector's accounting rules with
International Accounting Standards (IAS), and to coordinate accounting reforms in the rest of the
economy, by September 30, 1997, the Government will issue regulations governing accounting,
reporting and auditing requirements of the power sector, and the schedule to fully adopt these
regulations. Specifically, the regulations will define rules for asset revaluation and depreciation
allowance, provisioning for bad debts, tax rates and treatment of value-added and other taxes
(including on bad debts), and interest payments on short and long-term debt.

Project Implementation                                                                  33
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Institutional Arrangements
4.1          Implementation of the project will be the responsibility of Tbilsresi (the credit
beneficiary). Tbilsresi will maintain a Project Management Unit (PMU), which could be a separate
consulting company. It was agreed at negotiations to maintain the PMU headed by an individual whose
qualifications and experience are satisfactory to IDA and ensure that the PMU is staffed with sufficient
personnel with adequate qualifications (para 6.1(d)). The responsibilities of the PMU will include
engineering, commercial and contractual aspects of the project (engineering design, procurement, contract
administration, scheduling and coordination of project activities, supervision, acceptance, dispute
resolution, financial management, disbursement, reporting). In case the PMU is contracted out to a
consulting company, Tbilsresi will retain direct responsibilities for the key decisions: major procurement
decisions, contract signing, acceptance of the works and equipment, clearance of disbursement requests.
The PMU will be staffed with sufficient personnel, including a deputy project manager, a procurement
coordinator, specialists for various equipment categories (boiler, turbine, electrical equipment, auxiliaries,
instrumentation and control), a financial officer, interpreters/translators and secretaries. Tbilsresi may
depute some of its staff to the PMU. Main specialists and other key staff (procurement coordinator,
financial officer) with qualifications satisfactory to IDA, were appointed in April 1997.
4.2           Neither the project beneficiary nor local staff of the PMU have experience with
implementing IDA-financed projects. To supplement expertise presently not available (particularly in
project management, procurement, preparation of technical specifications and bidding documents, bid
evaluation, contracting, processing withdrawal applications, and project accounting and reporting), the
PMU will be assisted by qualified international and local consultants. Financing of these services is
included in the project budget. A qualified international consultant, assisted by a local specialist, has
been hired to prepare the bidding documents and assist Tbilsresi in conducting the procurement process.
IDA will also arrange for procurement and disbursement seminars to be held in Georgia to train the staff
of Tbilsresi, the PMU, and staff of Governmental organizations.
B. Implementation Schedule
4.3           The project would be implemented over FY1997-2000. The Project completion date is
December 31, 1999, and the project closing date is June 30, 2000. A detailed implementation schedule,
showing activity by project component is in Annex 9. Consulting services started in October 1996 with
preparation of bid documents, under financing from KfW. Bid documents were published in January
1997, and the bidding process is expected to be closed before effectiveness of the IDA credit.
C. Procurement
4.4           Procurement Arrangements. Major project elements, their estimated costs and proposed
procurement methods are given in Table 4.1, and the list of procurement packages is in Annex 10.
Procurement financed by IDA Credit would be carried out in accordance with Guidelines for Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995, revised January and August 1996, and using World



34                                                                          Project Implementation
Bank Standard Bidding Documents. Procurement financed by KfW and executed as parallel financing,
will follow KfW's procurement rules.
4.5            Equipment.  All equipment financed by the IDA  Credit (US$36.5 million) for
rehabilitation of the Gardabani unit #10 -- except equipment for environmental monitoring -- would be
tendered through ICB as one single-responsibility supply and install contract. Environmental monitoring
equipment would be bought through international shopping. Instrumentation and control equipment will
be financed by KfW, and supplied and installed by Siemens"7. The Client, with assistance of an
expatriate consultant, will be responsible for coordinating the work of the IDA-financed contractor with
Siemens. Tbilsresi, the beneficiary, will provide some material, and also make available their personnel
to the contractor for use in some of the work (demolition, site preparation, some erection, etc.)
4.6            Commodities.  Natural gas purchase financed by the IDA Credit (US$15.0 million)
would be procured through direct contracting for imports of natural gas from Turkmenistan. This
procurement method is justified by the following reasons:
(i)    Georgia receives natural gas through a pipeline which comes from  Russia over the
Caucasus, which is the only route in operation; and
(ii)    Traditional supplier of natural gas to Georgia (and to all Caucasus countries -- Georgia,
Armenia, Azerbaijan), has been Turkmenistan, rather than Russia, owing to the fact that
location of the gas fields in the region relative to the consumption centers, and
configuration of the existing pipelines, makes Turkmenistan the lowest-cost supplier.
4.7            Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing.  Out of the proposed credit, the
Borrower has proposed to use up to SDR 7.1 million (about US$10 million equivalent, 19.1 % of the
proposed credit) for advance procurement and retroactive financing of fuel (natural gas). Such advance
procurement is considered necessary by the Borrower to finance increase in fuel reserves and stabilize
power supply during the winter of 1996/97.
4.8            Consultant Services. Consultants for project implementation and management will be
financed under the IDA Credit and KfW loan. The consultants financed by the IDA Credit would be
selected in accordance with the Guidelines for the use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by
the World Bank as an Executing Agency, August 1981, through short-listing of firms.
4.9         Tbilsresi (the project implementation agency) has a very limited knowledge of international
commercial practices and IDA's procurement procedures (para. 4.2). The PMU, with support from
qualified international consultants, will handle the procurement activities under the project.  The
procurement team will receive training during the early stages of project implementation, both from IDA
and from the international consultant. A project launch workshop, to be held in June 1997, will provide
procurement training for Tbilsresi, the PMU, and MOFE staff.
17     In 1996 Siemens installed instrumentation and control equipment for unit #9, which is identical to unit #10 and with
which it shares the control room. To maintain compatibility of the equipment and minimize operating and maintenance costs,
Siemens will install the same equipment on unit #10. Contract for unit #9 was awarded to Siemens in 1995 under a competitive
tendering limited to German suppliers, since the project was financed by the Government of Germany through KfW.

4.10        Notification: A General Procurement Notice (GPN) was published in Development Business
in November 1996. A Specific Procurement Notice was published in Development Business on
December 31, 1996, for the large supply and install contract for rehabilitation of unit No. 10 at the
Gardabani thermal plant.

4.11        Prior Review: Prior review will apply to all ICB contracts (US$300,000 and above), and
to all IDA-financed contracts awarded by direct contracting. This will result in 100% percent of the total
value of IDA-financed goods being subject to prior review. The terms of reference for all consulting
assignments financed by IDA would be subject to IDA's prior review. Any consulting contract in excess
of US$ 100,000 for firms and US$ 50,000 for individuals would also be subject to IDA's prior review
procedures. Terms of Reference are to be reviewed for all contracts.
4.12 Procurement information will be collected by the PMU and reported to IDA as follows:

(i)  prompt reporting of bidding, bid evaluation results in the standard form and contract award
information; and
(ii)  quarterly reports indicating: (i) progress and problems in project implementation; (ii)
revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best estimates
for physical and price contingencies; and (iii) revised schedules of procurement actions,
including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual contracts.
D. Disbursement
4.13 The proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed over three years (1997-1999), against the categories
shown on the following table:

TOTAL                        52.3
4.14          A detailed disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 11.  Based upon credit
effectiveness by May 1997, the project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1999. The closing
date for the proposed project would be June 30, 2000.
4.15          The expenditures for contracts for goods valued at US$ 300,000 or less, contracts for
consulting firms valued at US$ 100,000 or less and contracts for individual consulting services valued
at US$ 50,000 or less may be financed on the basis of statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures. The
supporting documentation for these contracts would not be sent to IDA, but would be retained by the
borrower for inspection by supervision missions and by external auditors. All other disbursements would
be fully documented. The minimum size of applications for direct withdrawals from the Credit Account
and for issuance of Special Commitments will be 20% of the current amount of the authorized allocation.
4.16          Retroactive Financing. As stated in para. 4.7, the Borrower has proposed to use up to
SDR 7.1 million ( about US$10 million equivalent, 19.1 % of the credit) for advance procurement and
retroactive financing of fuel. All retroactive financing is expected to be within the maximum period of



Project Implementation                                                               37
12 months prior to the expected date of Credit Agreement signing. The exception to the limit of 10%
for retroactive financing was approved by IDA.
4.17         Special Account: To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a
Special Account in a major foreign commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA to cover
IDA's share of expenditures. The Authorized Allocation would be US$1,000,000. During the early
stage of the project, the initial allocation to the Special Account would be limited to US$500,000.
However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached the level of SDR8.7 million
(about US$12 million), the initial allocation may be increased up to the Authorized Allocation of
US$1,000,000 by submitting the relevant Application for withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of
the Special Account would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn,
whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard IDA
procedure as described in Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the Special
Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests.
E. Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation
4.18         A project launch mission would take place in June 1997. The PMU would prepare
quarterly progress reports showing the physical progress of the project, procurement status, costs incurred
and anticipated, disbursements made, administrative aspects and institutional performance. The quarterly
reports should be submitted to the IDA one month after the end of each quarter. A "mid-term" review
is scheduled for May 1998 for which the beneficiary would prepare a report which, in addition to the
information provided by quarterly reports, would contain monitorable performance indicators (Annex 12)
and an assessment of how the project meets the overall project objectives and benefits. The mid-term
report should be submitted to the IDA by end of April, 1998.
4.19        In order to monitor the financial performance of Tbilsresi under the project, an audit of
its financial statements by auditors acceptable to IDA would be required. The audit reports would also
contain separate opinions on compliance with all financial covenants under the IDA Credit.
4.20         The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all other project-related
accounts also will be maintained in accordance with IAS. The PMU will be responsible for maintaining
the necessary records concerning the project accounts, while Tbilsresi accounting department will be
responsible for maintaining its accounts. In accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines, audits will be carried
out simultaneously for statements of expenditure (SOEs) against which disbursements have been made
or are due to be made out of the credit proceeds, and specific reference to the Special Account and SOEs
will be made in the audit reports accompanying the financial statements. During negotiations, agreement
was reached that each year Tbilsresi will submit to IDA the auditors' reportfor Tbilsresi and its audited
financial statements, the audited financial statements restated in accordance with US, and the audit
report for the Special Account, project account, and SOEs for each fiscal year, not later than six months
after the close of such year (para. 6.1 (q)).
4.21         During negotiations, an agreement was reached with the Borrower to provide monthly
electricity balance data, and billing, collections and payment arrears data both at the wholesale and retail
sale levels (para. 6.1 tk)). Upon establishment of the Electricity Regulating Commission, the later would
be expected to review these statements before submission to IDA.

4.22          An implementation completion report (ICR), prepared by the PMU, will be submitted to
IDA promptly after the completion of the project but not later than 6 months of Credit closing date. The
ICR will discuss execution of the project, its costs and benefits, the performance of the borrower, the
performance of IDA and other cofinanciers and lessons learned.
4.23          In addition to the review  of procurement actions, quarterly reports and other
documentation, three supervision missions are planned annually. The project is expected to require the
total supervision effort of about 111 staff-weeks spread over four fiscal years. Annex 13 summarizes
the proposed supervision plan.
4.24          Project Monitoring Indicators and Mid-Term Review. Project monitoring indicators
include those related to: (i) the financial rehabilitation of the power sector, (ii) physical implementation
of the project's components, and (iii) increased operating efficiency and reduction of losses. A list of
indicators is presented in Annex 12. Agreement on the project monitoring indicators was reached at
negotiations (para. 6.1 (e)). It was also agreed that the Borrower and Tbilsresi will prepare quarterly
progress reports, which would include selected indicators and a mid-term project implementation report
by April 1998, and an implementation completion report by June 30, 2000 (para 6.1(r)). Time-based
actions presented in the implementation schedule will also be monitored.
F. Operation
4.25          Following project completion, the life of the unit 10 at the Gardabani thermal plant should
be extended for 15-20 years. Technical measures have been taken in the design of rehabilitation program
to prevent operation of the unit (and the entire plant) under sub-standard conditions. To ensure proper
operation, contractors involved in rehabilitation of unit 10 will be required to train personnel at the plant
in operation and maintenance. Training of the staff in plant operation was also provided as part of
rehabilitation of unit 9 in 1996. A new water treatment facility, financed by EBRD, is scheduled for
completion by the end of 1997. Technical assistance for business management of Tbilsresi company, to
assist the company's management in improving operation of the plant and management of the company,
is provided under the project. Tbilsresi's strategy to improve its technical and financial operations was
included in its draft Business Plan submitted to IDA before negotiations. Specifically, the business plan
covers: (i) the company's opening financial statements and projections for the next 5 years; (ii) a detailed
investment plan for 1997-99 and an indicative investment plan for the rest of the planning period; and
(iii) a strategy to strengthen company management, reporting and auditing which is to be supported by
the proposed project and will continue the efforts started under the EBRD-financed power rehabilitation
project. During negotiations, agreement was reached to submit to IDA the Business Plan for Tbilsresi
by June 30, 1997 and to consult IDA prior to making any revisions to the plan or undertaking any actions
not included in the plan (para. 6.1 (s)). Tbilsresi will take all necessary measures, in particular, to
operate the plant according to the technical standards of operation.



Project Benefits and Risks                                                                       39
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Project Benefits
5.1            The main benefits of the project are the restoration of the Gardabani unit #10 and the
consequent improvements in the capacity, efficiency and availability of the plant, resulting in increased
electricity generation and more reliable power supply, improved supply quality and security, and reduced
electricity imports. The injection of working capital and better fuel supply and increased fuel reserves would
also result in reduced electricity shortages, less rationing and a more stable supply allowing more discipline
in rationing of electricity to the extent that it would have to be applied. Technical assistance under the
project would improve capability of the industry to manage internationally financed projects, improve
corporate management at the Gardabani power company, and help in its privatization.
B. Project Financial Analysis
5.2            We did a discounted cash flow analysis on Gardabani and on the proposed financing of
generating fuels from the point of view of Tbilsresi, the key project beneficiary. The cost flows of the
Gardabani project include the: (a) investment costs with contingencies (see Chapter II of this report), (b)
incremental operating and maintenance costs estimated in the feasibility study, and (c) taxes. We compared
these cash flows on the benefit side with the sales revenue Tbilsresi expects to receive -the net electricity
delivered to Sakenergo times the bulk tariff net of the 20% VAT. Gardabani generates a financial internal
rate of return (FRR) of 10.1% and a financial net present value (FNPV) of US$ 267 thousand at a 10%
discount rate (12.5% on nominal terms), with a payback time of about 20 years. The rehabilitation of
Gardabani is therefore justified based on a cost recovery basis and a 10 percent real interest rate.
5.3            A  sensitivity analysis
was undertaken to evaluate the impact      100%  ------- -------------- ----------------

affecting the cash flows.  Figure 5.1       80%   ----                -   ----------------

5.4           Fuel purchases amount to US$15.85 million required to cover the generating fuel gap
envisioned for the 1996/97 and the 1997/98 winter seasons. The expected financial benefits of this
component include the sales revenue made possible at the expected bulk supply tariffs. The analysis shows
that sales revenue cover the fuel expenditures by a margin of 10 percent. The financial NPV of this
component amounts to US$1.3 million with an equivalent FRR of 16.1%. Detailed assumptions of the
financial analysis of both project components are presented in Annex 8.
C. Project Economic Evaluation
5.5           From the point of view of Georgia, the project is very attractive, with an economic rate of
return (ERR) of 30.8 percent (significantly higher than the 10.1 percent financial rate of return) for
Gardabani and 35.3 percent for fuel purchases. The distributional coefficient of the overall project (net
benefits to poor households as a proportion of the project net benefits) is positive, reaching 15 percent. The
fiscal coefficient (net fiscal revenue to the government as a proportion of net benefits) is about 53 percent.
The results are summarized below, and details shown in Annex 8.
Rehabilitation of Gardabani
5.6    The "without project" situation corresponds to the continued operation of the plant in its current
condition (i.e., without the 300-MW unit no. 10) and with the energy that the unit would supply provided
by imports until 2001 -the marginal source of electricity supply. The "with project" scenario corresponds
to the rehabilitation of the unit, restoring its parameters to their design values.
5.7           The costs and benefits of the project -measured as the increment over the "without project"
scenario- were discounted to the start of 1996. Costs include investment and incremental operational and
maintenance costs. There are two economic benefits, first the value of the incremental energy production
due to the project, and second the increase in consumer surplus -i.e., the avoided reduction in net user
benefits associated to a higher tariff "without the project."
5.8           "Without the project" the only feasible alternative would be to: (i) import electricity until
2001; and (ii) produce electricity from another domestic source of supply from 2002 onwards. Thus, the first
benefits are the savings from not having to use these alternative sources of supply as result of the project.
The second benefits arise from the fact that under a policy of cost recovery, electricity tariffs would be raised
to cover costs by 13.5 percent. Given a price elasticity of demand of -0.1, demand would decline by 1.2
percent "without the project." We have thus estimated the associated change in consumer surplus as a benefit
to the project.
5.9           The economic indicators of the project are very attractive, with an economic NPV of US$
47.9 million, and an ERR of 30.8 percent. The economic savings resulting from the project are the most
important benefits, and the production costs, the most significant expenditures.
5.10          The project appears robust against the risks and uncertainties that may impair its economic
performance. Figure 5.2 summarizes the results of the sensitivity analysis, while Annex 8 presents the
detailed results. The figure displays the changes (shown in the Y axis) in each of the cost and benefit streams
to yield a given ERR (the X axis). The point where the curves intersect along the X axis corresponds to the
30.8 percent ERR.

5.12   The economic analysis                  ~~~~Economic Rates of Return
of the proposed fuel purchases suggests
that significant economic net benefits          Figure 5.2: Economic Sensitivity Analysis
accrue to Georgia. If the generating
fuels were not made available, electricity supply would have to be rationed during the winter season and
reliability of supply would suffer considerably. Besides the social and reliability costs, consumers would
be willing to pay for electricity more than the actual tariff to avoid not being supplied. Based on this benefit
alone, financing of generating fuels has an economic NPV of 7.2 million and an ERR of 35.3 percent.
Distributional Impact
5.13           Table 5-1 presents the distribution of costs and benefits between the different project
stakeholders, specifically to the poor, and the government. The poor have two main benefits: employment
of unskilled labor during construction and operation of the project, and the increase in consumer surplus of
lower income households who would have had to pay a higher tariff without the project. Of the total net
project benefits, an estimated 15.1 percent go to the poor.
5.14           The government also benefits from the project from a variety of sources. First, it collects
a road tax of 0.1 percent of the production costs, and 20 percent VAT on bulk electricity sales. The analysis
shows that if they maintain a tariff policy of cost recovery, the government would benefit considerably from
the project, absorbing 52.7 percent through taxes of the total incremental net benefits made possible by the
project.

D. Project Risks
5.15          The recommendation to finance the proposed project at this stage recognizes the efforts of
state and sector authorities to begin to systematically address the main problems in the power sector.
Successful implementation of sector reforms, supported by this project, would create an environment in
which project direct benefits -- increase in electricity generation and improvement in the reliability and
quality of electricity supply -- would be sustained. Moreover, the reformed sector should be able to further
improve efficiency of the power svstem and support its expansion in the long run, increasing significantly
potential pay-offs of the project. However, project risks, particularly those related to the macroeconomic
environment and the sector's financial condition, are high. Through up-front measures (such as the tariff
increases, improved collections, and the debt restructuring exercise), and specific agreements, the project
is designed to improve accountability in the sector and mitigate project risks by monitoring compliance with
agreements and working with the authorities to take corrective actions where necessary. Several factors
which contribute to project risk, such as Government fiscal and social policies, the condition of the financial
sector, enforcement of hard budget constraints on enterprises, payment arrears and internal debts throughout
the economy, regulatory environment, and privatization strategy, have only been partially addressed by the
proposed operation and are being addressed by other Bank operations in the country, including a proposed
second Structural Adjustment Credit. Satisfactory compliance with agreements under this project will
influence future Bank operations in the sector.
5.16          The risks can be divided into two broad categories: (i) those associated with policies in the
energy sector, and (ii) the risks associated with the beneficiary and the project itself. The main risks
belonging to the first category are described in Table 5.2.

through other operations as well.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
GEORGIA
POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
ANNEX 1
Statement of Power Sector Development Policy
The Government of Georgia (GoG) is undertaking a comprehensive reform of the Georgian
Electricity Supply Industry (GESI), to raise the efficiency, attract investment, and promote
commercialization and privatization of the industry. The reform proposals have the following key aims:
*     Promote -through competition and private sector participation- an economic and reliable supply
of electricity and the efficient use of electricity;
*     Ensure that sector enterprises have clear objectives, adequate autonomy and accountability for
their performance;
*     Mobilize adequate internal and external financial resources;
O     Minimize the environmental, health and safety impacts of electricity production and use at
acceptable cost; and
*     Strengthen markets and the private sector in Georgia.
The GoG considers the reforms in the power sector a fundamental component of Georgia's overall
economic restructuring. We present below the GoG's policies and objectives for the development of the
GESI and the actions (Attachment) the GoG is committed to take to reach the proposed objectives.
A. Macroeconomic Policies
The GoG, with the assistance and support of the IMF, the World Bank, and other multilateral
and bilateral agencies, initiated a far reaching transition process to a market-based economy. The GoG
is committed to continue along the challenging reform path to enforce financial discipline and commercial
behavior of state enterprises, and accelerate their privatization. Conditions are now propitious for greater
macroeconomic stability and more rapid structural change. We believe the GoG has taken important steps
in coping with the problems posed by the internal strife and the transition from a command to an open
market economy. We have achieved progress in opening-up international trade, deregulating prices,
achieving fiscal prudence, and improving the macroeconomic situation. These actions have resulted in
a decline in inflation, and progress toward a more realistic and liberal exchange rate. We are optimistic
about continuing along this path and firming the basis for regaining the conditions for the sustainable
growth of the economy.



Page 2                                  Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy
B. Electricity and the Economy
The GoG recognizes that the high intensity of electricity use, uneconomic pricing, poor
commercial practices, weak regulatory institutions, the supply inefficiencies and the overall
decapitalization of the GESI severely hinder the normal development of economic activities in Georgia.
The GoG has designed a new power sector policy and strategy that will support the program of economic
reforms. We believe there are feasible solutions for the steady improvement of the electricity situation
that will facilitate economic output growth and improve the living conditions of the population.
C. Guiding Principles of Sector and Enterprise Reform
The GoG is convinced that we will overcome the main issues and challenges facing the GESI
through sector reforms aimed at creating, on the one hand, a new legal and regulatory framework along
open market lines, and, on the other, separate commercial companies competing wherever possible among
themselves. We believe that this set of sector and corporate restructuring measures will enable us to
supply an economic and reliable supply of power to the greatest possible number of consumers in Georgia
in a sustainable manner. In summary, the following principles will guide the GoG reforms:
-     Achieve clear separation of the policy making, regulatory, and ownership functions of the State;
Promote optimal long term development of primary energy resources to attain an economic and
balanced development between the various types of resources (hydro, thermal, renewables) with
proper environmental consideration, and taking into account the regional context and trade
opportunities;
e     Ensure the interconnected system is operated at the minimum level of cost in accordance with
appropriate quality, reliability and environmental standards;
*     Unbundle the sector into separate generators, a transmission company and separate distributors,
allowing large users to choose suppliers, subject to the maintenance of the integrity of the system;
*     Ensure commercial independence and financial discipline of electricity industry enterprises,
holding them accountable for their performance;
*     Promote through competition (generation and sales) and incentive regulation (transmission and
distribution) an efficient and reliable electricity supply;
*     Open the sector to private investment, and transform existing electric utilities to strengthen fair
competition, open access to networks, improve efficiency, and attract fresh capital for its
development;
*     Remove barriers to entry to the GESI - regardless of ownership - and identify clearly rights and
obligation for remaining in it, including mechanisms to monitor and enforce coverage and quality
of service;
*     Promote market pricing of electricity, i.e., set the level and structure of electricity prices based
on economic principles to encourage efficient use of energy and capital while providing for
adequate mobilization of funds to cover the operating and expansion costs;



Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy                                   Page 3
*      Establish explicit and targeted subsidies, for electricity supplied to very low income households;
*      Establish an independent electricity regulatory agency shielded from economic and political
influences by a) placing it outside the ministerial structure, b) providing it with an autonomous
budget, c) appointing long-term competent directors in a transparent manner, and d) staffing it
with professional and non-political personnel;
*      Establish clear and appropriate mechanisms to arbitrate and settle disputes among consumers,
producers, carriers, distributors and sellers of electricity; and
*      Ensure consistency with the Government's general policies of reform, economic stabilization and
adjustment.
D. Power Sector Policies
The GoG's power sector policy seeks to achieve sustainable efficiency in the GESI through the
application of the above set of principles. We established in 1996 the Ministry of Energy to guide the
GoG's energy policies in a consistent and coordinated manner.
Our strategy to achieve the efficiency objectives is based on: (i) corporatization,
commercialization and decentralization of the sector; (ii) implementation of commercial practices and
enforcement of payments; (iii) economic pricing of electricity with due regard to poor residential users;
(iv) establishment of a legal and regulatory framework to promote competition and private sector
participation; (v) optimization of the use of resources by fostering least cost development plans; (vi)
focusing investments in the short and medium term on the economic rehabilitation of existing facilities
and completion of economically viable but partially completed projects; (vii) promotion of efficient use
and conservation of electricity; and (viii) protection of the environment in electricity production and use.
We explain below each of these points.



Page 4                                    Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy
(i) Sector Organization and Corporate Restructuring of the GESI
The GoG is undertaking a major reorganization of the sector, supported by a legal and regulatory
reform. We have started an extensive corporate reform of the sector enterprises. We intend to transform
their managerial and administrative practices to keep up with the legal and regulatory reform. The
intention is to transform the enterprises into efficient and commercial companies through decentralization,
the separation of functions and responsibilities, corporate restructuring, commercialization, modernization
of management processes, and privatization.
In 1996 we separated generation, transmission and distribution assets. This separation by
functions and corporate restructuring will instill transparency to the resource allocation process. It will
also allow us to improve management processes, organizational change and structural realignment, human
resource development and the implementation of management information systems. By June 1997, we
will form joint stock companies with separate management and accounts.
We are aware that the manner in which we brake-up and privatize the distribution companies
(Discos) are important for the sustainability of the proposed GESI.  Small Discos have limited
creditworthiness and may not attract strategic generating investors. The formation of the Discos needs
to ensure that each has a sound commercial market with an adequate mix of users. We will: (i) define
borders between distribution and transmission sectors according to the accepted technical standards; (ii)
reorganize distribution into a smaller number of companies with adequate customer base to be a viable
business entities; and (iii) begin a transparent process, with a competitive bidding for the distribution
franchises open to the private investors, to avoid selecting only the most profitable parts of the system,
and preventing that the unwanted distribution circuits with low income users are left to the public
sector.
(ii) Poor Collection and Inter-Enterprises Arrears
The GoG realizes the detrimental economic and social effects of nonpayment, poor collection
practices, and arrears between public sector entities. We are aware that poor commercial practices,
specifically inadequate billing and collection of bills, are the major obstacles for the financial viability
of the GESI. As part of the GESI reform measures, it is the intention of the GoG to ensure conditions
in which power supply enterprises can enforce collections, and are responsible for their financial
performance and the quality of service. We will mandate cutting service to nonpaying customers and we
will penalize the enterprises that fail to act accordingly.
Specifically, we will ask electricity supply companies to disconnect consumers in arrears,
including industrial consumers, households, and government budget-funded entities; impose reconnecting
fees, and penalties on unpaid bills not lower than the commercial bank lending rate; and we will establish
the system of deposits equivalent to three months of consumption for supplying persistent defaulters. The
central and the local governments will assume the responsibility for resolving payments on behalf of
essential public services in arrears. In addition, the distribution companies will take measures to improve
metering, billing, and collection, as well as measures to eliminate their payment arrears for the electricity
purchases from Sakenergo.



Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy                                     Page 5
(iii) Electricity Pricing and Social Protection
As part of the economic liberalization program, the GoG initiated actions since September 1994
to move electricity prices gradually toward economic levels. We have made significant progress. We
have maintained a slower pace of adjustment for household electricity prices for social reasons.
However, we plan to raise the average residential rate to the industrial tariff level during the first half
of 1997. Simultaneously, we will subsidize low-income households for a minimum consumption of
electricity. We will examine and select by June 1997 the least distortionary manner in which to fund
these subsidies, either through the GoG's budget or through lifeline tariff rates.
We will eliminate cross-subsidies among consumer classes to reach full cost recovery tariffs for
each customer class by the end of 1998. Once we reach economic levels, we will continue to maintain
tariffs at these levels, through periodic adjustments as necessary given exchange rates and international
price changes. This will improve efficiency of electricity use and to ensure the financial viability of
electricity sector entities.
(iv) Reforming the Electricity Supply Industry Legal and Regulatory Framework
The GoG supports the establishment of a stable and transparent legal framework, clear regulatory
rules and independent regulatory institutions to ensure the achievement of the above objectives. To this
end, the GoG is committed to passing an electricity law that will:
-      separate the policy, regulatory and ownership functions of the Government, and
disengage the Government from business operations;
-      establish an independent electricity regulatory agency;
-      establish a firm  basis for commercialization of GESI, including liberalization of
international trade;
-      establish vertical separation of the electricity  supply  industry  into  generation,
transmission, and distribution functions;
-      allow private ownership of assets, including both the existing assets and new facilities;
-      open the way to competition in the production and distribution of power, and to its
transport under a "common carrier" transmission system;
-      create over the long-run conditions to encourage competition among the most economic
forms of electricity generation, including cogeneration by industrial plants, imports, and
other forms of generation and distribution, irrespective of ownership.
The GoG intends to create a stable and transparent regulatory framework by issuing detailed
regulations for the electricity supply industry and establishing an independent regulatory agency which
will implement the regulations. The agency will regulate tariffs; issue licenses; monitor and enforce
enterprises' responsibilities under the law; monitor financial viability of operators and their contractual
relationships; set and monitor quality of service; arbitrate disputes; and provide information and advice
to the Government. We will fund the agency in a way that ensures its independence and the hiring of
competent professionals.
(v) Sector Development Plans
As public resources to the sector have become critically scarce, special emphasis will be given
to the development of sound and consistent expansion plans based, first, on least cost principles and,



Page 6                                    Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy
later, on competitive investments. We wil develop a least-cost power sector investment program for the
medium and long term. This program will serve as an investment guide to existing public generators and,
once we privatize these, as an indicative least-cost expansion plan for prospective investors.
In the short term, we have established interim measures to ensure a correct allocation of scarce
resources. From information currently available, and considering the financial constraints, the following
investments have the highest priorities: a) rehabilitation of existing thermal and hydro power generating
plants, b) reinforcements to existing transmission systems, c) modernization of the electricity load
dispatch center, and d) rehabilitation of power distribution systems to reduce losses.
The GoG will actively promote regional cooperation in energy investment projects and
liberalization of energy trade.
(vi) Rehabilitation of Electric Facilities
The GoG assigns priority to urgently needed rehabilitation of generation, transmission and
distribution facilities that are severely deteriorated. Thermal and hydro generating plants are operating
at partial capacity levels and low efficiency. Additionally there exist serious transmission bottlenecks
while distribution networks need rehabilitation.
The restructuring and modernization strategy will give priority to reaching an adequate electricity
supply by rehabilitating and improving the efficiency of the existing installations through modernization
and repowering power plants and decommissioning - whenever economically justified - obsolete
installations.
(vii) Electricity Conservation
We are aware that measures to conserve energy are generally less expensive than investments to
expand supply. It is our firm intention to price electricity in a commercial manner, so that prices reflect
costs and induce consumers to use electricity efficiently. We will also examine alternative energy
conservation mechanisms and measures to complement economic pricing.
(viii) Enviromnent Protection
The GoG strongly believes that we cannot reach sustainable development without protecting the
environment. The GoG is developing an environmental strategy within the context of achieving
sustainable development. We intend to consider the environmental effects of electricity generation,
transmission, distribution and use. To this end, we will implement, considering the associated costs, the
measures stated in the strategy document to reduce the pollution impacts of electricity supply.



Annex 1: Statement of Power Sector Development Policy                                 Page 7
E. Conclusion
We believe that the successful implementation of the reforms should be done through a transition
process designed to overcome the immediate problems mentioned, and to be the least disruptive for the
continuous supply of electricity. In summary, the immediate problems need the following measures: a)
improve collections; b) reach cost-recovery tariffs; c) introduce targeted subsidies for the very poor,
either from the national budget or through lifeline tariffs; d) reduce electricity losses; e) minimize
operational costs; f) complete separating the policy, ownership, and regulatory roles of the state; g)
improve corporate structure and management, commercial and administrative practices of the electricity
companies, and h) promote the privatization of the industry's assets in an open, transparent and
competitive manner.
The program outlined above will have a major impact on the country's macroeconomic prospects.
We expect it to provide a sound legal and regulatory framework to the GESI and improve the efficiency
of existing institutions while opening possibilities for attracting private investors. We appreciate the
support of the international community to this program. We look forward to a continued cooperative and
successful exchange which will help in placing Georgia on a path to stable and sustained economic
growth.

6.    At the initial stage to carry out reorganization of "SAKENERGO", and to establish 3 independent
subsectors - GENERATION & TRANSMISSION, DISPATCH CENTER AND DISTRIBUTION
SUBSECTORS.
7.    Enterprises included in "SAKENERGO" s Generation Subsector (separate power plants or their
groups, maintenance or service enterprises or their groups) should be transformed into joint stock
companies, the shares of which will stay in the state property before the decision will be made on their
allocation. The Ministry of Fuel & Energy should establish appropriate unit to regulate a State Share.
8.    "SAKENERGO"s Transmission & Dispatch Structure should be transformed into united
commercialized, financially self-governing treasury enterprise "SAKENERGO", which will be supervised
by the Ministry of Fuel & Energy and won't be the subject of privatization on the current stage.
9.    Distribution Structures will be completely separated from "SAKENERGO " according to territorial
principle and transformed into joint stock companies, the shares of which will stay in the state property
before the decision will be made on their allocation and they will be regulated by the Local Authorities.
The Ministry of State Property Management, together with the Ministry of Fuel & Energy and Local
Authorities should draw up a privatization plan for this unit within one month.
10.   In order to carry out transformation of "SAKENERGO's Generation and Distribution enterprises
into joint stock companies the Department "SAKENERGO", according to the agreement with the Ministry
of Fuel & Energy and Local Authorities should draw up a documentation according to the Georgian
Legislation about the "Owners" and "Privatization of State Enterprises" and until 1 August 1996 should
submit it to the Ministry of State Property Management, also "SAKENERGO" should draw up a
corporatization plan and submit it to the State Secretariat.
11.   Ministry of State Property Management of the Republic of Georgia until 1 September 1996 should
provide transformation of abovementioned enterprises into joint stock companies according to the
requirements of Georgian Legislation about the "Owners" and "Privatization of State Enterprises".
12.   The Ministry of Fuel & Energy together with Local Authorities and the personnel of the
enterprises should draw up a plan on the transformation of accounting, financial and managerial activities
of the Separated Enterprises and Distribution Companies according to corresponding cost accounts the
implementation of which should start until 31 October 1996.
13.   The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Fuel & Energy, the Department "SAKENERGO",
together with Local Authorities should work out a plan on marking off enterprise accounts and property
inventory of already established enterprises according to long-term indebtedness of separate structures
from "SAKENERGO". The plan should include debt restructuring and debt coverage long and short term
schedules according to tariff structure. This plan should be based on the realization results of measures
designed by the Special Regulation of the President on the payment of consumed electricity.
14.   The Ministry of Fuel and Energy of the Republic of Georgia together with the Ministry of State
Property Management with participation of corresponding structure of the State Secretariat should work
out a plan of Electric Energy privatization and present it until 30 November 1996. This plan should take
into account the basic directions of State privatization process especially in Energy Sector.  The
investment environment and income caused by privatization have important essence for modernization

ANNEX 3
ELECTRICITY DEMAND AND SUPPLY PROJECTIONS
1.     Electricity Demand. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the future economic evolution
of Georgia, which makes forecasting electricity demand a difficult exercise. The economy is in severe
disequilibrium, with major structural changes under way. Electricity tariffs as price signals have limited
impact on consumers' behavior because of poor payment enforcement, and effective tariffs' are far lower
than their nominal values. The pattern and the level of consumption, therefore, has been little affected by
tariff increases and income changes.  Overall, because of the poor state of electric installations,
consumption, in recent years, has been constrained by low supply availability. Furthermore, available
electricity supplies have sharply decreased because of lack of funds to import electricity and generating
fuels, and to properly maintain and operate the system. These funding shortages have also led to further
disrepair and accelerated deterioration of the production and delivery infrastructure.
2.     A dynamic consumption model2, which takes into account changes in GDP (gross domestic
product), price adjustments (including lagged effects), and supply constraints was used to forecast annual
demand for electricity for the period 1998-2005. Over the long-run, the way and speed of economic
growth determines largely how energy demand will be supplied and at what price. The model implicitly
assumes that the economy would stabilize sufficiently (structurally and behaviorally) by the beginning of
the period.
3.     Electricity consumption is an intermediate demand for other uses, such as light, motive power,
heat, etc. It is thus necessary to consider the customers' installed capacity to use each fuel (power,
gasoline, diesel, etc.). Since statistics on household appliances, industrial and commercial energy using
equipment are virtually nonexistent in Georgia, the chosen demand model is based on the "partial
adjustment specification," which introduces a proxy for the user's equipment stock. The model states that
demand in year t is explained by the value of all the explanatory variables in that year, plus the lag-
dependent variable (i.e., the energy consumed in the prior year).
4.     To express the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, a dynamic double-log
model was used. The key advantage of this model is that it provides estimates of both short- and long-run
elasticities. The estimated coefficients are the short-run elasticities that measure the proportional change
in the dependent variable due to the proportional changes in the independent variables. The long-run
elasticities are derived from the short-run elasticities using the estimate of the lagged effect in the estimated
equations; i.e.,
i    Defined as collected electricity sales revenues (as opposed to billings) over total electricity supplied (rather than billed).
2    The model was used for developing electricity demand forecast for the Energy Sector Review for Georgia (June 30,
1995).

Long Run Elasticity -  Short Run Elasticity
I -Estimate of Lagged Demand
5.      Given the absence of an adequate time-series on consumption and tariffs (the available data
extended from 1989 to 1995), the estimated electricity demand elasticities are essentially judgmental in
nature. Although regression analysis was performed, the quality of the estimates was so poor, given the
low number of observations and the deficient data quality, that we relied more on judgment than on the
regression results. We however examined our demand estimates against other demand studies elsewhere,
showing that they were within acceptable ranges.

6.      Table 1 presents the values of the demand model used in the forecasts.  As expected, the
magnitudes of the elasticities are overall higher for income than for price. Although the estimated demand
is very inelastic to price changes in the short-run, the long-run price elasticity is significantly higher.

7.      Table 2 compares our elasticity estimates to four other demand studies.3 The comparison indicates
that electricity demand in Georgia is expected to be less elastic than other middle income countries in Latin
America. The tariff elasticity in Georgia is much lower than that of the other comparator countries. This
is partly explained by the poor payment track record of consumers in Georgia. The income elasticity in

Georgia, although also lower, is closer to the elasticities of the other countries.
8.     Consumption for years 1996 and 1997 was projected on the basis of expected supply constraints.
Historical consumption data are presented in Table 3, and the demand forecasts in Table 4; the demand
forecast represents total domestic demand, including all network losses and self-consumption of generating
plants. The maximum annual load projections were derived from the energy demand projections and system
load factors, which were assumed to increase slightly from the present level of about 55 % to 65 % by 2005,
where they were in the years of unsuppressed demand4.

9.     As explained earlier, electricity demand is responsive to income growth. Given the economic
uncertainties, we examined two alternative scenarios. In the pessimistic scenario GDP grows at an average
of 4 percent per anum, while in the optimistic one, it grows by 10 percent annually. The results for the
three simulations are presented in the figure above. As one can see, once the supply shortages disappear
after 1997, demand starts growing in tandem with economic expectations, even under the pessimistic
scenario.
10.    Power Supply. The available capacity in the Georgian power system changes almost daily,
depending on the operational status of equipment, water level in hydro plants, and availability of gas or
mazut at the Gardabani thermal plant. It now ranges between 800 MW and 1400 MW, and is much lower
than the installed name-plate capacity. Energy production is also limited by the same factors. Historically,
Georgia covered about 50% of requirements in late 1980s-early 1990s from domestic hydro production.
The remaining 50% was supplied by domestic generation using imported fuel (about 30%) and by
electricity imports (about 20%). Since 1989 all three sources of electricity have declined. Hydro



Annex 3: Electricity Demand and Supply Projections                                      Page 5
generation fell from more than 8 TWh in 1989 to 5.7 TWh in 1995. This drop cannot be explained only
by hydrological changes during the period. Similarly, thermal generation declined more than the quantity
of imported fuels, pointing to a decrease in plants' efficiency. Losses in the network, both technical and
commercial, also increased disproportionately (see Table 1.2 in main text). These facts indicate a
significant deterioration in system conditions and its technical production capacity -a result of maintenance
backlogs, disrepair, shortages of working capital and investment funds.
11.    System Expansion and Supply Costs. A simplified analysis of the supply options was conducted
to estimate investments needed to meet projected demand over the 1997-2005 horizon. System's operation
costs and investment requirements for generation were estimated assuming that, without investments in
system rehabilitation, the presently available production capacity -including hydro generation- would
continue to decline at a rate of about 5% per year, a conservative assumption given the higher rate of
decline of recent years. In balancing electricity supply with demand, economic dispatch of the Georgian
plants calls for scheduling hydro plants first, followed by the 300-MW Gardabani units. The rest of
demand in 1997 and 1998 has to be met by imports or by the older 150/165-MW units at the Gardabani
plant. A simple analysis demonstrates that importing gas or mazut for operating these units is more
expensive than importing electricity5. However, because of import constraints -isolation of the Georgian
system from the neighbors and the import of electricity in a radial configuration - which most likely will
be present throughout 1997-98, it was assumed that in these years the old Gardabani units will still be
operated.
12.    Without some investment to increase domestic generation capacity, the only option to satisfy the
forecasted demand would be to keep increasing electricity imports. Analysis in Annex 8, however,
indicates that rehabilitation ofthe 300-MW units at Gardabani is more attractive than imports, even without
taking into account investment costs needed to repair interconnection lines which would be necessary if
electricity imports were to be increased beyond several hundred megawatts.
13.    The analysis assumes a rehabilitation program for hydropower plants to reach their generation
potential of about 7.3 TWh by year 2003, from the present 5.7 TWh. The analysis also assumes that the
old 150/165-MW units at the Gardabani plant are retired after year 2000, and that both existing 300-MW
units are rehabilitated. No new ("green-field") capacity is needed until 200. Adding a new 300-MW unit
at Gardabani in 2002 (at a cost significantly lower than a truly "green-field" project, due to the fact that
some equipment has been procured and some civil work completed) enables the system to satisfy demand,
with increasing imports, until 2005. It is less obvious what expansion option is the least cost at the level
of system demand as projected for 2005 (see para. 1.26 in the main text). For the purpose of this exercise,
it was assumed that building a 450-MW combined cycle gas-fired plant would be the selected alternative.
14.    The analysis results in investment requirements for the generation system of about US$800 million
for the 1996-2005 period, of which about US$290 million would be used for rehabilitation of the existing
plants, mainly before year 2000, to recover about 1500 MW. The rest of US$510 million would be needed
after year 2000 for completion and construction of new plants, with total capacity of 750 MW.
5     At the net efficiency of about 20% and the current cost of natural gas at more than $65/tcm, only fuel cost of generation
comes to more than USC 3.5/kWh, while the price of electricity imports from Russia is USC 3-3.5/kWh.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
GEORGIA
POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
ANNEX 5
The Investment Program
A. Electric Power Infrastructure
1.      Georgia has extensive electric network coverage -  practically all households are connected to
the network. Its generation and transmission capacities were developed in the context of the FSU
economic and power system planning, and operated as a part of the integrated power system of the FSU.'
Both the fuel mix (share of hydropower, coal, oil, gas etc. in electricity generation) and the capacity mix
(size and type of generating units - base, intermediate, peaking) were optimized relative to the
Transcaucasus IPS and the FSU system, and are sub-optimal for the Georgia's power system taken alone.
2.      Generation. Total installed nameplate capacity of power plants in Georgia is about 5090 MW,
of which 2088 MW belongs to three thermal plants with 15 units (the Gardabani - 1850 MW, 10 units;
Tkvarcheli - 220 MW, 2 units; Tbilisi CHP - 18 MW, 3 units), 2843.5 is in 103 hydro plants with 182
units (of which 6 are large storage plants and 17 are larger run-of-river (RoR) plants; others are small
RoR plants), 5.4 MW are diesel units, and about 153 MW industrial plants ("block stations").
3.      The available capacity is, however, much lower. The Tkvarcheli thermal plant in Abkhazia was
damaged during the recent war and is out of operation. The Gardabani thermal plant, located near Tbilisi
and firing gas and oil, has 10 units altogether, two of which are newer 300-MW units commissioned in
1990 and 1994, respectively. Due to improper operation of these units (poor water treatment, lack of
lubricating oil, low and unstable system frequency, etc.), they suffered extensive damage for their age,
with particular damage to boilers, turbines and condensers. A fire that broke out in January 1995
damaged their control room and equipment. One of the units, no. 9, was rehabilitated in 1995 by
Sakenergo, using some major parts (e.g., turbine) which had been bought for the construction of another
300-MW block (no. 11). Its control room and equipment were repaired by Siemens AG, financed by
KfW under the German Energy Progerm. The other unit, no. 10, is not operational. Out of the eight
older 150-to-165-MW units, only two appear to be operational, or near-operational (two units are
undergoing major maintenance in preparation for comissioning) at a partial load of about 90-120 MW per
unit MW in total. These older units are very uneconomical, with efficiency below 20% (according to
the data for the first 5 months of 1994, the efficiency was only 17.2%). The Tbilisi CHP is in operational
I       Together with the power systems of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Georgian system constituted the Transcaucasian Interconnected
Power System (IPS) - one of the 11 IPSs in the FSU - controlled and dispatched from the Transcaucasian regional dispatch center in Tbilisi
(subordinated to the main system dispatch center in Moscow), to which the Georgian national dispatch center (also in Tbilisi) was subordinated.
In the regional context, Georgia had been developing hydro plants. Azerbaijan oil-based plants, and Armenia built a nuclear plant (in addition
to a mixture of gas-fired and hydropower plants). In all three countries, as in the FSU in general, investment policies in the last 15-20 years
favored use of natural gas in electricity generation. The Transcaucasus region, as a whole, was energy and electricity importer in the FSU,
although net direct electricity imports, unlike fuel imports, were not significant.



Page 2                                                          Annex 5: The Investment Program
condition, although it needs to be rehabilitated as no proper maintenance work has been done during the
last five years. The plant has been practically out of operation for the last several years due to the
shutdown of district heating system in Tbilisi which it serves with hot water. The industrial plants
("block stations") are also very old and inefficient; for example, the energy conversion efficiency of the
100-MW Rustavi industrial gas-fired generation plant is reportedly about 14%.
4.     The available capacity at hydro plants ranges between 400 MW  and 1000 MW, depending on
water availability and maintenance status. Maximum production of all hydro plants was 8,777 GWh in
1988, and average production between 1985 and 1993 was 7480 GWh; in 1994 it reached only 4900
GWh.
5.     Transmission Network. The power transmission network consists of 572 km of 500-kV lines,
21 km of 330-kV lines and 1565 km of 220-kV lines. The 500-kV line is the transmission backbone,
connecting the western part of the country, where most of hydro generation is concentrated including
Inguri, with the Gardabani plant in the eastern part. The line also connects Georgia, Russia and
Azerbaijan, and was meant to be the main regional transmission link. In addition, Georgia has another
220-kV link with Russia, a 220-kV link with Armenia, 1 10-kV with Turkey, and 220-kV and 330-kV
connections with Azerbaijan. The network of 220 kV and higher voltage has 18 substations; including
the 110-kV network (part of which has transmission role as well), the number of substations raises to
260. The transmission network suffers from the lack of regular maintenance and theft of the material,
and has very poor reliability2. Connections lines to Russia (500-kV) and Armenia are not functional at
the moment because of disrepair. A number of low-cost priority measures in substations, such as
replacement of circuit breakers, air-compressors, etc., have been implemented in 1995-96 under the
German Financial Cooperation, comissioned by KfW.
6.     Distribution Network.  The distribution network is extensive and consists of the following
sections: 4210 km of 100 kV, 3316 km of 35 kV, 2135 km of 10 kV, 2710 km of 6 kV and 76,740 km
of 0.4 kV. In addition to the problems characterizing the transmission network (lack of maintenance,
pilferage), distribution network was subject to more difficult operating regimes during the hours when
electricity was available as the only energy to households and, therefore experiencing surges in demand
frequently above the design capacity. The management of Telasi, distribution company supplying Tbilisi,
claims that they have to keep replacing or repairing transformers at a rate higher than in the years of
normal system operation.
7.     System Control and Conmmunications. The main national dispatch center (NDC) is located in
Tbilisi, and controls all major power plants and all 220-kV and higher voltage transmission facilities in
the country. It also controls 1 10-kV and lower voltage transmission facilities in eastern Georgia, while
the control center in Kutaisi controls 1 10-kV and lower voltage transmission facilities, as well as small
hydro plants, in western Georgia. The Kutaisi center also serves as a backup to the NDC in Tbilisi.
There are 17 regional dispatch centers in charge of distribution systems, which operate under the
supervision of the Tbilisi or the Kutaisi centers.
2      The transmission system experienced 114 incidents of line outages on 500-, 330- and 220-kV lines in the first 8 months
of 1995. It was reported that the line faults were a major cause of these outages, which often led to regional or country-wide
blackouts (27 country-wide blackouts were reported in the same period).



Annex 5: The Investment Program                                                                  Page 3
8.      The existing real-time data acquisition system is rudimentary, and includes - as designed - some
220 measurements and 900 telesignals from power plants and substations. No remote control is possible,
except for generation control of the Khrami-I power plant (manually, from main dispatch center in
Tbilisi), which is used for system frequency control. The Tbilisi dispatch center is linked directly with
main power plants, substations and regional network centers in the eastern part of the country, whereas
the connections with the facilities in the western part go through a regional center in Kutaisi. Although
34 substations and power plants are equipped with the FSU-made data acquisition equipment, NDC
currently receives real-time data from only three such field devices, due to near-complete breakdown of
the power line carrier-based data communication system, as well as faulty data communication equipment
and field instrumentation. Dispatchers at NDC have to rely on verbal phone conversations with the field
operators to monitor and control the system. However, this mode of communication is also unreliable
because of the poor telephone system, and dispatchers sometimes do not have even a phone connection
with some hydro plants for days.
9.      The power system in Georgia operates in permanent semi-emergency mode. Not only is it cut-off
from the neighboring systems3, but it often operates as several independent subsystems, with some power
plants supplying certain limited geographical areas. With demand consistently exceeding the available
supply, dispatchers are continuously struggling to maintain the electric balance by switching-off
consumers and rationing electricity. The generation/consumption balance is usually maintained at a
system frequency of less than the nominal 50 Hz, which enables supply to sa omewhat larger number of
customers, although with poorer quality and at the cost of accelerated deterioration of power system's
and users' equipment. With such poor control and communications, system frequency is also very
unstable, which has additional negative effects on equipment'.
B. Investment Priorities
10.    In the short-to-medium  terms general investment priorities are to restore the system  capacity
through enhanced maintenance, repair and rehabilitation. This would alleviate the electricity shortages
and create conditions to connect the system with neighboring electricity networks, enabling better
electricity trade and parallel operation, and improving the quality and reliability of service.
11.    Generation. Restoration of operational capacity at the existing plants through enhanced
maintenance and rehabilitation has been identified as most important priority. Analysis of system
generation capacity and demand forecast leads to the conclusion that, most likely, no new generation
capacity is needed before year 2002. Based on Sakenergo's assessment and some preliminary system
3       Imports are effected in so-called "radial" regine where consumers, fed through an import line, are cut-off electrically
from the rest of the Georgian power system which, consequently, continues to operate in the "island" mode.
4       During the least two winters frequency was kept mostly at about 45 Hz. occasionally decreasing as low as 42 Hz.
After the rehabilitation of the unit 9 at Gardabani, the frequency is not allowed to go below 48.5 Hz (otherwise the unit would
trip). Because of unstable frequency, however, which continuously changes by several tenths of a Herz within several minutes
-an extremely undesirable and unstable regime - the newly rehabilitated 300-MW unit 9 at the Gardabani plant cannot exceed
generation of 180 MW.

studies5, rehabilitation of 300-MW units at the Gardabani thermal power plant, and rehabilitation of
larger hydro plants -- the Inguri cascade, Ladjanuri, Khrami-II, Tkhibuli, Vartsikhe, Rioni, Gumati and
Jinvali -- should be given highest priority6. Rehabilitation of the Gardabani thermal power plant is
necessary as hydro production is not sufficient to cover demand, particularly during winter. It is a
project which, among the candidate projects, would achieve the highest contribution to the system
capacity and energy. Also, the transmission network regime requires injection of active and reactive
power at the Gardabani mode. A survey study, conducted by the SEED company under the EU-TACIS
financing in 1994 ("Development of an Energy Policy in Georgia - Rehabilitation and Extension of the
Hydroelectric System", July 1994), and the feasibility study for the program conducted by Hraza
Engineering, confirmed the urgency of rehabilitation of the hydro plants.
12.    Several options are available for system expansion in the medium-to-long term (after year 2001).
It seems likely that the large hydro potential of the country would play an important role. Construction
of some larger hydro projects has been initiated (e.g., the 700-MW Khudoni hydro project on the Inguri
river with annual generation of about 1800 GWh, and the 450-MW Namakhvani hydro project of three
cascade plants on the Rioni river with annual generation of about 1200 GWh), but potential for
developing small and medium-size hydro plants seem to be particularly good. Apparently, considerable
deposits of good-quality steam coal in the Tkhibuli-Shaori region could be used in a coal-burning power
station to reduce the dependance on imported fuels and diversify the fuel supply. Another candidate
option is completion of unit no. 11 at Gardabani, for which major civil works have been completed and
some equipment purchased. This, however, would have to be looked in the context of affordable fuel
purchases (mazut or gas), and the fact that some of the larger pieces of the purchased equipment have
been installed at units no. 9 and 10 to replace malfunctioning parts. Rehabilitation -- as alternative to the
retirement -- of some older units (no. 1 through 8) at Gardabani, particularly their possible conversion
to combined-cycle units, would need to be considered in the same context. Repair and rehabilitation of
the Tkvarcheli thermal plant in Abkhazia, with possible conversion to coal firing, should be considered
as well, once the political situation in the region stabilizes. Investments in reducing demand and
improving end-use efficiency should be compared with the supply-side alternatives. A least-cost power
development analysis (included as a technical service component in the World Bank project), supported
by more detailed examination of the competing options to determine their costs and benefits, should be
conducted to determine optimal investment program and system expansion plan.
13.    Transmission Network. A former-Sakenergo's business plan proposes the construction of a
second east-west 500-kV transmission line with a 220-kV line as a back-up and an inter-tie between the
two 500-kV lines. Such new lines would benefit the entire power system through the forthcoming period
of rehabilitation and the possible future construction of new plants. About two thirds of the new 500-kV
transmission line (out of a total of 420 km) have already been 60% completed and one 220-kV substation
(Moliti), associated with it, has come to a 20% completion. The total investment required for the entire

Kantor/SEEd Consortium, 1994; also, feasibility studies for the investment program by Burns and Roe, Harza Engineering,
American Electric Power (1996).
6      Rehabilitation of the Inguri plant should probably be first priority on technical grounds. Because of the political
problems in the region, however, the risk associated with launching a major rehabilitation project at this time would be very
high. Once the political situation in Abkhazia is stabilized and rehabilitation of the Inguri cascade becomes possible, hydro
plants which are downstream of the Inguri should also be rehabilitated



Annex 5: The Investment Program                                                      Page 5
line, however, is still considerable. Such an ambitious plan should be deferred until the economy shows
clear signs of recovery, and a new load size and pattern emerges.
14.   In the short term, there is a number of measures that can be implemented at relatively low cost
in order to improve quickly the reliability of the existing network.  Such measures include the
replacement of malfunctioning and obsolete but vital components, such as circuit-breakers and their parts,
air compressors for circuit-breakers, and accumulator batteries and their chargers. The pilferage of items
such as conductors, line insulators, and even transformer oil, has made these materials critical to the
smooth functioning of the network. In addition, two major components, related to connecting the
Gardabani thermal power station and an interconnection line with Azerbaijan, are needed to ensure the
reliability of power transmission from the two important sources.  Also, repairs and equipment
replacement at the connecting substations of several hydro plants and major 500-kV substations
(Zestafoni, Ksani) are among the first priorities, some of which have already been implemented through
KfW. These are followed by the need to establish reliable interconnections in order to synchronize the
system with neighboring countries, once a satisfactory operational performance has been attained.
Repairing the 500-kV connection to Russia, and the 220-kV line to Armenia (if Armenia will be able to
support parallel operation of the power systems) would serve this objective.
15.   Distribution Network. System overhauls and improvements are needed to reverse years of
maintenance neglect, pilferage, and security manipulations that have created a distribution system with
difficult operational conditions and unacceptable levels of safety and reliability. A major overhaul would
require large investments and must be deferred. An in-depth inventory would certainly discover that
replacement apparatus, windings, cores and oil for transformers, and other items could be of great benefit
in enhancing reliability and quality of service. The improvements will have to be implemented over time
and selectively, with first priority given to major load centers and improvements in metering and load
management capabilities. Ability to supply priority consumers independently will also be important in
enforcing payments and effecting electricity rationing, particularly in the short-term.
16.   System  Control and Communications.  The system is obsolete, in serious disrepair and
practically non-functional. Dispatchers cannot properly control configuration of the network, power flows
and generation because of lack of timely information. Although poor collection of payments and high
commercial losses are mainly the result of inadequate effort, organization and incentive system, an effort
to decrease the losses would significantly benefit from improved metering. Urgent measures are needed
to make it operational and restore at least basic communications with power plants and major substations
to ensure a minimal level of system integrity and reliability. In the medium-to-long term it would be
necessary to install modern communications, data acquisition and monitoring systems, and to upgrade
control and dispatch to a technical standard common in today's power systems.
17.   Investment Financing. The total investment needs for the generation system until year 2005
have been estimated at about US$800 million of which about US$300 million would be used for
rehabilitation of the existing plants (mainly until year 2002) to recover about 1500 MW, and the rest for
the construction or completion of new plants. Under the assumed demand projection scenario (Annex
3), new capacity will not be needed before year 2002. The needed rehabilitation works could be financed
initially, in large part, through borrowing from the international financing institutions. Multilateral and
bilateral financing agencies have committed or are considering allocation of about US$180 million for
the investment in the power sector in the 1995-1997 period. As the system restores its capacity and
financial health, and with general economic recovery, investments would have to be increasingly financed



Page 6                                                       Annex 5: The Investment Program
from internal resources and commercial borrowing. Since the financing needs will increase with new
programs becoming necessary, but also economically and financially viable, it will be necessary to attract
more capital from the private sector, both domestic and foreign. The conunercialization, corporatization,
and restructuring of the power industry, establishment of a modern legal and regulatory framework, and
privatization of sector enterprises which have already been initiated, should encourage private sector
investment, either directly, or through various independent power producer schemes, or through lending.
C. Components of an Investment Program
18.   An investment program in the power sector has been identified as a joint effort of the Government
of Georgia, the Georgian power industry, and various multilateral and bilateral financing agencies (World
Bank, KfW, EBRD, USAID, OECF of Japan, Government of Switzerland.). The program includes:
rehabilitation of: (i) a 300-MW unit (no. 9 and 10) at the Gardabani thermal plant, and the Gardabani
water treatment plant; (ii) six hydropower plants (Khrami II, Vartsikhe, Tkhibuli, Lajanuri, Rioni,
Inguri); (iii) system dispatch and control; (iv) communications; (v) several key transmission substations
and distribution networks, including electricity metering. The components of the investment program
which are still to be implemented, with a total cost estimated at about US$183 million, has been
segmented into a number of separate projects which are, or are planned to be, financed by the various
institutions, as presented in Table 1 below.
19.   The program includes the following components:
o      Rehabilitation of the Gardabani Thermal Power Plant (unit no. 10
o      Rehabilitation of Hydropower Plants
o      Rehabilitation and Upgrade of System Control
o      Rehabilitation and Upgrade of Communication System
o      Installation of Electricity Meters.
20.   Rehabilitation of the Gardabani Thermal Power Plant (unit no. 10). Unit No. 10 (300 MW)
although new (installed in 1994) is in a very poor condition. Inspection of the unit revealed that the unit
needs rehabilitation and replacement of major components to restore the unit to the original design and
improve its efficiency. The rehabilitation will include boiler heating surfaces, insulation, air heaters, flue
gas ducts, high and medium pressure rotors, turbine valves, feed water pumps, instrumentation and
control system, 6-kV switchgear, and generator circuit breakers and excitation system. It will also
include rehabilitation of water heaters, steam valves and piping, installation of new cables, and lighting.
The rehabilitation would restore the plant to its original design parameters and extend its life for another
15-20 years.
21.   Rehabilitation of Hydropower Plants. This component will include short-term and long-term
measures. The short-term measures will focus on priority rehabilitation of the following hydro plants
(nameplate capacities in parenthesis): (i) the Lajanuri hydropower plant (3x38.6 MW), (ii) the Khrami



Annex 5: The Investment Program                                                      Page 7
II (2x55MW), (iii) the Tkhibuli (4x20 MW) and (iv) the Vartsikhe I, II, III and IV (4x2x23 MW). The
work involves the following measures:
o      Rehabilitation of turbine governors and wicket gates; replacement of turbine
blades; replacement, rehabilitation or upgrade of other related equipment
(motors, pumps, guide vanes, oil system etc.);
o      Rehabilitation of generators including replacement, rehabilitation or upgrade of
stator and rotor windings, generator circuit breakers, excitation, voltage
transformers and electrical protection;
o      Rehabilitation  of substations  and  related  equipment including  step-up
transformers, circuit breakers, isolators, earthing switches, protection relays and
current and voltage transformers;
o      Civil works including training walls, repair of gravity flow tunnels, slit out of the
reservoirs, repair of power canals and the construction -f the overflow spillways
at the Vartsikhe power plant.
22.   The rehabilitation is expected to increase the capacity for about 110 MW in total, and energy
generation during the next five years for about 2033 GWh in total. The increase is distributed across the
plants as follows: Lajanuri: 32MW and 403 GWh; Khrami II: 10 MW and 219 GWh; Tkhibuli: 35 MW
and 176 GWh; Vartsikhe: 33.5 MW and 1535 GWh. The rehabilitation will enable operation of the
plants for at least another five years with regular maintenance. After that, the plants will likely need a
more substantial rehabilitation to complement the measures proposed in this program. The long-term
measures will include more costly major overhauls of the plants which would restore their capacities the
design values or more, improve the efficiency, extend the lifetime, and enable a reliable operation of the
plants for another 15-25 years.
23.   The Inguri plant and water reservoir have been operating under difficult technical conditions
during the last several years. During the civil war, three of the five generator units failed due to poor
maintenance. Most of the dam monitoring and meteorological equipment were either damaged or lost.
The remaining equipment is in a very poor condition and does not allow Sakenergo to perform systematic
monitoring of the dam and it's behavior, which presents a high potential risk to a very large populated
area downstream of the reservoir. To allow Sakenergo to measure and monitor behavior of the dam and
control the risk, supply and installation of new monitoring equipment is urgently needed. The work
involves the supply and installation of geodetic and meteorological equipment, automatic reservoir level
recorders, manometers and chronometers for drainage water measurement, and provisions for emergency
power supply. Repair of four low-level outlets to stop water leakages (water losses are estimated at 8-12
m3/s at each gate), and provision of a stoplog, lost in an accident in November 1994, which would
enbale gate repairs, are also a priority.
24.   Rehabilitation and Upgrade of System Control. This component will address immediate needs
for improvements in system monitoring, control and dispatch by rehabilitating the Tbilisi and Kutaisi
dispatch centers and high priority field equipment. The work includes three major components:
o      installation of new computer-based, open-architecture master systems at the two centers;



Page 8                                                      Annex 5: The Investment Program
o      installation of new field monitoring and data acquisition equipment at selected power
plants and substations;
o     replacement of fault recorders at selected substations.
25.   Rehabilitation and Upgrade of Communication System. This component is intended to address
the urgent needs to restore voice and data communications, which are essential for the real-time control
and operation of the power system. The present communication system has serious limitations, including
poor quality channels and obsolete or non-functional equipment. The rehabilitation plan calls for the
repair or rehabilitation of the power line carrier-based comnmunications, with installation and intermixing
of new small microwave paths where heavier traffic requires higher capabilities. The plan will improve
communications between control centers and system facilities, as well as between regional dispatch
centers and transmission and distribution personnel. The program includes:
o     Restoration of primary paths of the power line carrier backbone communication system;
o      Upgrade and rehabilitation of the communication system in the Tbilisi area, which
connects the national dispatch center, the main thermal power plant (Gardabani), and
several important high-voltage transmission network substations (Gdani, Lisi, Navtlugi);
o      Development of a microwave communication link between the Kutaisi dispatch center and
Zestafoni 500/220/110 kV substation;
o      Upgrade of the short-wave long distance and local radio communication equipment;
o      Installation of telephone exchanges in the Tbilisi dispatch Center and at the Gardabani
plant.
26.   Installation of Electricity Meters. Metering is critical for commercial operation of Sakenergo
and distribution companies, and for reduction of any non-technical losses. This component would
represent only a pilot project, to provide installation of about 25,000 new electricity meters at different
consumer premises. Priority could be given to areas with high consumption and high distribution losses.
Meters may include both high-voltage meters which measure Sakenergo's deliveries to distribution
networks, and end-user meters in distribution networks. The latter will be leased by Sakenergo to
distribution companies running the network once selection of distribution systems to install the meters is
made. EBRD is pusuing the issue in more detail.
D. Cost Estimate and Financing
27.   Program Cost: Total program costs are estimated at about US$183 million equivalent. A
summary is presented in Table 1. The costs do not include technical assistance for procurement and
project management needed to implement the project.
28.   Program financing. The program would be partially financed by funds from a number of
multilateral and bilateral sources, including IDA, the German Financial Cooperation Fund via KfW, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Government of Switzerland, OECF,
and the Italian Trust Fund, as indicated in Table 1. There is a financing gap of about US$70 million to
implement the program completely.

US$70 million (excluding the contribution to the rehabilitation of unit 10 at Gardabani). EBRD
approved a loan of about US$18 million for rehabilitation of the Gardabani plant (water treatment
plant, condenser cleaning) and the Rioni hydro plant. USAID and EU have sizable technical
assistance programs, supporting both the investment projects and sector reforms.

POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
ANNEX 6
Environmental Impact Assessment
Description of the Assessment
1.    The main environmental issue associated with rehabilitation of Unit 10 of the Gardabani Thermal
Power Plant is the potential impact on ambient air quality around the Plant. Rehabilitation will result in
a longer life for the unit and as a result, more fuel will be burned producing more atmospheric pollution.
The magnitude of the resulting impact will depend greatly on the amount of mazut burned and its quality,
particularly in regard to its sulfur content.
2.    The Gardabani thermal power plant is limited by the Ministry of Environment to a maximum size
of 2000 MW. The total name-plate capacity of the plant's ten units is 1850 MW; however, five of the
8 older 150-MW units (units no. 1-8) are out of comission, so that the total nominal capacity of the plant
after unit 10 has been rehabilitated will be 1050 MW -- well within the limits set by the Ministry of
Environment. The plant must also operate within specific emission limits (as part of its "ecological
passport") and is charged a "user fee" of approximately 12,000 lari per year for its gaseous emissions
within the "passport" limits. If the plant were to operate in excess of the permitted emission limits, it
would pay a penalty of up to 5 times this "user fee" for each episode.
3.    The Regional Environmental Inspectorate, as part of their environmental assessment, also
identified the following additional environmental impacts as resulting from operation of the Plant:
(i)    Thermal Pollution of the Kura River (cooling water can be 2-5 times the ambient water
temperature of the river, especially during the winter);
(ii)    Episodic leakage of mazut from the fuel transfer facility (rail transfer to the Plant
storage), and from underground storage tanks which can impact on surface and ground
water.
4.    IDA and the Government of Georgia both require that the project's potential for environmental
impact be determined, and that any management measures be included in project design to mitigate
environmental problems that may be identified. After discussion with the Ministry of Environment and
the local Environmental Inspectorate, IDA determined that both sets of requirements could be met through
an Ecological Expertise to be conducted by the Ministry of Environment. The terms of reference of this
Ecological Expertise were jointly prepared and agreed upon by IDA and the Ministry of Environment.
5.    The main focus of the ecological expertise was air quality, particularly in regard to ambient SOx
concentration. The impact of a rehabilitated unit 10 on ambient air quality was therefore estimated using
a computer model. Air quality modeling capability exists in Georgia and was used in 1992 to predict
Plant impact when up to 12 units were assumed to be in operation.



Annex 6: Environmental Impact Assessment                                            Page 2
6.    It was agreed that this earlier modeling work needed to be updated. Sakenergo and its consultants
provided the air quality modelers (the Hydrometeorology Department of the Ministry of Environment)
with the operational parameters of Unit 10 that are expected to result following the rehabilitation
(particularly as the rehabilitation affects SOx and NOx flue gas emission concentration, temperature of
the flue gas as it exits the stack, total emission volume, and duty cycle of the unit).
7.     The first job of the air quality modeling was to help determine a suitable standard for maximum
sulfur content of the fuel mix to be used by Unit 10, following rehabilitation. This was done by assuming
several different scenarios for fuel-quality/fuel-mix burned by the Plant as a whole. For this exercise to
be conducted, the following assumptions were made:
(i)    That the mix of gas and mazut and the sulfur content of mazut in the fuel-mix can vary
in proportion. The variable of interest is the total sulfur content of the total fuel mix
being burned;
(ii)    At least 3 scenario's were modeled. These were 0.5%, 1%, and 3% sulfur in the fuel
mix .
8.     After an estimate of the "allowable" maximum sulfur content of the fuel mix was preliminarily
determined, this part of the modeling results and the maximum fuel sulfur content recommended were
sent to IDA for review and comment.
9.     Modeling was then undertaken with the objective of predicting monthly ground level
concentrations of SOx and NOx using average ambient temperature of each month as the main variable.
This information needed to better define possible impact and to determine suitable sampling sites for a
long term monitoring program. The Ecological Expertise was completed in September 1996.
Results of the Enviromnental Assessment
10.   The results of the environmental assessment were as follows:
(i)    The post-project impacts on ambient air quality, as indicated by the atmospheric
dispersion modeling, suggested that few problems were likely to arise when fuel used in
Unit 10 included no more than 40% mazut, and that mazut contained no more than 3%
sulfur. However, Unit 10 is part of a larger power generation complex. Limiting sulfur
in mazut to no more than 1.5% would result in improvement in ambient air quality
around the Gardabani Plant, and would also minimize the gaseous sulfur contribution
from this Project to the earth's atmosphere;
(ii)    Thermal pollution of the Kura River is likely to be less of a problem after completion of
the rehabilitation. Unit 10 operates on a "closed water cycle". Steam is condensed and
recycled along with cooling water. It was estimated that only 2 m3/sec of make-up water
will be required to compensate for evaporative looses, and no water is discharged to the
environment. In comparison, the 8 smaller units require 40 m3/sec of water from the
Kura River when new and operating under full load (today, only 13 m3/sec is required
to be abstracted from the River, and a large part of this is returned to the environment).



Page 3                                              Annex 6: Environmental Impact Assessment
(iii)   Episodic pollution of surface and ground waters with mazut spills does not seem to be
a major problem today. Spills occurred mainly from storage tanks that are no longer
used.
Enviromnental Monitoring
11.   It is necessary to undertake an ambient air quality monitoring program to ensure the effectiveness
of any management measures taken to mitigate environmental impacts, and to ensure that unforeseen
impacts do not jeopardize expected Project benefits. The location of sample sites are to be determined
with the assistance of the ambient air quality modeling (points where expected elevated SOx/NOx
concentrations are near human settlements or environmentally sensitive areas).  The Regional
Environmental Monitoring Center will also be consulted in regard to sample site selection and sampling
frequency.
12.   The Plant does not, at present, have the staff, equipment or training needed to undertake a long
term monitoring program. The project will include procurement of sampling equipment needed to at least
measure SOx and NOx, and to continuously monitor wind speed, direction and humidity under the terms
of the Credit from IDA.
13.   The monitoring program is to be developed with the assistance of a consultant procured under
a PHRD grant. The terms of reference for that consultant is presented below.

Terms of Reference- Consultant Assistance with Preparation of a Long Term Environmental
Monitoring Program
Project Environmental Assessment
1.    The main environmental issue associated with rehabilitation of Unit 10 of the Gardabani Thermal
Power Plant is the potential impact on ambient air quality around the Plant. Rehabilitation will result in
a longer life for the unit and as a result, more fuel will be burned producing more atmospheric pollution.
The main fuel of the plant is natural gas, with variable amounts of cofiring with mazut. The magnitude
of the resulting impact possibly associated with operation of the station following rehabilitation of Unit
10 depends greatly on the amount of mazut burned and its quality, particularly in regard to its sulfur
content.
2.    The Gardabani Thermal Power Plant is limited by the Ministry of Environment to a maximum
size of 2000 MW. It must also operate within specific emission limits (as part of its "ecological
passport") and is charged a "user fee" of approximately 12,000 lari per year for its gaseous emissions
within the "passport" limits. If the plant were to operate in excess of the permitted emission limits, it
would pay a penalty of up to 5 times this "user fee" for each episode. If units 9 and 10 were to both go
into operation, the Plant would probably need to demobilize at least 2 of its older units to stay within the
requirements of the "ecological passport".
3.    A brief environmental assessment has been done for the Project and reviewed by the Ministry
of Environment through its "Ecological Expertise" process. The main focus of the environmental
assessment was on emissions of SOx, NOx and total suspended particulates (TSP) from the rehabilitated
Gardabani Power Plant. Air quality modeling was therefore undertaken.
4.     The first objective of the modeling was to help determine a suitable standard for maximum sulfur
content of the fuel mix (gas and mazut) to be used by Unit 10 following rehabilitation. This was
accomplished by assuming several different scenarios for fuel-quality/fuel-mix being burned by the Plant
as a whole. Modeling was then undertaken to predict ground level concentrations of SOx and NOx. This
information was needed for the ecological expertise, and to determine possible sampling sites for a long
term monitoring program.
5.    The post-project impacts on ambient air quality, as indicated by the atmospheric dispersion
modeling, suggested that few problems were likely to arise when fuel used in Unit 10 included no more
than 40% mazut, and that mazut contained no more than 3% sulfur. Limiting sulfur to no more than
1.5% sulfur would result in improvement in ambient air quality around the Gardabani Plant, and would
also minimize the gaseous sulfur contribution from this project to the earth's atmosphere. The following
environmental management measures are therefore suggested:
(i)    Maximum amount of mazut to be burned in combination with natural gas in Unit 10
should be no more than 40% when;
(ii)    Maximum concentration of sulfur in the mazut does not exceed 1.5%;



Page 5                                            Annex 6: Environmental Impact Assessment
(iii)   Bringing Units 9 & 10 back on-line will result in honoring the ecological passport limits
regarding maximum size of the Gardabani Plant.
Objectives of the Long Term Environmental Monitoring Program
6.    A long term, ambient air quality monitoring program around the Gardabani Power Plant will be
implemented under the immediate direction of Sakenergo's Environmental Department. It will have the
objectives of:
(i)    Determining whether the recommendations made to control the amount of sulfur in the
fuel mix being burned in Unit 10 (as a component of the total emissions from all units
of the Gardabani Power Plant) is being implemented as required under the terms of the
Project;
(ii)   Determining whether the recommendations made to control the amount of sulfur in the
fuel mix being burned in Unit 10 (as a component of the total emissions from all units
of the Gardabani Power Plant) prove to be adequate to maintain ambient air quality
within Government of George standards;
(iii)  Identifying any unexpected air quality impacts associated with operation of the Gardabani
Power Plant.
Proposed Scope of the Long Term Monitoring Program
7.    Approximately 8-10 permanent sampling sites should be identified by correlating information
from the atmospheric pollution dispersion modeling undertaken during Project environmental impact
assessment with topographical maps of suitable scale showing areas of human habitation and
environmentally sensitive areas. Sampling should be stratified to be representative of climatic conditions
experienced over the entire year. It should also be diurnal to cover all possible weather conditions
expected in the Gardabani region. The monitoring program will be funded under the Project and by
Sakenergo, and include:
-     A program to monitor ground-level concentration of TSP, SOx and NOx for at least 5
years after the commissioning date of the rehabilitated Unit 10, when the monitoring
program  should be reviewed.  This review  should lead to the transferring of
environmental monitoring responsibilities to the Gardabani Power Plant Staff;
-     Purchase of necessary monitoring equipment and training of environmental staff of
Sakenergo and the Gardabani Plant in the use of the equipment, and with the
implementation of the air quality monitoring program.
8.    The location of monitoring sites, conduct of the sampling program, and dissemination of
monitoring results should include the Regional Environmental Inspectorate and Regional Monitoring
Center of the Ministry of Environment.

Scope of the Proposed Consultancy
9.    Consultancy assistance is needed to advise the Environmental Department of Sakenergo on:
(i)    The development of a fully detailed, long term monitoring program (sample site location,
sampling frequency, analysis of results and dissemination of results, etc.);
(ii)    Assist with technical specifications for air quality and weather monitoring equipment to
be purchased under the proposed Project;
(iii)   Develop a training program (using mainly local sources of environmental expertise,
supplemented with internationally-sourced training as needed) for the Environmental
Departments of Sakenergo and the Gardabani Power Plant;
(iv)   Provide basic training to Gardabani Power Plant Environmental Staff in methodology
needed for weather station location, establishment, operation, and maintenance.
10.   The consultancy is expected to consist of a single, four week visit to Georgia, and one week in
the consultants home office to prepare for the visit and to write up a final report of the results of the
consultancy. The consultant selected will need to be an atmospheric physicist (or similar) familiar with
air quality modeling, monitoring and establishment of weather stations.

POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
ANNEX 8
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT
1.      We conducted a financial and economic analysis, based on the incremental costs and benefits
derived from the with/without project approach, on the two project components: (i) rehabilitation of
Gardabani, and (ii) the purchase of generating fuels. All costs and benefits were expressed in 1996 constant
prices. The economic flows are net of taxes, subsidies and depreciation. The 10% discount rate (12.5%
in nominal terms) used in the analysis corresponds to the opportunity cost of capital in Georgia.
2.      The "without project" scenario represents the continued operation of the plant in its current
condition, subject only to routine limited maintenance, and with continued deterioration of availability and
efficiency. The "with project" scenario represents rehabilitation and replacement of major components of
Unit No. 10 (300 MW), to restore it to its original design capacity and operational efficiency. Estimates
of average annual energy production for the two scenarios were deternined from the unit's characteristics
and operational parameters in each scenario.
A. Financial Evaluation
Gardabani Rehabilitation Component
3.      We discounted the costs and benefits of the "with project" scenario, measured as an increment over
the "without project" scenario, to 1996. The financial costs include investment and incremental operational
and maintenance costs (including a 0.11 % of indirect taxes and the allocation for depreciation), while the
financial benefits refer to the additional sales revenue made possible by the project. The project enables
an increment in generation due to: (i) restoration of the unit's capacity; (ii) improvement in plant
availability; and (iii) improvement in plant efficiency. The FNPV of the component is US$ 267 thousand
and the FRR is 10.1 percent. Table 8. 1 presents the summary results of the project's financial analysis.

4.       The sensitivity analysis examines maximum and minimum  changes in the cost and benefit streams
of the project and the resulting internal rates of return. The sensitivity shows that the project financial
profile is very sensitive to changes in the project parameters. Table 8.2 shows the assumed changes and
results of the financial sensitivity analysis.

B. Economic Evaluation
Gardabani Rehabilitation Component
6.       The economic costs include the investment and incremental production outlays net of taxes and
depreciation. The economic benefits are the value of the incremental energy production, and the increase
in consumer surplus -i.e., the avoided reduction in net user benefits associated to a higher tariff "without
the project." This arises from the fact that under cost recovery tariffs, tariffs would have to be raised in

average by 13.5 percent "without the project" to cover for the higher costs of supply costs. Given a price
elasticity of demand of -0.1, demand would decline by 1.2 percent without the project. We show the
summary economic analysis for Gardabani in Table 8.4. The ENPV of the component is US$ 48.0 million
and the ERR is 30.8 percent.

ERR would not drop below the 10 percent benchmark unless either investment costs increase by more than
1 1O percent, production costs increase above 20 percent, and savings decline below 15 percent. Consumer
surplus benefits are negligible.
