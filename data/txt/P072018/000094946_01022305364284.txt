EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This Environmental Assessment (EA) and Environmental Policy Framework Evaluation
(EPFE) have been prepared on behalf of the National Electric Power Authority of Nigeria
(NEPA) in support of project preparation for the Nigeria Power Transmission Project
(Project).  The report addresses potential environmental impacts arising from proposed
project investments, supported by evaluations of Nigerian environmental and resettlement
policy frameworks.
Under the Project, funds will be used to add new 330-132 kV and/or 132-33 kV
transformers and associated facilities at five existing substations located at Oshogbo, Kano,
Onitsha, Benin, and Alaoji. Additional funds will be used for capacity building within the
newly formed NEPA Environment, Resettlement and Social Unit (ERSU).
The Project has been screened by the World Bank as requiring a Category B
Environmental Assessment (EA), leading to preparation of this EA report according to
World Bank guidelines. In support of potential future electric-sector investment activity, a
standalone Environmental Policy Framework Evaluation was also prepared, and has been
presented as Appendix A. The objective of the EPFE report is to evaluate the national
policy, regulatory, and institutional capacity for managing the generic suite of issues
associated with transmission line development.
The following potential issues associated with substation upgrade or rehabilitation were
examined.
* Impacts to biological resources arising from  construction of new
facilities, including loss of habitats;
* Impacts to human resources arising from construction of new facilities,
including economic displacement and involuntary resettlement;
* Noise related to construction and operation of large transformers;

February 2001                            ES-2                                 003-2204
* Public and workplace health and safety associated with past management
practices at existing substations, including the use and disposal of PCB
containing transformer oils;
*  Contamination issues associated with ongoing management of facilities
constructed Project funding.
The Oshogbo, Kano, Onitsha, Benin, and Alaoji substations all have sufficient land within
existing fenced perimeters to accommodate the facilities proposed under the Project, and
no biological or social land use impacts are therefore anticipated as a result of project
activities.
The new transformer facilities will be located towards the center of the large
(approximately 30 hectare or larger) substation properties at all five sites. Continuous
noise levels, calculated using standardized equipment emission rates, will be on the order
of 46 dBA at the closest point to fenced property boundaries, which is comparable to the
45 dBA World Bank recommended standard for residential areas (nighttime), and well
within requirements for industrial areas. No residences or sensitive receptors were noted
in close proximity to the substation sites, so noise is not considered an issue for this
project.
No testing was performed to determine the presence or absence of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) in transmission cooling oils, oil-stained soils, or other media in the
five substations that were visited. Review of background literature and consultation with
manufacturers indicates that PCBs were phased out of manufacture and use in all countries
of the world at different dates during the 1970s and 1980s.  For the purpose of
characterizing environmental risk in this report, equipment manufactured in a country prior
to enactment of such legislation is assumed to contain PCB-containing transformer fluids.
Using this criterion, it is a conclusion of this report that leakage and uncontrolled disposal
of PCB-containing these criteria cooling oils has occurred at the Oshogbo and Onitsha
facilities, but not at the Kano, Benin, or Alaoji substations. Given the persistence of PCB

compounds in the environment, disturbance of contaminated soils during construction at
these sites presents a risk of PCB exposure to workers and substation personnel.
Mitigation measures proposed include the implementation of Phase I audits, including PCB
testing, at all five substations prior to construction design. If the presence of PCBs is
confirmed at a given substation during the Phase I investigation, a Phase II audit will then
be conducted to delineate the extent and concentration of contamination. The Phase II
audit results will allow development of construction plans for new facilities designed to
minimize disturbance of contaminated areas and therefore human exposure. Proposed
terms of reference and checklists for the Phase I audits are included as Appendix B.
Other issues encountered at the substations are related to an overall lack of environmental
management planning, with special regard to waste management and disposal. Proposed
mitigation actions include the development of site specific Environmental Management
Plans (EMP) as part of the Phase I audit scope. A summary table of contents for the EMP
is included as Appendix C.
Summary EA findings and proposed EMP activities are presented at the end of the text as
Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
As further described in the Environmental Policy Framework Evaluation (Attachment A),
Nigeria has a relatively mature environmental regulatory framework that requires
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of all new projects. The type of EIA prepared is
determined on the basis of a project description submitted to the Federal Ministry of
Environment (FME formerly known as the Federal Environmental Protection Agency),
which uses the description for screening purposes.  According to FME screening
guidelines, the substation renovations will likely be screened for a "CategoryII EIA,"
which is comparable to the World Bank CategoryB EA in its focus on environmental
management planning. It is therefore proposed that this report be submitted to FME for
comment and screening of the five substation renovation projects. Once Phase I audits are

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES OF THE ENVIRON-
MENTAL ASSESSMENT
This Environmental Assessment (EA) and appended Environmental Policy Framework
Evaluation (EPFE) have been prepared on behalf of the National Electric Power Authority
of Nigeria (NEPA), in support of project preparation for the Nigeria Power Transmission
Development Project (Project). The EA has two broad objectives.
The first EA objective is to identify key environmental impacts that could arise from
implementation of activities under the proposed Project, as well as to propose appropriate
environmental management options for the elimination, reduction, or mitigation of those
impacts. As described in further detail in Section 3.0, the Project will support the
renovation or upgrade of a several existing transmission line substations and associated
support facilities. No greenfield substation construction is contemplated under this phase
of the project. It is the understanding of NEPA that, given the proposed scope of activities
and associated issues, the World Bank has screened the Project for a Category B EA. The
report has been prepared according to the guidelines presented in OP4.01 and supporting
policies for this type of EA, as well as those of the government of Nigeria, as further
described in subsequent sections. The EA report on Project activities constitutes the main
body of this report.
The second EA objective is to evaluate national capacity to identify, quantify, and manage
the generic suite of issues associated with power sector development in support of future
project activities. This evaluation has been approached as a form of sectoral environmental
assessment, the results of which are attached as the EPFE report (Appendix A).
The approach for preparing the Category B EA of the Project activities can be summarized
as follows:
* Summarize key aspects of the policy, legal, and administrative
framework of both the World Bank and the Government of Nigeria as

related to the management of environmental quality in the electric
transmission subsector (Section 2.0). This summary will defer to a more
detailed analysis contained in the attached EPFE report (Appendix A).
*  Identify  key  activities and physical interventions of the Project
(Section 3.0).
*  Characterize existing environmental conditions at the sites of Project
activities, including contamination issues originating from historic
practices (Section 4.0).
*  Impacts arising from activities proposed under the Project (Section 5.0).
*  Propose an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) that provides for
the acquisition of additional data needed for validating EA conclusions,
mitigating  impacts  from  the  Project, and  monitoring  long-term
environmental quality (Section 6.0).

2.0 POLICY, LEGAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
The policy, legal, and administrative framework for environmental assessment for both the
government of Nigeria and the World Bank is the subject of detailed analysis in the
attached Environmental Policy Framework Evaluation (EPFE, Appendix A). Prepared as
a standalone deliverable in support of future investment activities in Nigeria's power
sector, the EPFE and the EA will be closely linked in any decision-making process
regarding environmental performance of the Project.
Given the level of detail in the EPFE, the corresponding Policy, Legal, and Administrative
Framework section of this EA will remain summary, referring to the former report's
detailed descriptions as needed.
2.1 Environmental Assessment in the Republic of Nigeria
Nigeria has relatively mature environmental regulatory framework that includes provisions
for environmental assessment, environmental audit, numerical environmental quality
standards, and enforcement.
Previously vested in a serious of sectoral policies and laws (e.g., the Forestry Law of 1978
and the Land Use Decree of 1978), responsibility for environmental quality in Nigeria was
consolidated under the authority of the Federal Ministry of Environment (FME). FME,
which was created under Decree No. 58 of 1988. Initially tasked with the development of
environmental quality standards for air, water, noise, and hazardous materials
management, FME was further authorized to request and review Environmental
Assessments of new projects, both public and private, under the provisions of Decree
No. 86 of 1992. Subsequent modifications to FME's authority also tasked the agency with
preparation of national policies on environmental protection, and environmental policy
inputs to the 5-year national development plans.

In addition to guidelines for EA preparation, Decree No. 86 also contains provisions for
the screening of projects according to impact potential, including an initial schedule of
activities for which mandatory EA preparation is required, and public disclosure of EA
findings. Subsequent procedural guideline publications by FME provide for screening
categories (1 to 3) that determine the type of EA report to be prepared, which in turn vary
in depth and scope of analysis as a function of project specific enviromnental risk. The
guidelines also call for environmental compliance monitoring as a follow-on activity to EA
review  and approval.  Classified as Infrastructure projects, electric generation and
transmission is an activity for which EA preparation is considered mandatory on all new
projects.
The national environmental legal and policy framework is the subject of a more detailed
description and comparative analysis in the Environmental Policy Framework Evaluation
report (Appendix A).
2.2 Environmental Assessment for World Bank Funded Projects
This section describes the Bank environmental assessment guidelines, standards, and
policies that may be applicable to the Nigerian Power Transmission Development Project.
As presented in the Bank's Operational Policy Note (OPN) 4.01, the information compiled
for an EA enables examination of a project's potential negative and positive environmental
impacts, comparison of these impacts with those of feasible alternatives, and
recommendation of measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for
adverse impacts and provide overall improvements in environmental quality. Additional
information on EA requirements of OPN 4.01 is presented in Appendix A.
2.2.1 World Bank Sectoral Guidelines
The World Bank views electric transmission lines as projects with a wide range of
environmental risk, depending on location and project size.  As described in the
1/0oo204/EAn204Final020502.doc  Gol der Associates



February 2001                         -5-                              003-2204
Environmental Assessment Sourcebook series (1990), impacts are principally associated
with the creation and maintenance of corridors, construction of the towers, and risk from
electromagnetic fields (EMF).  Small-capacity lines of short length that do not pass
through sensitive areas may not require a comprehensive EA, though larger capacity,
longer lines will trigger preparation of an EA. For these reasons, transmission lines often
are ranked as a Category B project, meaning that full environmental assessment may not be
required, and that the depth of analysis called for in individual terms of reference can vary
according to anticipated impacts. Additional discussion of Bank sectoral guidelines is
presented in Appendix A.
2.2.2 World Bank Cross Sectoral Policies
The World Bank maintains the following cross-sectoral "safeguard" policies of relevance
to this project.
* Operational Policy (OP) 4.04 Natural Habitats;
* Operational Directive (OD) 4.30 Involuntary Resettlement (to be
converted to OD 4.30);
* OD 4.20 Indigenous Peoples;
* Operational Policy/Best Practice/Good Practice (OP/BP/GP) No. 11.03
Management of Cultural Property in Bank-Financed Projects;
* OP 11.02 Wildlands.
Additional descriptive information on these policies is presented in Attachment A.
2.2.3 World Bank Numerical Standards
The Bank's Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook (1998; "Handbook') provides
detailed requirements for general and sector-specific control of pollution, including

numerical ambient, emission, and effluent standards for all major contaminants. The
Handbook presents standards on a sector basis, but the values are generally similar across
the sectoral lines. Of relevance to this project, the Handbook calls for a maximum sound
level of 45 and 55 A-weighted dB (nighttime and daytime periods, respectively) for
residential, educational, and institutional land uses, and 70 A-weighted dB for industrial
areas, measured at the property boundary.

3.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Nigeria Transmission Development Project seeks to redress certain network
deficiencies and operational constraints of the Nigerian power transmission system.
Redressing network deficiencies will allow the efficient dispatch and transmission of the
additional expected power resulting from the emergency and longer term measures now
being taken to increase generation availability.  The Project proposes an IDA loan
separated into an Investment component of US$ 55.44 million, a Technical Assistance
component of US$ 4.88 million, and a Social and Environmental component of
US$ 1.15 million.
3.1 Project Investment Component 1
Under this project investment component, $55.4 million dollars will be provided over the
period from 2001 through 2003 to support the following activities.
hmprovements at five main grid substations: Onitsha, Kano, Osogbo,
Alaoji and Benin; and grid system reactive compensation;
: Installation of grid system metering at 132 kV to enable the
measurement of power supplied to unbundled distribution companies;
* Establishment of a new National Control Center (NCC) with
SCADA/EMS facilities and associated communications requirements.
The first of these three subcomponent activities were the focus of attention during EA
development.  The five main grid substations and proposed investment activities include
the following.
P Oshogbo Substation:  This substation will be augmented by one
150 MVA 330/132 kV transformer and associated 330 and 132 kV
bays.

technical information is available other than presented in this report. Descriptions of these
substations are presented in Section 4.0, based on observations made during
reconnaissance visits by the Golder-NEPA team.

established.  Under this environment and social component, funds will be provided to
establish the ERSU and for staff training and capacity-building.  Once established, the
ERSU will have responsibility for monitoring and evaluation of Project environment and
social activities, and for preparing, with the assistance of consultants when necessary, EIA
and EMPs, and Resettlement assessments and action plans for subsequent phases of the
APL. Apart from the project related work, ERSU will cover the whole TransysCo. The
scope of ERSU's work under the Project also includes designing and supervising the
Phase 1 environmental audits to determine the need for remediation actions if past waste
disposal methods are found to have resulted in PCB contamination of soil at the
substations.

4.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
Transmission line substations are found throughout Nigeria, occurring in all of the major
climate and life zones of the country. However, the five substations slated for Project
investment activities are located in urban/industrial areas. None of the proposed substation
renovation projects will entail expansion of an existing substation fenced perimeter
conversion of land to new use. At the time of EA preparation, the substations slated for
investment activity consisted of the following sites.
4.1 Oshogbo Substation
The Oshogbo Substation was visited by members of the NEPA-Golder environmental
assessment team on November 16, 2000. This facility is located in Osun State, Western
Highlands geographic region, and was constructed in 1968 on land adjoining the National
Control Center, just west of the city of Oshogbo. Originally covered with dry deciduous
forest, Osun State is now almost entirely converted to agriculture and urban areas.
4.1.1 Property Description
The substation property is enclosed by a 2-meter high fence of concrete block construction,
providing controlled access. No site plans of the property or any equipment were available
at the time of the reconnaissance visit. Site surface area was visually estimated to be
around 30 hectares, of which more than one-half was unoccupied. Areas in active use
were topped with coarse gravel. Land surrounding the substation is unoccupied, and
covered with a low, dense growth of secondary vegetation. No residences or agricultural
activities were observed within the immediate vicinity of the substation boundary.

4.1.2 Existing Facilities
The facilities at the Oshogbo station included the following key components.
* A single 150 MVA 330-132 kV ASGEN (Italian) transformer
manufactured in 1968;
* A  single 150 MVA  330-132 kV Mitsubishi (Japanese) transformer
manufactured in 1974 (Photo 1);
* A shunt reactor (ASGEN) manufactured in 1968 (Photo 1);
* Circuit breakers and switches associated with 6 incoming 330 kV lines
and 8 outgoing 132 lines;
* Control room, offices and maintenance shops;
* Salvage yard for used equipment and materials.
4.1.3 Existing Environmental Management Issues
Interview of site management staff was conducted during the site reconnaissance. Though
the property and equipment appeared orderly and well maintained, management staff
indicated that no formal environmental management is currently practiced at the Oshogbo
station.
As related to substation environmental issues (i.e., other than employee health and safety),
the historic impacts generated by the lack of formal environmental management planning
are principally related to waste generation and disposal. No records are maintained related
to the disposal of wastes, principally spent oil from circuit breakers, and used equipment is
stored onsite in a designated salvage yard (Photo 4). Estimates of waste transformer oil
generated were on the order of four drums (55 US gallon) per year, all originating with the
replacement of carbonized circuit breaker oil.   All replacement oils are mineral
(i.e., non-PCB) as further evidenced by labels of empty drums stored onsite. Transformer

cooling oils are not subject to high voltage arcing and carbonization, and are periodically
reconditioned in situ to lower moisture content. Transformers and the shunt reactor were
reportedly filled at commissioning, and no replacement oil is added.  As such, the
transformers do not generate significant waste streams of used oil during normal course of
operations (i.e., tap changers and circuit breakers mounted on the transformer may
contribute to the estimated four barrels annually). Spent oil is reportedly used for weed
control within the property boundary, and empty drums are stored onsite (Photo 5).
Heavy surface staining was observed around the base of shunt reactor at Oshogbo,
extending approximately 10 meters from  the base of the structure.  According to
management staff, the oil spillage occurred over a period of several years due to a fracture
in the reactor's cooling oil containment vessel, which was finally repaired in 1991.
Estimates of the total quantity of lost transformer oil were on the magnitude of 200 barrels.
A used ASGEN 150 MVA transformer was observed in the scrap yard, of identical make
as the one in active service Photo 4. This equipment was reportedly decommissioned in
1974, and replaced with the Mitsubishi reactor currently in service. The transformer was
likely drained of cooling oil prior to it's movement to the existing site, and no information
was available on the fate of the 13,450 gallons (imperial = 52,455 liters, or 953 drums)
originally contained in the cooling circuit, per information on the data plate.
The use of PCBs in cooling oils was phased out in Japan by decree in 1972 (Bruce
Congalton, Mitsubishi Electric Power Products Inc., personal communication), and the
equipment used onsite was originally filled with mineral oil. However, similar Italian
legislation was passed in 1988 (DPR 216/88), well after the manufacture date of the
ASGEN equipment. The ASGEN company no longer manufactures transformers, and
representatives could not be reached for comment.

4.2 Kano Substation
The Kano Substation is located in Kano State of the North Central Highlands geographic
region. Originally characterized by arid savannah vegetation, the majority of Kano State
has long been converted to dryland cultivation of millet and maize or pasturelands.
4.2.1 Property Description
The approximately 30-hectare area occupied by the Kano Substation is located on the
northwest edge of the city of Kano, state capital, second largest city in the country and the
site of extensive commercial and manufacturing development.  The substation was
constructed in 1977 on property now enclosed by a 2-meter high fence of concrete block
construction, providing controlled access. No site plans of the property or any equipment
schematic layouts were available at the time of the reconnaissance visit. Site surface area
was visually estimated to be the same as the Oshogbo station (i.e., around 30 hectares), of
which more than one-half is unoccupied and cleared of vegetation (Photo 7). Areas in
active use were topped with coarse gravel.
Land immediately surrounding the substation (i.e., within 100 meters) is unoccupied,
though villages are clustered in fairly high density along the access road. No agricultural
activity was observed within the immediate vicinity of the substation boundary.
The areas containing the transformers and circuit breakers areas are located towards the
property center, at least 150 meters from the closest point of the perimeter wall.

4.2.2 Existing Facilities
The facilities at the Kano Substation include the following key components.
* Two 150 MVA 330-132 kV Mitsubishi transformers, manufactured in
1977 (Photo 6);
* A Mitsubishi shunt reactor manufactured in 1977 (Photo 6);
* Circuit breakers and switches associated with 2 incoming 330 kV lines
and 6 outgoing 132 lines;
* A trailer-mounted 132-33 substation;
' Control room, offices and maintenance shops.
4.2.3 Existing Environmental Mpaena ent Issues
Interview of the substation Assistant General Manager and the maintenance manager was
conducted during the site reconnaissance. The property and equipment generally appear to
be well maintained. As with other substations visited, the management staff indicated that
no formal environmental management is currently practiced.
As related to substation environmental issues (i.e., other than employee health and safety,
not addressed in this report), the historic impacts generated by the lack of formal
environmental management planning are principally related to waste generation and
disposal. No records are maintained related to the disposal of wastes, principally spent oil
from circuit breakers, estimated at 40 to 50 drums per year. Carbonized transformer oil is
used to control weeds on the property, which is the disposal method for the entire volume
generated. Perhaps due to good maintenance, or the relatively young age of the station,
used equipment consisted only of one spent circuit breaker and a replacement tap changer
for one of the 150 MVA transformers.

As described in Section 4.1.3, PCB-containing compounds were phased out in Japan
beginning in 1972, and the type of equipment used in the Kano substation was designed to
use mineral oil (Bruce Congalton, Mitsubishi Electric Power Products Inc., personal
communication). Pending confirmation testing during the Phase I audits recommended
prior to construction (see Section 6.1), the presence of PCBs on site is therefore regarded
as highly unlikely.
4.3 Onitsha Substation
The Onitsha substation is located in Anambra State, within the Eastern Scarplands
Geographic Region. Originally covered with the Guinea Savannah vegetation community,
the region has largely been cleared for agriculture or human settlement, as is the case with
most of the Nigerian national territory.
4.3.1 Property Description
Constructed in 1968 the Onitsha substation is located in an area of relatively dense urban
development of the city of Onitsha. As with other substations of similar capacity, the
approximate surface area is 30 hectares, enclosed by a 2-meter high cinderblock wall that
provides controlled access.   The working portion (approximately one-half) of the
substation property is topped with coarse gravel, and the rest occupied by a low cover of
weedy vegetation. Land use immediately outside the perimeter wall is residential.
Operational components of the facility (i.e., transformers and associated equipment) are
located towards the center of the property, with a distance estimated at 150 meters to the
nearest point on the perimeter wall.
A system of concrete gutters collects surface water runoff from the active areas of the
substation for open discharge offsite.

4.3.2 Existing Facilities
The facilities at the Kano Substation include the following key components.
* One 90 MVA 330-132 kV ASGEN transformer, manufactured in 1968;
* One 90 MVA 330-132 kV Mitsubishi transformers, manufactured in
1975;
* (shunt reactor);
* One 60 MVA 132-33 kV Hyundai transformer, manufactured in 1982;
* One 60 MVA 132-33 kV Mitsubishi transformer, manufactured in 1978;
* One 60 MVA 132-33 kV Trafo-Union transformer, manufactured in
1973;
* Circuit breakers and switches associated with incoming 330 kV lines and
outgoing 132 kV lines;
* Control room, offices and maintenance shops;
* Used equipment scrap yard.
4.3.3 Existing Environmental Management Issues
Consistent with the other two substations, the primary existing environmental issue arises
from historic and ongoing lack of environmental management of the site. No plan exists
for the disposal of domestic or process wastes, which are again largely comprised of
transformer oils, presumably in the same volumes as the Oshogbo and Kano facilities
(40 to 50 drums per year from  routine maintenance).  In keeping with maintenance
practices on other substations, transformer cooling oil is reconditioned in situ, contributing
little to the waste stream, except in the case of catastrophic spillage or disposal of an entire
load of oil upon transformer decommissioning. Some oily surface staining was observed,
though not as heavy as in the case of the Oshogbo Substation.

February 2001                        -17-                              003-2204
A used ASGEN 150 MVA transformer was observed in the scrap yard, of identical make
to the one observed at the Oshogbo facility.   This equipment was reportedly
decommissioned in 1975, and replaced with the Mitsubishi reactor currently in service.
The transformer was likely drained of cooling oil prior to it's movement to the existing
site, and no information was available on the fate of the 13,450 gallons
(imperial = 52,455 liters, or 953 drums) originally contained in the cooling circuit.
For reasons provided in Section 4.1.3, it must be presumed that the ASGEN equipment
was originally commissioned using PCB-containing cooling oil that was still present upon
decommissioning. Though no staining was observed of the magnitude found at Oshogbo,
no records were kept to document the fate of the oil contained in the decommissioned
transformer, as well as of those quantities generated through routine maintenance of the
ASGEN equipment. It may be presumed that spilled oil was left on the surface, and other
quantities disposed of either through weed control or hauling offsite.
4.4 Benin Substation
The 330/132/33 kV Benin Substation is located in Edo state in the Eastern Scarplands
Geographic Region. Originally covered with Guinea Savannah vegetation community, the
region has largely been cleared for agriculture or human settlement, as is the case with the
other substations, and indeed most of the Nigerian national territory.
4.4.1 Property Description
Located on Sapele Road in the central part of Benin City, this boundary fence of this
facility is surrounded by urban development. As with the other substations, the Benin
facility is fenced and access is controlled. The majority of the approximately 30-hectare
property is topped with gravel, with a sparse cover of weedy vegetation elsewhere.

Existing transformer and switch equipment is located towards the center of the site, with
no human habitation or activity on the unoccupied sections.
4.4.2 Existing Facilities
Existing equipment at the Benin substation includes the following key components.
* One 150 MVA 330-132 kV Mitsubishi transformer, manufactured in
1977;
* One 60 MVA 132/33 kV Mitsubishi transformer, manufactured in 1977;
K One 60 MVA 132/33 kV Mitsubishi transformer, manufactured in 1996;
One 45 MVA 132/33 kV Mitsubishi transformer, manufactured in 1982;
* One 30 MVA 132/33 kV Mitsubishi transformer, manufactured in 1986;
* Circuit breakers and switches associated with incoming 330 and
outgoing 132 or 33 kV transmission lines;
* Control room, offices and maintenance shops.
In addition to active equipment, various spent components and used oil drums were
scattered about the site.
4.4.3 Existing Environmental Management Issues
Unlike the Onitsha and Oshogbo facilities, all equipment at the Benin station, including
spent or discarded gear, post-dates the use of PCB-containing cooling oils, and no PCB
contamination issues are believed to exist.  As is the common practice with other
substations visited by the NEPA-ERSU team, there appears to be no environmental
management planning for the site. Used transformer oils are disposed of on-site, often as
weed control, and areas of heavy surface staining were noticeable. Spent equipment,

empty drums and other solid waste is apparently abandoned in situ, with no organized
storage or long-term plan for disposal. Runoff is collected in a series of shallow surface
channels, where it is directed into offsite drainage features. No material use or waste
disposal records are kept onsite, and no estimated volumes were available for major waste
streams.
4.5 Alaoji Substation
The 330/132 kV Alaoji substation, located on the outskirts of the Alaoji Aba township.
4.5.1 Property Description
The Alaoji substation property is by appearance larger than the other fourbeing proposed
for Project funding (no property measurements were available).  Active equipment
occupies approximately one-third of the site, on the graveled one-half of the property. The
entire property is enclosed by fence, with controlled access and no existing land use on the
non-active portions. No groundwater wells were observed in the immediate vicinity of the
substation property, which contains a scattering of residences and other structures.
4.5.2 Existing Facilities
The Alaoji substation has the following key components.
* Two 330-132 kV transformers oflSO MVA capacity, manufactured by
Mitsubishi in 1978;
* Circuit breakers associated with incoming 330 and outgoing 132 kV
transmission lines;
* Control rooms, maintenance buildings and offices.
The grounds are relatively free of used equipment and solid wastes.

4.5.3 Existing Environmental Management Issues
The two 150 MVA transformers were manufactured after the legislated phase out date for
PCB compounds in Japan, such that this form of contamination is likely not an issue. As
with other substation facilities examined during the EA field visits, no environmental
management planning is practiced at the facility, and waste streams are neither quantified,
tracked or disposed of in a systematic manner. Less evidence of oil spillage could be
observed at this site as compared to the other four facilities planned for investment under
the Project activity.

5.0 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF APL-1 ACTIVITES
Potential issues that may be generically associated with the construction and operation of
new substation facilities of the capacity proposed under the Project are summarized below.
> Conversion of land to accommodate equipment needed for expanded
capacity, with impacts arising potentially arising from loss of natural
habitat and involuntary/economic displacement of residents;
* Noise emissions from transformers;
' Exposure of personnel to hazardous wastes, including PCBs, during
construction-related disturbance of contaminated soils;
> Future contamination of soil and water from inadequate waste disposal,
resulting from environmental management planning.
A description of each facility is provided above, and potential environmental issues are
summarized below as well as in Table 1.
5.1 Conversion of Land
All new installed transformer capacity proposed under the Project will take place within
existing property boundaries of the five substations that were visited. Land use within
these properties has been dedicated for substation purposes for periods from 34 to
43 years, and is fenced so as to allow controlled access. Approximately one-third to
one-half of the 30+ hectare surface area of all substations is now occupied by active
equipment. Each substation manager was interviewed during site reconnaissance visits
regarding potential expansion areas, and sufficient land to accommodate the equipment
described in Section 3.0 could be readily identified in each case. Vegetation control is
practiced on land within site boundaries presently unoccupied by active equipment, and no
human use or transit of those sites occurs.

In conclusion, there will be no impacts to existing ecological or socio-economic land uses
caused by land use conversion arising from activities proposed under the APL-1 phase of
the Project.
5.2 Noise Emissions from Transformers
5.2.1 Construction Noise
Construction noise will originate during the operation of heavy equipment used for earth
leveling and transportation, including bulldozers, excavators and cement mixers, which
have acoustic power levels of 90 to 130 dBA. Construction noise levels are typically
intermittent and temporary in duration.
Operational noise from substations can be emitted by equipment operation and circulating
cooling water. Equipment in the substation that creates audible noise includes cooling air
fans, main transformer cooling fans, and main transformer oil circulation.
Ambient sound level measurements were not made during the reconnaissance visits.
However, the substations are located on the fringes of major urban developments, and
ambient noise observed during visits was restricted to the existing emissions from
transformers.
As described in Attachment A, the GON has standards governing maximum ambient noise
that provide maximum sound levels that range from 90 A-weighted dB for an 8-hour
exposure to 115 A-weighted dB for 15-minute exposures. The World Bank guidelines call
for a maximum sound level of 45 and 55 A-weighted dB (nighttime and daytime periods,
respectively) for residential, educational and institutional land uses, and 70A-weighted dB
for industrial areas. These sound levels are to be measured at the property boundary to
determine guideline compliance
l/00/2204/EAM2204Final020502.doc  Golder Associates



February 2001                         -23-                              003-2204
The following analysis was conducted to evaluate potential noise issues arising from
construction and operation of the new 150 MVA 330-132 kV transformer facilities at the
five substation sites.
Sound levels generated by electrical transformers are a function of its power rating, in
MVA, and are described in the Edison Electric Institute's (EEI) "Electric Power Plant
Environmental Noise Guide," which was the reference used in this analysis.  The
algorithms provided in the EEI document were applied for 0 to the largest transformer size
of those found at the five substations, the 150 MVA transformers at the Kano facility. The
sound power level for this equipment, on a continuous basis, is calculated to be 94dB.
The sound power level for the 60 MVA transformers at the same substation is calculated to
be 92 A-weighted dB.
Using the EEI sound power levels for the two 150 MVA and three 60 MVA transformers
at the Kano Substation and the wave divergence propagation routine (i.e., sound levels
generated by a source decreases as a function of distance), the overall predicted sound
level impacts to the nearest property boundary (minimum 200 meters) would be
approximately 46 A-weighted dB. This predicted sound level impact does not take into
account any additional path-specific sound-attenuating benefits, such as vegetative cover,
shrubs, etc. Given this fact, the operational impacts of the new transformers at all of the
five substations proposed for Project investment will most likely comply with the World
Bank noise guidelines for residential, educational, and institutional land uses.
5.3 Exposure of Personnel to PCB-Contaminated Soils
As described in Section 4.0, there is a very high likelihood that PCB-contaminated soils
are present on the Oshogbo and Onitsha sites. Though no field analysis was conducted
during the reconnaissance visits to confirm the presence of PCBs, the ASGEN equipment
was manufactured and commissioned well over a decade prior to these compounds being
phased out in Italy, the country of origin. Furthermore, an extensive spill of transformer

February 2001                            -24-                                003-2204
oil from the shunt reactor at Oshogbo was observed, the fate of nearly 1,000barrels of oil
from the decommissioned ASGEN transformers at Oshogbo and Onitsha is not
documented, and historic practice has been to dispose of used oils by land application for
weed control.
5.3.1 Background
Not manufactured in any country since 1977, PCBs (i.e., there are over 200isomers and
compounds) were widely used in a number of industrial applications up until that year.
Because of their insulating properties, chemical stability and relative inflammability, they
have been found to be particularly useful as coolants, where the standard concentration in
transformer oil was 500 ppm.
T-he compounds are known to cause chronic reproductive effects, gastric disorders and skin
lesions in laboratory animals, which is the basis of their having been listed by the USEPA
as a probable human carcinogen.   The compounds are further suspected of being
environmental estrogens (i.e., mimicking the effects of the natural hormone estrogen on
the body)'. For these reasons, the compounds have been phased out for all industrial uses
worldwide, and are subject to remediation and treatment as hazardous waste under the
regulatory frameworks of most industrialized countries.
5.3.2 PCB Risk at the Oshogbo and Onitsha Substations
PCB compounds are highly water insoluble, a property that also results in adsorption to
organic materials in sediments and soils.  PCBs are also highly persistent in the
environment, with a half-life of several years in soils2. Though water insoluble, PCBs can
be mobilized in soils if light organic solvents (e.g., gasoline, degreasers and cleaners) are

spilled on the contaminated sites, which could reach groundwater bearing a load of
solubilized PCBs.
If land applied within the property boundary, either for weed control or convenient
disposal, the PCBs from waste oil at the Onitsha and Oshogbo substations will still be
present in the near-surface soils in high concentration. Bulldozing, leveling, and other
disturbance of contaminated soils during construction of new facilities may result in
exposure of workers, or nearby residents via skin contact, inhalation of PCBs adsorbed to
organic material in dust particles, and transport by surface runoff of construction site
sediments.
Finally, decommissioned equipment and materials at the substation sites, including
breakers, transformers and empty drums, are potentially hazardous if PCB compounds
were ever in use during active life. Exposure from these sources would depend entirely on
how the materials were disposed of. No plan exists at the present time for further action
with any of these materials.
The presence or absence of PCBs is readily determined in the field using test kits. These
kits contain reactive compounds, and are not allowed upon commercial aircraft, making
their importation to a country like Nigeria difficult.  However, importation can be
arranged within the time frame of project implementation, and their use will be an integral
part of Phase I site audits recommended as part of pre-construction activity (Section 6.0).
5.4 Lack of Environmental Management Planning
Aside from the issue of PCBs, the waste management practices at all five substations
present an ongoing environmental issue. Though lacking the toxicity of PCBs, transformer
mineral oil is nonetheless a potential pollutant, and the absence of appropriate disposal
techniques could lead to additional contamination from maintenance of transformers
acquired under the Project. The absence of disposal guidelines for smaller amounts of

waste generated through equipment and vehicle maintenance likewise constitutes an
environmental issue that will increase as substation capacity is expanded. Measures for
addressing these issues are also presented in Section 6.0.

6.0 ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN
The basic components of the Environmental Action Plan (EAP) are as follows.
* Supplementary Data Needs or Analysis;
* Impact Mitigation;
* Site Environnemental Management Planning;
* Institutional Arrangements and Strengthening.
Each of these components is addressed in the following sections, and is summarized in
Table 2.  Costs of EAP actions are presented as part of the Environmental Policy
Framework Evaluation report (Appendix A).
6.1 Supplementary Data Needs or Analysis
This component addresses any data or analysis needed to validate the key conclusions of
the EA, but which were either not practical at the time of EA preparation, or critical for
reaching a decision about the project's potential impacts or the feasibility of their
mitigation. In the case of the Project, the primary post-EA data collection and analysis
consists of environmental audits, to be performed on each facility during the development
of construction engineering plans. These audits will validate the presence or absence of
historical contamination issues that may need to be addressed prior to final construction
design. The audit terms of reference will also call for will also call for the preparation of
site-specific environmental management plans to address ongoing environmental issues as
well as monitoring.

6.1.1 Phase I Audit
The initial round of audits will be Phase 1, consisting principally of site inspections, record
review, and interviews, to be conducted according to ASTM standards by a qualified
environmental consulting firm. A checklist of potential issues will be prepared using the
findings of the Project EA, supplemented by standard sectoral checklists. A summary
outline of environmental audit guidelines is presented as Table 3. Comprehensive Phase I
environmental audit guidelines and a checklist for substations are presented in Appendix C,
and will be used for preparing Phase I bid documents. For budgeting purposes, it is
assumed that all substations will be the subject of Phase 1 audit activities.
6.1.2 Phase 2 Audit
It is anticipated that the results of the Phase 1 audits will indicate that some sites require
further investigation and characterization, to be implemented through a Phase 2 audit
process. The product of the Phase 2 audit will be a site-specific plan that will include
approaches to minimize risks arising from disturbance of contaminated soils during
construction of new facilities under the Project. For budgeting purposes, it is assumed a
Phase 2 analysis will be needed at the Oshogbo and Onitsha substation sites due to the
likely presence of PCB-contaminated soils on the property.
6.2 Environmental Impact Mitigation
6.2.1 Noise Impacts
Construction activities will be limited to daylight hours so as to minimize impacts on any
residential areas.

6.2.2 Exposure to PCBs During Construction
A final construction plan will be developed based upon results from the Phases I and II
audits, if it is determined that PCBs are present in a concentration sufficient to pose risk to
onsite or offsite human health. Elements of exposure minimization that may be included
are summarized below.
* Delineation of the extent and concentration of soil contamination, and
establishing the new construction footprint to avoid disturbance of those
areas;
> Water application for dust suppression during grading and excavation;
S Sediment and erosion control measures to prevent runoff of
unconsolidated, contaminated soils;
- Respiratory and skin protection;
* Removal of contaminated soils.
Removal of contaminated soils to an offsite location is predicated on the existence of a
proper disposal facility. PCBs are tolerant of very high temperatures, and if incompletely
combusted will produce dioxin-contaminated emissions, a problem even more serious than
the original. Identification of waste disposal facilities will take place during construction
management planning.
6.3 Enviromnental Management Planning
The environmental impacts associated with the lack of standard operating procedures
would be best addressed by establishing a systematic EMP for each of the substations.
EMPs identify activities with potential environmental impacts, describe methods to
mitigate and monitor those impacts, identify persons responsible for implementing the
elements of the plan and appropriate training for those individuals, and prescribe a

schedule and cost estimate for implementation. For example, specific activities which
could be included in the EMPs are implementing a waste management program for the
transformer maintenance operations.
An outline for an EMP is provided in Appendix C; the elements of the EMP are
summarized below.
6.3.1 Environmental Management Plan Summary
This summary of an EMP is based on draft World Bank guidance published in May 1996
(World Bank BP 4.01 Annex C). It is important to note that the following elements must
be applied to each identified potential impact.
Mitigation
The EMP will identify and summarize all anticipated significant adverse environmental
impacts from site activities, including socioeconomic impacts. For the electric sector
facilities, these issues include, at a minimum, air emissions, fuel and oil handling, solid
and hazardous waste management, and wastewater management. Mitigation measures to
minimize environmental impacts should be identified. The mitigation measures should be
related to the type of impact to which it relates, and the conditions under which it is
required (i.e., continuous, periodic, or in the event of contingencies). Designs, equipment
descriptions, and operating procedures should be specified.
Monitoring
Environmental monitoring of affected media must be performed to measure the
environmental impacts of the site activities and the effectiveness of the mitigation
measures. The EMP should provide a description of the monitoring measures, including
parameters to be monitored, methods to be used, sampling locations, frequency of

February 2001                          -31-                                003-2204
measurements, detection limits, and thresholds for corrective action. Monitoring and
reporting procedures should be identified to ensure early detection of conditions that
necessitate corrective actions, and provide information on the progress and results of
mitigation.
For the Nigerian power sector, environmental media to be monitored include air,
wastewater, surface water, and groundwater. Parameters monitored should be appropriate
for the media and source. For example, long-term air monitoring is necessary for the
power parks, periodic personal air monitoring for worker health and safety purposes may
be appropriate for the operations centers, and air monitoring is likely not necessary for the
substations.  Similarly, petroleum  hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds are
appropriate parameters to be monitored in stormwater discharges from all facilities.
For each environmental media, ambient conditions should be established to the extent
feasible. Given the number of other potential sources for environmental contamination of
these media, it is likely not possible to determine "unimpacted' conditions. Accordingly,
monitoring points at the upwind, upstream, or upgradient portion of the property boundary
are likely necessary to determine media quality at the point of entry to the site. Similarly,
point of compliance monitoring locations must be established to determine media quality at
the point of exit from  the facility.  Given the variability of media flow  direction
(e.g., wind direction), multiple entry and exit monitoring points are likely necessary. A
comparison of data from the entry and exit points will establish the net impact from the
site.
Monitoring locations are also likely required at specific discharge sources, such as
wastewater outfalls and power plant stacks. Depending upon the environmental media,
off-site monitoring locations may be necessary to measure impacts distant from the facility.
For example, air monitoring locations may be required several kilometers from a power
park stack.

6.3.2 Institutional Arrangements and Strengthening
As referenced in Section 3.3, NEPA environmental management capability will be greatly
strengthened with the creation of the Environmental and Social Review Unit (ESRU).
NEPA's traditional focus has been on the management of impacts arising from involuntary
resettlement associated with hydropower development, and little institutional capability or
experience exists with EIA, audit, and compliance. With Project support, the ERSU will
be strengthened so as to manage environmental issues of an expanded transmission sub-
sector.
Though the organization of the ERSU is still underway, it will likely have administrative
divisions responsible for EIA of new projects, management and compliance of existing
projects, as well as resettlement planning functions.
A number of activities will be implemented with Project support to strengthen individual
professional capabilities for managing power sector environmental issues, as summarized
below.
- Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) training, to enable ESRU staff
to prepare TORs for bid and oversee preparation and agency approval of
EIA on sectoral projects;
* Environmental Management Plan (EMP) training, to enable ESRU staff
to work with NEPA facility managers in the preparation and
implementation of site specific environmental management activities;
* Environmental audit training, to enable ESRU staff to prepare TORs for
bid, oversee implementation of and interpret results of audits related
ongoing compliance of NEPA facilities;
* ESRU staff study tours to visit Transmission sub-sector environmental
management agencies in other countries;
* Development of a geographical information system (GIS) capability in
order to organize and apply data of relevance to environmental issues in
the transmission subsector.

Training in environmental assessment, environmental management planning, and
environmental audit will be an early Project priority, since the ERSU staff will be
responsible for oversight of the substation audits, development of appropriate mitigation
activities, and support of individual project EIA with FME.
Further description and costs of institutional strengthening activities are presented in

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES
Golder Associates Inc. has prepared this Environmental Policy Framework Review (EPFR)
of the Nigeria Power Transmission Project (Project) on behalf of, and in collaboration with
professional staff of the Nigerian Electric Power Authority (NEPA).  The report is
intended to address potential environmental issues associated with future investment
activities under any subsequent project phases not yet scheduled for implementation; as
well as any private sector investment enabled by the proposed restructuring and
rehabilitation of the transmission subsector under the Project.  Specific environmental
impacts, mitigation and monitoring measures associated with these future projects will be
identified through the national environmental assessment process, with oversight from the
newly formed Environment, Resettlement and Social Unit of NEPA.
The purpose of this EPFR is therefore to assure that the government of Nigeria and NEPA
have, or will develop, the requisite legal and institutional capability to address
environmental issues, including preparation of Environmental Assessments, arising from
future investment activities planned by the project. This EPFR report was based on
interview of key Government of Nigeria (GON) and NEPA staff, as well as review of
environmental legislation and policies.
The EPFR report has the following objectives and organization.
* Summary of the types of future investment projects (Section 2.0), as
well as environmental and social issues associated with their
implementation (Section 3.0);
> Preparation of a summary comparison of World Bank and Nigerian
environmental laws, policies, and standards (Section 4.0), with
particular emphasis on the latter's provisions for environmental
assessment and associated activities such as public participation and
environmental management planning;
* Recommendations on policy and institutional strengthening actions as
needed to address issues (Section 5.0);

* Estimated costs and timing for all policy and institutional strengthening
actions, including training, provision of equipment and materials, and
funding (Section 6.0).
It should be noted that national policy and capacity regarding involuntary resettlement, the
key issue most often associated with transmission lines, has been the subject of an
evaluation and report prepared under separate terms of reference (Appendix B).
Conclusions and key recommendations from the resettlement policy assessment are
incorporated into the findings of this EPFE report.

2.0 DESCRIPTION OF POTENTIAL FUTURE INVESTMENT
ACTIVITIES
The Project purpose is to improve Nigeria's electric power sector performance,
specifically in the transmission sub-sector. The following investment activities will be
undertaken during the current Project.
* Removal of existing constraints to power transmission by rehabilitation
and upgrade of existing systems;
* Facilitating the development of a new transmission company, by
enabling private participation in existing and expanded transmission;
* Development of regulations specific to the operation of a restructured
transmission sub-sector.
At the time of EPFR preparation, the following activities are envisioned as potential future
investment activities.
: Optical fibre project: Phase II;
- New SCADA/EMS system for NCC (Oshogbo);
' Alaoji - Umahia 132kV D.C. line (125 kIn);
* Umahia 132kV substation;
* Benin - Onitsha second 330kV line (137km);
* Alaoji - Enugu 330kV S.C. line (175 kin);
* Enugu 330kV Substation (expansion);
* Onitsha - Nnewi 132kV line (25 km);
* Nnewi 132kV Substation;
* Makurdi - Yandev - Wukari 132 kv S.C. line (184 kim);

* Yandev 132kV Substation;
* Wukari 132kV Substation.
If fully implemented, this investment list would entail 312 km of 330 kV capacity and
276 km of 132 kV capacity transmission line. It is not known at this time if these new
lines could be co-located along existing transmission line rights of way, or if new corridors
must be identified.  This uncertainty is the rationale for this assessment of GON
institutional capacity for conducting environmental assessments of new transmission line
projects.

3.0 POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH
FUTURE INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
A generic suite of issues is associated with the development of new transmission lines, as
described below.
* Impacts to human populations located in future transmission line rights
of way. These impacts may include (i) the involuntary restriction of
access to legally designated parks and protected areas results in adverse
impacts on the livelihood of the displaced persons; or (ii) the involuntary
taking of land and other assets resulting in:
* relocation or loss of shelter; or
- loss of assets or access to assets; or
* loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the
affected persons must move to another location.
* Potential public safety issues arising either from the innate hazard of
high-voltage lines, exposure to electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation, or
aircraft collisions;
* Potential direct conversion of natural habitats for use as transmission line
corridors and rights-of-way;
* Increased access to vulnerable natural areas as a result of transmission
line and access road construction and maintenance (i.e., induced
development);
* Potential exposure of human populations to EMF radiation;
* Noise generation by substation transformer equipment.

4.0 ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, LEGAL, AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK FOR NIGERIA AND THE WORLD BANK
This section presents summary descriptions and comparison of both the Government of
Nigeria and World Bank environmental policies and guidelines.
4.1 Environmental Policy and Regulatory Framework for Nigeria
Nigeria has a mature environmental regulatory framework relative to other countries on the
African continent, and which includes provisions for environmental assessment,
environmental audit, numerical environmental quality standards and enforcement.
4. 1. 1 Creation of the Federal Ministry of Environment
Previously vested in a serious of sectoral policies and laws (e.g., the Forestry Law of 1978
and the Land Use Decree of 1978), responsibility for environmental quality in Nigeria was
consolidated under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA),
which was created under Decree No. 58 of 1988, under the supervision of the Federal
Environmental Protection Council (Council). Subsequently reorganized as the Federal
Ministry of Environment (FME), the agency's initial mandate included the following.
* Establish Federal water quality standards and effluent limitations;
* Protect air and atmospheric quality;
* Protect the ozone layer;
* Control the discharge of hazardous substances;
* Enforce the process, including power to search, seize and arrest as well
as procedures in respect of suits against the agency.

In 1992, the Decree No. 58 was further amended (Decree No. 86) to task FME with the
preparation of a comprehensive National Policy for protection of the environment, of
which the centerpiece strategy was development of procedures for environmental impact
assessment of all development projects.
4.1.2 Environmental Impact Assessment
In addition to guidelines for EA preparation, Decree No. 86 also contains provisions for
the screening of projects according to impact potential, including listed activities for which
mandatory EA preparation is required, as well as provisions for public disclosure of EA
findings for follow-on monitoring.
4.1.2.1 Project Screening and Scoping
A Procedural Guideline document (FEPA 1995a) has been published to guide project
screening and scoping. In consideration of criteria that include impact magnitude, extent,
duration, risks, significance and availability of mitigation measures, the screening process
leads to one of three categories, as described below.
0 Category I projects will require a full Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA);
* Category II projects may require only a "partial: EIA, which will focus
on mitigation and environmental planning measures, unless the project is
located near an "Environmentally Sensitive Area" (ESA), in which case
full EIA is required;
> Category III projects are considered to have "essentially beneficial
impacts" on the environment, for which an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) will be prepared by FME.
The procedural guidelines provide examples for the term "ESA" that closely approximate
World Bank criteria for areas of special concern, and include the following.

* Coral reefs;
* Mangrove forests;
* Small islands;
* Tropical rainforests;
*  Areas with erosion-prone soils;
* Areas prone to desertification;
* Natural conservation areas;
* Wetlands of national or international importance;
* Areas which harbor threatened or endangered species;
* Areas of particular scientific interest;
* Areas of historic or archeological interest;
*  Areas of importance to threatened ethnic groups.
Screening takes place on the basis of a "Project Proposal" document that consists of a
description of the activity to be undertaken, a summary outline of potentially affected
elements in the surrounding environment, and proposed impact reduction or mitigation
measures incorporated by project design.
Finally, the Procedural Guidelines also provide a list of activities subject a priori to
Category I, II, and III EIA, again strongly based on similar guidelines in World Bank
Sourcebook and Operational Policy literature.  In the Nigerian guidelines, "Power
Generation and Transmission" is listed as a Category I activity only for thermal projects of
10 MW or greater, combined cycle thermal generation, nuclear generation or
hydro-electric generation for dams and reservoirs of a certain size or above.  The
Category II activities include "small scale electric transmission" without criteria as to
determination of scale.

4.1.2.2 EIA Content
A series of sectoral ELA guidelines (FEPA 1995b) have also been published that are
derived from USEPA and World Bank documents. The Infrastructure Sectoral Guidelines
address electric power generation and transmission, identifying issues typically associated
with transmission line projects including the following
* Impacts arising from land acquisition and development, including
impacts to human and biological resources;
* Visual/aesthetic impacts, noise and vibration;
* Diseases arising as a function of development induced by construction
access and service road access.
An "EIA Report Writing Format" section is included in both the Procedural and Sectoral
guidelines that presents a recommended report organization that includes all of the topic
areas covered by the World Bank OPN 4.01. A comparison of report contents from the
FME format and from OPN 4.01 is presented in Table A-1.
4.1.2.3 EIA Submittal and Review
The Procedural Guidelines summarize the process of EIA preparation and submittal to the
FEPA Secretariat, which conducts the screening, assigns an EIA category and manages the
scoping process (Figure 1). If determination is made that an EIA is required, a review
panel is appointed under criteria received from the Federal Environmental Protection
Council. This panel manages the sufficiency evaluation of the EIA and is also responsible
for public disclosure (see Section 4.2.4). Once approved, a technical committee is named
to write the government's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which will include
provisions for monitoring during construction and operation.

4.1.3 Supporting Regulatory and Policy Framework
The Nigerian enviromnental assessment process is supported by regulations containing
numeric standards for ambient environmental quality, as well as to control pollutants in
emissions and effluents.
4.1.3.1 Numeric Environmental Standards
Development of numeric standards for measuring ambient environmental quality and
regulating contaminant discharge of effluents and emissions was the initial mandate of
FEPA, predating the creation of EIA and audit procedures enabling their enforcement.
Key legislation titles are listed below.
* S.I. 8 National Environmental Protection (Effluent Limitation)
Regulations 1991 requires permitting of any industrial discharge into
public air or waters, subject to standards described in S.I. 9.
* S.I. 9 National Environmental Protection (Pollution Abatement in
Industries and Facilities Generating Wastes) Regulations 1991 provides
sector-based numerical standards for effluent and emission quality
(except for noise).
* Guidelines and standards for Environmental Pollution Control in
Nigeria - Federal Ministry of Environment (FME) 1991, which include
ambient noise standards.
Additional regulations address the land-conversion and human health issues associated with
transmission line projects, as described below.
4.1.3.2 Public Health and Safety
Public health and safety is addressed by NEPA guidelines establishing 7.5 m and 15 m,
respectively, as the Minimum Horizontal Distance (MHD) between a building and NEPA
high-tension overhead wires of 11 and 33 kvA, respectively. Note that MHD refers to the

distance measured from the centerline on the ground (i.e., the point directly beneath the
conductor). An MHD for lines of 132 and 330 kvA has been established as 30 m and
60 m, respectively.
Public health and safety is further addressed by the Civil Aviation Act of 1990, which
prohibits the construction of transmission lines along and around airports.
4.1.3.3 Impacts Due to Land Conversion: Natural Resources
The Mineral Resources Act of 1990 requires that transmission line corridors not be
established through "Minerals and Natural Resource Areas," thereby protecting their
economic value.
Impacts to biological resources is provided only by the prohibition of transmission line
construction through areas formally designated as Wild Animal Preservation areas or
Lakes and National Parks, as contained in the Wild Animal Preservation Act of 1990. No
policy guidelines were found that address the conversion of non-protected lands of high
biological diversity or habitat value (i.e., "Wildlands" in World Bank policies).
4.1.3.4 Impacts to Human Resources
Virtually no regulatory or policy reference to socio-economic impacts of power
transmission projects is integrated into the environmental regulatory framework of Nigeria.
All issues related to involuntary resettlement or compensation for loss from the state
exercise of eminent domain are addressed in the Land Use Act of 1978 (amended 1990).
Issues arising from loss of property and involuntary resettlement have been addressed
under a separate set of TORs for preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan Policy
Framework. The objective of this exercise was to evaluate existing GON policies and
practices, and recommend actions needed to align them with World Bank requirements as

provided in OD 4.30. The entire report is provided as Attachment C, with key fmdings
summarized below.
* The NEPA Property and Resettlement Departments have considerable
historic experience with indemnification and resettlement arising from
hydropower  projects,  such  as  the  as  Jebba  Hydro  Project
(12,000 resettlers) and Shiroro Hydro Project (19,000 resettlers). These
activities were the subject of the following comments in the Resettlement
Action Plan Policy Framework report.
> In the case of property losses cash settlements have been provided, but
no alternative land made available to displaced parties as required under
OD 4.30.
* Cash settlements on civil structures were not always based on full
replacement cost, again as required by OD 4.30.
- Cash settlements for loss of croplands was not always based on market
values for produce, or full replacement costs for long-term assets such as
fruit or forestry species, whereas OD 4.30 requires restoration of full
income streams in cases of economic displacement.
Recommended policy actions are summarized in Section 5.5, and described in detail in
Attachment B.
4.1.3.5 Public Disclosure During EIA
Decree No. 86 (1992) contains numerous references to public disclosure, including the
following statement of objectives in the opening clause.
The objectives of any environmental impact assessment shall be to
encourage the development of procedures for information exchange,
notification and consultation between organs and persons when proposed
activities are likely to have significant environmental effects on boundary or
trans-state or on the environment of bordering towns and villages"
(Section 1. [c]).

However no specific guidance is provided on how public consultation is to be carried out,
with Section 9. [4] stating the following.
The Council may determine an appropriate method in which the decision of
the Agency shall be published so as to reach interested persons or groups,
in particular the originators or persons interested in the activity subject of
the decision.
Considerable guidance is provided in the closing portion of Decree No. 86 on the
establishment of public files containing EIA and EIS documentation, and on assuring that
the public maintains access to those files.
Guidance for public disclosure other than that found in Decree No. 86 is scant. The
Procedural Guidelines refer to a public review process, to be conducted during EIA
sufficiency evaluation. Reference is made to the requirement that "venues of display will
include, among others, the LGA (i.e., local government authority), state EPA and FEPA
headquarters and that... the public shall be invited to participate in this review process
through newspaper advertisements."
In practice, the public is invited (by radio as well as newspaper announcement) to
participate in FEPA EIA review meetings, and signed meeting minutes are accepted as
evidence of "stakeholder consultation" (Philomena Adinye, Assistant Director of EA
Division, FEPA; personal communication).
In summary, the public consultation process consists of an open-door policy for
stakeholder participation in agency meetings regarding sufficiency of EIA reports, and
assuring public access to those reports as well as to FEPA's statement of findings (i.e., the
EIS).  No written or verbal description was encountered to village/community-level
meetings conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining stakeholder input.

4.1.3.6 Post-Commissioning Environmental Audit and Compliance Monitoring
As is often the case in developing economies, the FEPA staff has been challenged to
enforce monitoring and compliance measures provided for in the environmental
management plan of the EIA, due to factors that include policy/guideline weakness and
institutional capacity.
The scope of Decree No. 86 virtually ends with the EIA process, providing no guidance on
assuring environmental performance after projects are approved. Both the Procedural and
Sectoral Guideline documents make nominal references to compliance auditing, but again
provide no guidelines for its implementation.
Interview of FEPA personnel further indicated little familiarity with environmental
auditing and that regular compliance reporting did not occur; as was confirmed by
interview of substation management personnel. Likewise interview of private sector
contractors who prepared EIA reports revealed almost no familiarity with environmental
audit practice.
4.1.3.7 Public Grievance Procedures
No reference has been found in the policy or regulatory literature to a formal mechanism
for handling grievances related to environmental issues. Interview of FEPA personnel
indicates that formal grievance statements may be submitted to the FEPA Legal Unit, who
is then tasked with developing the agency's response. Anecdotal information also indicates
that public pressure has lead to government response on some occasions, usually when
issues are of sufficiently high profile to gain attention at the national level.
The NGO community also reportedly serves a public watchdog function on environmental
issues. Interview of the Nigerian Environmental Society (NES) personnel indicated some
history of public advocacy on environmental issues. In one instance, the NES developed a
memorandum to advise all government agencies, donors and national NGO groups that

construction was underway on the National Stadium project without an EIA having been
prepared, obligating the government to prepare one (Ane Leslie Adogame, Executive
Secretary, Nigerian Environmental Society, personal communication).
4.1.4 Institutional Capacity for Environmental Management
Under the terms of reference for the Power Transmission Development Project, NEPA
will create an Environment, Resettlement and Social Unit (ERSU). The ERSU will have
the broad mandate of assuring that new activities implemented in the transmission
subsector with Project funding comply with both the national and World Bank policies
regarding environmental and social impact.
It is expected that the ERSU will be largely drawn from the staff of NEPA's resettlement
and property departments, which are the organizations that have been responsible for
addressing involuntary resettlement and related compensation activities in the past.
Though not fully designed or established, the proposed ERSU organization will include
resettlement and environmental sections, each with distinctive responsibilities.
No formal institutional capability assessment was performed on NEPA staff. However, it
is apparent that, while possessing excellent empirical skills, particularly in the planning
disciplines, most NEPA staff members have not received sufficient training and exposure
to environmental management tools such as EA, environmental management planning or
environmental audit. Proposed capacity-building actions are presented in Section 5.0.
4.2 World Bank Environmental Policies and Guidelines
The Bank's policy requirement for the evaluation of potential environmental impacts of all
lending projects is described in OP/BP/GP 4.01 Enviromnental Assessment (EA). As
stated in OP/BP/GP 4.01, environmental consequences should be recognized early in the
project cycle and taken into account in project selection, siting, planning, and design by

preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse environmental impacts
and enhancing positive impacts.
The OP/BP/GP 4.01 also presents guidelines for screening projects into one of the
three EA categories A, B, or C, depending on the anticipated risk of adverse impact. With
regard to screening, the World Bank views electric transmission lines as projects with a
wide range of environmental risk, depending on location and project size. As described in
the Environmental Assessment Sourcebook series (1990), impacts are principally
associated with the creation and maintenance of corridors, construction of the towers, and
risk from electromagnetic fields (EMF). Small-capacity lines of short length that do not
pass through sensitive areas may not require a comprehensive EA, though larger capacity,
longer lines will trigger preparation of an EA. For these reasons, transmission lines often
are ranked as a Category B project, meaning that full environmental assessment may not be
required, and that the depth of analysis called for in individual terms of reference can vary
according to anticipated impacts.
Supplementary guidance on EA preparation for the World Bank of relevance is provided in
the following series of publications.

4.2.1 Sectoral Guidelines
Sectoral guidelines for electric power transmission systems are stated in the Technical
Paper No. 154, Environmental Assessment Sourcebook, Volume III, Guidelines for
Environmental Assessment of Energy and Industry Projects (1991), "Sourcebook III. " The
guidelines state that electric power transmission lines will affect natural and sociocultural
resources. The special issues associated with transmission systems are effects on land use,
health and safety hazards and induced development. Negative impacts to land resources
such as fragmentation of habitat and vegetation along the right of way or introduction of
new access to protected areas (i.e., wildlands) can result. Increase risk of electrocutions
can occur due to placement of low-slung lines near human activity. Electromagnetic fields
created by the transmission line can result in potential health hazards.  Induced
development or population relocation may occur in or on the borders of a right-of -way.
4.2.2 Cross Sectoral Guidelines
The Bank also maintains policies to address key issues on a non-sectoral basis (also known
as "safeguard policies"), of which the following are relevant to the suite of issues that
could arise from the Project.

4.2.2.1 OP 4.04 Natural Habitats
The Bank does not support projects involving the significant conversion of natural habitats
unless there are no feasible alternatives for the project, and its siting and comprehensive
analysis demonstrate that overall benefits from the project substantially outweigh the
environmental costs. If the EA indicates that a project significantly convert or degrade
natural habitats, the project includes mitigation measures acceptable to the Bank. The
Environmental Assessment Sourcebook Update No. 20 (October 1997) provides related
guidance on the topic area of managing biological diversity as an EA issue area.
4.2.2.2 OD 4.30 Involuntary Resettlement (to be converted to OD 4.30)
Involuntary resettlement as used in this policy covers both (a) the involuntary displacement
(physical and non-physical) of affected people that arises from change in land use or water
use, loss of productive assets or loss of income or means of livelihood, whether or not the
people must move to another location, and (b) the measures for mitigating the impacts of
displacement. The policy applies whether or not the Bank itself is financing part of the
project that may require involuntary resettlement, and it covers resettlement resulting from
activities that are not part of the Bank-financed project but are necessary to achieving the
objectives of the project. Displaced persons are assisted in their efforts to improve their
former production levels, income-carrying capacity, and living standards, or at least
restore them to the levels they would have without the project.
4.2.2.3 OD 4.20 Indigenous Peoples
This directive provides guidance to ensure that indigenous people benefit from
development projects, and to avoid or mitigate adverse effects of Bank-financed
development projects on indigenous peoples. Addressing issues pertaining to indigenous
peoples must be based on the informed participation of the indigenous people themselves.

4.2.2.4 Operational Management of Cultural Property in Bank-Financed Projects
Policy Note  (to be issued as OP/ BP/GP 4.11) No. 11.03
Bank policy is to assist in the preservation of cultural property where part of a
Bank-financed operation, and to avoid its elimination. The Bank normally declines to
finance projects that will significantly damage nonreplicable cultural property, and assists
only those projects that are sited or designed so as to prevent such damage.  The
Environmental Sourcebook Update No. 8 (September 1994) also provides additional
guidance on the management of impacts to cultural property during EA preparation.
4.2.2.5 OP 11.02 Wildlands
The World Bank policies and guidelines on wildlands, defined as land and water areas
virtually unmodified by human activity, are presented in Operational Policy Notes 11.02
Wildlands: Their Protection and Management in Economic Development (World Bank,
1986). The Bank policy is to avoid the elimination of wildlands and to actively assist in
their preservation. Certain wildlands, including protected areas, are deemed to be of
"special concern." The Bank normally declines to finance projects involving conversion of
wildlands of "special concern," even if such conversion occurred prior to the Bank being
invited to consider financing. Wildlands of special concern are areas that are recognized to
be exceptionally important in conserving biological diversity or perpetuating environmental
services, and can be classified into two types. First, are wildlands officially designated as
protected areas by governments, sometimes in collaboration with the United Nations or the
international scientific community. Designated protected areas may be National Parks and
protected areas, Biosphere Reserves, World Heritage Natural Sites, Wetlands of
International Importance (i.e., Ramsar designation), areas designated for protected status
in national conservation strategies or master plans, and similar "wildlands management
areas" (WMAs; i.e., areas where wildlands are protected and managed to retain a
relatively unmodified state; Annex 1 of OPN 11.02).

A second category is wildiands that are as yet unprotected by legislation, but recognized by
the national and/or international scientific and conservation communities, often in
collaboration with the United Nations, as exceptionally endangered ecosystems, known
sites of rare or endangered species, or important wildlife breeding, feeding, or staging
areas. These include certain types of wildlands that are threatened throughout much of the
world, yet are biologically unique, ecologically fragile, or of special importance for local
people and environmental services. Wildlands of special concern often occur in tropical
forests, Mediterranean type brushlands, mangrove swamps, coastal marshes, estuaries, sea
grass beds, coral reefs, small oceanic islands, and certain tropical freshwater lakes and
riverine areas. Wildlands of special concern also occur in certain geographical regions
(Annex 2 of OPN 11.02) that have been reduced to comparatively small patches and
continue to undergo rapid attrition. As a result, these regions harbor some of the most
threatened species in the world.
When wildlands other than those of special concern may become involved, the Bank
prefers to site projects on lands already converted (e.g., logged over, abandoned,
degraded, or already cultivated areas) sometime in the past, rather than in anticipation of a
Bank project. Deviations from this policy must be explicitly justified.
As defined in Operational Directive 4.01, Annex D, Wildlands: Their Protection and
Management, wetlands are defined as wildlands of special concern. In the Bank's
Operational Policy Notes (OPN) 11.02 Wildlands: Their Protection and Management in
Economic Development (World Bank, 1986), wetlands are identified as a subset of
wildlands of special concern. Therefore, the policies and guidelines for wildiands, as
summarized above, apply to wetlands as well. The Bank also recognizes the significance
of small or unrecognized wetlands and the need for those areas to be considered during
preparation of the project.

Wetlands are valuable ecosystems that provide wintering, breeding, and feeding areas for
waterfowl, shorebirds, and other species of birds. The areas also provide spawning and
feeding areas, as well as year-round habitat for fish and other wildlife. In addition to
serving ecological functions, wetlands serve as water storage areas and natural filtering
areas that improve water quality.
Wildlands and wetlands of worldwide importance have been identified via the RAMSAR
process. Named after the Iranian town in which the first convention was held, RAMSAR
is accepted shorthand for the "International Convention of Wetlands of Global
Importance." The World Bank cannot support actions that propose degradation to areas
protected under this agreement, or actions that violate any other international community.
4.2.2.6 Biodiversity
The Bank upholds two policies on biodiversity, as presented in Environmental
Sourcebook I (World Bank 1991), as well as subsequent updates. The Bank supports the
preservation of endangered species and critical habitats, and the conservation and
management of wildlands. The Operational Manual (World Bank 1984) Statement 2.36
Environmental Aspects of Bank Work states that the Bank will not finance projects that
"cause severe or irreversible environmental degradation" nor projects that "would
significantly modify natural areas" identified by international organizations as biologically
valuable or by governments as protected areas.
Bank guidelines pertaining to biodiversity identify actions to take in the very early stages
of an environmental assessment. During the early part of the environmental assessment
preparation stage, an environmental reconnaissance can be performed to identify and assess
the significance of impacts to biodiversity and identify any other concerns. Sourcebook I
suggests that assessors identify specific ecosystems the project will affect, the important
biological features of the identified ecosystems, the general nature of the project's impacts,

and the significance of impacts relative to ecosystem types in the region and/or country,
and the cumulative effects and trends for the ecosystem types.
Sourcebook I presents several possible technical actions that could be incorporated in
mitigation plans, such as establishing equivalent conservation units elsewhere in the region
to offset unavoidable loss of habitat in the project area (mirroring policies for impacts to
wildlands, wetlands and tropical forests). Several institutional actions are also presented,
such as the strengthening of existing agencies with management responsibility for parks
and preserves, other wildlands management areas, and biological resources in general.
The Bank recognizes the importance of community involvement in the successful
maintenance of biodiversity in the future, and highlights the need to maintain
communication among affected groups, develop an awareness of the importance and
benefits of maintaining biodiversity, awareness of the apparent costs and benefits of the
project, knowledge of realistic management options, and recognition of local customs,
traditions, and cultural values.
For the purpose of identifying threatened and endangered (T/E) species, the IUCN Red
Databook series should be used to complement national (if any) lists. Operating through
the World Conservation Monitoring Center in Glan, Switzerland, the IUCN has established
a website where country-specific searches may be conducted.
Measures for ensuring that projects adequately address World Bank policies on
environmental and social soundness issues are incorporated into several Bank documents.
In addition to ODs, several policy papers reflect World Bank policies on environmental
and social soundness issues. These include the World Bank Environmental Guidelines
(World Bank 1988a), the Environmental Assessment Sourcebook Series (Word Bank
1991), updates to the sourcebook series dated from 1993 to 1996, The World Bank
Participation Sourcebook (World Bank 1996) and the Pollution Prevention and Abatement
Handbook 1998.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND PROPOSED ACTIONS: NIGERIAN
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY FRAMEWORK
Conclusions on the Nigerian policy and institutional framework evaluation, and proposed
actions to address areas of concern are presented in subsequent sections, and summarized
in Table A-1.
5.1 Environmental Assessment
The statutory requirements for environmental assessment of new projects are
unambiguous, and the accompanying guidelines present  the screening, scoping,
preparation, and review process in ample detail. The screening guidelines reference the
need to protect a comprehensive list of sensitive habitat types, and the EIA report format is
comparable to the World Bank's. In conclusion, if national guidelines are followed, no
further strengthening of national environmental assessment requirements is required to
assure adequate EA review of Project related issues during future investment activities.
Implementation issues and policy support recommendations are summarized below.
5.2 Numeric Standards
The Nigerian regulatory framework has numeric standards both for ambient environmental
quality as well as for emissions and effluents. Individual standards are comparable to
those of the international lending institutions, and are considered adequate safeguards for
environmental quality if used for environmental assessment and compliance purposes
during future investment activities; especially since transmission line construction and
operation will generate little in the way of emission and effluent streams.
5.3 Protection of Wildland Habitats
Though the Nigerian screening guidelines identify a comprehensive list of habitat types
regarded as Environmentally Sensitive Areas, no further guidance or regulation is provided

on how potential impacts to these areas can be addressed during EA preparation.
Regulatory protection is afforded to formally protected areas, but not to habitats such as
wetlands or tropical forests outside the boundaries of those areas. Impacts to unprotected
natural habitats is not likely to occur during future investment activities that do not involve
significant new land conversion. Greenfield projects, especially high capacity transmission
lines, may result in direct impacts to natural habitats as a result of
The EIA terms of reference for greenfield transmission line projects will require the
identification of any natural habitats along proposed corridors as part of baseline
evaluation. Impact assessment and mitigation measures will include avoidance of any high
value habitats, including those listed in the Nigerian screening guidelines, or compensatory
protection of other, comparable wildlands in the case that impacts cannot be avoided. The
TORs will draw upon and reference relevant World Bank literature, including OPN.
5.4 Public Consultation
Though the Nigerian environmental assessment guidelines reference public participation
and communication as primary EIA objectives, the mechanisms to carry out this objective
are not well defined. In the absence of a defined process, the public consultation practice
has evolved into an open door policy for EIA technical review meetings, with no specific
effort directed towards consultation with stakeholder communities.
It is unlikely that public consultation will be required for projects that do not entail
large-scale land use changes, such as the installation of new capacity within existing
substation perimeters, or co-location of new transmission lines in existing corridors.
Greenfield projects, especially the construction of new, high-capacity transmission lines,
bring a high risk of involuntary resettlement or economic displacement. Accordingly,
public consultation will be carried out during the issues scoping phase of EIA
development, in parallel or preparatory to with socio-economic baseline studies.

EIA terms of reference will include a description of required public consultation activities.
The TORs will draw upon World Bank guidelines on the subject, including the Operational
Sourcebook Update No. 5 Public Involvement in Environmental Assessment.Requirements,
Opportunities and Issues.
5.5 Involuntary Resettlement
As summarized in Section 4.1.3.4, and described in detail in Attachment B, considerable
experience resides within NEPA on resettlement issues. However, the NEPA approach
has not historically complied in full with World Bank requirements as contained in
OD 4.30.  The recommended policy actions of the Resettlement Action Plan Policy
Framework are to bring these NEPA practices into compliance with World Bank policies,
as well as to implement the processes provided under OD 4.30, including the iterative
preparation of Resettlement Action Plans with participation by affected parties at each RAP
development stage.
5.6 Cultural Property
The construction of linear facilities presents a risk of disturbance to any sites having
cultural significance along the alignment. However, no direct reference was found in the
Nigerian guidelines to the management of issues arising from archeological finds made
during the EIA process. This absence of policy guidance, plus the fact that Nigeria has a
long history of occupation, with significant trade-based urban developments in the north
dating back several centuries, creates the need for cultural resource protection during
future investment activities.
The TORs for the environmental impact assessment studies conducted on greenfield
transmission line projects will require a review of proposed alignments by a qualified
national archeologist. Should a risk to cultural resources be identified during this review,
spot checks of key areas will be conducted during EIA preparation. The construction
contract documents will also contain standard guidelines for responses to "chance-finds" of

archeological resources during construction activities. These responses will include a
cessation of construction activity at the site of the find until professional evaluation can be
made of its significance; as well as notification to the appropriate agency of interest. The
TORs and construction contract documents will drawn on World Bank guidelines for
preparation, including the document Operational Management of Cultural Property in
Bank-Financed Projects Policy Note (to be issued as OP/ BP/GP 4. 1 1) No. 11.03.
5.7 Compliance Auditing and Environmental Management Planning
The Nigerian EIA guidelines refer to post-commissioning requirements for environmental
performance monitoring. Statutory requirement also exists to obtain a pollution discharge
permit, and to submit reports to FEPA on discharge parameters (S.I. 8 National
Environmental Protection [Effluent Limitation] Regulations 1991). However in practice
little post-commissioning evaluation of environmental performance occurs, and both NEPA
and FEPA personnel have little familiarity with either the management framework within
which it should occur, such as Environmental Management Planning, or the component
evaluation tools such as Environmental Audit. Exceptions to this may be the multinational
energy companies (e.g., Shell, Texaco) who have developed and implemented
environmental management policies on a corporate basis, and which translate into a
uniform practice for their operating companies worldwide.
As described in the EA report, the Project activities present some risk from the lack of
environmental management planning at substation sites.  The proposed means of
addressing substation contamination will also address the larger issue of non-existent
environmental management planning on a sector basis, as described below.
Phase I audits will be conducted at each substation facility slated for activity under the
Project to determine the degree of environmental hazard, in turn principally related to the
likely presence of PCBs onsite. The audit scope will include workshop training of ESRU
personnel in environmental audit procedures. Training will include also include issues

associated with post-commissioning operation of transmission lines. A training objective
will be to create a nucleus of capability within NEPA for the monitoring of environmental
performance in the transmission line sub-sector. The workshop approach will therefore be
on the training-of-trainers. Sample TORs and checklists for the Phase I audits are attached
to this report (Appendix B and B-1).
The audit process is a tool for, among other things, determining the effectiveness of
environmental management planning. Since EMP has been absent at NEPA facilities, and
little capacity exists within the FEPA regulatory agency, additional training will be
provided to ERSU in this topic area. As with the audit training, one objective will produce
a nucleus of capability at the national level, which will be transferred to facilities
constructed with project funding (and potentially to the entire NEPA organization,
including generation facilities). A sample EMP table of contents is attached to this report
as Appendix C.
5.8 Institutional Strengthening
As referenced throughout this report, the staff of the ERSU have excellent empirical skills
in discipline areas applicable to environmental management, as well as experience in the
conduct of field surveys in support of resettlement planning. However, experience is
limited in the application of tools such as EIA, environmental audit and environmental
management planning. The ERSU is likewise in the early stages of organization, and
administrative responsibilities are not yet well defined.
5.8.1 Professional Capacity: Training Activities
Specific measures to strengthen ERSU institutional capacity for managing environmental
issues of Project activities are described below.

* Workshop-based training will be conducted in each topic area of
enviromnental auditing and environmental management planning.
* International study tours will be conducted so the ERSU personnel can,
among other activities, interview with professional counterparts in
transmission sub-sector environmental management units elsewhere in
the world. Lessons learned in a developing country context may be
more readily transferable to the Nigerian situation than those gained
from state-of-the-art settings. Accordingly, this tour should not only
include visits to power company staff in the developed world, but also
counterpart staff in countries with relatively young environmental policy
frameworks (e.g., Mexico). Lessons learned.
* A geographic information system (GIS) capability should be developed
within the ERSU. GIS based on PC capabilities (i.e., as opposed to
workstation) can be acquired at a relatively low cost, and will greatly
increase the utility of EIA baseline data, as well as the power of EIA as
a decision making tool.
- Technical assistance to design, acquire and set up the GIS system will be
provided to the ERSU, as will applications training in GIS.
5.8.2 ERSU Organization and Administrative Responsibilities
Though the final organizational structure of the ERSU is still fluid, arrangements under
discussion include an administrative division into the following three divisions.
* A "Resettlement Division," further divided into "Operations" and
"Valuation" units, which will be tasked with evaluating involuntary
resettlement and related compensation actions, as further described in
Appendix A-1.
* An "Environment Division," which will be subdivided into a unit with
responsibility for "Compliance and Environmental Management," plus
an "Environmental Assessment" unit responsible for EIA.
* A "Social Issues" unit that will be responsible for public consultation,
public awareness and communication within NEPA on environmental
management issues, and to serve as an official conduit for public
grievances on environmental issues in the transmission subsector.

February 2001                        -29-                              003-2204
Since there is a universal need for data on all areas of responsibility, it is proposed that the
GIS unit be placed under the supervision of the ERSU general manager.
Proposed responsibilities of the "Resettlement Division" are provided in detail in
Appendix A-1. Proposed responsibilities of the "Environment Division" are summarized
below.
The "Environmental Assessment" Unit will have the following responsibilities.
* Prepare "Project Proposal" reports for new project activities.
* On the basis of "Project Proposal" reports, conduct screening with
FEPA to establish an EIA category
* Prepare TORs for EIAs on new projects,
* Oversee competitive bidding on consultant contracts to prepare EIA
reports per the TORs
* Manage the EIA preparation process, with input from the Environment,
Resettlement and Social Unit (ERSU) as appropriate, and including
oversight of the EIA review by FEPA
* Negotiate mitigation, compliance and monitoring requirements for new
projects with FEPA, and with input from the "Compliance and
Environmental Management" division.
The "Compliance and Environmental Management" Division will be responsible for the
following.
* Evaluation of existing NEPA  transmission facilities in terms of
compliance with the Nigerian environmental regulatory and policy
framework (with priority given to facilities slated for investment);
* Preparation of environmental management plans for each facility,
including provisions for periodic monitoring and reporting;

> Oversight of the monitoring and reporting process, management of data,
and provision of assistance to facility managers in obtaining
environmental permits and submitting environmental reports to FME.
The Social Unit will have the following responsibilities.
*  Collection and storage of secondary socio-economic data (i.e., in the
GIS system) of relevance to the activities of the other two units;
* Preparation and execution of Public Consultation plans for use in the
EIA process on new projects;
* Preparation and communication of a Grievance mechanism for use by
the public.
The "Resettlement Unit" will have a strong orientation towards the field, given the need
for ongoing interaction among stakehold groups. Accordingly, this unit will be divided
into Headquarters and "Zonal" components, with the latter having permanent presence at
the state and local government level (see Appendix A-1). Likewise, the "Social" unit will
have a public interaction role, and a local (i.e., "zonal") administrative component as well.
However, the Environmental Unit will likely become a centralized, headquarters-based
group that can be mobilized as needed to work at existing facilities, or at the site of new
project activities.
These administrative and organizational observations are of an initial nature.  It is
recommended that expertise in institutional analysis relative to public environmental
management be contracted as a first Project activity to finalize questions such as the
optimal division of responsibilities and respective staff strength for the ERSU.
Costs for the implementation of environmental management activities are presented in
Table A-2.

NIGERIA
POWER TRANSMISSION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN POLICY FRAMEWORK
1. Project Description
1.    The proposed Nigeria Power Transmission Development Project will provide
62.2 million dollars IDA credit to Nigeria's National Electric Power Authority (NEPA)
to help finance urgent power rehabilitation needs, expansion of national transmission
system, and power sector reform. The project will consist of three components: (1)
investment component (US$56 million); (2) technical assistance component (US$5
million); and (3) social and environmental component (US$1.2million).
2.    For the investment component, the project seeks to redress certain network
deficiencies and operational constraints of the Nigerian power transmission system.
These measures will allow the efficient dispatch and transmission of the additional
power expected to be available with the emergency and longer term measures now
being taken to increase generation availability. Specifically, the Investment components
will include: (a) augmentations required at five main grid substations: Onitsha, Kano,
Osogbo, Alaoji and Benin; and grid system reactive compensation; (b) installation of
grid system metering at 132 kV to enable the measurement of power supplied to
unbundled distribution companies; and (c) establishment of a new National Control
Center (NCC) with SCADA/EMS facilities and associated communications
requirements. For the technical assistance component, it provides assistance for
establishing the new transmission and system operation company, and for developing
transmission and system operation-related secondary regulations. For the social and
environmental component, it includes establishment of an Environment, Resettlement
and Social Unit and an HIV/AlDS prevention awareness program.
2. Resettlement impact
3.    There is no resettlement associated with this project. However as an input to
the early establishment of the Environment, Resettlement and Social Unit, and as a
basis for preparation of future World Bank-assisted projects in the transmission sub-
sector, the following Resettlement Policy Framework has been prepared.
3. Policy Objectives
4.    The objectives of the policy framework include the following elements:
(1) involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized through design efforts; (2)
where involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, resettlement activities should be conceived
and executed as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient investment



Appendix A-1
resources to give the persons displaced by the project the opportunity to share in project
benefits; and (3) displaced persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their
livelihoods and standard of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pro-
displacement levels.
5.    Here, "affected people" refers to people who are directly affected socially and
economically by a project through (a) the involuntary taking of land and other assets
resulting in: (i) relocation or loss of shelter; (ii) loss of assets or acess to assets; (iii) loss
of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the affected persons must move
to another location; or (b) the involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks
and protected areas results in adverse impacts on the livelihood of the displaced persons.
The policy applies to all displaced persons regardless of the total number affected or the
severity of impact. Particular attention is paid to the needs of vulnerable groups among
those displaced: especially those below the poverty line, the elderly, women and children,
indigenous groups and ethnic minorities.
6.    If a project is World Bank-financed, the resettlement policy should apply to all
components under the project regardless whether or not they are directly funded by the
Bank. It should also cover resettlement resulting from complementary activities that are
not part of the Bank-assisted investment projects, but are necessary to achieve its
objectives as set forth in the project documents.
4. Potential Resettlement Impacts Associated with Future Transmission Projects
7.    Construction of new high voltage transmission lines (330kV and 132kV) and
substations (330kV and 132kV) will involve a certain amount of land acquisition and
resettlement. For transmission lines, a small amount of land area would be acquired for
building tower bases; and additional land would be needed temporarily during the
construction for access road and storage sites. According to NEPA practice, in order to
ensure safe operation of transmission lines, all building structures and various trees
underneath the transmission line will be removed, within 30 meters of right of way for
132kV transmission line, and 50 meters right of way for 330kV transmission line.
Depending on the selection of alignment, the number of people affected and amount of
home demolition needed would vary. A certain amount of damage to farm crops could
result during the line construction. Farmers would be allowed to continue farming after
the completion of construction. They will be compensated for the lost yield from this
land during the construction period. In addition, compensation would be provided for
the damage to crops within the right of way during future repairs or rehabilitation.
8.    For the construction of substations, land area requirements range from  10
hectares for 132kV substation to 30-50 hectares for 330kV substation. Depending on
the location of the substation and types of land occupied, the affected people may lose
both their houses and their farmland. In this case, alternative farmland and residential
plots would be provided for resettlement and rehabilitation. Table 1 provides a

Appendix A-1
5. Legal Framework for Land Acquisition and Resettlement
11.   The legal basis for land acquisition and resettlement in Nigeria was the Land
Use Act adopted in 1978 and modified in 1990. The following are selected sections
relevant with the land acquisition and resettlement.
Section 1. Subject to the provisions of this Act, all land comprised in the
territory of each State in the Federation are hereby vested in the Governor of
each State and such land shall be held in trust and administered for the use and
common benefit of all Nigerians in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
Section 2: (a) all land in urban areas shall be under the control and management
of the Governor of each State; and (d) all other land shall be under the control
and management of Local government within the area of jurisdiction of which
the land is situated.
Section 5 (1) It shall be lawful for the Governor in respect of land, whether or
not in an urban area - (a) to grant statutory rights of occupancy to any person
for all purposes;
Section 6: (1) It shall be lawful for a Local Government in respect of land not in
urban area - (a) to grant customary rights of occupancy to any person or
organization for the use of land in the Local Government Area for agricultural,
residential and other purposes; (b) to grant customary rights of occupancy to any
person or organization for the use of land for grazing purposes and such other
purposes ancillary to agricultural purposes as may be customary in Local
Government Area concerned.
Section 6: (3) It shall be lawful for a Local Government to enter upon, use and
occupy for public purposes any land within the area of its jurisdiction, and for
the purpose, to revoke any customary right of occupancy on any such land.
Section 6: (5) The holder and the occupier according to their respective interests
of any customary right of occupancy revoked under subsection (3) of this
section shall be entitled to compensation, for the value at the date of revocation,
of their unexhausted improvements.
Section 6: (6) Where land in respect of which a customary right of occupancy is
revoked under this Act was used for agricultural purposes by the holder, the
Local Government shall allocate to such holder alternative land for use for the
same purpose.
Section 28: (1) It shall be lawful for the Governor to revoke a right of
occupancy for overriding public interest.
4



Appendix A-1
Section 29: (1) If a right of occupancy is revoked  ..., the holder and the
occupier shall be entitled to compensation for the value at the date of revocation
of their unexhausted improvements.
Section 29 (3) If the holder or the occupier entitled to compensation under this
section is a community the Governor may direct that any compensation payable
to it shall be paid (a) to the community; or (b) to the chief or leader of the
community to be disposed of by him for the benefit of the community in
accordance with the applicable customary law, (c) into some fund specified by
the Governor for the purpose of being utilized or applied for the benefit of the
community.
Section 29: (4) Compensation under subsection (1) of this section shall be, as
respects -
(a) the land, for the amount equal to the rent, if any, paid by the occupier
during the year in which the right of occupancy was revoked;
(b) buildings, installation or improvements thereon, for the amount of the
replacement cost of the building, installation or improvement, that is to say,
such cost as may be assessed on the basis of the prescribed method of
assessment as determined by the appropriate officer less any depreciation,
together with interests at the bank rate for delayed payment of compensation and
in respect of any improvement in the nature of reclamation works, being such
cost thereof as may be sustained by documentary evidence and proof to the
satisfaction of the appropriate officer;
(c) crops on land apart from any building, installation or improvement thereon,
for an amount equal to the value as prescribed and determined by the
appropriate officer.
Section 33: (1) Where a right of occupancy in respect of any developed land on
which a residential building has been erected is revoked under this Act, the
Governor or the Local Government, as the case may be, may in his or its
discretion offer in lieu of compensation payable in accordance with the
provisions of this Act, resettlement in any other place or area by way of a
reasonable alternative accommodation (if appropriate in the circumstances).
12.   According to the Land Use Act, all land in Nigeria is vested in the Governor of
each State, and shall be held in trust for the use and common benefit of all people. The
administration of land area is divided into urban land which will be directly under the
control and management of the Governor of each State; and non-urban land, which will
be under the control and management of the Local Government. The Governor of each
State will have the right to grant statutory rights of occupancy to any person for any
purposes; and the Local Government will have the right to grant customary rights of
occupancy to any person or organization for agricultural, residential and other
purposes. For agricultural purpose, no single customary right of occupancy shall
exceed 500 hectares.
5



Appendix A-1
13.   The Act gives the government the right to acquire land by revoking both
statutory and customary rights of occupancy for overriding public interest. In doing so,
the Act specifies that the State or Local Government should pay compensation to the
current holder or occupier with equal value. For NEPA as a federal government
agency, it is also empowered by both Land Use Decree and NEPA Operational Decree
(no. 24 of 1972) to acquire land for the purpose of effective operation. In doing so,
appropriate compensations need to be paid in line with the existing Act. For any other
public or private enterprise, the process of acquiring land for development purpose will
begin with the application to the relevant Local and State Governments. After the
review of the proposed project, and suggested compensation levels, the Land
Department of the State Department will approve the application for overriding public
interest.
14.   Since the Act gives the state ownership of all land, during land acquisition,
compensation for land acquired by NEPA will be paid only for structures, installations,
and improvements on the land, not land itself. However the Act does require State or
Local Government to provide alternative farmland for the affected people for farming
purposes, or alternative residential plots for those who will lose their houses. In all
hydro resettlement programs implemented by NEPA, such land replacement was
carried out.
15.   However, in some transmission projects implemented by NEPA  recently,
alternative land was rarely provided for transmission line and substations projects.
Compensation was paid for improvements, crops, trees, and structures within the right
of way. No special treatment was made for the land occupied by tower bases. No
alternative land was made available for the relocated people. In some areas closer to the
cities, on a case by case basis, additional cash compensation was paid to the affected
people for replacing the lost building plots. For substation projects, for those who lost
land and houses, additional cash compensation was paid to the affected people for
relocation and resettlement purposes, but alternative land was not provided by NEPA.
16.   In order to ensure that the interests of affected people are fully protected NEPA
will ensure that whenever land is acquired (farmland or residential), alternative land
with similar location and size will be provided as replacement. The Local or State
Governments will be responsible for arranging such land replacement, and NEPA will
be responsible for any cost associated with such land replacement. The project affected
persons will choose such alternative land site with the agreement of local government
and NEPA will bear the cost.
6



Appendix A-1
6. Compensation Rates for Structures, Assets, Crops and Trees
a. Structures and Assets
17.   Although the Land Use Act does not specify detailed compensation rates for lost
structures, installations or improvements due to land acquisition, it does provide basic
principles for such compensation, based on replacement costs less any depreciation,
together with interests at the bank rate for delayed payment of compensation. In
practice a set of building compensation rates is often adopted by individual State
Governments, which are applied throughout the State for development projects.
Although such rates are adjusted periodically by the State to reflect changing
construction costs, they appear to be low compared with the rates assessed by NEPA.
For example, for a bungalow with modem facilities, the Benue State rate is between
N2,000 to N4,500 per square meter, compared with NEPA assessed rate of N5,000 to
N10,000 per square meter. Usually, the state rates are applied only to state-funded
projects, and rates for federally-funded projects or privately-funded projects are higher
than the State rates.
18.   In  the actual implementation by  NEPA  property  department, building
compensation is based on valuation for each affected structure. In the process of
valuation of affected structures, the methods of replacement cost, comparable market
price, and combination of these two were often used by NEPA professional estate
surveyors. Table 2 provides a recent example of compensation rates for different
building structures in Benue State for a 330kV transmission line between Makurdi and
Aliade. According to NEPA staff, these rates seem to be accepted by the affected
people as fair compensation. However, because depreciation factor (up to 25 percent)
was often considered in these compensation rates, and because alternative residential
plots or cost for preparing such plots were often not included, the actual payment could
be less than the full replacement cost for the affected people, particularly in rural area
where no market price is available for such structures.
19.   To ensure that during project implementation, the affected people will be
provided full replacement cost for the lost structures, and are able to rebuild their
houses without any difficulties, NEPA will estimate building compensation rates based
on full replacement cost without depreciation, and will be responsible for ensuring that
alternative residential plots are provided for affected people. Once individual project
impacts are identified and valuation of individual structures are completed, detailed
compensation rates for different structures will be included in the resettlement action
plan.

Note: the range of compensation for each type of structure reflects different finishes
and construction quality.

b. Crops and Economic Trees
20.   On the issue of compensation for crops, and economic trees, a set of
compensation standards are normally specified by individual State Governments, which
is applied throughout the State for development projects. Each State adopts its own
compensation rates for different crops and economic trees. As a result, variation exists
among States on compensation rates. For example, compensation rate for yam farm,
was set at N 15,000 per ha. in Benue State, and only N 2,500 per ha. in Plateau State;
for cassava farm, it was N8,000 per ha. in Benue State and only N1,000 per ha. in
Plateau State. More importantly, most States rates seem to be low in comparison with
average yield and market price for these crops and economic trees. For example, the
price of yam farm could be as much as N50,000 to N60,000 per ha.; and the price of
cassava farm could be as high as N25,000 to N30,000 per ha. In actual implementation,
NEPA often uses these State rates as the lowest limit for compensation, and makes
necessary adjustments to reflect actual situation when State compensation rates appear
to be too low.
21.   In order to ensure that the compensation rates for crops and economic trees are
adequate for providing replacement value and restoring income and livelihood for the
affected people, during resettlement preparation, NEPA will consult with the affected
people, and make detailed assessment of compensation rates, which will take into
account the current yield and market price of different crops, as well as the replacement
cost for economic trees. Such compensation rates will be included in the resettlement
action plan.
8



Appendix A-1
c. Other Compensation and Assistance
22.   For any loss of infrastructure facilities and community services, such as roads,
bridges, schools, electricity, water, and so on, NEPA will provide in-kind
compensation by rebuilding these facilities to their original states. Such replacement
will be completed prior to the construction of transmission projects, so that the daily
life of concerned communities will not be affected.
23.   For all affected households who will be relocated due to the demolition of their
houses, in addition to providing replacement land for housing construction, each
affected family will be given in-kind or cash assistance by NEPA to prepare the site,
and construct necessary on-site infrastructures. In order to facilitate the moving for all
relocated households, transfer assistance will be provided by NEPA to the affected
people.
7. Criteria and Eligibility for Compensation
24.   The compensation and rehabilitation will be provided for all affected people under
the following conditions:
(1) if their land or income source will be removed due to land acquisition for a
project;
(2) if their houses or residential plots will be lost or partly damaged due to land
acquisition;
(3) if any other properties (crops, trees, and other facilities) or access to these
properties will be removed or damaged due to land acquisition or construction for
a project.
25.   All affected people, regardless of their legal status, will be provided compensation
and rehabilitation based on the policies adopted by NEPA. Lack of legal paper of their
customary rights of occupancy certificates shall not be an obstacle for obtaining
compensation for them.
8. Institutional Arrangement for Resettlement Planning and Implementation
Institutional Context
26.   Currently there is resettlement institutional capacity in NEPA. Such capacity is
mainly concentrated in the resettlement department under the hydro power project
division of the generation sector, and the property department under the corporate
service sector. The resettlement department consists of 19 professional staff with
planning, economic, geography, and social backgrounds. They are mainly responsible
for carrying out resettlement planning and implementation for hydro projects, such as
Jebba Hydro Project (12,000 resettlers) and Shiroro Hydro Project (19,000 resettlers).
The staff of the resettlement department are familiar with the resettlement process,
9



Appendix A-1
including detailed socio-economic surveys, consultations with affected communities,
and development of economic rehabilitation schemes for affected people. The property
department is responsible for surveying different types of impacts and calculating
detailed compensations. In the past, the property department staff have worked closely
with resettlement department staff in resettlement operations for hydro projects.
However, for transmission line and substation projects with less impacts, the property
department staff are mainly responsible for the resettlement implementation, which is
often conducted on cash compensation basis.
27.   Within the property department, there are about 70 full time staff involved in
land acquisition and compensation activities. They are located in two sections: (1)
wayleave survey section, and (2) estate survey section. The wayleave survey section is
responsible for valuation of crops and economic trees; the estate survey section is
responsible for valuation of structures and attached properties. These staff are scattered
in different Zone offices of NEPA across the country with each office having 8 - 15
staff. The staff from different Zonal offices are responsible for carrying out land
acquisition and resettlement for the respective States. During the process of resettlement
implementation, NEPA's audit department is also involved when reviewing
compensation values and approving compensation payment to the affected people.
Environment, Resettlement and Social Unit (ERSU) of NEPA
28.   An Environment, Resettlement and Social Unit (ERSU) will be set up within
NEPA, which will be part of the future transmission company. The unit should be divided
into a headquarters unit and zonal units. The unit should consist of two sections:
environment section and resettlement section, with 10 - 12 staff from both resettlement
and property departments. The main responsibilities of resettlement section of ERSU
headquarters unit include:
(1) developing a resettlement policy framework;
(2) organizing policy training for the resettlement staff in both ERSU headquarters
unit and zonal units;
(3) organizing both socio-economic surveys and inventory surveys for each proposed
project;
(4) preparing resettlement action plan for individual projects;
(5) allocating resettlement funds to the respective resettlement zonal-units, after cross
checking with Audit staff;
(6) supervising disbursement of compensation to the affected people by zonal-units staff;
(7) organizing and carrying out internal resettlement monitoring for projects;
(8) hiring independent institution for resettlement monitoring and evaluation.
(9) assisting the design team in deterniination of final alignment to minimize resettlement.
ERSU Zonal-Units of NEPA
10



Appendix A-1
29.   During implementation of a project, the ERSU will be supported by existing
resettlement staff from both the property and resettlement departments in NEPA zonal
offices. There will be several dozen full time staff in zonal offices of NEPA. Each office
will be responsible for handling resettlement planning and implementation for individual
transmission projects in its region. Their main responsibilities will include:
(1) carrying out detailed inventory and socio-economic survey for the proposed project;
(2) assisting the ERSU headquarter unit staff to prepare resettlement action plan;
(3) consulting State and Local Governments and affected villagers on policies;
(4) signing compensation contract and pay compensation to the affected people;
(5) carrying out internal resettlement monitoring work for the project;
Measures for Reinforcing Institutional Capacity Under the Project
30.   In order to improve institutional capacity for ERSU, its members will receive
training such as participating in resettlement policy training and workshops on
resettlement planning, implementation and income generation. The training activities
could include (1) sending key ERSU staff to participate in resettlement and social
assessment training sponsored by the World Bank; and (2) inviting international
consultants or World Bank staff to Nigeria to carry out a series of workshops on
resettlement policies, planning and implementation. Through these training activities,
ERSU staff will gain a better understanding of international best practice and World Bank
resettlement policies, and be better prepared to carry out resettlement planning and
implementation in accordance with new resettlement policy framework.
State and Local Government Agencies
31.   During the process of resettlement planning and implementation, the concerned
State Government agencies will be involved in the process. Specifically, they will
(1) participate in alignment selection;
(2) participate in compensation policy formulation
(3) help to resolve observed differences, such as compensation rates;
(4) assist in allocation of alternative land and issue land certificates of occupancy;
(5) resolve or report grievances to ERSU staff.
32.   For affected Local Governments, they will also be involved in the process of
resettlement planning and implementation. Specifically, they will
(1) provide comments on alignment selection;
(2) participate in compensation policy formulation;
(3) assist in site selection of alternative land and issue customary rights of occupancy;
(4) provide a liaison officer to work with ERSU staff;
(5) witness the payment of compensation to individuals and communities;
(6) resolve or report grievances from affected people to the State Government;
11



Appendix A-1
33.   District Heads and Village Chiefs will also be involved in the process:
(1) assist in dissemination of information to affected people;
(2) assist in the socio-economic and inventory survey;
(3) witness the compensation to affected individuals and communities;
(4) help in selection of alternative sites for replacement purposes;
(5) assist in restoration of infrastructures;
(6) resolve or report grievances to Local Government liaison officer.
9. Implementation Process
34.   In terms of the process of resettlement planning and implementation for
transmission projects, there are seven basic steps to be followed by ERSU staff.
35.   (1) Consultation with State and Local Governments. Establish initial contacts
with relevant State and Local Governments by introducing a project, potential
resettlement impacts, and strategy or approach for compensation and rehabilitation.
Such contacts allow the resettlement team to collect opinions or comments on the
proposed project from the affected communities.
36.   (2) Reconnaissance Survey. Preliminary identification of people affected by a
planned transmission project, which will be carried out in the field by a team of
resettlement staff and engineers in the design phase. Such survey provides an early
estimate of resettlement scope for the project.
37.   (3) Social Economic Survey and Detailed Inventory. Following the completion
of demarcation on the ground for right of way or area for substation, a detailed
inventory survey and social economic survey will be carried out within the affected
area. During the survey, all impacts such as houses, land, trees, and crops, will be
counted and measured, and affected households and people will be identified with the
participation of the affected people. Along with recording all types of lost assets, trees,
and crops, social economic information of the affected people and communities will
also be collected by resettlement staff.
38.   (4) Develop Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) Based on the survey and agreed
compensation rates, the ERSU staff will calculate the compensation amount for each
affected household, produce a detailed resettlement cost estimate, and prepare a
resettlement action plan for the project.
39.   (5) Consultation with Affected People. The resettlement plan and compensation
policies will then be reviewed by relevant State and Local Government officials, with
participation of district and village representatives. The comments and feedback from
local governments and affected people will be considered in the RAP finalization.
12



Appendix A-1
40.   (6) Disclose the RAP policy to the Affected People. Inform the affected people
and villages about the adopted resettlement policy and compensation standards once the
RAP is approved. Public disclosure of the RAP could be carried out, for example, by
holding public meeting, putting up notices in the affected villages, or distributing
resettlement information booklets to the affected people.
41.   (7) Sign Compensation Contract and Pay Compensation to the Affected People
The final step of resettlement implementation should be started sufficiently before the
contractors enter the site, to give the affected people reasonable time to complete new
houses and move their belongings (e.g. 4-6 months). During the implementation, ERSU
staff will pay compensation directly to each affected household in the presence of local
government representatives.
10. Resettlement Funding, Cost Estimate, Flow of Funds and Contingencies
42.   Resettlement budget for proposed projects will be fully included in the total
project cost. In order to ensure that the resettlement program will be implemented
smoothly, during the resettlement planning, efforts will be made in developing realistic
cost estimates for the resettlement program. The detailed cost estimated will be based on
comprehensive inventory survey of different impacts, and actual replacement cost for
various types of compensation and rehabilitation. In addition, in order to ensure smooth
implementation of resettlement program, the resettlement budget will also include other
related cost, such as survey and resettlement planning, resettlement monitoring and
evaluation, technical training, and overall administration. Given the time required for
implementation, and level of accuracy of the initial survey, a contingency fund of no less
than 10 percent of total resettlement cost will be set aside for covering cost changes due to
inflation or unexpected situations during the implementation.
43.   In order to minimize problems in delivering compensation, ERSU will ensure that
the flow of resettlement funds will be direct and transparent. Usually for compensation to
individuals, the funds will flow from ERSU through staff of Zonal Unit to affected
individuals (head of household) witnessed by local government representative, district
chiefs and village heads. For compensation to affected communities, the fund will flow
from ERSU through Zonal Unit to affected communities witnessed by local government
and district chiefs. For the cost of restoring infrastructures and providing replacement
land, ERSU will be responsible for carrying out the implementation and delivering the
products to the affected communities and individuals.
13



Appendix A-i
11. Consultations with, and participation of, displaced persons in planning,
inplementation
44.   The consultation with the affected people will take place early in the process of
resettlement planning. Before the socio-economic survey of resettlement impacts is
conducted, the resettlement staff from NEPA will carry out a reconnaissance survey to
identify the people and communities affected by the project. During the survey,
comments and opinions of local governments and affected communities on the project
will be collected and passed on to project planners. Continued consultation and
participation will take place during the comprehensive social economic and inventory
survey. During the survey, every affected household will be visited, and survey results
will be reviewed by the affected people. In addition, in the process of developing the
resettlement action plan, the local governments and affected people will be given
opportunities to review the compensation policies, rehabilitation measures, and make
site selection for the replacement land. Such consultation and participation will be
continued by ERSU staff through the resettlement implementation, which include
signing compensation contracts, delivering compensation to affected people, providing
replacement land, and restoring community infrastructures.
12. Grievance Redress Mechanism
45.   The affected people will be given many opportunities to review the survey results
and compensation policies during the process of resettlement planning and
implementation. However, during implementation, various issues might be encountered
by the resettlers. In order to resolve concerns effectively and quickly, a grievance redress
mechanism will be set up. The affected people will be notified about such mechanism
before the resettlement implementation.
46.   Under the proposed grievance procedure, if a person is not satisfied with his or
her compensation or rehabilitation measure, he could voice his complaint to the affected
village head or district chief. The village head or district chief will give him an answer
within two weeks. If he still does not agree with the solution, he could appeal to the
liaison officer of local government, who will given him a reply within two weeks. If he
still does not agree with the decision, he could appeal to the State Government and
through them appeal his case to NEPA. The State and NEPA will make a decision within
two weeks. If he still does not agree with the decision, he could go court as a last option.
13. Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangement
46.   Following the requirements of the World Bank, during the resettlement
implementation, both internal and external resettlement monitoring and evaluation
exercises will be carried out in order to monitor resettlement implementation and ensure
all affected people are compensated adequately and their income and livelihood are
restored after resettlement and rehabilitation.
14



Appendix A-1
Internal Monitoring
47.   The internal resettlement monitoring will be carried out by ERSU and its Zonal
Unit staff. The main purpose is for the transmission company management to have an
overview of the resettlement progress during project implementation. Every three months,
local Zonal Unit staff will report resettlement implementation progress for each
transmission line or substation project to ERSU headquarter unit. ERSU will compile
these individual project reports into an overall resettlement progress report for the whole
project.
48.   The report will include two parts. The first part is text section, which will provide
detailed explanation on resettlementprogress, fund allocation, and issues and problems as
well as solutions in the implementation. The second part includes a set of tables, which
provides a comparison between actual implementation for compensation delivered,
amount of houses demolished, amount of new houses constructed, etc. and those in the
resettlement action plan. In general, the internal monitoring will cover the following
aspects of resettlement implementation:
(1) the delivery and usage of resettlement compensation;
(2) allocation of replacement farmland and residential plots;
(3) reconstruction of new houses;
(4) restoration of community infrastructure and facilities;
(5) assistance for vulnerable group;
(6) implementation schedule;
(7) resettlement policies and compensation standards;
(8) efficiency of resettlement institutions.
External Monitoring and Evaluation
49.   For external resettlement monitoring and evaluation, an independent institution
will be selected to carry out external resettlement monitoring and evaluation. The seleced
institution should have extensive experience in social survey and resettlement monitoring.
The main objective is by independently monitoring and evaluating the resettlement
implementation, to see whether the objectives of the resettlement policy are aclieved; and
to provide basic assessment on resettlement implementation and restoration of livelihood
for the affected people.
50.   The scope of monitoring and evaluation includes the implementation progress,
resettlement policies, delivery of compensation and replacement land, changes of
income and livelihood among affected people, consultation and participation and
development of local communities. The method of resettlement monitoring and
evaluation will be based on a combination of sample household surveys and rapid
appraisal in the field. The basic steps of monitoring and evaluation efforts include:
15



Appendix A-1
(1) developing detailed work plan according to terms of reference;
(2) designing a survey scheme, including survey questions and survey forms;
(3) conducting baseline survey among affected people prior to resettlement
implementation;
(4) setting up information system for monitoring and evaluation;
(5) carrying out monitoring and evaluation surveys on sample villages,
households;
(6) processing the survey data and analyze the survey results;
(7) preparing resettlement monitoring and evaluation report (1-2 times a year
during the project implementation).
