Country: Guatemala                                                       Second Social Investment Fund Project
A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The project would be the Bank's second loan to the Social Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversi6n Social, FIS). It
would continue to support the Government's poverty alleviation efforts by targeting its investments to the poorest
areas and population groups in the country, and contribute to participatory decision-making by strengthening the
capacity of community-based organizations and local governments to define problems, prioritize needs, plan and
implement small-scale community-based subprojects, and ensure sustainability by developing adequate
arrangements for subproject operations and maintenance. The project would finance: (a) high priority social and
economic infrastructure and complementary goods and services; (b) training and consultant assistance to support
capacity building and project sustainability in the communities; and (c) strengthening of the central and regional
offices of the FIS, closer coordination with local governments and line ministries, ex-post and impact evaluations
of completed subprojects and beneficiary assessments, and the development of a coherent framework for the social
safety net. Progress toward these development objectives would be monitored and assessed according to the key
performance indicators outlined in Annex 1.
The project satisfies the requirements of the Bank's O.D. 4.20 because of the intensive targeting of FIS resources
to rural areas with a majority indigenous population, where poverty is most acute. Project progress, outcomes and
impact would be monitored and evaluated on a regular basis through the use of an agreed set of monitoring
indicators related to the number, type and quality of subprojects financed by the project, beneficiary participation
in the subproject cycle, and subproject processing times; subproject operations, community access to and use of
infrastructure and services financed by the loan, and adequacy of arrangements for operations and maintenance.
The impact of project investments would be measured using a number of social, economic and organizational
measures such as school enrollment, population coverage for selected basic health services, travel times to centers
of economic activity such as markets and social services, number and type of economic activities in the beneficiary
communities, participation of women in economic activities, and the number of community organizations,
including local governments, NGOs, mothers' clubs, school parent associations, which are functioning in a sample
of the areas in which several subprojects have been financed over the course of the project.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Coun try Assistance Strategy (CAS)goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 18036-GU Date of latest CAS discussion: 7/14/98
The objective of the CAS is to assist Guatemala in making peace stick by supporting efforts to form an inclusive
nation. To this end, the CAS emphasizes support in two inter-linked development priorities directly related to the
proposed project. First, building social cohesion and strengthen participatory decision-making by choosing,
designing, and implementing subprojects in ways that foster inclusion through decentralized decision-making and
implementation, and informed participation of beneficiaries, while strengthening communities. Second, reducing
poverty and exclusion by concentrating lending targeting the social safety net to the poorest members of society.
These priorities are being supported by a lending program that includes Basic Education Reform, Rural and Main
Roads, Low-Income Barrios, Reconstruction and Local Development, a proposed Land Fund project (FY99) and
the proposed FIS II project. The FIS is one of the key actors in the social safety net because of its participatory
decision-making nature, and its ability to reach remote impoverished areas with priority small-scale investments in
social and economic infrastructure and services.  It complements the work of the National Peace Fund
(FONAPAZ) by reaching poor areas not included in the former conflict areas (ZONAPAZ).
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:

Country: Guatemala                                                          Second Social Investment Fund Project
Poverty. Guatemala has the second-worst GINI coefficient among 64 low-to-middle income countries, and
widespread poverty akin to that of much poorer nations. Poverty is concentrated in rural areas which are inhabited
predominantly by indigenous groups, and is skewed toward women. It afflicts over 75 percent of the population,
86 percent of the rural population, and 70 percent of female-headed households (49 percent of which are in
extreme poverty). Geographic isolation and the effects of prolonged conflict on their assets and communities
compound the poverty affecting rural people. Poverty in Guatemala stems in part from unequal access to
productive assets and chronic low investment in human capital. Credit is scarce for all but the largest producers.
Although the current Government is reversing the trend, there has been a historic lack of public and private
investment in basic rural infrastructure - roads, communications, electricity, water and sanitation. Education and
health have received less than half the regional average share of GDP for decades, and this spending has had an
urban bias.
Government Strategy and Institutional Capacity. The key challenge for Guatemala is to sustain peace by
ending the exclusion that contributed to the conflict. To this end, reducing poverty, especially extreme poverty, is
key. The Government's development strategy, which takes into account the Peace Accords, recognizes that this
requires an increase in spending for social programs (expenditures in social and institutional development
programs are expected to rise from 5 to 9 percent of GDP), more effective delivery of social services that are better
targeted to the poorest, rapid improvements in infrastructure especially in rural areas, and clarification of land
ownership and tenure as well as functioning land markets and rural financial systems. The Government recognizes
the urgency of providing investments and services needed by the poor, especially in rural areas, and reversing the
historic tendency to a centralized public sector. Compounding this condition is the sheer magnitude of the task
given widespread poverty in the country. In order to deliver programs quickly in the short term while sectoral
reforms are being designed and implemented by the line ministries, the Government has established several social
funds, including the FIS. The social funds have been able to channel resources quickly to the poor, especially to
the most needy rural areas, by financing small social and economic subprojects proposed by communities, local
associations, municipalities, and other groups. It is expected that by working directly with communities and
municipalities, social funds will contribute to strengthening institutional capacity at the local level, which would
prepare communities to assume some of the responsibilities now managed by line ministries.
While social funds in general, and the FIS in particular, are playing a key role as part of the Government to fulfill
the targets set by the Peace Agreements, more effort has to go into ensuring that the social funds contribute to
poverty reduction in an effective and coordinated manner, and into determining their longer-run role relative to that
of the other agencies.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project would address the above-mentioned issues by expanding and improving social and economic
infrastructure, goods and services provided to the poorest communities, thus ensuring a more equitable allocation
of social expenditures and contributing to capacity building, particularly of beneficiaries, local communities and
social sector intermediary organizations. The project would have a particular focus on rural areas where most of
the indigenous people live, which is consistent with the policies of the Bank. The Government's strategic planning
for poverty alleviation policies, strategies, objectives and performance and alternatives for the future role of the
FIS, as well as the expected role of the other social funds, would be supported by the Bank and other donors. The
continued involvement of the Bank with the FIS would provide the means to tie the strategic planning exercise to
issues of resource allocation, targeting, decentralization, and institutional development of implementation capacity.

C: Project Description Summary
The project's total cost is estimated at US$64.0 million. It would be implemented over a four-and a half year
period starting in FY99 and would have three components: (i) community-based subprojects; (ii) institution
strengthening at the community level; and (iii) institutional development of the FIS.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The proposed project would contribute to the Government's poverty alleviation strategy and fulfillment of the
Peace Accords by providing support to the line ministries in the provision of social and economic infrastructure
and services to the rural areas. The FIS has demonstrated its ability to reach remote, under-served rural areas
which have benefited from only limited public sector investments. The investments in small-scale community-
based subprojects financed by the FIS complement the investments by the municipal governments and line
ministries and contribute to the decentralization of the Government by building local capacity to identify problems,
plan, execute and maintain subprojects. The emphasis on mutually-beneficial collective action, which is an
essential ingredient of the FIS subproject cycle, is widely recognized as one of the most important building blocks
of social capital.
3. Benefits and target population:
The benefits of the FIS project are expected to include expansion and improvement of social and economic
infrastructure and services in poor rural areas, stronger institutions and capacity to sustain them in poor
communities, and an increase in income-generating activities. The target population for the FIS since its inception
has been the poor municipalities throughout the country, as identified on the basis of a poverty map developed
during the preparation of the first project. The 1994 population census and indicators of unsatisfied basic needs
have been used to update the poverty map for the second project, and rank communities by poverty level. Five
poverty rankings were established for the first project and have been maintained. A recent review of FIS
accomplishments indicates that 49 percent of FIS resources has gone to communities in the two poorest categories
and less than 4 percent has gone to the communities with the lowest levels of poverty (see Annexes 9 and 10).
Indicative allocations of FIS resources have been made each year based on use of the poverty map. The FIS
targeting strategy has now combined the concept of unsatisfied basic needs with a new concept of "graduation" for
those communities which have satisfied most of their basic needs in social and economic infrastructure. This
strategy will allow the FIS to target more of its resources to the poorest communities. In addition, the FIS will
reinforce its community organizing efforts in the poorest microregions in order to compensate for the relatively
lower capacity of the poorest communities to organize and present project proposals to the FIS.
The first project supported by the Bank used a subproject menu which focused primarily on the construction and
rehabilitation of schools, health posts, water and sanitation systems, small roads and bridges, irrigation systems,
and community health, food and nutrition, and basic education subprojects. The FIS has proposed the use of a
negative list for the second project, which would give them greater flexibility to respond to the requests of the
communities. A negative list has been prepared, and was agreed with the Bank at negotiations. The negative list
includes subprojects involving involuntary resettlement and subprojects that would contribute to the alteration of
water flows or contamination of international waterways.
Beneficiary contributions for each FIS subproject are mandatory and usually consist of Labor (time spent in project
preparation and solicitation, project preparation, provision and transportation of local materials, in difficult
mountainous areas, and unskilled labor required for the project). Analysis of actual contributions indicates that
they average 11 percent of project cost and sometimes exceed the amount originally estimated if all of these inputs
are taken into account. FIS will review and revise its criteria to facilitate accounting for this contribution.
However, the nature of these contributions makes it difficult to register them, and providing the documentation
normally required for the accounting system; therefore no formal registration in the financial and accounting
records of the FIS will be required.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation Period: 4.5 years, FY1999 to FY2003
Executing Agency: The FIS would be responsible for overall project management, including the promotion,
appraisal, financing, approval and supervision of subprojects. The FIS is an autonomous government institution
with independent legal and financial status. It was created by a Congressional Decree to invest in activities which
would improve living conditions of the poor in rural Guatemala. The FIS has mobilized considerable support from
national resources and the international community, and had approved projects with a total value of TJS$62 million
by 1997. The absorptive capacity of the FIS has increased rapidly during the past 12 months as a result of
management improvements during 1997. The FIS was restructured into sector management units, additional
regional offices were created, and many administrative procedures were streamlined. The number of disbursements
required for small subprojects was reduced, and a less formal approach to local shopping was introduced. The
combined disbursements on loans and grants financed by IDB, IBRD, KfW, OECF and OPEC now average about
US$6 million per month.
Improvements to be financed by the new project would include a decentralization strategy which aims to bring the
FIS closer to the communities, reduce subproject processing time, accelerate subproject completion, increase
implementation capacity and improve the productivity of central and regional offices by training central and
regional offices staff to review and approve subprojects and manage procurement and subproject execution. The
management information system will be improved to support decentralization, as will the consultant and contractor
data bank, updated regional unit price lists, and standardized subproject processing criteria and procedures. The
decentralization process will begin in one regional office and extend gradually to others. Lessons learned in the
first regional office will be used to modify the decentralization program as needed. The loan will finance
investments in office equipment, training, and short term consultants, but not staff salaries, which will be paid with
government counterpart funds.
Project Coordination: Many of the subprojects identified by poor communities are traditionally supported by the
Ministries of Health (MOH), Education (MOE), Agriculture (MAGA) and Communication, Transport and Public
Works (MCTOP). FIS has interagency agreements with all of these to ensure that subprojects are appropriate and
do not duplicate ministry activities, and to ensure the line agency's ability commitment to fund recurrent costs not
covered by beneficiary communities. In addition, FIS has official agreements on coordination and cooperation
with the other social funds. FIS will continue to monitor the use of the agreements and identify other ways to
ensure effective interagency coordination with local governments, regional offices and NGOs. A regular review of
experience will serve to identify problems and best practices. As part of the coordination effort led by the FIS, the
Bank will continue to cooperate with other donors on project preparation and supervision missions
Since signing the Peace Accords, FONAPAZ was given the mandate to work in the post-conflict areas. FONAPAZ
emphasized rapid response; and FIS developed a more comprehensive but lengthier project cycle. The lessons
learned have benefited both organizations. The FIS has streamlined its subproject cycle, reduced bottlenecks in the
project pipeline, and become more efficient and more participatory. Both organizations work in some of the same
areas of the country, where poverty alleviation and the implementation of the Peace Accords overlap. There is
close coordination in the division of responsibilities through continuous communication at all levels of operations.
A definitive division of responsibility is unlikely because communities prefer to have the option of working with
both organizations. The new FIS targeting strategy takes into account the scope of the Basic Education Reform,
Reconstruction and Local Development, and Rural Roads projects supported by the Bank, and the activities of
DECOPAZ, a project financed by the IDB, the Community Development project financed by the Canadian
Government, the programs supported by the German Government in Alta and Baja Verapaz, and the activities of
the other funds and donors.
Project Oversight: The Social Cabinet, headed by the Vice President of the Republic, ensures policy formulation
and, among others, coordination of the FIS policies and programs with those of the other social sector entities in

the public sector. A five-member Board of Directors, with members appointed by the President of the Republic,
provides oversight for FIS policies and operations. The adequacy of financial management arrangements in the
FIS has been confirmed by a recent Bank review of the system and annual audit reports prepared for the first FIS
project by an external auditor acceptable to the Bank. For the new project, the FIS will be expected to implement
the new reporting modules required for Bank projects. As soon as the LACI requirements have been met, the legal
documents will have to be revised to reflect LACI's financial management condition.
Proiect Monitoring and Evaluation: The Bank will supervise project quality and performance of the FIS through
the Resident Mission and regular (at least twice yearly) project supervision missions, one of which would be an
annual implementation review. Supervision tasks would include the following: (a) a review of targeting and
promotion of subprojects and participation of women and all population groups; (b) subproject ex-post reviews,
quality and distribution of the portfolio between and among categories, internal processing rates, project unit costs
and procurement procedures, participation of communities, NGOs, and local governments, disposition of problem
subprojects; (c) progress of the training programs, decentralization of the FIS and improvements in the MIS; (d)
review of terms of reference, technical assistance and completed training activities; (e) monitoring of performance
indicators agreed with the FIS; (f) coordination with line ministries, other social funds, and municipal
governments; (g) other routine supervision and internal administration issues. The annual implementation review
would also discuss the proposed work program for the following year and proposed modifications in the FIS
program. The results of the annual evaluation of completed subprojects, beneficiary assessment and procurement
audit will be incorporated in the program of the FIS to improve performance. An impact evaluation at the
conclusion of the project would be designed to measure the medium to longer term costs and benefits of the FIS
investments, based on the experience gained in the evaluation of the first project and experience with impact
evaluations completed in other countries. Some of the key considerations of the impact evaluation are expected to
include targeting, subproject sustainability, community participation, and poverty impact.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
A single larger loan to FONAPAZ was considered by the Bank as an alternative to a second loan to the FIS;
however, this was ruled out because the FONAPAZ mandate extends only to the ZONAPAZ or former conflict
areas of the country which are included in the Peace Accords. Alternatively, the project investments could have
been managed by the respective line ministries. However, the capacity of the line ministries to manage numerous
small-scale investments in remote rural areas remains limited. The FIS has a proven track record in responding to
"bottom-up" demand and reaching isolated rural communities. The time required to respond to these demands is
expected to be reduced significantly as a result of the reorganization of the FIS and improved administrative and
subproject processing procedures introduced during the past eight months.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the proposed project design:
The project design reflects the social fund experience in Latin America which has been discussed in recent World
Bank and IDB reports as well as the findings of the FIS annual review mission of May 1997. The World Bank
report stresses the need for social funds to: (i) focus on well-defined subprojects; (ii) be operationally efficient;
(iii) obtain feedback from communities, beneficiaries, and coordinating agencies through monitoring and
evaluation; (iv) be transparent and accountable; (v) ensure proper targeting; (vi) make adequate arrangements for
subproject sustainability. The IDB report found that the social investment funds are efficient, transparent, and
relatively free from political interference and helped to improve the living conditions of the poor through the
provision of social and economic infrastructure and services. They should not attempt to replace or supplant other
public sector entities; they should reinforce and assist the work of other state institutions. The IDB recommended
that the social funds allocate more resources to training and community development, integrate environmental
concerns in their operations, and give greater emphasis to the involvement of women.
The Bank's annual review mission in 1997 identified some areas which needed improvement in FIS operations
related to contracting, supervision, operation and maintenance of completed subprojects. These problems have
been addressed through a detailed, time-based action plan. All of these issues have been discussed during project
preparation and reflected in the project composition and the implementation plan. The project would incorporate
an updated targeting mechanism, new environmental assessment procedures, streamlined subproject identification,

Country: Guatemala                                                       Second Social Investment Fund Project
preparation, procurement and disbursement procedures, improved accounting for beneficiary contributions,
community training for maintenance, and a greater focus on women. Beneficiary participation will be incorporated
in the entire subproject cycle, and a study of gender issues has identified way to increase the participation of
women in FIS activities. Decentralization and delegation of greater authority and responsibility to the regional
offices is expected to increase responsiveness to beneficiaries and increase the efficiency of FIS operations.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Borrower commitment has been demonstrated by the timely implementation of the detailed corrective action plan
agreed on August 31, 1997. During the pre-appraisal mission, the Vice President and Minister of Finance of the
country made explicit endorsements of the important role to be played by the FIS, and the office of the Vice
President made a commitment to seek extension of the FIS authorization to the year 2005 to ensure its continuity
and provide sufficient time for the new project to be completed. The FIS managers have contracted a series of
studies of NGOs, community banks, environment, procurement audit, ex-post evaluation of completed subprojects
and beneficiary assessment, whose findings and recommendations are being used to improve FIS policies and
operations.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank has assisted the Government in identifying areas for improvement in FIS policies and operations and in
designing corrective measures, especially in community participation, women's participation, environmental
assessment procedures, contracting and supervision. As part of its dialogue with the Government on public sector
expenditures, the Bank helped the Government to identify overlaps between the FIS programs and the activities of
the other social funds to eliminate duplication of efforts, coordinate activities, and maximize the efficiency of
resource allocation. The Bank had provided comments and suggestions for the Terms of Reference for project
preparation studies, made available international cross-country advice on the experience of FIS programs
elsewhere, especially in the LAC region, and had developed study tours and pre-project training for FIS staff. In
addition, the Bank has actively promoted donor coordination and the adaptation of consistent approaches and
policies with KfW, IDB, OECF, and OPEC.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
X Cost-Benefit Analysis; X Cost Effectiveness Analysis:
The social investment fund finances approximately 2,000 subprojects each year, and the composition of the project
portfolio varies each year according to the demand expressed by the beneficiaries. Because of this, it is impossible
to undertake a cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis in advance. The project monitoring system is used to
determine the cost of individual subprojects, and aggregated to determine average cost per subproject type, and
cost per beneficiary. Cost-effectiveness analyses may be applied to some subprojects such as rural roads and
bridges, schools, and other subprojects which are also financed through other means to determine the relative
efficiency of financing these subproject through the social investment fund. Additional indicators such as the cost
per number of jobs created and businesses established can also be tested. The Bank recently initiated a review of
experience to date in the economic analysis of social fund subprojects in an effort to improve the application of
economic analysis techniques to the community-based subprojects. The findings and recommendations of the
study will be discussed with the FIS when the results become available in early 1999 with the expectation that
updated economic analysis policies and practices will be introduced in the FIS as a result.

Country: Guatemala                                                      Second Social Investment Fund Project
2. Financial (seeAnnex5): NPV=US$ N/A       million; FRR= N/A
The project would finance the investment cost of cultural, social and economic infrastructure subprojects. Where
appropriate, subprojects will be expected to have an operations and maintenance plan with a simple financial
analysis of recurrent cost performed as part of the subproject appraisal process. The Bank would continue to work
with the FIS to review the experience with community banks and micro-credit activities in Guatemala and other
countries.  Several recent studies of the experience of the community banks have identified issues and
recommendations which are being studied by the FIS in the expectation that they will be incorporated into the next
round of community bank programs. This program will continue to evolve based on experience gained in
Guatemala and elsewhere in the development of microcredit programs. The Bank will support studies and training
for the banks, but will provide no financing for the credit activities of the banks.
3. Technical:
The FIS has developed technical criteria for each subproject type, based on existing norms from the respective
public agencies to ensure technical coherence and compatibility. These criteria have been updated and are being
incorporated in the revised Operations Manual, which will be used for all subprojects financed by the project.
Work is ongoing for water and sanitation, rural roads and environmental assessment procedures, all of which are
being reviewed by the Bank before they are incorporated in the revised Operations Manual. The FIS has adopted a
negative list, agreed at negotiations, to enable communities to identify subprojects which are not included in the
current FIS subproject menu. These subprojects may require feasibility studies depending upon the nature of the
subproject. It is anticipated that cultural heritage subprojects will be included in this category.
4. Institutional:
The project would be managed by FIS through its central Headquarters in Guatemala City and through its 22
departmental offices. A marked acceleration in the implementation and disbursement of the first project, which
occurred after the implementation of the corrective action plan, indicates that the FIS capacity has increased
significantly during the past 12 months. The FIS has subsequently identified additional ways to become more
efficient. A strategy for decentralizing some of the subproject identification, evaluation, approval and supervision
functions to reduce subproject processing times and make the FIS more responsive at the regional and local levels
was developed and reviewed by the Bank during the pre-appraisal mission. Further work will be undertaken to
clarify the division of responsibility between central and local govemments and beneficiary communities for the
operation and maintenance of completed subprojects, and will be reflected in the training activities financed by the
new project to strengthen community capacity. This is an ongoing effort which requires constant monitoring and
modification to adapt to local conditions. There is no single solution which will fit all subprojects.
Under the proposed new loan, subprojects requested by communities would be evaluated by the FIS and executed
by local contractors or NGOs or communities which meet agreed eligibility criteria included in the Operations
Manual. Training related to community strengthening, including the operation and maintenance of completed
subprojects, would be contracted out, primarily to NGOs. The FIS Operations Manual includes detailed
information on all phases of the subproject cycle from identification, design, and community participation through
implementation including technical and administrative supervision of ongoing works and arrangements for
subproject operations and maintenance. The manuals are currently being revised and updated. The completion of
this revision and confirmation of no-objection to the Manual by the Bank will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Any future modifications to the existing Manual related to the implementation of this project will require a no-
objection from the Bank before reimbursement for expenditures for project activities affected by the modifications
could be requested from the Bank.

5. Social:
During project preparation, emphasis was given to using the experience gained during the first phase of the FIS
operation. The lessons learned are reflected in the reorganization of the FIS, the updating of the targeting
mechanism, increased emphasis on community participation in the subproject cycle, and development of the
decentralization plan to bring the FIS closer to the communities it serves. As part of the evaluation of this
experience, the FIS contracted an external ex-post evaluation of completed subprojects and beneficiary assessment
to learn more about community priorities and their experience with the FIS (see Annex 10). The evaluation is
being used to increase participation, especially of the poorest communities, indigenous groups and women.
Through the Programa de Organizaci6n Comunitaria (POC), the FIS developed beneficiary training in social
organization to increase participation in the identification of needs, prioritization of investments, and operation and
maintenance of subprojects. Regular consultation with the communities and further training would be financed by
the project.
A study of gender issues was completed in October 1997. Some of its major findings included scarcity of
infornation about the situation of women; design of FIS subprojects to benefit women, promote or improve the
status of women; and lack of data on women's participation in the preparation, implementation or maintenance of
subprojects, such as community banks; moreover, the subproject cycle did not always accommodate the interests of
some groups of women. To address these issues, FIS used the POC to increase the participation of women. Early
results are good and FIS plans to use this methodology in other areas of the country. In addition, specific
monitoring indicators which measure women's participation will be included in the new project. The FIS will
review the subproject cycle and identify new approaches to facilitate women's participation. FIS staff are being
trained to increase sensitivity to women's issues, more women are being recruited for the regional offices and in
indigenous areas, and bilingual and multilingual staff are being increased.
6. EnvironmentalAssessment:        Environmental Category      L A    3 B   E C
Justification/Rationale for categorv rating:   The project would have no significant environmental risks.
Subprojects which involve involuntary resettlement or that would contribute to the contamination or alteration of
water flows of international waterways would not be financed by the Bank loan. Standard safety and
environmental assessment procedures have been developed by FIS consultants. Participatory mechanisms are
being proposed for use during subproject preparation to raise community awareness of environmental issues and
ensure their consideration in subproject design, implementation and operation.
Status of any other environmental studies: The Bank has reviewed the environmental evaluation criteria proposed
for the project and is providing technical assistance to update them to meet Bank standards and guidelines before
their inclusion in the updated Operations Manual. Capacity building activities would include community-based
orientation of beneficiaries to environmental issues and staff training in the use of environmental assessment
criteria and community education activities.
Local groups and NGOs consulted: CARE, FAFIDESS, FUNDAP, Don Bosco, Talita Kumi, ASOPRODE,
CODESAR, ADESPRO, NEUBA, ICOS, UNiFEM, local mayors, other political leaders, local staff of NGOs,
representatives of community organizations and beneficiaries in Quetzaltenango, Totonicapan, San Marcos, El
Quiche, Coban, Alta Verapaz, Izabal, Chiquimula, and Jalapa.
7. Participatory approach
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
During project preparation, several studies were undertaken in an effort to understand better the contributions and
participation of beneficiaries in general, and women in particular, in FIS subprojects, the role of NGOs and other
organizations of civil society, and the potential for increased participation of beneficiaries in the protection of their

environment in the context of working with the FIS. These studies involved visits to communities, focus groups,
individual interviews and other consultations with FIS staff in the center and the regions, with central and local
government officials, contractors who execute FIS subprojects. In addition, FIS has completed a beneficiary
assessment as part of the evaluation of experience to date. From this they are learning more about the priorities of
the communities and their expectations of FIS in the future. The study of gender issues included visits to a number
of communities and from interviews with beneficiaries. FIS recognizes the difficulty of working with women and
adapting its programs to the culture and characteristics of the indigenous groups and is working to increase
participation in these communities, especially of women. Additional work will be required to increase the
confidence of these communities in local capacity to improve living conditions and alleviate poverty. Diagnoses of
the experience of organizations of civil society and the NGOs in Guatemala point to the need to involve these
groups from the outset in problem diagnosis, prioritization of subprojects, and during all stages of the subproject
cycle, to simplify procedures. These findings have been reflected in the modified subproject cycle and updated
operations manuals and in the training of beneficiaries and community groups which have been included in the
proposed project.
b. Other key stakeholders:
Local government officials, including school teachers, community workers, staff and local contractors of the
regional offices of the FIS, NGOs, and representatives of the private sector have also been consulted in the context
of the evaluation, beneficiary assessment, and project preparation. In addition, key organizations - the IDB, KfW,
and representatives of the Canadian, Dutch, Japanese and Swedish governments - have been consulted.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Subproject sustainability will be ensured through:
(a) cooperation with the line ministries and updated agreements on their responsibility for the operation and
maintenance of some completed subprojects (as described in agreements between the FIS and those organizations);
and (b) a comprehensive program of beneficiary training in social organization, operations and maintenance of all
completed infrastructure subprojects, including the establishment of user groups/maintenance committees and
provision of a simple tool kit for water supply, and sanitation and access road subprojects and community
commitment to contribute to the cost of operations and maintenance; and
Regarding the sustainability of FIS as an institution, the FIS legislation provides an authorization up to May 31,
2001. The Government has emphasized repeatedly the importance of FIS in meeting the need for small-scale
infrastructure in poor areas of the country, which would justify the extension of the FIS mandate. High-level
government officials, including the Vice President of Guatemala and the Minister of Finance, have confirmed the
intention of the Government to seek an extension of the FIS mandate to 2005.

3. Possible ControversialAspects:
The extension of the FIS authorization to 2005 will require a two-thirds vote in the Congress. Because the FIS is
working at a national level with poor communities without regard to the politics of the poor areas, it is considered a
national, multi-partisan program by the current Administration. For this reason, the Government is confident that

it will be able to obtain the two-thirds majority vote required by the Congress to extend the FIS mandate. The
Bank has received a letter from the Office of the President of Guatemala which commits the Borrower to seek an
extension of the FIS authorization to 2005. The loan agreement contains a dated covenant which provides for the
presentation to the Congress of the draft law to extend the FIS authorization. It also includes remedies in the form
of suspension in the event that the Borrower does not make satisfactory arrangements to carry out the project
beyond May 31, 2001.
The FIS has developed a proposal for the decentralization of its activities and the reinforcement of the regional
offices to improve implementation capacity and responsiveness to communities. The capacity of the regional
offices is limited at present, but is expected to improve substantially during the second project.  The
decentralization of the FIS could provide lessons for the decentralization of other government entities and could
influence the pace and characteristics of other government decentralization initiatives.
G: Main Loan Conditions
1. Conditions of Effectiveness:
*   A revised Operations Manual, including environmental assessment criteria, acceptable to the Bank will be
adopted by the FIS;
*   A Subsidiary Agreement between the Borrower and the FIS making the proceeds of the loan available to the
FIS on terms acceptable to the Bank would be signed.
2. Other:
*   The Government would provide the necessary counterpart funds to cover its share of the investment
subprojects, and make adequate arrangements for the incremental recurrent costs of completed subprojects;
*   FIS would furnish semi-annual Project Implementation Reports acceptable to the Bank;
*   FIS would conduct joint Annual Implementation Reviews with the Bank;
*   FIS would furnish Annual Operating Plans acceptable to the Bank;
*   FIS would maintain staff with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank and inform the Bank of
changes in key staff;
*   FIS would contract each year an external ex-post evaluation of a representative sample of completed
subprojects and beneficiary assessment, as well as an impact evaluation at the conclusion of the project, all
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, with the findings of each evaluation to be discussed with the
Bank during the Annual Implementation Review;
* FIS would contract annual financial and procurement audits and submit completed reports to the Bank for
review and comment.

Project Description
Guatemala: Second Social Investment Fund Project
Proiect Description
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$64.0 million, of which the Bank would finance US$50.0 million.
The project would be implemented over a four-and a half year period starting in 1999, and would have three
components:
Project Component 1 - US$56.5 million - Community-Based Subproiects: (1) Social and Economic
Subproiects. The project would support a wide range of community-based demand-driven proposals including pre-
investment feasibility studies for small-scale infrastructure and services subprojects, such as schools, health posts,
water supply, sanitation and latrine systems, bridges and access roads, cultural heritage and productive activities.
The subprojects described above and other subprojects agreed with the Bank will be financed based on targeting
and selection criteria and procedures set out in the Operational Manual. Government counterpart funds would be
used to finance salaries and other operating cost of the FIS. Government counterpart funds would be used to
finance salaries and other operating costs of the FIS.
Project Component 2 - US$2.0 million - Community Training. The project would provide training linked to
individual subprojects for beneficiaries, local staff of line ministries, municipalities, in participatory planning,
problem identification, subproject prioritization, subproject implementation and supervision, subproject operations
and maintenance, cost recovery where appropriate, and environmental and gender issues.
Project Component 3 - US$5.0 million - Institutional Development. To improve the quality of subprojects and
FIS responsiveness to beneficiary communities, the project would support consultancies and staff training to
promote participatory planning, environmental concerns, community maintenance of subprojects and efforts to
increase the participation of women in FIS subprojects. The project would also finance the decentralization of the
FIS, including training of the staff in 22 departmental offices, MIS improvements in support of decentralization,
and related staff training; annual external ex-post reviews and procurement audits of completed subprojects,
beneficiary assessments, and a project impact evaluation at the conclusion of the project; a modest amount of MIS
and other office equipment, and vehicles for subproject supervision and decentralized operations; and through FIS
and interagency coordination and collaboration with Bank-supported sector work on poverty. This will focus on
the identification of vulnerable groups, interagency coordination, monitoring and evaluation.
Front end Fee - US$0.5 million

Annex 4
Economic Analysis
Guatemala: Second Social Investment Fund Project
Methodology and Assumptions.
The demand-driven nature of the project implies that communities will determine the nature and scope of each
subproject funded. Accordingly, neither benefits nor costs can be completely identified ex ante and it is not
possible to estimate an ex ante overall internal economic rate of return for the project as a whole nor
individually for the potential subprojects. Subprojects to be funded under the proposed project would, in
general, be similar to those subprojects funded and completed by FIS since 1994. Project monitoring of
individual subproject costs and the results of annual ex-post evaluation of completed subprojects would be used
to document project costs and benefits and internal cost-efficiency analyses could be made based on a
comparison across regions of the relative cost and benefits of similar subprojects including cost per
beneficiary. The unit price system used to estimate the cost of individual subprojects by project type will be
useful in this analysis.
Complementarity among community subprojects makes a precise overall quantitative analysis (i.e., economic
IRR calculation) difficult. The synergy created from the interactive effects of several subprojects within any
municipality is difficult to capture and equally difficult to quantify. Similarly, spill-overs and spill-ins, in the
form of incremental benefits or costs which are unintended, yet nonetheless result from the undertaking of the
subproject, must also be recognized in the economic analysis, but are both difficult to identify and quantify.
Community subprojects foster the creation of social capital. The demand-driven imperative of the subprojects
requires that communities identify and prioritize their most pressing needs. The FIS project preparation staff
will assist the beneficiaries, NGOs and other contractors, local governments and local and state organizations
to examine subproject proposals to confirm their feasibility and verify their compatibility with overall
community development objectives. Members of the community will be expected to assume responsibility for
a pre-defined percentage of the financing of each subproject, either in cash, in-kind, in labor or all three.
Qualitative recognition of these benefits is vital to a full understanding of the social and economic impact of
the individual subprojects. However, the benefits attained from reinforcing social capital in the beneficiary
communities will not be easy to quantify within the framework of estimation of internal economic rates of
return. The analysis is complicated further by the difficulty of documenting community and beneficiary
contributions, many of which are in-kind labor and/or other services. The FIS has agreed to develop a more
comprehensive system for recording both planned and actual beneficiary contributions.
Economic Efficiency of Subprojects.
Infrastructure and social (including cultural heritage) subprojects will be analyzed under the least cost, best
alternative criteria. Several aspects of project design help to ensure that infrastructure and social subprojects
undertaken represent the least-cost, best alternative. First, the demand-driven nature of each subproject permits
scarce resources to flow where they are most needed, thereby improving efficiency in the allocation.
Community participation and coordination with local governments and local organizations ensures that the
chosen subproject is the best alternative for the local community. Second, the use of standard technical
designs, including unit cost parameters, for the most common type of subprojects ensures that least cost models
are adopted and decreases search and information costs by providing communities with established patterns of
initiating and completing a subproject. The FIS will continue to maintain and update its regional cost data
base. Third, the contracting procedures prescribed in the Operations Manual require local shopping or
competitive bidding on the majority of subprojects; the FIS will solicit at least three bids for each subproject

and subsequently choose the least-cost bid. Finally, annual ex-post evaluations (including economic
evaluations) of an agreed sample of subprojects would be conducted and their recommendations included in the
annual project implementation reports and incorporated in the annual operating plan for the following year.

Main assumptions: Beneficiaries will demonstrate commitment and ownership of the subprojects by financing a
significant portion of the operation and maintenance of the investments, which will guarantee their sustainability.
Central and local government contributions which are subject to severe revenue-generating restrictions would be
kept to a minimum and cannot be expected to exceed the overall percentage of counterpart funding. The
implementation period will be four years with six additional months for disbursing on outstanding commitments.
The FIS expects that they may commit and disburse the full loan at a faster rate, possibly in two years, depending on
whether other cooperating agencies actually approve loans which are currently being prepared and negotiated.
The FIS is expected to continue to receive financing from other international organizations, including IDB and KfW.
Since all external co-financing is parallel rather than joint, no adverse effects on the Bank project would result if one
or the other of the external co-financing arrangements were to change. The Bank will monitor the overall amount of
commitments from co-financiers as part of its project monitoring and supervision activities and will support the FIS
when requested to do so in its efforts to coordinate project supervision missions and work plans with other donors to
ensure consistency among programs and avoid duplication and overlap.
Other assumptions: Recurrent costs have been calculated on the basis of FIS recurrent expenditures to date. The
assumption is that the FIS will continue to be the executing agency throughout the project and the program will not
be transferred to another agency. It also assumes that there will be no major reorganization or change in the staffing
level or character of FIS operations and that as regional offices are expanded, staff in the central office will be
reduced proportionally so that FIS operating costs will not rise. These projections also assume that counterpart
financing will be available, the financing of recurrent costs, which will be a condition of some subprojects, will be
assured, and that personnel will be available to staff schools and health posts and other subprojects.

Annex 6
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Guatemala: Second Social Investment Fund Project
Procurement
Procurement methods (see Table B). Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank guidelines for the procurement of goods, works, and services using
standard contract documents acceptable to the Bank: Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits, January 1995, revised January/August 1996 and September 1997; and Guidelines: Selection
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997, revised September 1997. The
FIS would manage all procurement actions under the project based on agreed procurement procedures
described in the FIS Operations Manual.
Subprojects. The FIS would finance small subprojects in poor rural communities such as the
construction and/or rehabilitation and equipment of primary schools, health posts, small agricultural
storage facilities, water and sanitation systems including latrines, small bridges and feeder roads, and
other subprojects which may be agreed between the Bank and the Borrower. Because of the small size
and scattered location of the subprojects, no International Competitive Bidding (ICB) is anticipated. The
average cost of these subprojects is less than US$50,000 equivalent and many of them are located in
remote rural areas. To the extent possible, contracts for works under subprojects would be grouped in
packages of US$150,000 equivalent or more. Works under subprojects costing more than US$150,000
equivalent would be contracted using National Competitive Bidding procedures (NCB). Contracts
estimated to cost between US$50,000 and US$150,000 equivalent, up to a total of US$ 20.0 million
equivalent, would be awarded on the basis of written quotations obtained by the FIS from at least three
qualified bidders which are opened and evaluated simultaneously.  In the case of contracts for
subprojects with an estimated cost of less than US$50,000 equivalent, up to a total of US$19.0 million
equivalent in remote rural locations, where the three quotation procedure described above is not feasible,
direct contracting would be permitted either with the only available or interested contractor, a local
NGO, or with the community as contractor provided that the community has the legal capacity to enter
into contracts or agreements. The provisions for Direct Contracting, Local Administration, or
Community Participation outlined in Sections 3.07, 3.08, and 3.15 of the Procurement Guidelines would
apply. In order to ensure fair pricing and cost efficiency, construction costs would be compared to a
regional unit price system which is updated periodically.
Goods. Goods to be procured under the project that are not included in the subprojects described above
would consist of vehicles, computers and other office equipment, education, promotion and training
materials. Because of the small quantities of goods to be procured and the nature of these purchases, no
ICB is anticipated. Contracts for goods estimated to cost US$50,000 equivalent or more would be
procured using NCB procedures. International shopping would be used for procurement of computers
and vehicles estimated to cost less than US$50,000, up to a total of US$0.3 million equivalent. Other
goods estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent, up to a total of US$0.3 million equivalent,
would be procured using national shopping on the basis of written quotations obtained from at least three
qualified suppliers.
Consultant Services. Consultant services would be procured using IBRD Consultant Guidelines and
standard contracts reviewed and approved by the Bank. Contracts for consultant services for the
information system, project monitoring and evaluation, external audit, and training programs would be
awarded on the basis of Quality Cost-Based Selection (QCBS). Contracts for other consultant services
for limited assignments and others where teams of consultants are not required would be awarded to
according to the provisions in Chapter V of the Consultant Guidelines. A plan for consultant services

Country: Guatemala                                                Second Social Investment Fund Project
would be included in the annual operating plan with draft terms of reference, the estimated cost of each
contract and procurement method to be used.
Prior Review Thresholds. Prior review by IBRD would be required for: (a) procurement arrangements
described in Appendix 1 of the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loan and IDA Credits,
January 1995, revised in January and August 1996 and September 1997; (b) the first two contracts each
year for works estimated to cost more than US$500,000 equivalent, and the first two contracts for goods
estimated to cost more than US$100,000 equivalent; (c) all contracts for vehicles and computer
equipment whose total cost exceeds US$100,000; and (d) for consultant services, all terms of reference,
as well as all contracts for individual consultants which exceed US$25,000 equivalent, and all contracts
with firms when the contract value exceeds US$50,000 equivalent. All other contracts would be subject
to ex-post review. Prior review of an estimated 30 percent is expected under these arrangements.
Furthermore, audit arrangements for the project include annual ex-post evaluations of a sample of
approximately 10 percent of completed subprojects and subproject procurement audits linked to the
annual financial audits, both conducted by external auditors. In addition, Bank supervision missions anad
similar project review procedures used by other donors such as IDB and KfW will complement the
Bank's review of procurement performance.
Disbursement
Allocation of Loan Proceeds (see Tables D & E). The proposed IBRD loan would be disbursed over a
period of about four and a half years, to be completed by December 31, 2002. The project closing date
would be June 30, 2003 (i.e. six months after the completion date). Disbursements would be in
accordance with the guidelines set out in the IBRD disbursement handbook. Disbursements would be
made against the following categories of expenditure: (a) Subprojects (up to 84%); (b) Goods, including
vehicles and parts, computers, communications and other office equipment and related materials (100%
of foreign expenditures and 75% of local expenditures); (c) technical assistance, training, workshops,
study tours, audits and evaluations (100%). Retroactive financing of up to US$5.0 million equivalent
would be permitted for eligible expenditures in all categories incurred after June 5, 1998, since the earlier
loan was fully disbursed in mid-1998, and a substantial pipeline of elegible subprojects has built up.
Use of Statements of Expenses (SOEs). Disbursements would be made on the basis of full
documentation for all expenditures made under contracts requiring prior review by the IBRD, as
indicated in Table C; and contracts whose value would be raised above the prior review limits as a result
of amendments. For all other expenditures, disbursements would be made against SOEs for which
supporting documents would be maintained by the FIS and made available on request to IBRD and
extemal auditors for review.
Special Account. To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a special account
in the Bank of Guatemala with an initial deposit of US$3.3 million equivalent, corresponding to an
average of four months' expenditures expected to be paid from the account. The Borrower will submit
replenishment applications on a monthly basis or when 25 percent of the authorized allocation has been
used, whichever occurs first. The replenishment applications will be supported by the necessary
documentation: a bank statement of the special account and a reconciliation of the special account
against Bank records. The special account would be audited in conjunction with the annual financial
audit of the project.
Audits. FIS would have the records and accounts of the project for each fiscal year, including the special
account, audited by an independent and qualified external auditors in accordance with generally accepted
international auditing standards and procedures, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.
Certified copies of the audit reports would be furnished to the Bank no later than six months after the end
of the FIS fiscal year. In addition, an annual procurement audit would be prepared by April 30 and

review the experience of the previous year. It would include a sample of subprojects in execution and
completed by April each year, and would examine all aspects of the subproject cycle from identification
through completion. Auditors would review the individual contracts, ascertain compliance with the
terms of the contracts and the Bank's procurement guidelines, inspect the progress of works and
reconcile physical progress with expenses incurred.
FIS Financial Management Systems and Conversion to the LACI Disbursement System. FIS has a
comprehensive budget and accounting system which provides detailed information by cost category and
project component. The system is designed to satisfy government accounting requirements, but does not
automatically generate project financial statements, which must be prepared separately. An accounting
module which generates project financial statements was developed and implemented in June, 1998 for
the IDB project, and will be extended to the new Bank project within three months after effectiveness.
The FIS has satisfied the financial audit covenant of the first project, and audit reports for the first FIS
project indicate that the financial management system is satisfactory. The FIS will implement a new
procedure to document community contributions which will be reviewed with the Ministry of Finance
and external auditors.

Social Assessment and Indigenous Peoples Participation
Guatemala: Second Social Investment Fund Project
Socioeconomic Conditions of Target Population
Social assessment has been an integral element of the ongoing efforts of the FIS to increase
community participation and improve targeting and subproject quality.  These efforts have been
advanced by several assessments and studies undertaken during the preparation of the project (see Annex
8). The findings are consistent with other social assessments which have been completed for other
projects in Guatemala. Educational attainment of the poor population over fifteen years of age in
Guatemala is lower, at less than two years, than in any other country in the region, and the illiteracy rate
in rural areas, at 66 percent, is the highest. The inadequate coverage of the health system is demonstrated
by the high infant mortality rate and low vaccination rates that result in periodic epidemics of
controllable communicable diseases.
The living conditions and the nature of the problems faced by poor communities do not vary with
differences in language and cultural heritage however these problems are exacerbated by the social and
cultural isolation experienced by the indigenous groups because of language and cultural differences.
The higher prevalence of poverty found in the indigenous communities when compared to non-
indigenous population groups is one of the key indicators of their disadvantaged status in Guatemala.
Guatemala's indigenous population represents almost 70 percent of the poorest income quintile and only
8 percent of the highest. Children who live in the indigenous regions and whose mothers have no
education experience malnutrition rates which are forty percent higher than in urban areas.
Women are twice as likely to be poor as men and rural women, particularly those in indigenous
communities, are among the most disadvantaged citizens of Guatemala. They often work 18 - 20 hours a
day in agriculture, child care, food preparation, gathering fuel wood and water, and other related work in
the house and on the farm. They have lower levels of educational attainment than men and are highly
dependant on their fathers and husbands for contact with the world outside their homes and immediate
community of relatives and friends. Although some programs such as improved stoves, health and
nutrition services, training of midwives and community banks are directed to women, the FIS has only
recently begun to develop a strategy to increase the participation of women in FIS subprojects and to
include women in community-based training activities beyond those mentioned above.
Targeting
The FIS has updated its poverty map in order to target its investments more closely to the most
vulnerable population groups in the country. Targeting has shifted from the use of a poverty line to an
index of unsatisfied basic needs because the latter method, using 1994 census data, permits the FIS to use
very specific disaggregated information on living conditions - housing, access to water and sanitation,
basic education and economic dependency levels - in each of the country's 330 municipalities and
achieve a precision which is not possible using a poverty line. A weighted index was created to rank
municipalities by poverty level which identifies the most deprived communities within each municipality.
The proportion of the country's poor population which lives in each area serves as the basis for the initial
distribution of FIS resources each year. This methodology will be accompanied by a policy of
"graduating" those communities which have already satisfied certain basic needs such as health, water
and sanitation and basic education. This will permit the FIS to shift an increasing proportion of its
resources to those communities which are having most difficulty moving out of poverty.

Participation and Community Organization2
Participation of the community throughout the subproject cycle has been uneven and varies from
region to region depending on the stage of advancement in community organization achieved at the local
level. Isolation and especially poor roads make community participation more difficult in areas such as
Alta and Baja Verapaz and Quiche. Women's participation is also very limited, particularly in decision-
making; it is not traditional for women to participate in or speak out at community meetings. Their
isolation is increased in cases where they speak only a native language and/or are illiterate.
Community participation in problem identification and definition of priorities though joint decision-
making is often influenced by the level of support provided by intermediary agencies such as NGOs,
municipalities, the church etc.. Difficulties encountered in attempting to comply with FIS technical and
financial requirements for subproject preparation may have biased some communities towards the
selection of less complex subprojects which may not be their real priority. Up to 1998, 60-70 percent of
FIS's investments were allocated to subprojects of low complexity such as school construction and
equipment.
Beneficiary Contributions
The communities contribute materials and unskilled labor during subproject execution; however,
they have no control over subproject executors or supervisors who are contracted by the FIS. Many
communities are not aware of their right to reject works which are not satisfactory. Community
contributions to subprojects financed by the FIS have been estimated at an average of about 11 percent of
total investment costs, however, empirical evidence indicates that the contribution rate is much higher.
The recording of actual contributions has not been accurate and complete. Moreover, accounting for
community contributions does not include community expenditures on subproject preparation (trips,
papers, etc.) nor women's labor when they substitute for men. The FIS procedures for recording and
including community contributions will be reviewed and improved under the new project.
Project Sustainability
Participation in subproject operations and maintenance can be problematic, particularly when
arrangements for subproject sustainability have not been agreed during project preparation. Communities
often need training in order to be able to assume responsibility for operations and maintenance. This
training needs to be coordinated with a more intensive effort to build community organizations which
endure. In order to receive FIS financing, communities have constituted an organization with temporary
legal status called an EFIS3. This mechanism has been used for administrative convenience but has had
limited impact on community organization; in some cases, it has overlapped with and even weakened
existing organizations. The Community Organization Program (POC) created by the FIS to support
community organization and enhance participation is helping to improve this situation. The Unit in
charge of the program is supporting the process for the EFIS to transform into permanent legal entities
and keep operating after individual subprojects have been completed. There are an estimated 2,500 EFIS
with legal status and about 19,000 grassroots organizations all over the country so there is tremendous
potential to strength local governance through these existing entities.

FIS is now involved in the final stages of an effort to: (i) simplify procedures for the entire
subproject cycle (new operations manuals are being finalized); (ii) continue to target poor rural areas and
increase the involvement of women and youth through new initiatives; (iii) broaden the subproject menu
to allow communities greater discretion in their prioritization and selection of subprojects which reflect
local conditions and respond to local needs; and (iv) strengthen community organization to enhance
community participation and subproject sustainability and ensure that existing community organizations.
attain permanent legal status. These activities which are designed to enhance the participation of
indigenous and non-indigenous community groups in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of
national, regional and local development plans which may affect them directly are consistent with the
Bank's O.D. 4.20 and the Intemational Labor Organization Accord Number 169. They are also
consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy and the Govemment's approach to poverty alleviation.
Institutional Development and Participation Plan for Indigenous People, Women and Youth
The institutional development program in support of strengthening community participation,
increased participation of women and indigenous groups and efficiency improvements will have several
thrusts. The simplification of the subproject identification and preparation procedures outlined in the
new Operations Manuals will facilitate the participation of the poorest communities (primarily
indigenous groups) that have limited institutional capacity and subproject design skills. Manuals for
training in subproject operations and sustainability will help local communities to continue their
capacity-building after the subproject execution phase has ended. Subprojects which are targeted
specifically to women such as midwifery training, organization of women for school feeding programs,
improved stoves and public laundries and training programs for the institutional development of women's
community organizations will receive special attention from the FIS.
The decentralization of the FIS will delegate more decision-making authority to the regional offices,
intensify the involvement of communities with regional, rather than central offices and staff of the FIS
and reduce the amount of time each subproject is in the pipeline. It will allow the regional offices to
respond to local conditions including language and cultural differences in the indigenous communities
and coordinate with local govemments more closely.
Staff recruitment efforts in the indigenous areas now give priority to bilingual and multilingual staff
(including women) who have the potential to improve relations with the indigenous groups and increase
the participation of indigenous women. The open subproject menu will allow communities and
subgroups within communities such as women and youth to identify subprojects that are of particular
interest to them.
In addition, the project will support workshops for FIS staff, community-based training of women's
groups to help them achieve a sustainable level of autonomy in the management of the affairs of their
various organizations, identification and testing of new instruments to promote the participation of
women based on experience in other countries, visits by FIS staff to successful programs in other
countries, construction of a map for targeting community training efforts in each region that provides
information on the capacity levels of local organizations, and exchanges of ideas and information with
other institutions in Guatemala.
The young people of Guatemala have been badly affected by the long civil war that reduced
opportunities for education and employment. The poor and indigenous youth in rural areas are
particularly affected. Several FIS programs such as self-employment, training centers and support for
small businesses have benefited young adults. However, there is a need to do much more; therefore FIS
will design a strategy to target youth specifically as part of the project.

Inter-institutional coordination will permit the FIS to achieve a multiplier effect by ensuring that FIS
investments complement rather than overlap with or duplicate those of the local governments, line
ministries, and NGOs and increasing their participation in the FIS subproject cycle by developing
agreements with them on regional and community work plans and subproject supervision and
maintenance arrangements. Project monitoring and evaluation indicators will be used to measure
progress in increasing the participation of women and youth, in reaching and working effectively with
indigenous groups and communities and making inter-institutional coordination agreements operable.
The Role of the NGOs
Presently there are in Guatemala around 300 umbrella-organizations integrated in nine consortia that
have developed strong institutions with capacity to promote and develop their own projects. Since 1992
the umbrella-NGOs have established a third tier organization, the Guatemalan NGOs Coordination
Forum (El Foro). This entity has gained a strategic position in the political and economic life of the
country. Until recently most NGOs concentrated on human rights issues particularly in Alta Verapaz,
Huehuetenango, El Quiche and San Marcos, the departments most affected by the civil war violence.
More recently NGOs involved in economic development have expanded their work to include
activities in education, health, agriculture, environment, water and sanitation, etc. Almost 90 percent of
these NGOs received financing from international agencies. Only 98 organizations recognized claimed to
have access to national resources; and only 34 claimed to have received resources from social funds and
municipal funds. In the case of FIS this relationship has been very slow to develop because according to
its mandate, it has the capacity to create its own direct executors, the EFIS (FIS enterprises). However,
NGOs can play a more important role in the future providing local support to train communities and
enhance grassroots organizations.

History and Accomplishments of the Guatemalan Social Investment Fund
Guatemala: Second Social Investment Fund Project
This annex provides a brief summary of the history and accomplishments to date of the Guatemalan
Social Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversion Social - FIS).
Background
The Fund is an autonomous institution of the Guatemalan government with independent legal and
financial status. It was created by Congressional Decree No. 13-93 on May 4, 1993 for a duration of
eight years for the purpose of investing in activities which would improve the living conditions of the
poor population of rural Guatemala. In order to accomplish this, the Fund has mobilized resources from
the national and international community and targeted its investments to subprojects which satisfy the
basic needs of rural Guatemalan communities. The World Bank supported the establishment of the fund
with a US$20 million loan which was approved by the Board of Directors in November, 1992.
The Fund is governed by a five-person Board of Directors and managed by an Executive Director
who is appointed by the President of the Republic. The Fund was originally organized along the lines of
the subproject cycle, with departments of promotion, evaluation, subproject implementation, control and
follow-up but this created problems of discontinuity and lack of coordination as subprojects moved
through the subproject cycle. In 1997, a reorganization established six new departments along sector
lines - water and sanitation, education, health, social infrastructure, productive subprojects and
environment.  Each department follows subprojects from identification through completion, thus
ensuring continuity, technical support and quality control which is well-coordinated and consistent
throughout the subproject cycle.
As the portfolio of the FIS has grown, it has become increasingly difficult to manage all aspects of its
operations from FIS Headquarters in Guatemala City. In 1997, ten new departmental offices were added
to the existing eight, additional staff were recruited, and plans were developed to modify operating
procedures in order to alleviate the congestion which had developed in the main offices, reduce the
delays in response time to requests from communities, and delegate more authority and responsibility to
the regional offices. Procurement, contract management and eventually, subproject approval functions
will be delegated to the regional offices. These decentralization efforts will be supported by the project
financing for equipment, training and technical assistance.
Accomplishments to Date
The Fund began to identify and prepare subprojects in 1993 and its portfolio has been growing
steadily ever since. Annual investments have increased from US$1.5 million in 1994 to US$23.5 million
in 1997. By the end of 1997, 3,593 subprojects with a total value of US$45.5 million had been
completed. Approximately three million Guatemalans have benefited from the investments of the Fund.
Education subprojects have dominated the portfolio with support for primary school construction and
rehabilitation, equipment and materials. More than 1700 classrooms have been built, in addition to
school offices, kitchens and sanitary facilities. Equipment purchased includes desks, tables, chairs,
kitchen equipment, blackboards and text books in Spanish and in indigenous languages. Support for
community-based pre-primary, non-formal and literacy programs has also been provided. The FIS
piloted a community-based pre-primary and primary education program in rural areas which in 1996

became the Ministry of Education's central strategy for expanding the coverage of education services in
rural areas (PRONADE - National Community-Managed Program for Educational Development). More
than 15,000 teachers have received training with FIS resources.
Water and sanitation subprojects have benefited more than 25,000 families and more than 10,000
latrines have been constructed. During 1997, the FIS expanded its assistance to the health sector; 674
health posts were equipped, 45 new posts were constructed, more than 500 midwives and health
promoters were trained and provided with basic equipment, 17 community pharmacies were organized
and provided with an initial supply of medicines. Other subprojects financed include small rural bridges
and access roads, and more than 40,000 improved cooking stoves, which use half as much wood as
traditional stoves. Environmental subprojects in solid waste management, agro-forestry and alternative
uses of energy have recently been added to the subproject portfolio in response to community demand.
The Fund is working with community banks in the poorest communities in an effort to provide
opportunities for women to move from subsistence to market by helping them to develop their marketing,
money management and entrepreneurial skill through small scale productive activities which most often
begin as home-based enterprises. In the two years that the FIS has supported community banks, they
have financed, through NGOs, 73 banks. Other productive subprojects include storage for agricultural
products and small scale irrigation systems.

l FIS's targeting system is based on a classification of municipalities into five poverty categories, according to the results of a
formula incorporating key social indicators: (i) housing density (persons per room); (ii) quality of housing; (iii) access to basic
sanitation services; (iv) access to potable water supply; (v) access to primary education;
and (vi) dependency.
