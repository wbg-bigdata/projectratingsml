MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL EXPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development Credit to Tanzania for SDR22.0 million (US$30.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit would be made
on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity. It would finance enterprises
engaged in export agriculture as well as technical assistance and training
to the Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (CRDB).
2.       Background.  Agriculture is the most important sector in
Tanzania's economy although its contribution to GDP declined from 57
percent in 1960 to 46 percent in 1984. It contributes 80 percent of
exports and provides employment to 83 percent of the labor force, and is a
major source of food and raw materials for the urban and industrial sectors
and of Government revenues needed for the development of the economy. The
agricultural population is an important market for the goods and services
produced in the industrial sector.
3.       Agricultural production and exports of major crops were the engine
of economic growth in Tanzania until the mid-1970s when they began to
decline rapidly. This was mainly caused by Government's macro-economic
policies and institutional changes which did not provide sufficient
incentives and resources to sustain agricultural production. To reverse
the trend of declining agricultural production, the Government of Tanzania
(GOT) through its Economic Recovery Program (ERP), has started remedying
the defects of past policies. In addition to a major devaluation and
continuing real adjustments in the exchange rate, GOT has introduced major
reforms in the agricultural sector. GOT has increased producer prices in
real terms, widened quality margins, substantially liberalized the
marketing of food grains, re-established cooperative unions to take over
from parastatals the responsibilities for farm-level crop purchases,
liberalized the marketing of minor export crops, and permitted several
private estates to market their produce directly instead of through
marketing boards. The Government has agreed to liberalize agricultural
export marketing and the importation and distribution of all agricultural
inputs other than fertilizers and seeds. The next step in the reform
process is expected to focus on opening up the marketing of export crops at
the farm level to tll marketing agents, including private traders.
4.       With these reforms, the decline in agricultural output in recent
years has been arrested and agricultural exports have been enhanced. This
is because, in the new policy environment, many agricultural export
enterprises in the various crop sub-sectors now find it profitable to begin
investing in the rehabilitation and upgrading of their plants and
equipment. These enterprises, including potential new entrants, need
medium- and long-term foreign exchange credit for this purpose. The
financial intermediary, the Cooperative and Rural Development Bank, through
which most agricultural credit is channelled, itself requires strengthening
to enhance its capacity to service the agricultural sector effectively.

5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The rationale for IDA involvement,
particularly its timing, lies in helping agricultural export-related
enterprises to expani their exports in response to the changes in the
policy environment as described in paras 2-4 and agreed under the Multi-
Sector Rehabilitation Credit (MRC). By helping these enterprises and
thereby improving the country's balance of payments position, IDA would
contribute to the sustainability of the liberalization which is a major
element of IDA sector development and overall macro development strategy
for Tanzania. IDA's role is crucial in supporting entrepreneurship among
Tanzanian nationals in the agricultural sector and ensuring that the
longer-te-m task of building the capacity of CRDB to supply medium- to
long-term agricultural credit gets underway and fits within a proper policy
framework. The provision of agricultural credit is an essential part of
IDA's strategy for improving basic services including research, extension,
credit and marketing. There are many donors in the agricultural sector in
Tanzania; however, there remains a considerable need which is not currently
being met with regard to foreign exchange credit to export agriculture.
IDA's assistance under this project would fill part of this gap and thereby
supplement the assistance provided by other donors.
6.       Proiect Obiectives.  The project's aims are to increase exports
through support to export-related agricultural enterprises and strengthen
the capability of CRDB, Tanzania's only specialized agricultural bank, to
become a viable agricultural lending institution.
7.       Project Description.  The project, to be implemented over a period
of up to eight years, provides funds for capital and recurrent import costs
required to rehabilitate or expand agricultural export enterprises,
training of CRDB staff, and technical assistance support to CRDB. The
total cost of the project is estimated at US$40.0 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$28.0 million (70Z). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Tanzania are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map of Tanzania, IBRD No. 19829 and Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6958-TA dated March 1, 1988 are attached.
8.       Agreed Actions.  All major issues have been resolved with the
Government. The Government has agreed on the following actions as
conditions of Credit effectiveness: (a) converting its outstanding loans
to CRDB (TSh 588.0 million) into equity capital and CRDB using it to write-
off its outstanding bad debts as of June 30, 1987; (b) restructuring and
maintaining CRDB's loan committee with membership and terms of reference
satisfactory to the Association; and (c) signing of a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Government and CRDB satisfactory to the Association.
9.       At Negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Borrower on a
monitorable action program requiring CRDB to take actions in order to
improve its performance as follows: (a) complete its staff redeployment
and where warranted retrenchment by September 30, 1989; (b) furrnish to the
Association by not later than September 30, 1988, a financial plan with a
view to achieving and maintaining (i) in all its ordinary operations an
adequate financial spread over its borrowing rates to cover its costs of
operation and ensure a reasonable profit margin, (ii) a fixed charges
coverage of at least 1.25 times, (iii) a liquidity ratio of at least 1.5 by



- 3 -
June 30, 1990, (iv) an operating profit margin of at least 102 by June 30,
1990, and (v) a rate of return of at least 1.2Z on total average assets and
102 on equity by June 30, 1990; (c) furnish to the Association by not later
than September 30, 1988 a plan to reduce its remaining loan arrears as of
June 30, 1987 by 331/3Z annually leading to the elimination of such arrears
by not later than June 30, 1991; and (d) complete the review of its
accounting and computer systems by September 30, 1988, and update the
accounting system and implement financial information system by June 30,
1989.
10.      In addition, assurances were also obtained from Government at
Negotiations that: (a) the sub-borrowers would be permitted to maintain
foreign exchange escrow accounts sufficient to cover the debt-service
requirements of loans under the project from their export proceeds; (b)
CRDB would be permitted to maintain a foreign exchange account to cover
loss provisions from their earnings under the project; and (c) Government
would set non-discriminatory terms and ensure equal access to the credit by
eligible sub-borrowers without regard to form of ownership.
il.      Benefits.  A broad spectrum of agricultural enterprises throughout
Tanzania would benefit from the project. This should help strengthen the
entrepreneurial basis of the agricultural sector. The project would foster
greater capacity utilization, improved productivity and efficiency, and
improved agricultural term-lending capacity of CRDB. However, the main
benefit from the project is expected to be an increase in Tanzania's
exports following the rehabilitation and expansion of viable enterprises,
and an improvement in the quality of produce and hence price. The economic
rate of return for individual sub-loan investments are expected to exceed
15? and in most cases, would be substantially higher.
12.      Risks.  The main risks associated with the project relate to the
possible waning of the Government's commitment to maintain the momentum of
policy reform, particularly as it relates to liberalization of crop and
input marketing and producer pricing. Thus far, indications are that the
Government's determination has not waned and this project would, in fact,
help consolidate the reform process by providing inputs urgently required
to obtain an export response. There is also the risk that the credit
disbursement could be delayed if there are delays in the restructuring of
CRDB and the strengthening of its capacity to process loan applications.
This risk has been minimized by front-loading of studies and agreements
related to the restructuring of CRDB, and by providing technical assistance
to prepare feasibility studies of sub-projects and assist CRDB in project
implementation.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
