                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Task Team conducted a re-engagement mission in Guinea from March 28 to April 10, 2011 that included field visits to rural communities. The mission assessed that the National
                         Coordination Team remained intact and generally supervised the project despite suspension of disbursements since December 2008. Furthermore during the field visits, the team
                         met with beneficiary communities all of whom continued to work with the National Coordination Team (NCT) during the suspension period to update their Local Development Plans,
