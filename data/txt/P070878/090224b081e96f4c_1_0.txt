                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR covers the findings of an implementation support and supervision mission held in Guinea from May 20 to 30. The mission noted that project activities are progressing well,
                         including the final creation process of the two marine protected areas (MPAs) targeted by the project, and the implementation of Income-Generating Activities (IGAs) and NRM Micro-
                         Projects (MPs) to benefit communities adjacent to the MPAs: (i) the MPAs of Alcatraz and Tristao (90,000 ha of which Alcatraz 5,000 ha and Tristao 85,000 ha) have been created
                         by ministerial order and the presidential decrees to finalize the creation process have now been signed; (ii) All 11 rural communities participating in the project have developed

                         income generating activities (IGAs) and NRM micro-projects (MPs) and their implementation is satisfactory.

                         Based on the foregoing, the mission has upgraded IP and progress towards PDO/GEO achievement to satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government intends to request a follow on project to build on the results achieved and extend project coverage to rural communities that could not be covered under the current
                         project due to the political situation that led to Bank projects suspension for approximately 2 years and subsequent project restructuring in 2011 that reduced project scope from 17
                         communities to 11.
