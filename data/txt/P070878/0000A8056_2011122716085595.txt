                         The task team conducted a post-restructuring mission from October 17 to 28, 2011. The mission assessed that activities implementation progressed normally on the ground based
                         on the orientations provided in the level one restructuring paper approved by the Board in May 2011. Noteworthy are the following: (i) the 2 targeted Marine Protected Areas (MPA)
                         for a total surface area of 90,000 ha have been created by Ministerial Arretes. A presidential decree is in the process of being signed to finalize the creation process; (ii) all 11
                         participating rural communities adjacent to the MPAs have identified and included environmental protection and natural resource management micro-projects in their Annual

                         have also registered significant progress. The task team is of the opinion that the potential of achieving the project objectives is greater now than before the restructuring. The team
                         will however maintain progress towards achievement of PDO and Overall Implementation Progress as Moderately Satisfactory. These ratings will be revisited after the next
                         implementation support mission tentatively scheduled for April/May 2012 that will assess the progress of micro-projects implementation as well as verify the actual signature of the
