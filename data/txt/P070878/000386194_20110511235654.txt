Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
To promote rational management of the Recipient’s coastal biodiversity for both conservation and
sustainable development ends in selected priority areas (up to 17 of the Recipient’s Rural Development
Communities), with a focus on those around sites identified under the Ramsar List of Wetlands of
International Importance and shared watersheds, notably Alcatraz Island, Rio Pongo and Tristao Islands),
with a particular emphasis on assisting communities in and around these priority areas to plan, implement
and maintain environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive alternative livelihoods options.

The Global Environmental Objective (GEO) : The original GEO is to promote conservation of globally and
nationally significant habitats and species in Guinea’s coastal zone in selected priority areas encompassing
coastal Ramsar Sites.

7b. Revised Project Development Objectives/Outcomes

The revised combined PDO & GEO: To improve the conservation of the Recipient’s coastal and marine
biological resources in selected Ramsar Sites.

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



  A. SUMMARY

1. This is a level one restructuring of the Guinea Coastal, Marine, and Biodiversity
Management Project (the Project). The Restructuring Paper seeks the approval of the
Executive Directors to introduce changes to the project, and accompanying amendments
to the Project’s legal documents. The changes include: (i) a revision of the Project
Development Objectives (PDO); (ii) a reduction in the scope of project components; (iii)
an extension of the Project Closing Date by 24 months, from December 31, 2011 to
December 31, 2013; and (iv) a reallocation of the Grant Proceeds and an increase in the
ceiling of the Special account from its current USD550,000 to USD1,000,000.

2. The main reason for the proposed changes is to minimize the impact of the
suspension of disbursements since December 2008 following the political and social
unrest in the country.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

3. The project was approved on June 22, 2006 and became effective on July 20, 2007.
The GEF grant amount is USD5 million and the disbursement amount to date is USD0.62
million representing a 12.32% disbursement rate. Given the suspension of disbursements,
implementation of project activities came to a halt which led to a rating of moderately
unsatisfactory of both progress towards achieving the PDO and the overall
implementation progress. This project was not rated Unsatisfactory based on the fact that
the team remained intact and generally supervised the project and ensured that project
audits were completed in a timely manner. The mid-term review (MTR) initially planned
for June 30, 2009 could not be undertaken due to the political unrest.

4. Following the Presidential elections of November 2010 and the subsequent
reengagement of the Bank in Guinea, the task team conducted an implementation support
mission from March 28 to April 10, 2011. The mission thoroughly reassessed the project
and covered all aspects related to an MTR. As a result of this mission, the task team and
the Government agreed to restructure the project as described above, mainly to make up
for the time lost since December 2008 and to enhance the potential of achieving the PDO.
The Government’s request letter dated April 12, 2011 is attached in Annex 5. Should the
two-year extension be granted, the team will carry out a light MTR to confirm progress
and that project is back on track.



                                           7
5.     The new Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Guinea has been approved and the
suspension on the disbursements has been lifted as of April 21, 2011.

  C. PROPOSED CHANGES

6. Project’s Development Objective (PDO): The original PDO is to "promote rational
management of the Recipient’s coastal biodiversity for both conservation and sustainable
development ends in selected priority areas (up to 17 of the Recipient’s Rural
Development Communities), with a focus on those around sites identified under the
Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance and shared watersheds, notably
Alcatraz Island, Rio Pongo and Tristao Islands), with a particular emphasis on assisting
communities in and around these priority areas to plan, implement and maintain
environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive alternative livelihoods options".

7. The Global Environmental Objective (GEO): The original GEO is to "promote
conservation of globally and nationally significant habitats and species in Guinea’s
coastal zone in selected priority areas encompassing coastal Ramsar Sites".

8. The PDO has been simplified while maintaining its substance, and combined with the
GEO.

9. The revised and combined PDO and GEO will be: To improve the conservation of
the Recipient’s coastal and marine biological resources in selected Ramsar Sites.

10. Results/indicators: The proposed PDO/GEO level indicators are: (i) Surface area
classified as Protected Marine Areas; and (ii) the number of communities practicing
conservation measures in the MPAs. The first indicator will measure the increase in the
area being included as conservation activity sanctuaries. The second one will measure
the number of adjacent communities who are using agreed conservation measures in the
created sanctuaries. The new results matrix and the corresponding realigned indicators
are attached in Annex 1.

11. Components: The components have been reduced in scope to focus on those
activities that can have a rapid positive impact on the rural populations, thereby reducing
pressure on the natural resources, while also attaining the objective of improved
conservation of Guinea’s marine biological resources. Instead of the five initial
components, project activities have been consolidated and restructured into four
components: (i) Creation of MPAs in Ramsar Sites and support to their management; (ii)
Capacity Building for MPAs management; (iii) Support to participative local
development ; and (iv) Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation. Only those
activities that can be completed within the extension period and that contribute to the
achievement of the PDO have been maintained. The specifics of the changes in the
components are presented in a matrix in Annex 2.
                                            8
12. Institutional arrangements: Changes are proposed in the project’s institutional
arrangements as follows: the National Coordination Unit is now under the responsibility
of the Ministry of Decentralization, in replacement of the Ministry of Planning. The
newly created Office of Biological Diversity and Protected Areas (OGDBAP), which
operates under the purview of the Ministry of Environment , will be leading the creation
of MPAs (component one) and related capacity building (component two). The
components matrix in annex 2 presents these changes.

13. Financing: Project costs have been revised as follows:


                                        Project Costs (USD)
                           Components/Activities                                   Current1       Proposed
       Component 1: Creation of Marine Protected Areas in Ramsar                    900,000        1,049,000
       Sites & support to their management

       Component 3: support to participative local development                    1.600,000        1,819,000
       Component 4: Local Capacity Building (merged with comp 3)                  1,000,000            0,000
       Component 5: Project Management and Monitoring &                             800,000          919,000
       Evaluation
       Total                                                                      5,000,000        5,000,000

14. Reallocation of the grant proceeds and increase in the ceiling of the Special Account:
The Government of Guinea requested a reallocation of GEF proceeds to align the project
budget to the selected activities. They have also requested an increase of the Special
Account ceiling from USD550,000 to USD1,000,000 to accelerate physical and financial
execution. The procurement plan has been revised accordingly, project staff are available
to accelerate implementation, and there is an absorptive capacity for this increased ceiling
The reallocation includes the following changes:

(i) an increase in “Goods?, “Works?, “Training? and “Operating Costs? categories to:
      (a) strengthen the capacity of the newly created office for biological resources and
         protected areas management (OGDBAP) for a sustainable management of MPAs
         to be created by the project;
      (b) enhance the capacity of communities for the development and implementation
         of Natural Resources Management micro-projects, and to co-manage the created
         MPAs along with the OGDBAP; and
      (c) enhance the operating capacity of the Project Implementation Unit to intensify
         its support to the communities thereby ensuring prompt and effective
         implementation of micro-projects;

    If the project has had a previous restructuring, the current should reflect the latest approved costs.
                                                          9
(ii) a decrease of funds in the “Consultant Services & Audit? as studies related to the
measurement of trends for key species and water quality indicators and the stabilization
of natural resource base are no longer required under the restructured project - the
measurement of these indicators would take longer to obtain than could be done, even in
the context of the proposed two-year extension; and,

(iii) a decrease in sub-projects category given that the project will now focus on 11 local
communities within the extension period instead of the 17 initially planned during a period
of five years. The new reallocation table is presented below:

                   Categories                    Allocation in USD              Percentage

   Total



15. Closing date: The Government has also requested an extension of the closing date
from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2013. The extension will enable the
Government to minimize the impact of the suspension of disbursements since 2008
through the completion of selected activities that will enhance the potential of achieving
the PDO. The Government has prepared a work plan covering the extension period which
has been determined to be acceptable to the Bank. The work plan is attached as Annex 3,
and the procurement plan for the remaining duration of the project is attached as Annex
4.

Original PDO: To promote rational management of the Recipient’s coastal biodiversity for both conservation and sustainable development ends in selected priority areas (up to 17 of the Recipient’s Rural Development
Communities), with a focus on those around sites identified under the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance and shared watersheds, notably Alcatraz Island, Rio Pongo and Tristao Islands), with a particular
emphasis on assisting communities in and around these priority areas to plan, implement and maintain environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive alternative livelihoods options.
Original GEF Global Environmental Objective (GEO): is to strengthen the conservation of globally and national significant habitats and species in Guinea’s coastal zone in priority areas encompassing several coastal
ramset sites.

New combined Project Development Objective (PDO)/Global Environmental Objectives: (GE0): To improve the conservation of the Recipient’s coastal and marine biological resources in selected Ramsar sites.
