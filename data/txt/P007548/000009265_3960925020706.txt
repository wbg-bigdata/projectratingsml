PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
First and Second Small and Medium Scale Industry (SMI)
Development Projects
Loans 1552-ME and 1881-ME
PREFACE
This report reviews the performance of the First and Second Small
and Medium Scale Industry (SMI) Development Loans channeled through NAFIN
(Industrial Development Bank) for onlending by the following three NAFIN
trust funds: Fondo de Garantia y Fomento a la Industria Mediana y Pequena
(FOGAIN), Fondo Nacional de Eomento Industrial (FOMIN) and Fideicomiso de
Conjuntos, Parques y Ciudades Industriales (FIDEIN). The coordinating
committee for the project agencies which was created as part of the
Integrated Program for SMIs, Is known as PAI. The report covers the
implementation period from the inception of the PAI program in 1978 until
1985 which is the termination date for the Second SMI Loan (1881-ME).
The PAI scheme of integrated support to SMI's is a unique
experiment, in that it is the only SMI loan of its type supported by the
Bank.  Under the project, different types of financial services were
brought together, though the beneficiaries were allowed the flexibility to
choose from amongst the line of credit they needed and in this sense the
acronym "Integrated" could be considered a misnomer.. The PAl extension
service however lent some credence to an integrated approach in that it
served the clients of FOGAIN, FOMIN and FIDEIN, in promoting their programs
and providing badly needed technical advice.
Loan 1552-HE was approved on April 27, 1978, declared effective
on January 12, 1979, and disbursed until September 30, 1982. The delays in
loan effectiveness were mainly due to the lack of agreement to implement
interest rates agreed upon during negotiations.   Loan 1881 was approved on
June 24, 1980, and became effective on December 22, 1980. The loan was
completed on June 30, 1985.
This report is based upon the data obtained during two Bank
missions to Mexico in May and June 1986. The preparatory work for this PCR
was carried out under the overall direction of PAI's Technical
Secretariat. The final report was prepared by the Industrial Development
and Finance Division 2, of the Projects Department, Latin America and the
Caribbean Region.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report xms read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were
received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
First and Second Small and Medium Scale Industry (SMI)
Development Projects
Loans 1552-ME and 1881-ME
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The PAI program was the first Bank involvement in an integrated
development program for SMI's in the industrial sector and as such the
implementation experience is unique, in so far as it relates to the
provision of various financing packages to a common clientele (SMI's) and
also the experience with the coordinating mechanism set up to manage a
complex project with several componentsc The two loans under review in
this report were the first two industrial credit loans for SMI development
made to Mexico in support of the Government's Integrated Program for SMI
development known as PAI. The loans were in the amounts of US$47 million
and US$100 million, respectively. The project was implemented through the
following three key trust funds managed by NAFIN: FOGAIN, (the trust fund
for credit to SMI's); FOMIN, (the trust fund for equity and quasi-equity
financing) and FIDEIN, (the trust fund responsible for industrial park
development). In addition, for the first time an industrial extension
service was established which worked in close collaboration with the
implementing agencies and other existing specialized technical assistance
agencies in Mexico.
2.        The Bank's principal objective under the two loans was to foster
more rapid growth in output and employment and to promote regional
development by strengthening the existing system of providing term
financing for financially sound and economically efficient investment
projects of small and medium-sized firms (para 2.02). Secondary objectives
focused .on the institutional development of the executing agencies, the
operation of an industrial extension service, and support to other
technical assistance and research inatitutions involved in the industrial
sector. Project implementation has been reasonably smooth and loan fund
utilization timely (para. 4.01-4.03), particularly in the early
implementation period which coincided with the boom conditions in the
Mexican economy (para. 1.02-1.03).
3.        The subprojects financed by FOGAIN have had a positive economic
impact with significant employment generation. The bulk of subloans have
gone to the small end of the industrial size spectrum (paras. 4.07-4.14).
The FOMIN equity investment portfolio had mixed results in terms of
profitability, but most loans were in support of high priority investment
activities. Nevertheless, FOMIN was not instrumental in financing new
enterprises and most of its equity investments were confined to existing
enterprises or holding companies. Under both loans, FIDEIN operations went
through an experimental stage, and eventually it withdrew from its direct
construction role (para. 3.24). While FIDEIN operations were helpful to
the eytent that they had a positive demonstration effect, the investments
did not make any significant contribution to the decentralization objective
rarely did



existing enterprises relocate in industrial zones, only new enterprises
sought space in industrial parks which offered clear market and other
advantages. Similarly, the industrial estates, developed by FIDEIN had
varied success, with a high occupancy rate for only half of those
developed, while the rest failed to expand their available capacities
fully.
4.        While the two SMI loans were conceived and implemented without
any broad financial sector policy objectives, the Bank must be credited
with influencing interest rate policy for lending to the SMI sector (para.
3.08 - 3.10). At the time the first project was appraised FOGAIN operated
a fixed interest rate structure which was not subjected to periodic reviews
to bring it in line with either market interaes rates or the cost of FOGAIN
funds. The Bank assisted projects gradually initiated the rationalization
of interest rates by FOGAIN moving it to link its subloans to the average
cost of funds (ACr) index and under the 3econd SMI project FOGAIN narrowed
the interest rate differentials which existed for different sizes of
borrowers and for different locations. Through this gradual process of
reform the Bank helped to introduce variable interest rates for FOGAIN
lending under the third SMI project (Loan 2325-ME). The introduction of
variable interest rates clearly demonstrated a positive impact on the
financial operations of FOGAIN which had previously experienced operating
losses due to the fixed interest rate (para. 5.06).
5.        The loans have been considerably more successful with respect to
their primary than to their secondary obiective which was to improve the
functioning of the three participating institutions. The Bank loans have
had a limited impact on the functioning of the institutions which were
already well established at the time the PAI program was initiatedi and in
fact in the case of FOGAIN, Bank funds only represented
a minor portion of its total operational resources. While both these
factors reduced the Bank's leverage in inducing any radical changes in the
operating practices of the executing agencies, some irportant
organizational and procedural improvements were initiated at the Bank's
advice. The degree of receptivity to changes however varied for each
institution. While FOGAIN undertook some positive organizational and
staffing changes and made improvements in its operating procedures (para.
3.11-3.13), FIDEIN continued to suffer from institutional weaknesses
throughout the implementation of the two loans (para. 3.20-3.26) and made
little effort to adopt changes as suggested by Bank missions. FOMIN took
some good initiatives in procedural matters (para. 3.18-3.22), but also
suffered from staff weaknesses.
6.        The participating financial intermediaries (PFI) made limited
efforts under the loans with respect to improving their subproject
preparation, appraisal and supervision practices. The PFI's seem to have
concentrated their subproject evaluations on the assessment of credit
worthiness and the availability of adequate collateral. There was very
little emphasis on determining the financial and economic viability of the
investments. As an apex rediscounting agency dispensing subsidized credit
resources FOGAIN could have exercised influence in improving the operating
procedures of the PFI's. Regrettably FOGAIN chose not to disturb the
delicate balance between a very strong commercial banking sector (which was
fully responsible for the credit risk) and a government trust fund whose
role according to the banks was to channel funds to a target group of
beneficiaries namely the SMI. FOGAIN on its own part, confined itself to



- vi -
reviewing the end use of the funds and the eligibility of the borrowers and
more or less accepted the credit evaluation of the PFIs. Under the
influence of the Bank, however, FOGAIN began to carry out selected
subproject evaluations, but it was not until the third SMI loan that
formal subloan evaluation criteria were agreed upon. On the other hand,
the impact of the Bank advice was much more apparent in the case of FOMIN
which adopted improved evaluation practices and streamlined its supervision
system. The performance of FIDEIN in the area of project evaluation
.remained weak not only during the implementation of the first two projects
but also in the early periods of the ongoing loan. A clearer focus of
technical assistance activities in the above mentioned areas, could have
had a positive impact on the institutional building.
7.        The variation in institutional improvement, particularly the lack
of progress by FIDEIN, can be attributed to the undefined character of the
agency and the lack of strong commitment to strengthening the institution
by NAFIN. Experience has shown that unless there is strong commitment to
change at the government and institutional levels, interventions in
institutional strengthening are bound to fail. Either at the NAFIN or
FIDEIN level there was always a reason for inaction. The very future
institutional status of FIDEIN has been in question, and several proposals
to either merge it or expand it were considered by NAFIN during the
implementation of the two projects. Under these circumstances, the
projects should have included concrete changes prior to implementation
rather than proposed studies and agreements on changes at some future date.
8.        The overall coordinating mechanism set up under the project
including the financing arrangements proved to be the least successful
aspect of the project and frequently led to institutional friction
(paras. 3.01-3.03). This situation was further complicated by the fact
that for' most of the implementation period the same person was director of
PAI and FOGAIN, All three executing agencies were answerable to their own
executive committees and while they depended on the financing resources of
PAI they resisted any direct management role by the PAI Technical
Secretariat. The resistance was particularly strong in the case of FOGAIN
which represented almost 70% of the PAI program, while the financing from
the PAI fund onlj provided 6% of FOGAIN funding when the second loan was
appraised. In retrospect the implementation of the SMI projects has
demonstrated that in setting up an overall coordinating mechanism adequate
consideration should be given not only to the relationships between
institutions but also to the fiiancing arrangements which in this case
proved to be an overriding factor in determining the effectiveness of
integration under the Program. Another important lesson from the operation
of an integrated program with a central coordinating body and a common
financing fund is to confine the coordinating role simply to providing
policy guidance and to monitoring the program components, and not to
attempt to manage them directly.  Besides it is preferable to ca^italize
the executing agencies directly and to concentrate project technical
assistance resources in strengthening the executing agencies.
9.       'An impressive and instructive part of the project wee the
initiation and operation of an industrial extension service which has
developed into an important support function for SMI operations in Mexico
and can be replicated in other countries (paras. 6.01-6.08). The PAI
extension service has now been fully institutionalized and is part of



- vii -
NAFIN's regular industrial promotion activities. These activities are
largely supported through Government budget, but consideration is being
given to imposing a nominal fee for users of this important and useful
service.
10.       The two loans aimed at supporting the technical assistance
activities of other institutions involved in industrial development (para.
6.09). The target group of beneficiaries under this component were in
practice quite different from that originally envisaged, and above all the
institutions were not exclusively focused in serving the SMI. A major
drawback of a loosely defined technical assistance program was that the
three main executing agencies did not benefit adequately from the available
resources which were managed by the PAI technical secretariat. Under the
Fourth SMI loan a detailed technical program has been prepared for each
participating institution which will ht.-zceforth be responsible for
Implementing its own technical assistance program.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
First and Second Small and Medium Scale Industry (SMI)
Development Projects
Loans 1552-ME and 1881-ME
I. DNTRODUCTION
1.01      Bank Lending for Small and Medium Scale Industry (SMI).  In 1978,
lAPIN (the National Industrial Development Bank) initiated an Integrated
Program for SMI development, known as PAI.1/ This program was to be
liplemented through three NAFIN-administered trust funds which were
already2/ supporting individually SMI activities. The main components in
the PAf program were: (1) a credit rediscount scheme involving commercial
banks and operated by a second tier Institution the "Fondo de Garantia y
Fomento a la Industria Mediana y Pequena' (FOGAIN); (2) risk capital
investments by the "Fondo Nacional al Fomento Industrial" (FOMIN);
(3) credit and a technical assistance for industrial estate development by
*1ideicomlso de Conjuntos, Parques y Ciudades Industriales' (FIDEIN);
(4) technical assistance to be delivered by an extension service of PAI to
help SKI improve its operation and to obtain assistance from the above
Funds and/or from other agencies In the country. To date, the Bank has
financed three projects under the PAI program for a total amount of US$322
million. A fourth SMI project (US$185 million) has been recently
negotiated with overall objectives similar to the earlier projects, but
with a deeign that incorporates the major lessons of this PCR, and the
implementation experience gained from the ongoing third SMI project (Loan
2325-HE).
1.02      Macro-Economic and Sectoral Performance.  The implementation
perlod for the first and second SMI projects (1978-84) spans two distinct
phases of economic activity -- the year 1978 witnessed a resurgence of
productive activity and the economy experienced four years of exceptionally
high growth rates, averaging 82 p.a. for GDP and about 9% p.a. for
manufacturing output. The second and latter project implementation period
is marked by the severe economic and financial crisis which commenced in
1982 and in some respects persists to date. The earlier boom conditions
were associated with the initiation of intensive exploitation of the
country's hydrocarbon resources, a substantial growth in public
expendlture, and a similar expansion in private sector investment. During
the high growth period, industrial imports grew rapidly, equivalent to over
172 p.a. in real terms. The 1982 crisis, however, brought industrial

growth to an abrupt halt and in fact reversed the period of sustained
g'rowth. Many medium to large-scale Mexican companies came close to
bankruptcy, and even though small scale industries showed more resilience
because of their ability to adapt their output to the low demand situation,
they reduced their capacity utilization significantly.
1.03      Since disaggregated data on manufacturing sector performance is
unavailable, the performance of the SMI sector is assessed by comparing the
overall manufacturing sector growth to the performance of subsectors
dominated by SMIs.  The highest concentration of Mexican SMIs  is in
consumer goods (mainly non-durables) and the intermediate goods
subsector. While the annual average rate of growth of physical production
in the manufacturing sector was 3.6% for the period between December 1975
and June 1986, consumer goods grew at an annual rate of 3.7%, and
intermediate goods at an annual rate of 4.2%. Within the consumer goods
industries, however, the physical production of non-durable consumer goods
(preponderantly SMIs) grew by 3.6% annually whereas durables (mainly
produced by large scale industries) grew by 1.9%. Another important
feature is that when compared to the overall growth of the manufacturing
sector, the growth of both the non-durable consumer goods and intermediate
goods subsectors has been much faster during the upswings, and the
reduction in growth during the recessionary periods has been more moderate
(Annex 30). In sum, SMIs were concentrated in sectors with a smaller
downward risk when compared with the manufacturing sector as a whole, a
factor which explains their resilience during the-1982/83 crisis.
1.04      Interest Rate Policy and Supply of Financial Resources.  Interest
rate arrangements on Bank loans in Mexico have traditionally been designed,.
negotiated and supervised on a project by project basis and the rates under
the two loans reviewed were no exception to this rule. The principal
instrument of Mexican interest rate policy is the Central Bank's authority
to set rates on deposits of various maturities. A weighted average of the
actual deposit rates then determines the average cost of funds (ACF). The
ACF In turn serves as a reference rate for many types of loans. The
interest rates under the two SMI projects were equal to the ACF during the
earlier implementation years (1978-79) but overtime a gap developed between
the ACF and the preferential interest rates charged by FOGAIN (para. 3.08-
3.10). Yore importantly FOGAIN's interest rates were fixed over the life of
the subloans and annual adjustments to the level of interest rates were
applicable only in the case of new subloans.
1.05      Mexico's interest rate policy has undergone significant changes
during the implementation period of the two projects. Prior to 1979,
interest rates remained stable during long periods; then, between August
1979 and the beginning of 1983, the policy was to adjust interest rates
vis-a-vis inflation with a lag. While from 1978 to late 1981 the interest
rate levels as determined by the ACF index remained more or less in line
with the inflation rate the level of interest rates had fallen far below
the inflation rate and the rate of exchange rate devaluation during the
years 1982-83 (Figure 1). The severe inflation and movements in the real
exchange rate during 1982-83 greatly aggravated and extended the severity
of distortions in the level and dispersion of interest rates and the Bank
encountered increasing resistance to covenants requiring adjustments in the
interest rates levels. In the context of the SMI program, while agreement
was reached in late 1982 with NAFIN to adjust FOGAIN interest rates (on a



quarterly basis), this agreement was not implemented until mid-1984, in the
face of rapidly accelerating inflation, which pushed up the ACF to
unprecedented levels. FOGAIN also considered it counterproductive to raise
interest rates, at a time of severe economic recession and low level
investment demand.
1.06      Deposit interest rates also fluctuated widely over the
implementation period of the two projects, showing a consistently upward
movement since 1982. During 1979 and 1980, the effective real cost ot the
average term deposit to the commerciel banks was negative; after dropping
to about -5% in 1980, it recovered to 1% in 1981, before plummeting again
to a low of -22% in 1982. Since 1983, however, the average real cost of
funds (compounded monthly) to the banking system (ACF) has become positive
and reached a real annual rate of 5% in 1984 and 6% in 1985. An important
feature of the interest rate policy in Mexico has been the decision to set
effective longer term rates below short term rates. The objective was to
influence inflationary expectations by putting a ceiling on long term rates
below that on short term rates. Its immediate effect, however, has been to
dampen the growth of badly needed long-term resources to the financial
sybtem. For example, in 1980, term deposits with maturities of one year and
over accounted for 47% of total term deposits from the pablic in commercial
banks, while in 1985, they accounted for 3X. Consequently, subsidized
credit lines through trust funds like FOGAIN were an important source of
financing, particularly for the SMI's which had limited access to scarce
commercial bank resources.
II. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL OBJECTIVES OF THE LOANS
2.01      Loan Preparation.  Preparatory work for the first Small and
Medium Scale Industry (SMI) Development Project was carried out within the
framework of the InduL,rial Sector mission during October 1976 followed by
pre-appraisal mission in January 1977. The appraisal took place in August
1977 and a loan (1552-ME) for US$47 million, was approved by the Board on
April 27, 1978. The loan was signed on May 4, 1978 but only became
effective December 1, 1979 due to a prolonged discussion on interest rates
(the Mexican Government was not ready to accept an upward adjustment in
rates as agreed during negotiations), and a subsequent delay in the
ratification of the Guarantee Agreement by the Mexican Congress. Since the
first SKI project disbursed rapidly (para. 4.01) and the demand for credit
was quite high the Mexican Government requested in November 1980 that a
follow-up project be prepared. The second SMI project (Loan 1881-ME) for
US$100.0 million was approved by the Board on June 24, 1980 and became
effective on December 12, 1980. The loan comprised the same components as
in Loan 1552-ME except that in addition to the PAI extension service other
specialized technical assistance institutions such as CENAPRO (Centro
Nacional de Productividad) INFOTEC (technical information and advice) and
FONEP (feasibility studies) could also benefit from the T.A. funds.
2.02      Appraisal Objectives. The objectives of the two loans, were
essentially similar namely to: (i) foster more rapid growth in industrial
output and employment by providing finance for SMI's wishing to increase
their productive capacity; (ii) assist in implementing the national plans
for industrial decentralization and regional development by making
financial and technical assistance available to firms outside the main



-4-
metropolitan areas; (iii) strengthen the support system for SMI by
coordinating more closely the activities of existing financing and
technical assistance institutions, including the operation of an extension
service, which was to be expanded under the follow up project to lesser
developed regions.
2.03      The extent to which the appraisal objectives, including the
specific institution building objectives, were achieved, is described and
reviewed in the following chapters.
III. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Program Coordinating Committee (PAI)
3.01      Organization and Coordination.  The PAI program was to be
governed by a high level Program Coordinating Committee, headed by the
Director General of NAFIN and including the heads of all participating
institutions, as well as representatives from the MIinistries of Finance,
Commerce and Industry, and Banco de Mexico. A Technical Coordinating
Committee with a Technical Secretariat was set up to oversee the
operational aspects of the program. While initially the Secretariat was
based in NAFIN, it was later moved to FOGAIN, with the Director General of
FOGAIN also acting as the technical secretary. This organizational change
was aimed at increasing the linkage between the Secretariat and the largest
operating unit (FOGAIN). Because of the experimental nature of the
coordination role of PAI, the Bank appraisal missions considered the
institutional arrangements as "transitional" and necessary to establish the
program. Bank supervision missions expressed the need to separate the
functions of PAI staff from those of FOGAIN, because PAI extensionists were
becoming too closely involved with the credit promotion activities, at the
cost of their technical advice functions. While some improvements were
introduced in January 1979 by appointing separate deputy directors for PAI
and FOGAIN operations, a complete separation between them did not take
place until 1984. PAI was then put under the direction of a NAFIN director
who doubled up as its Technical Secretary. The new management expanded PAI
staff and began to take a direct role in overseeing the operations of the
executing agencies anid acting as a filter for subprojects submitted to the
Bank for approval and/or reimbursement. The institutional arrangement with
various layers (Executing Agency, NAFIN, PAI) to control 'subproject
quality", caused unwanted delays in subproject approval.
3.02      The underlying cause of the institutional friction was the PAI
financing arrangement whereby the trust funds were expected to pass on to a
common PAI Financing Fund the loan recoveries from the Bank loan as well as
a major portion of their interest rate spread. This requirement seemed
reasonable when account is taken of the fact that PAI not only provided the
trust funds with the counterpart funds but assumed the foreign, exchange
risk (for which it received an interest rate spread). Nevertheless,
FOGAIN, the largest participant, refused to fully honour its financial
commitment; it witheld transfers of loan recoveries to PAI and paid only a



small part of its interest spread to PAI.3/ The institutional problem
worsened when PAI's Coordinating Committee did not meet officially after
1982 and in its absence the technical secretariat started to assume direct
responsibility for coordination.
3.03      The Bank's supervision missions were fully aware of the PAI
coordination problems, and several attempts were made at top levels in
NAFIN to resolve these problems. However, since the coordination
difficulties did not materially affect the actual implementation pace of
the program (which was essentially in the hands of the executing agencies),
the institutional relationships between PAI and the executing agencies
were left unchanged even under the Third Loan 2325-ME. The financial
arrangements between PAI and the executing agencies did adversely affect
the financial soundness of the whole program (para. 5.03) and obliged the
Government to review the entire institutional and financial relationships
under the PAI program. Consequently, agreement has been reached, within
the context of the Fourth SMI loan, with Government to abolish the PAI fund
and to capitalize the implementing agencies directly. In addition,
measures have been taken to not only ensure a more effective coordination
between the executing agencies, but to oversee the implementation of the
entire Program.
Fondo de Garantia y Foviento a la Industria Mediana y Peguena (FOGAIN)
3.04      The Institution.  FOGAIN, the most important financial
institution for small and medium industry (SMI) in Mexico, was established
in 1954 as a Government trust fund (Fideicomiso) administered by NAFIN.
It is a second-tier institution, rediscounting credits made to SMI for
equipm.ent, machinery, factory construction and working capital. Under
Loan 1552-ME the FOGAIN component amounted to US$30.0 million, increasing
to US$70.0 million under the follow-up loan.
3.05      Management and Organization.  FOGAIN's main decision making
body is its National Technical Committee while its day-to-day operations
are the responsibility of a management team headed by a Director General.
From 1978 to 1984 FOGAIN had three Director Generals: from 1978 to 1982,
it was headed by Mr. Tomas Gonzalez Hinojasa, formerly Credit Manager of a
leading Mexican Financiera (SOMEX), who introduced a comprehensive
reorganization as recommended by the Bank under the first SMI project. The
reorganization consolidated related functions and responsibilities,
upgraded key middle management and increased the decentralization of staff
at the regional offices with the objective of transferring loan processing
authority to field staff.
3.06      With the change of Director in 1982, there was a significant
outflow of professional staff from both PAI and FOGAIN, causing a serious
slowdown in operations.  In February 1984, separate directors were
appointed for PAI and FOGAIN which had hitherto operated jointly.
Mr. Sergio Luis Cano, who was previously head of FOMIN, was appointed the
new Director of FOGAIN. He made substantial organizational changes
including the setting up of an Internal Audit Office, a Legal Department,
3/ It is important to note that 80% of FOGAIN's funds came from resources
that did not administratively pass through PAI.



- 6 -
and a Credit Monitoring Department which began operating in 1985. Through
the successive three Bank loans, FOGAIN has developed into a stronger and
more mature financial institution. Nevertheless, further decentralization
of FOGAIN subloan approval and processing functions at the regional level
is needed (para. 3.11-3.12).
3.07      Staffing and Staff Training.  In 1977 at the time Loan 1552-ME
was appraised, FOGAIN staff was about 100 employees, most of whom were
concentrated in Mexico City with a few representatives stationed at NAFIN's
regional offices. By 1979, when Loan 1881-ME was appraised, FOGAIN staff
had increased to 130, but by 1982 this number went up to 150. When FOGAIN
separated from PAI in February 1984, the staff numbers had jumped to 454
professionals of which only 21 were at the regional offices. As of end
1986, FOGAIN staff totaled 449, consisting of 39 economists, 70 public
accounts and administrators, 10 lawyers, 20 engineers, 115 administrative
officers and- 195 other professionals. The expansive growth in staff
numbers in-late 1985 and early 1986 was in keeping with the rapid increase
in FOGAIN'S lending activities (para. 4.06). Overall FOGAIN staff is of
high quality with the majority having good qualifications. Furthermore
during 1980-82 special training programs were developed to help the staff
acquire the necessary skills to adapt to an expanded credit program. In
fact recently an internal training division has been set up to identify, on
a continuing basis, the staff training requirements and to arrange such
training.
Operating Procedures
3.08      FOGAIN Interest Rates.  At the commencement of Loan 1552-ME,
FOGAIN was using fixed interest rates (at levels set in 1977) which varied
by geographic zones and averaged 13 percent. During negotiations for Loan
1552-ME, the Bank proposed that interest rates be no less than 16% until
December 1978, and three points above the ACF index thereafter. The pro-
posed rates were accepted reluctantly at negotiations but were not formal-
ized by Government after loan signing. After delaying project start up for
almost one year, it was agreed to adopt a more flexible interest rate
structure which permitted FOGAIN to fix final interest rates between one to
three points above the ACF. This system was a marked improvement over the
earlier fixed interest rate regime, in that it allowed for periodic
revisions in the interest rates to reflect both the prevailing market rates
and allowed rates to respond to any significant changes in the ACF index.
3.09       Further progress on FOGAIN interest rate policy was achieved
during loan negotiations for 1881-ME. The Bank proposed another increase
in interest rates from July 1980, so that the average would be one
percentage point above the average ACF for the preceding twelve month
period (May 1979-April 1980). For the first time agreement was reached to
adjust interest rates more frequently than the annual adjustment called for
in the Loan Agreement. An interest rate adjustment was to be made if the
ACF index deviated by more than 3 points in the last quarter. In addition
discussions were initiated to reduce the interest differentials within
categories of borrowers. The Mexican Government opposed the increase in
rates on grounds that the larger and more established enterprises could
borrow competitively and freely in international markets (where rates were
relatively lower). They also wanted to maintain the differentials in
interest rate by location, since it was an important instrument to promote



-7-
industrial decentralization. The interest rate mechanism finally agreed
(Annex 29) included clauses for periodic review of rates,, and one which
showed an overall increase in rates for the medium-scale enterprises; the
differential by zones was maintained.
3.10       During implementation of Loan 1881-ME, the Mexican authorities
failed to adjust interest rates (in February 1981) and requested that the
Bank grant a moratorium until the end of 1981 on all adjustments. The main
reason for the non-compliance with interest rate adjustment clause was the
intense political presures generated at a time when the presidential
candidate was being nominated. In May 1981 the Bank suspended
disbursements against the Loan, and finally succeeded in obtaining an
upward adjustment in FOGAIN onlending rates. In summary, the Bank worked
closely with Government and NAFIN authorities under the two loans to bring
FOGAIN interest rates closer to market rates. However, FOGAIN continued
with a fixed interest rate for its outstanding loans, which as inflation
accelerated after 1982 caused serious portfolio losses.   It was not until
the negotiation of Loan 2325-ME In 1983 that agreement was reached with
Mexican authorities to adjust interest rates of outstanding loans to
correspond with the interest rates of new subloans. Despite the limited
leverage the Bank had in influencing FOGAIN's interest rate policy,
positive changes were introduced under the three SMI loans in Mexico. And
the Bank may rightly clalm that it helped rationalize interest rates for
the SMI sector to reflect more closely the cost of funds.  However, since
the issue affected Bank-assisted projects across sectors, it was concluded
that this issue was best addressed within the context of Bank's
macro-economic policy dialogue with the Mexican Government (para. 1.05).
The policy dialogue on interest rates and subsidies between the Bank and
Mexican authorities finally culminated in the General Interest Rate
Agreement (GIRA) concluded in 1984.
3.11      Appraisals.  Under the FOGAIN rediscounting system, the
participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) are primarily responsible for
evaluating the creditworthiness of loan applicants and determining their
financial viability before submitting a financing request to FOGAIN. The
analysis of subloans at FOGAIN level was thus limited to ascertaining:
credit eligibility, expected economic impact as regards employment
generation and sectoral factors; marketing prospects; and the amount of
credit needed and the financing terms. While FOGAIN's subproject appraisal
procedures have been evolving slowly, it has made little effort to promote
standard evaluation practices at the PFI level. Even itself FOGAIN did not
calculate ERR's, and FRR's were estimated only on a ex-post basis and that
too for the larger subloans. Recently FOGAIN has initiated, as a result of
the Bank's insistence, to calculate rates of return for subprojects of more
than US$100,000. Similarly, the revised criteria for appraising permanent
working capital subloans was agreed upon with the Bank to take more account
of inflation. Lack of adherence to subproject evaluation criteria has been
a disappointing aspect of FOGAIN's operations.
3.12      Project Supervision.  As a second-tier institution, FOGAIN
considers its supervision role to be one of "controlling' the end use of
its funds by PFIs. Thus, supervision of subloans has been performed
primarily by the PFI's who have generally concentrated on loans in
arrears.  FOGAIN has performed some analyses of samples of FOGAIN-financed
enterprises to ascertain if its funds were being used for the purposes



stated in the subloan submissions. It was not until 1984-85 that FOGAIN
strengthened its supervision efforts by creating the Credit Monitoring
Department and by hiring outside consultants to assist in this function.
Bank supervision missions recommend that subloan follow-up not only verify
the ultimate use of loan proceeds, but also identify problems confronting
the beneficiaries. The most serious gap in FOGAIN's monitoring role is
that it does not maintain any detailed information on the status of its
loan portfolio iith the PFI's. Bank supervision missions have consistently
commented on this weakness, but no concrete measure has been initiated
until the Fourth SMI loan which requires a time bound plan to collect
information on arrears. The recent computerization of FOGAIN's activities
has improved subproject quality control, but there is stiU a strong need
to strengthen the capability of commercial banks in this regard,
particularly with respect to helping them focus on the development impact
of subprojects, instead of their overriding concerns with simply ensuring
collateral. Under the recently approved Fourth SMI project technical
assistance resources have been provided to strengthen FOGAIN's information
system including its review of subprojects performance.
3.13      Reporting Requirements.  FOGAIN's internal auditing has
been carried out by a special unit of NAFIN. Additionally, FOGAIN has been
independently audited by outside firms. The audit report for 1981 was
qualified but arrangements made for the following-audit years were
satisfactory. Independent auditors are designated every year by the
Comptroller General of the Republic under a procedure for selecting and
monitoring auditors who are required to follow the principles of Government
audits. In general the Bank found FOGAIN audit procedures adequate and
reports were submitted in time.
Fondo Nacional de Fomento Industrial (FOMIN)
3.14      The institution.  FOMIN was established in 1972 as a Government
trust fund administered by NAFIN. Its role is to stimulate the creation of
new SMI enterprises or the expansion or strengthening of existing ones by
contributing equity capital as a minority shareholder (initially less than
33% and, from 1980, less than 49% of the company's equity). FOMIN was
allocated US$10.0 million of loan resources under the first loan and
US$12.0 million under the follow-up loan.
3.15      Management, Organization and Staffing.  During most of the
implementation period of Loans 1552 and 1881, FOMIN had the same Director,
Sr. Jorge Luis Cano, an experienced manager who stayed with FOMIN until
1984. FOMIN has also had, throughout, a relatively capable and
well-motivated staff, but turnover has been high and vacancies difficult to
fill. The main reason for the turnover is the special skills FOMIN staff
acquire in equity financing, which has been in high demand in the banking
sector. FOMIN's total staff increased from 49 employees in 1978, of whom
24 were professionals, to 82 in 1985, of which 43 are professionals; in
mid-1986 only three of them had been with the institution for more than two
years. Although the lack of continuity in staffing showed no apparent
adverse efforts on the level and quality of FOMIN operations, it put an
excessive burden on FOMIN's top level staff to train and motivate the newly
recru.ted staff. The Bank missions have consistently noted the need to
enhance the renumerations of FOMIN staff, but NAFIN maintains that it has
to have a uniform salary policy for staff all the trust funds it
administers.



- 9 -
3.16      At the time of appraisal of Loan 1552-ME, FOMIN was organized in
two major departments: one in charge of appraisals and legal procedures,
the other portfolio control and sales of equity participations. By 1981,
during implementation of Loan 1881-ME due to growth and staff shortages,
appraisals and supervisions were being done by the same analysts. Bank
supervision missions in 1981 and 1982 reported an imbalance between the
evaluation of prospective new clients and effective portfolio control.
FOMIN introduced changes on the Banks suggestion and under the present
organizational structure, although appraisal and control are under the same
Deputy Director (Sub-Direction General Tecnica) these activities are in
different departments. Similarly supervision has been strungly reinforced
over the last two years, with frequent visits to client companies and
active participation in their boards of directors.
3.17      Staff Training.  Part of the technical assistance zomponent of
both loans was designated for the additional training of personnel but the
training courses provided by the training institutions in Mexico were not
ideally suited to the needs of a risk-capital investment company such as
FOMIN. Besides, since government regulations restricted FOMIN's employees
from travelling abroad to visit other more experienced risk-capital
institutions, training has been confined largely to on-the-job training in
the institution. Only one foreign expert in venture capital investment was
brought in under the technical assistance components of both loans.
Operating Policies and Procedures
3.18      Lending Policies.  Initially FOMIN's irnvestments were mostly in
the form of new issues of common stock. Based on advice from Bank and IFC,
FOMIN moved in early 1981 towards investments in preferred shares and in
convertible subordinated credits. This diversification broadened the range
of FOMIN's potential customers and facilitated investment packages more
adapted to the cash flows of the enterprises. Above all the use of
convertible credit has also generated a more stable income for FOMIN. In
practice, convertible credits have been favored over preferred stock by
firms because interest on convertible loans is tax deductible. Until
1981-82 FOMIN's established practice was not to invest in financial
restructuring of firms or to do so only in very exceptional cases.
However, the crisis of 1982-83 created an increasing demand on FOMIN in
this area which resulted in some incremental equity investments in its
earlier clients and also new investments in firms undergoing financial
difficulties.
3.19      Regarding-clientele focus, at the time of the approval of Loan
1552-ME, entrepreneurs were celuctant to accept a public institution, like
FOPIN, as a partner even as a minority shareholder and FOMIN was forced, in
practice, to work mainly with already established firms, many of which
belonged to medium-size holding groups. These saw FOMIN as a means to
expand capacity, to decentralize existing plants or to start new ventures.
The time consuming and costly assessment of risk factors, and some
provisions of its charter (such as the requirement for external auditing),
generally precluded FOMIN from playing a significant role in financing
small firms. Therefore, FOMIN's assistance focussed primarily on medium
size enterprises (equity contributions of Mex$12.3 million on average
during Loan 1552-ME and during Loan 1881-ME Mex$32.9 million on average (in



- 10 -
the range of $700,000 to $1,000,000 in 1980-82 and around US$500,000 in
1980). The economic difficulties of 1982-83 also pressed FOMIN into
providing more finance to cover working capital needs (including debt
restructuring). This increased working capital financing caused cash flow
problems for FOMIN, as some of these projects were not eligible for Bank
financing and FOMIN was forced to use its own resources.
3.20      Project Appraisal and Supervision.  While FOMIN's appraisal
capabilities were well established prior to 1978, the following
improvements were introduced during Loans 1552-ME and 1881-ME: calculation
of ERR for subprojects using more than US$250,000 in Bank funds; increased
emphasis on evaluating the technical aspects of projects, introduction of
more imaginative financial packages through the combination of equity and
convertible loans and attempts at co-financing with commercial banks.
These changes notwithstanding FOMIN's appraisal procedures still use
traditional approaches as in credit project appraisals with too little
consideration for the abilities of the entrepreneurs and the market
prospect for products.  FOMIN's supervision was initially lax, but
following Bank suggestions, supervision staff were organized according to
sectoral activity rather than by geographical location of firms. And by
the end of the implementation of Loan 1552-ME, FOMIN started issuing a
monthly report with financial indicators on the status of enterprises in
its portfolio. As part of the appraisal of the ongoing Loan 2325-ME a plan
of action was prepared to rehabilitate the recoverable enterprises and to
liquidate the failed investments. Since 1983, FOMIN started using outside
consultants to carry out technical supervisions on a continuous basis.
3.21      Procurement and-Disbursement.  A check of documentation for a
sample of subprojects showed that FOMIN's disbursements procedures have
been adequate.  FOMIN's disbursement policies provide for the first 20% of
FOMIN's investment to be disbursed when the firm has met all the agreed
conditions. The remainder is disbursed against a time table agreed with
the firm on a pari-pasu basis with other shareholders of the firm.
Regarding procurement practices, as a general policy, FOMIN obtains price
quotations from several suppliers and from time to time reviews the quality
and technical adequacy of goods purchased. However, during the initial
stages of execution of Loans 1552-ME and 1881-ME (1979-81) it was not
normal practice for FOMIN to insist on an independent valuation of the
equipment purchased. Prices were agreed by the foreign seller and the
local entrepreneurs based mainly on reference prices of new equipment.
More recently, FOMIN has insisted on the independent valuation of used
equipment, either by registered foreign appraisers or by NAFIN's capital
goods specialists. Under the proposed Bank Fourth SMI operation, FOMIN
would establish explicit procedures for procurement of used equipment.
3.22      Auditing and Accounting Procedures.  FOMIN's financial statements
have been independently audited by reputable accounting firms. At the
Bank's request, FOMIN has required annual audited statements and the use of
acceptable accounting systems from all firms in its portfolio. Every
year's financial statements require reformulation one year later to make
the adjustments resulting from revaluation of equity participation in the
client firms after their own audits have been completed. There is urgent
need for streamlining FOMIN's management information base and reporting
system but improvements have been hampered by bureaucratic delays in the
acquisition of computer equipment. Technical assistance under the proposed
Fourth SMI Loan would address this issue.

Fideicomiso de Pargqus Industriales (FIDEIN)
3.23      The Institution.  FIDEIN was established in 1970 as a Government
trust fund administered by NAFIN to plan, promote and implement a national
system of industrial estates as part of a national program of industrial
decentralization. Under Loan 1551-ME the FIDEIN component was US$5.0
million increasing to US$3.0 million in the Second SMI loan.
3.24      Development Strategy and Operating Procedures.  Between 1978 and
1985 FIDEIN underwent several changes in its lending policies and
procedures; from a central coordinating/advisory institution to the
"Fideicomisos Especiales" (the legal local entities owning and operating
the individual regional publicly financed estates) assisting the Secretaria
de. Asentamientos Humanos y Obras Publicas (SAHOP) in selecting the location
of industrial estates and in feasibility studies of the projects. After
approval of the locations SAHOP, in consultation with FIDEIN, prepared
overall layout plans of the 500 ha site acquired in each case and proceeded
to develop the initial 20 ha.  The local "Fideicomiso Especial" was then
responsible for implementation and management of the project.  FIDEIN
assistance was supposed to include: promotion and marketing of the
itdustrial plots, accounting and financial control (including annual
budgets and-financial statements), administrative and legal procedures
related to development of the estates, etc.  In some cases FIDEIN provided
the Fideicomisos with small amounts of short-term credits.
3.25      The appraisal of Loan 1552-ME identified the lack of long-term
credit for SMIs to finance building construction, as a key constraint in
industrial estate development. As a result, FIDEIN's activities under
Loans 1552-ME and 1881-HE were expanded to cover three areas of direct
financial assistance: (i) construction of standard factory buildings (SFB)
for rental on industrial estates with option to purchase, or for direct
sales to SMIs; (ii) construction and leasing of common facilities to
provide services to groups of SMIs on the estates, and (iii) financing of
equipment and machinery leasing to SMI operating on the estates. FIDEIN
was expected to act as a second-tier agency to provide financing and only
exceptionally, was it prepared to finance and administer directly the
construction of factory buildings and common service centers. The three
new tasks given to FIDEIN produced only disappointing results. In the SFB
eub-program, FIDEIN opted for direct contracts with client firms, and
financing directly sales, rent and leases of the installations to SMIs.
Only the development of the land sites remained the responsibility of the
local "Fideicomisos".
3.26      A comprehensive program of staff expansion and training was
discussed at negotiations of Loan 1881-ME and a program of advanced
construction by FIDEIN of SFB to be subsequently sold or leased was agreed
upon. Under this program FIDEIN was to undertake the advanced construction
of at least one or two factory units per estate, of 1,000 to 2,000 m2 each
which was expected to have a demonstration effect. The operational results
were disappointing (para.4.23-4.25), and further policy changes had t,c be
introduced. The three investment activities that were included in the two
Bank loans under review were excluded from the third SMI Bank loan, and
FIDEIN's financing role was restricted to supporting investments by public
and private sector entities.



- 12 -
3.27      Management, Organization, Staffing.  FIDEIN suffered from
management problems during most of the implementation period of both
loans. Immediately after the appraisal, a new Director General, Mr. A.
Navarrete, was appointed, but since he was sick during the major part of
his tenure, his subdirector, Mr. Felix Lopez acted as the Director until
the end of 1981 when Mr. Gustavo Varela took over. Serious financial
irregularities during the tenure of the previous management were identified
by an independent financial and technical audit. Consequently NAFIN
empowered Mr. Varela to reorganize FIDEIN, remove several key staff, and
initiate judicial proceedings as appropriate. The new Director General
implemented significant organizational changes in FIDEIN in early 1983 at a
time when the Government redefined FIDEIN's role (para. 3.25).
3.28      From the time Loan 1552-ME was appraised to 1980, FIDEIN's
professional staff increased from 15 to 27 organized under two managers,
one in charge of legal, administrative and financial matters, and the other
responsible for technical and operational matters. Despite the increase,
the quality of FIDEIN staff was considered weak at the time of appraisal of
Loan 1881-ME. To meet the needs of expanding activities, staff was
increased from 43 (including 27 professionals) in 1980 to 84 employees
(38 professionals) by December 1982. Unfortunately many of the new staff
were inexperienced and coupled with a lack of appropriate management
direction, FIDEIN's performance remained poor in the quality and management
of its programs (para. 4.25). In December 1984, an Acting Director General
was appointed under whose guidance FIDEIN gradually evolved into its new
role as technical assistance agency. FIDEIN staff was reduced to 62 by
December 1985, of which 30 were Lechnicians and professionals. While
FIDEIN has developed a good technical capacitj in the design of industrial
estates and in the execution and supervision of civil works, its financial
analysis and project appraisal work still needs further strengthening.
This aspect will be addressed under the recently approved Fourth SMI
project.
IV. UTILIZATION OF LOAN PROCEEDS UNDER LOAN 1552-ME and 1881 ME
Resource Transfer
4.01      There were no disbursements during the first implementation year
of Loan 1552-ME, because of a lack of agreement on the FOGAIN interest rate
clause (para. 3.08) but PAI held up disbursement requests from the other
implementing agencies as well. After this matter was resolved the rate of
loan utilization increased rapidly. By the end of 1979 disbursements
already amounted to US$27.2 million, 155% more than the levels anticipated
at appraisal. The fast disbursement rate reflected the increase in
industrial sector investments which continued throughout 1980 (para. 1.02)
and by start of 1981, about 97% of the total amount (US$45.3 million) had
been disbursed.
4.02      The experience with the utilization of Bank Loan 1881-ME was
somewhat different in that during the first year of effectiveness, the loan
was committed almost 50% more than anticipated at appraisal and total
disbursements were US$46.0 million.  After one year the disbursement of
loan 1881-ME was actually 300% above the disbursement level projected at
appraisal. The strong demand for loan resources was in line with the



- 13 -
buoyant economy at the time in Mexico, helped by the active promotion
efforts of the PAI staff. After the crisis of late 1982, however, loan
disbursements slowed but in 1983 these still amounted to US$20.5 million,
i.e., 146% more than the level projected at appraisal. Accumulated
disbursement reached US$92.5 million by the end of 1983, 8% above
disbursement levels anticipated at appraisal. However, in November 1983
the Loan was amended under the Bank's Special Action Program (SAP) to
assist Mexico confront the severe economic problems it was experiencing.
since late 1982. Two important measures which speeded the disbursement
rate under the loan were an increase in the disbursement percentage from
55% to 73% for subloans, and the agreement to permit financing for
permanent working capital through the projects equity component. By
mid-1984, the loan was fully committed and the closing date of the loan was
extended for six months to June 1985, to allow time for the disbursement of
some subprojects.
4.03      The loan disbursement experience under both projects varied for
each of the subcomponents. While the FOGAIN credit resources moved
rapidly, under both loans, the FOMIN equity component and FIDEIN industrial
park investments lagged. The movement of funds under the FIDEIN component
were particularly slow so that when Loan 1881-ME was appraised in 1980 only
US$1.1 million out of the US$5.0 million had been committed. The
relatively tardy utilization of loan resources by FIDEIN was partly due to
the newness of the operation, but largely due to the inherent weakness in
FIDEIN's implementation capacity (para.3.27). On the other hand, FOMIN
investments moved slowly due to the cautious investment policy adopted by
its management. The disbursement experience with the two SMI loans and the
subsequent operation (Loan 2325-ME) was taken into consideration in
estimating the Implementation speed of the the proposed Fourth SMI project.
Lending CharacterisL ^s under Loans 1552-ME and 1881-ME
4.04      The proceeds of Loan 1552-ME financed 915 subprojects at
a cost of Mex$1,829.9 million (US$78.7 million)4/ distributed as
follows: 864 subprojects through FOGAIN with a cost of Mex$1,248.4 million
(US$53.7 million); 29 subprojects through FOKIN with a cost of
Mex$356.4 million (US$15.3 million); and 22 subprojects through FIDEIN
with a cost of Mex$223.7 million (US$9.6 million). Also the loan financed
Mex$56.9 million (US$2.4 million) for a program of Technical Assistance.
The total cost of the subprojects reached Mex$1,885.8 million
(US$81.1 million) for the entire project. The results were close to the
loan targets since the appraisal estimated financing 1,160 subprojects.
4.05      Loan 1881-ME helped finance a total of 2,120 subprojects for a
cost of Mex$10,902 million (US$87.5 million)5/ distributed as follows:
2,019subprojects through FOGAIN for a cost oT Mex$8,574.5 million (US$68
million); 79 subprojects through FOMIN for a cost of Mex$1,910.1
million(US$15.3 million) and 27 subprojects through FIDEIN for a cost of
4/ Exchange rate of US$lmMex$23.25, representing the average rate during
the loan implementation period 1979-81.
5/ Exchange rate of US$1-124.54 Mexican Pesos, representing the average
during the loan implementation period 1982-84.



- 14 -
Mex$X$417.4 million (US$3.9 million). Also the loan financed technical
assistance for Mex$123.0 million (US$0.9 million). The 2,120 subprojects
financed under the loan compares very favorably with the appraisal
estimate of 870 projects. As in Loan 1552-ME the foreign exchange risk was
borne by the Government at no cost to the sub-borrowers and as this loan
(1881-ME) was disbursed during a period of a rapidly appreciating exchange
rate, it was clearly an important factor in the high demand for subloans.
FOGAIN Component
4.06      Lending Operations.  Since FOGAIN's information system on
subloans does not permit a disaggregation of credits by source of financing
(IDB, Bank or its own resources), it was not possible to analyze the
characteristics of all subprojects financed with the loan resources.
Nevertheless, a broad picture of FOGAIN's lending characteristics is
obtained from the analysis of its overall operations analyzed in Annex
13-14 which summarizes FOGAIN's loan approvals during its 31 years of
operation from 1954 to the end of 1985. During this period FOGAIN subloans
totalled 66,925 loans for Mex$298.7 billion. The majority of loans were
between Mex$1.0 million and Mex$5.0 million and these accounted for 34.0%
of the total amount approved. Loans of over Mex$30.0 million accounted for
only 1.02 of the approved loan amount. Twenty percent of the credits
approved during the whole period were in 1985 indicating the major
expansion in FOGAIN's clientele was during that year. FOGAIN loan
approvals during the period 1954-85 cover all sectors, notably food
products (21%), metal processing and machine fabrication (17%), and
manufacture of foo%.wear and other leather products (3%). Fifty percent of
the loans approved were for production of consumer goods, 38% for
intermediate goods, and 12% for capital goods. FOGAIN subloans were mainly
to small scale industries - 83% of the credits (64% by amount) were
channelled to enterprises with less than 50 employees. Small scale
industry as defined by annual sales (below Mex$400 million), accounted for
81% of the credit (56% by amount).  During 1985, a total of 91% of the
loans (75% by amount) were directed to small scale industries.
4.07      Lending Characteristics - Loan 1552-ME.  To compare FOGAIN's
overall lending characteristics with subloans financed with Bank resources,
a sample survey of 84 subprojects was carried out by FOGAIN under Loan
1552-ME, including 13 new enterprises. The results of the survey are
detailed in Annex I.  It shows that 27.4% of the subloans had a maturity
range of one to two years, with only 2.6% of subprojects benefitting from
payment periods of over five years. Most subprojects (70Z) had maturity
terms between three to five years. This range of maturities were less than
expected at appraisal and reflected the conservatism of the commercial
banks rather than any FOGAIN policy to keep maturities short.
Nevertheless, FOGAIN benefitted from the shorter maturities to the extent
this permited FOGAIN to roll-over the loan recoveries several times.
4.08      Subproject Types.  As regards the project objective to finance
mainly small enterprises with 25 or less employees, of the 84 enterprises
sampled it was found that 70 enterprises (or 83% of the total) had 10 or
less employees. Only one firm had more than 100 employees. The total cost
of the 84 subprojects included in the survey amounted to Mex$230.8 million
(US$9.9 million), with an average subloan size of about Mex$500,000
(US$21,500). Only four subloans of the 84 were over the free limit of



- 15 -
US$150,000. Any single industrial subsector did not represent more than
25% of the subloans: food, beverages and tobacco industries represented
23% of the total subloans with the remaining 77% distributed to eight sub-
sectors, primarily non-electrical machinery, 10%; textiles, apparel and
footwear, 12%; chemical products, 10%; non-metallic minerals, 10%; and
others with smaller participation. The geogriphical dispersion of the sub-
projects shows that only 17.8% of the total subprojects were located in
the high priority Zone I with the remaining 82.2%, representing 83.8% of
total lending, were located in Zones II and III. Under the follow up pro-
ject greater attention as given to financing investments in Zones I and II.
4.09      Subproject Impact.  Economic and financial characteristics of the
subprojects financed under Bank loan 1552-ME are summarized in Annex 2.
The economic impact of the subprojects can be considered satisfactory in
terms of employment creation and the viability of the investments
financed. The 84 subprojects surveyed generated a total of 2,852 new jobs
with an average investment cost per job of Mex$80,900 (US$3,479). In the
survey, the investment cost per job ranged from Mex$9,700 (US$417) for a
labor intensive furniture firm to Mex$2,269,000 (USS95,951) for a
medium-sized capital intensive engineering plant. In some of the
enterprises the cost of creating additional employment was high because
investments were mainly for expansion (71 firms), raising productivity
rather than an increase in the labor force, and less for new enterprises
(13 firms).
4.10      FOGAIN carried out an 'ex-post' analysis of a sample of the SMI
projects financed based on the subloan appraisal data, updated for actual
performance data obtained as part of the PCR work.  In addition PAI
calculated IRR and ERR for a sample of subprojects based on data available
in the files. Based on the data for these two samples, the ERR for the
sampled subloans ranged from 13.8% to 293.8%, and more than 80% had an
average ERR's of 47.0%. The IRR ranged from 1.4% to 207.2%. On a priori
basis, therefore, FOGAIN financed economically sound and efficient
subprojects under Loan 1552-ME with the average rates of return well within
the overall range of 15%.
4.11      Lending Characteristics - Loan 1881-ME. Details from a
representative sample of 240 Bank subprojects (about 10% of subprojects)
financed under Loan 1881-ME, including 56 new enterprises, are shown in
Annex 4. The total cost of the 240 subprojects of the survey amounted to
Mex$739.37 million (US$5.9 million) with an average subloan size of MexS3.5
million (US$28,103).  None of these were over the free limit of
US$250,000. The objective of financing smaller enterprises was well
achieved; more than 90 percent of the financed subprojects analyzed in the
survey had 25 or less employees.
4.12      As regards the geographic distribution of subprojects, about
45.8% (100 subprojects), of a total 240 subprojects surveyed, were in
Zone I 6/ and the remaining 54.2% (140 subprojects) were located in Zones
6/  Geographic Zones are defined in the decree published in Diario Oficial,
February 2, 1986. Zone I (Priority Preferential); Zone II (State
Priority); Zone III (Controlled and Consolidated Growth); Rest of the
country.

II and III which represented 56.3% of the total financing. There was thus
a marked improvement compared to the first loan in locating investments in
high priority zones. The pattern of financing by subsectors was similar
under the two projects, with no industrial subsectors representing more
than 20% of the total disbursed. The food industries subsector benefitted
most with 38 subloans (15.8%) of the total subloans. The remaining 84.2%
is divided between 16 subsectors including non-metallic minerals (10.8%),
metallic products (10.8%), non-electric machinery (8.7%), chemical products
(8.3%) and others with smaller participation.
4.13      Subproject Impact.  The economic and financial characteristics of
the subprojects financed under this Bank Loan are summarized in Annex 4.
The 240 subprojects surveyed generated an estimated 1,471 new jobs at an
investment cost per job of Mex$0.6 million (US$5,369); investment cost per
job ranged from Mex$0.1 million (US$939) to Nex$10.6 million (US$99,624).
Again, the cost of creating additional employment in some of the
subprojects was relatively high because the investments were mainly for
plant expansions (184 firms) and less for new enterprises (56 firms). In
this loan FOGAIN calculated ex-ante ERR which ranged from 4% to 385%.  The
subloans had an ex-ante IRR ranging from 7.6% to 387.0X.
4.14      Current Status of Subloans.  To assess the latest position of
subprojects, the PCR mission visited a randomly-selected sample of 12
sub-borrowers.  All the enterprises were experiencing working capital
shortages due to severe restrictions on commercial bank credits. None of
the enterprises had received technical assistance in project preparation
nor in any aspects of management. While the original calculations of the
financial and economic rates of return of the subprojects being financed
appeared justified originally, the mission observed that these groved to be
optimistic on an ex-post basis.  This is partly due to the deterioration in
the financial condition of the enterprises, which suffered due to the
accelerating rate of inflation and associated high financing costs and the
depressed level of demand in domestic and international markets; cost
overruns and unsatisfactory sales performance were common among subprojects
surveyed.
FOMIN Component
4.15      Subprojects Financed.  Under Loan 1552-ME FOMIN financed 29
subprojects at a cost of Mex$356.6 million (US$15.3 million) using US$8.4
million from the Bank loan. Of these, 22 were direct equity investments;
six took the form of convertible loans; and one received part as straight
equity and part as a convertible loan. Seven additional subprojects were
approved by FOMIN and the Bank, but were eventually cancelled before any
disbursements were made (See Annex 5). Seventeen of the subprojects
required equity investments over the free limit of US$150,000 in Bank
financing.
4.16      Under Loan 1881-ME, 61 FOMIN subprojects received financing
at a cost of Mex$2,005.8 million (US$16.1 million) and a disbursement of
US$10.0 million from the Bank loan. Of the 61 subprojects, 41 were
straight equity investments, 12 received both equity and convertible
subloans and eight were straight convertible type loans. Six additional
projects were cancelled. Fifteen firms received equity investments and/or
convertible subloans over the free limit of US$250,000 in Bank financing,



- 17 -
with the highest FOMIN investment being Mex$150 million and the highest
Bank participation Mex$109.5 million (US$580,000 at 1984 exchange rate), or
73% of FOMIN's participation. Bank participation in terms of total project
costs under the FOMIN component was 55% for Loan 1552-ME and 63% for Loan
1881-ME. The increase during Loan 1881-ME is due to a Government request
in mid-1983 to raise Bank Rarticipation in PAI disbursement to trust funds
from 502 to 73% in line with the policy approved for the follow-up Third
SMI project (Loan 2325-ME).
4.17      SubproJect characteristics:  Seventy percent of the subprojects
under Loan 1552-ME and 79% of those under Loan 1881-ME went to medium scale
enterprises (each receiving investments of Mex$5 million or over) which
used 95% and 97% of the funds respectively. This confirmed expectations at
appraisal (para. 3.19) based on the recognition that small scale firtms
depend on their own equity and in fact are reluctant to have a Government
agency as a partner. However, only four subprojects reached the maximum of
Mex$150 million. The size of FOMIN investments being Mex$12.2 million
(US$530,000) during Loan 1552-ME and Mex$32.8 million (US$264,000) during
Loan 1881-ME. Only three participants in Loan 1552-ME and four under Loan
1881-HE were first time investors and started new enterprises. This number
increases to eight and 27 respectively if new projects of existing
enterprises are considered 'new". The majority of FOMIN financing went to
expanding or restructuring existing enterprises. In some cases, the
assisted firms belonged to a larger conglomerate operating as a holding
company and in some of those cases (e.g., Grupo DEMSA-Notyformas) FOMIN
assisted several firms belonging to the same group. There are no specific
covenants in the loan agreements against investing in holding groups, these
procedures run counter to FOMIN's explicit role of stimulating the creation
of new SMI enterprises, and also conflicts with FOMIN goal of diversifying
its portfolio. FOMIN has begun to gradually diversify its clientele by
investing in newer enterpries, but mwre concrete efforts are needed in this
direction under the Fourth SMI project.
4.18      Geographically, although a high percentage (39%) of subprojects
financed were located in Zone III, a substantial number of enterprises
operated in Zones I (26%) and II (35%). Considering the high concentration
of professional and entrepreneurial talent around Mexico City, Monterrey
and Guadalajara, this degree of FOMIN project dispersion can be considered
satisfactory. An additional positive feature was the concentration of
FOMIN investments in specific geographic areas which were hitherto regarded
relatively underdeveloped (e.g. San Luis Potosi where FOMIN has, at
present, 12 investments, and Sinaloa where it has seven investments). More
than 90% of the FOMIN projects were designed to supply the domestic market,
with only 20% specifically intended to substitute for imports. Only 9% of
subprojects, using 22% of FOMIN's resources under both loans, were planned
for export.
4.19      Current Status of FOMIN Subprojects. Of the 89 projects financed
by FOMIN under both loans, only six subprojects are still under
implementation (one under Loan 1552-ME and five under Loan 1881-ME) while
the rest are all in operation. Some have already been sold or liquidated
(15 from Loan 1552-ME and eight from 1881-ME) (See Annex 9). To assess the
impact and present status of the different components under both Bank
loans, PAI undertook a special survey of FOMIN subprojects. However, the
Information provided by FOMIN-assisted enterprises was, in most cases,



- 18 -
patchy and inconsistent and in the cases of some firms where FOMIN had
already sold its participation, the enterprises refused to provide
information. FOMIN needs to strengthen its information base and collect on
a regular basis data on the operational aspects of the firms it supports.
This should be relatively easy since FOMIN maintains a relatively long term
association with its business partners through its equity investments.
More recently FOMIN has developed a good data base on its enterprises and
under the recently approved Fourth SMI Loan technical assistance resources
are being specifically provided to further develop FOMIN's information
systems.
4.20      As of December 1985, of all the investments or credits approved
under both loans (see Annex 9), only 17% are operating with profits, 46%
with losses, and 30% have been sold or liquidated, a situation which
though quite disappointing is reflective of the effects of the industrial
recession, which began in mid-1982. By December 1982, 54 companies (47% of
FOMIN's portfolio) were experiencing financial difficulties, many as a
result of exchange losses (following the large September 1982 devaluation),
high financial costs and associated working capital shortages. To some
extent the poor performance of FOMIN assisted enterprises is also due to
deficient financial management and an inability to handle crisis
situations.
4.21      The rates of. return calculations prepared for the PCR are however
quite optimistic ranging between 15.0 and 80.0% with an average of 33.2%
for Loan 1552-ME and 37.8% for Loan 1881-ME. Although the appraisals did
not project expected IRR, the actual rates of return can be considered very
acceptable by international venture capital standards. A random review of
recent supervision reports prepared by FOMIN staff and some visits to
enterprises indicate that (i) ex-post results are, for the most part, in
line with "ex ante" estimates, and (ii) at least 50% of the enterprises
currently facing financial difficulties can probably be rehabilitated.
4.22      Results of equity sales show that all 16 firms sold by FOMIN,
since inception of PAI-I resulted in capital gains, if investment is valued
at historical costs (Annex 9). However, a sample of cases calculated in
real terms shows most of these sales merely broke even or represent losses
in real terms. Even while accounting for the adverse effects of the
economic situation, FOMIN's meager sales performance on its equity
portfolio generally indicates poor investments and a weak divesture policy
characterized by sales of shares to existing owners with limited bargaining
position in the hands of FOMIN. With respect to the FOMIN convertible
loans under both loans 1552-ME and 1881-ME, Mex$493.5 (out of a total of
Mex$686.7 million) are currently outstanding in 14 subprojects.. As of
December 1985, six of these projects were in arrears of three months or
more, with total arrears of principal and interest amounting to MexS77.6
million, which represents 11% of the total amount provided as convertible
subloans. However, 62% of the arrears is concentrated in two firms which
are presently receiving technical assistance to help towards recovery.
Thus, while excluding the above two firms, the average of "arrears of three
months and over amounts to Mex$29.5 million, or only 4% of total financing
provided, and 6% of the outstanding balance, a reasonable average
considering the economic conditions prevailing.

FIDEIN Component
4.23      Overall operations.  Under Loan 1552-ME, FIDEIN provided
financing for 31 factory buildings, with a total PAI participation of
Mex$198.4 million (US$8.5 million) and a Bank participation of Mex$109.1
million (US$4.7 milion), or 55% of the total PAI financing. Also, three
equipment leasing subprojects were financed with a PAI participation of
Mex$25.3 million and Mex$13.9 (US$320,000) of loan proceeds. Under Loan
1881-HE, financial assistance was provided for the construction of 24
factory buildings, with a PAI participation of Mex$390 million and using
US$1.7 million of loan proceeds, three leasing operations were financed
under this loan requiring about Mex$27.4 million (US$220,000) of PAI
assistance and about US$120,000 of Loan proceeds.
4.24      Annex 10 summarizes some characteristics of the industrial
projects established within FIDEIN financed factory buildings. A detailed
analysis of subproject characteristics is not relevant in this case since
the performance of these beneficiaries can only be marginally attributed to
the buildings, or to the SFB (Standard Factory Buildings) subloans.
Nevertheless, the following features are of interest: (i) over 80% of
factory buildings were sold to small companies with less than Mex$25
million (in 1985 pesos) of equity; (ii) nearly 60X of enterprises assisted
under the program were new enterprises and nearly 70% of the enterprises
assisted were established on industrial estates located in Zone I of the
highest decentralization priority; (iii) loans to final beneficiaries had
maturities in the range of two to five years, with the majority being of
the four to five year range, which represents maturities much shorter than
expected at appraisal.  The cash flow from investments in factory buildings
proved to be quite positive, and about 702 of the amounts disbursed under
both loans have already been repaid to FIDEIN; (iv) to mid-1986 subprojects
were well balanced between different branches of industry, with a slight
predominance of machinery manufacturing firms which represented 13% of the
total allocations in number of enterprises, and 20% in total allocations of
funds under both loans.
4.25      FIDEIN subprojects were, in reality, a termrsale of a fixed asset
to industrial clients. Appraisals of the enterprises were carried out by
FIDEIN before sale of the buildings, but assessment of repayment
capabilities of the enterprises was limited to the building which, in most
Investment cases, represented only a small part of the investing companies
total operations and asset base. Furthermore, a few SFB were even paid for
in cash, in which case subproject appraisal became a purely academic
exercise. The only meaningful information that can be derived from the
results of the FIDEIN survey of subprojects is that out of 50 enterprises
surveyed (which represent about 80% of the total number of FIDEIN
subprojects), only two have gone out of business and their factory
buildings are closed and unused. The remaining 48 are still operating and
are using the SFBs for their intended purpose.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF INSTITUTIONS
PAI
5.01      Financing Operations.  The original agreement between SHCP and
NAFIN setting up PAI and its financing Fund provided a seed capital of
Mex$510 million (US$22.5 million equivalent) and stipulated that the
principal of the IBRD loan (US$47 million) was to be repaid by the Mexican
Government so that PAI could capitalize the loan resources. PAI was only
responsible for servicing the interest payments for the FOGAIN credit
component (US$30 million). In addition, NAFIN obtained from Banco de
Mexico a line of credit of MexS420 million (US$18.5 million) for additional
rediscounting operations of FOGAIN. It is not clear from the documents
whether PAI was obligated also to pay only the interest on the FOGAIN
portion of Loan 1881-ME.
5.02      PAI also received annual Government subventions (approximately
US$60 million equivalent since 1978) mainly to meet its administrative
expenses, over and above the amount needed for repayments to IBRD since
1981.  To meet its financial needs, PAI has also been borrowing funds from
NAFIN and Banco de Mexico. The funds borrowed from NAFIN were high cost
while the funds from Banco de Mexico have been slightly below the Average
Cost of Funds (ACF). As of May 31, 1986, FOGAIN represented 69% of PAI's
portfolio, FOMIN accounted for 13% and 19% was held by FIDEIN. In theory,
PAI should have received from the sub-programs the recoveries of the
credits or investments made by these institutions, but FOGAIN (its largest
client) did not transfer any funds. As already stated, (para. 3.05) during
1978-1982, the head of FOGAIN and PAI were the same person, and the
arrangements tended to favor FOGAIN allowing it to retain a high spread
from the interest rate charged to the final beneficiary. FOGAIN paid PAI
35% p.a. interest rate on the outstanding balance of the funds provided by
PAI, and kept the subloan repayments for its future lending.
5.03      Financial Performance.  Since its inception PAI has been losing
money and its equity base has been eroded despite the total infusion of
about US$350 million in quasi-equity, from the Mexican Government in the
form of seed capital or as subsidies in the form of repayments of principal
and as a portion of the interest on Bank's loans (PAI only pays interest on
a portion of the IBRD's loans). The following reasons have attributed to
PAI's losses: (i) PAI was responsible for the payment of the foreign
exchange risk on a substantial part of IBRD's loans; (ii) the low interest
rates paid by FOGAIN to PAI, was inadequate for PAI to cover interest and
foreign exchange losses, requiring it to borrow funds from NAFIN and Banco
de Mexico to cover operating expenses or losses; (iii) the subsidized
interest rates granted to FIDEIN's clients meant lower earnings for PAI
on these operations; and (iv) the relatively poor performance of FOMIN's
portfolio, and the retention of PAI resources by FOMIN for further
investment.
5.04      As seen from Annexes 26-27, PAI's interest rate income represents
a maximum of about 20% of the value of the portfolio, about a quarter of
the CPP level in 1986. This is insufficient for PAI to cover interest
payments and the foreign exchange losses. The portfolio in mid-1986 was
worth only about US$65 million equivalent, while the funds provided to PAI
have been worth at the time about US$350 million. The difference between



- 21 -
the full value of the IBRD loans (US$325 million, of which more than US$297
million have been disbursed to date) and that of the existing portfolio has
been due to the massive devaluations of the peso against the dollar, and
the relatively low interest rate spread received by PAI from FOGAIN, and
the non interest earnings equity investments financed through FOMIN. Above
all, while the credits or investments made by the institutions using PAI
resources are denominated in pesos, PAI has assumed the foreign exchange
risk which is not adequately covered by the interest rate spread it
receives. If PAI's interest rates had been closer to the CPP rate, the
income from interest income would have been gone much further towards
covering the foreign exchange losses and there would have been less erosion
of its capital base.
FOGAIN
5.05       Financial Performance.  The FOGAIN income statement, balance
sheet, and financial indicators for 1979-85 are presented in Annexes 15, 17
and 18. The rapid growth of FOGAIN lending operations during 1979-85
(para.4.06) had a positive impact upon its financial performance. FOGAIN's
loan portfolio grew at an explosive rate of 25% in dollar terms in the
1979-82 period. On the income side, with an exception of 1980 in which
FOGAIN had a moderate profit Mex $3.9 million (US$130-125 million) due the
beginning of the government annual contributions, from 1981 to 1983 it made
net losses. In 1981 FOGAIN incurred net losses of Mex$ 6.8 million (US$2.2
million) and in 1983 Mex $419.5 million (US$2.7 million).  This was mainly
due to the foreign exchanti losses incurred on its IDB borrowings, which
were not covered by the fixed interest rates maintained over the life
of the subloans.  In addition, FOGAIN's cost of borrowing increased along
with inflation -- in the period under review its operating portfolio
carried an average peso interest rate of about 18% compared to its average
cost funds, excluding its equity base, of about 30%.  The losses were only
partially covered by Government subsidies and in 1984, FOGAIN was absolved
from carrying the foreign exchange risk.
5.06      The appraisal reports for Loans 1552-ME and 1881-ME had predicted
operating losses in case domestic inflation rates accelerated and if FOGAIN
interest rates were left unadjusted. In the earlier years (1979-83) FOGAIN
interest rates did fall behind inflation rates with consequent income
losses. However, starting in 1984, FOGAIN's made a profit of Mex$20.4
billion (US$12.8 million) increasing to Mex $39.8 billion in 1985 (US$18.0
million) and to Mex $15.2 billion in 1986 (US$52.1 million).  The positive
operating results were essentially a direct consequence of the variable
interest rate policy (adopted by FOGAIN in late 1984) linked to a inflation
base which was rapidly on the rise, since 1983.
5.07       As far as expenditures are concerned, interest charges (i.e.,
interest paid on funds received) is the major cost item.  This financial
charge decreased in relation to FOGAIN's total income from 87% in 1981 to
54% in 1985 as a result of a progressive reduction in interest rates linked
to increased borrowing from IDB/Bank whoes resources were obtained at fixed
rates denominated in pesos. FOGAIN's administrative costs were less than
2% of average total assets an acceptable level compared with similar
institutions elsewhere.



- 22 -
5.08       FOGAIN's total assets show an increase in current terms in 1980
from Mex $9.7 billion (US$689.2 million) to Mex $130.8 billion (US$448.7
million) in 1985, however, a decline in dollar terms. An analysis of the
balance sheets presented in Annex 18 shows that most significant asset, the
loan portfolio, grew rapidly between 1982 and 1985 in current terms from
Mex $33.7 billion (US$317.8 million) to Mex $123.7 billion (US $24.3
million), but fell in real terms, as a consequence of domestic inflation
and a reduction of FOGAIN's borrowing levels.  The loan portfolio
constitutes approximately 95.0% of the asset base. Liabilities as an
element in the overall position of FOGAIN shows an increase in current
Mex$4.9 billion to Mex$61.6 billion, but a decline in US$ terms from
US$165.6 million to US$153.4 million.  From a time perspective the
structure of FOGAIN's liabilities has improved: whereas in 1984, 36% of
all liabilities were short term, only 24% were in this category in 1985.
This is the result of a deliberate policy to replace short-term high cost
borrowing instruments with foreign financed fixed interest resources.
5.09       FOGAIN's equity capital consists mainly of Federal Government
contributions in the form of budget appropriations and the recoveries of
loans negotiated with international institutions. Prior to 1984 its equity
capital was eroded through exchange losses and through inflation, but for
the entire period 1980-85 it grew in current nominal terms, with the
equity capital rising from Mex $1.9 billion to Mex $69.2 billion. Capital
as a factor in liabilities plus equity has increased steadily from 20% in
1980 to 53% in 1985. Also, the debt/equity ratio dropped from 2.58 in 1980
to 0.89 ln 1985, a level that put FOGAIN in a sound a financial position.
FOMIN
5.10   Investment Portfolio.  FOMIN's operations during the implementation
of both loans grew rapidly; in nominal terms its investment portfolio of
Mex$181.9 million as of December 1977, grew to an aggregate investment of
Mex$6,777.4 million, as of December 1985. In real terms FOMIN's
cperational growth is less impressive, however, and shows a portfolio
increase from US$6.2 million in 1977 to US$22.3 million in 1985. Thus,
FOMIN's portfolio grew at an annual rate of 57% in nominal terms and 18.0%
in real terms between 1977 and 1985.
5.11      FOMIN's increase in investment was made possible through a major
capitalization program which is reflected in an equity increase from
Mex$377 million in 1978 to Mex$5,710.6 million in 1985, in nominal terms.
Although an important part of this increase is due to the revaluation of
fixed assets in line with inflation, Government capital contributions also
increased from Mex$435.7 million in 1978 to Mex$2,630.4 in 1984. In dollar
terms, FOMIN's equity rose from US$12.7 million in 1978, to US$19.6 million
in 1985, or a growth of 6.4% per year. The Government contributions and,
to a lesser extent, retained earnings from FOMIN's own operations
(MexS496.0 million as of December 1985) contributed to the growth in
equity. The second most important element contributing to the increase in
assets was PAI's financial support to FOMIN, which went up from zero in
1978-79, when the NAFINSA-World Bank program started, to Mex$2,732 million
(US$9.4 million) in 1985. In 1985 FOMIN's own resources, consisting of
retained earnings, investment sales, and interest from subordinated loans,
represented 43Z of its total funds.



- 23 -
5.12      Financial Performance.  After incurring losses until 1979,
FOMIN's revenues increased significantlv, due to the rapid growth of its
portfolio, due to the introduction of convertible credits and to a more
profit-oriented asset sales policy. From 1980, net revenues covered
operating administrative expenses. By 1981 operating expenses (Mex$63
million) represented 62% of current income (Mex$102 million) and at
year-end 1985, operating expenses (Mex$328 million) represented only 52% of
current income (Mex$630 million) and only 4.8% of FOMIN's total portfolio
(See Annex 18).
5.13      Based on the above results, FOMIN's financial situation appears
to be sound, even while discounting for inflationary distortions, and the
impossible task of adequately assessing the current market value of its
portfolio. On the liabilities side, FOMIN does not bear the full cost of
losses on its investments (it only repays PAI to the extent of its
investment recoveries) and in the case of profitable investments it repays
PAI only in nominal terms plus half-of the capital gains. Therefore,
FOMIN's growth in equity does not necessarily mean-a real improvement in
the effectiveness of its investment operations. The revaluation of the
portfolio does not always reflect fully the increase in value or in actual
prices and therefore cannot be said to show the real increase in equity.
On the assets side, while FOMIN has increased the number and value of its
operations, the present financial status of the companies in FOMIN's
portfolio makes it highly improbable that the values given as to the
different items in the balance sheets represent their real market value.
Any assessment of FOMIN's current financial position must take account of
the above and in the future, as agreed during appraisal of Loan 2325-ME,
procedures should be followed to require FOMIN to update regularly the
market value of its portfolio and to produce audited financial statements
for management purposes.
FIDEIN
5.14      Financial Performance.  FIDEIN's past financial statements is in
Annex 25. An assessment of FIDEIN's net worth is difficult since audited
statements for most years during both loans were qualified mainly due to
the problems related to the transfer of ownership of industrial estates to
and from State Governments, without clear agreements on the financial
conditions. Evaluation of FIDEIN's assets was extremely dificult. Also
the audited statements, since 1984, have been prepared in nominal terms.
5.15      An analysis of the limited financial data available shows an
improvement in FIDEIN's financial situation during 1979-84, but again the
manner of resource transfer from PAI to FIDEIN obscures the real
situation. In the loans under review NAFIN agreed with the Bank that
FIDEIN would not pay interest on the Bank funds used for its operations
until it was generating sufficient income to make this possible. FIDEIN
was expected to repay to NAFIN the principal of the accounts received under
the loan, as and when it recovered such accounts from individual invest-
ments. However, FIDEIN's inventory of buildings created liabilities from
FIDEIN to PAL at the time of construction. Several years later, when the
buildings were sold they generated income at prices prevailing in the year
of sales. The difference produced a significant nominal increase in
FIDEIN's assets so that in nominal terms assets grew by more than six times
between 1980 and 1985, but its equity remained almost constant in nominal



- 24 -
terms and decreased substantially in real terms. While FIDEIN's Income
Statements show profits from 1981 onwards, they include as income
substantial Government subsidies which hide the real operational losses.
5.16      As of December 1985, only ten of the 54 FIDEIN clients under both
loans were in arrears of three months or over amounting to MexS13.8 million
in principal and Mex$52.9 million in interest, out Of a total outstanding
balance of Mex$491.0 million and a total amount of credit operations of
Mex$1,235.7 million. However, nearly 50% of the principal in arrears
(Mex$6.4 million) and over 70% (Mex$37,300) of interest in arrears, were
concentr4ted in two companies (Becal, S.A. and Ceramicas Filtrantes, S.A.)
both already under litigation. The other arrears are mainly short-term
(less than six months) and have not increased during the last three years.
These short-term arrears amount to Mex$32.9 million, including both
principal and interest, and represent 7% of the total outstanding balance
and a 3% of total lending by FIDEIN, an acceptable figure considering the
crisis in the Mexican industry.
VI. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES
PAI Extension Service
6.01      A central feature of the PAT program was the creation of an
industrial extension service which was designed by NAFIN with Bank
assistance. The role of the extension service was to make small scale
industrialists aware of the sources of financial assistance, and to provide
them directly with some basic technical/managerial assistance. In addition,
for resolution of specific problems the extensionists were to refer
entrepreneurs to specialized technical assistance institutions cooperating
in the program.   The results of the extension services can be considered
as quite significant both in terms of the positive institution building and
of services provided to SMI's. The Bank made substantial contributions to
the development of the extension service through comments and suggestions
following some in-depth supervisions.  However, the key element in the
strengthening of the service was the full commitment of NAFIN to the
concept of an "integrated program' of assistance to SMIs which included a
common extension service for the three executing agencies.
6.02      Staff and Staff Training.  The extension service started
operations in mid-1979 with the training of 20 extension officers in a
six-week program designed and implemented with the assistance of
specialized training institutions (e.g., IPADE, CENAPRO). A further group
of extension officers were trained in August/September 1979; and by
year-end 1979, 40 qualified officers had been deployed to 14 offices
throughout Mexico. By the end of 1981, PAI's extension service had 93
industrial extension agents and eight auxiliary technical staff which, in
addition to eight regional subdirectors and 8 regional coordinators,
amounted to a corps of 117 extension professionals deployed in 26
branches. The system was operating under the gu'tance of eight regional
subdirectors and a small central coordinating staff at headquarters.   All
of the 117 staff had been recruited and trained through a rigorous program
during 1979/1980. The conditions offered to the extension officers were
attractive at the time and the number of applicants exceeded by a wide
margin the number of places available. PAI was thus able to choose from a



- 25 -
select group of capable young professionals with varying backgrounds in
engineering, economics and business administration.
6.03      Each PAI extension branch is staffed with two to three extension
officers, depending on the level of priority assigned to each region.
Regional offices visited (Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, San Luis Potosi,
Leon and Mazatlan) revealed a high degree of motivation, professional
competence and knowledge of the respective industrial groups on the part of
all extension officers. The quality and quantity of work performed by the
regional offices appears satisfactory. It should be noted that such work
has been performed since 1982 with limited means and logistic support. The
extension service has become fully institutionalized and has recently been
put under the management of NAFIN's Diiectorate of Industrial Promotion,
which plans to further strengthen and expand this services to cover
hitherto unattended regions. Under the recently approved Fourth SMI
project, the largest porticn of the technical assistance funds would be
used to support the expanded activities of the extension service.
6.04      The initial training provided to the staff -- using loan
resources -- was comprehensive and of high quality. The training given
together with the high motivation of the staff resulted in low turnover in
the first years and an excellent rapport between extensionists and
entrepreneurs during the period 1979-82. After 1983 staff turnover in the
extension service was high following management changes in PAI and FOGAIN
and a deterioration in the conditions of employment due to Government's
austerity measures. In terms of geographical coverage the original plan
was to locate extension officers in NAFIN's regional offices and thereby
reduce administrative costs. However, this policy had to change ini order
to reach designated priority areas and by year-end 1985 the number of
regional branches had increased to 33. Furthermore, the most recent policy
review (January 1986) set the number of offices at 38 classified in four
different categories. The total number of extensionists in December 1985
was 94 plus the regional subdirectors and central coordinators together
with 20 or so headquarters staff.
6.05      Operational Policies and Procedures.  The basic policy and the
philosophy of the PAI extension service is to make contact with as many
SMI's in the area as possible and to make them aware of the range of
institutions and programs being offered to help them. The types of
activities to be undertaken by extension officers were designed to fall
under five different categories: (i) promotion (making first contact with
enterprises); (ii) technical advice (making a quick diagnosis and providing
direct assistance); (iii) referrals (to specialized technical
institutions); (iv) training (for entrepreneurs 4t;d bank officers); and
(v) group actions (assistance to groups of entrepteneurs). Two different
periods in the extension service development can be identified. One, when
PAI and FOGAIN were together under the same Director General and then after
1983 when the PAI-FOGAIN separation started and the extension services
began to redefine its role. Although the separation of PAI and FOGAIN
actually took place in early 1984, the second stage of review and
redefinition of PAI's role lasted until mid-1985 and, in some respects, is
still going on.



- 26 -
6.06      During the earlier phase of its operations, a major part of PAl's
extension activities was concentrated in promoting FOGAIN's credit
operations. The close relationship between extension work and credit was
further stimulated by the existence of subsidized interest rates on FOGAIN
credits which encouraged many SMI clients to cooperate in various technical
assistance programs in the hope of gaining access to a FOGAIN credit. In
retrospect, it is clear that in spite of some shortcomings in this mode of
operation, the close relationship with credit served as an effective
opening to "sell' the idea of technical/managerial assistance to the
entrepreneurs. As a result, when PAI started some innovative approaches
(e.g. collective assistance through "clusters"), entrepreneurs were ready
to cooperate. Later, when PAI was separated from FOGAIN, in early 1984,
the extension service was already mature, experienced and above all known
to try new approaches and to broaden its clientele.  Under the current
policy, PAI's technical/managerial assistance is less concerned with
promoting FOGAIN credits which is seen as only one of the many tools of
assistance available to the enterprise.
6.07      In terms of delivery procedures, the most significant
development, in the period under review, was the change from assistance to
individuals to groups of enterpreneurs. While group assistance procedures
are not new in extensionism, the methods used in Mexico were developed,
with the assistance of a foreign expert, to fit the Mexican environment.
The 'clusters" approach of organizing groups of firms in the same
geographical area and with similar product lines (shoes, textiles,
furniture, glass, etc.), and imparting technical assistance to the group,
has achieved good success over the years. As an outcome of the "clusters"
work, entrepreneurs have not only improved their technical and management
skills, but have also organized purchasing cooperatives, credit unions,
joint exhibits, quality control groups, subcontractors' exchanges and other
forms of cooperation. Groups of entrepreneurs have expressed their
appreciation for the assistance received in this way from the extension
service and from each other. They recognized the value of that assistance
and have expressed their willingness to pay a moderate price for further
assistance.
6.08      During 1985 PAI conducted 66 general and 70 specialized courses,
most of which were of about 20 hours duration. During 1984, 2,524 SMI
enterpreneurs participated in these 136 courses which were offered free or
at very modest cost. These training courses have suffered until now for
lack of local training material. PAI headquarters, recognizing this
problem, has recently prepared a collection of cases based on SMI in Mexico
which should help to improve the relevance of the training given.
Technical Assistance Institutions
6.09      Each of the Loans included a US$2.0 million technical assistance
component to finance the foreign exchange costs of training the extension
agents and the equipment needed for specialized technical assistance
institutions. While the First SMI loan did not specify a breakdown of the
technical assistance component, the second SMI loan estimated the resource
allocation as follows: 20% for INFOTEC, 22% for CENAPRO, 24% for PAI, 17%
to be divided be:ween FOGAIN, FIDEIN and FOMIN, and 16% for other
institution  (e.g. IMIT, FONEP, training schools).



- 27 -
6.10      In practice the use of T.A. funds under the First and Second
Loans was substantially different than anticipated. INFOTEC used 50% of
the funds, 40% of which was used to buy a computer system and 60% for
foreign expenditure costs of foreign publications, patents and consultant
services. Although INFOTEC definitely increased its work for SMI during
this period there is no evidence that the funds used from this component
were used for help only to SMI; FOGAIN used 29% of the funds, of which
half was spent in calculators, typewriters and leasing of computing
equipment, ard the other half in office furniture, office remodeling and
publications for promotional purposes; PAI used 15% of the funds, of which
nearly one-half was spent in paying for rental of conference rooms and
oifice remodeling and the other half in paying for a foreign consultant to
help develop the 'clusters" program; CENAPRO used 5% of the funds in
audiovisual equipment, which was subsequently transferred, when CENAPRO was
dissolved, to the Labor Ministry. FOMIN and FIDEIN used less than 1% of
the funds altogether and operated without even some essential elements for
their every day operations (e.g., computers and calculators).
6.11      In sum, the technical assistance component which was managed
exclusively by PAI was not successful in coordinating the resource
allocations and to evaluating the expenditures as related to the goals of
SMI support programs. It should be noted also that Bank supervision
missions did not raise the issue of the use of the T.A. funds with the PAI
Secretariat although questions were raised by the Bank when the
expenditures were submitted for approval. In retrospect, eventhough the
technical assistance program was loosely defined the Bank supervision
missions should have insisted that PAI develop a forward-looking
monitorable technical assistance program, with adequate attention and
resources applied to strengthening the operations of the main implementing
agencies (FOGAIN, FOMIN and FIDEIN). In fact, a major drawback of the
centralized control of technical assistance funds was that the implementing
agencies did not benefit adequately from the resources for their
institution building activities. To correct these anomalies, the recently
appraised SMI project includes two features different from the earlier
projects: first each participating institution will manage its own
technical assistance program and secondly the technical assistance package
has been prepared In detail with elaborate implementation schedules which
can be jointly monitored by NAFIN and the Bank.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      General.  Overall the Bank played a positive role in the
institutional development of the three executing agencies FOGAIN, FOMIN,
and FIDEIN and at the same time it provided much needed long-term
investment resources for SMIs. During implementation of the two projects,
the executing agencies consolidated their policies, improved their
operational procedures and built up a well-trained staff. Nevertheless,
they still have to overcome weaknesses in project promotion, evaluation and
supervision, and other important lessons have been learned from the
implementation experience which are discussed below.



- 28 -
PAI
7.02      Throughout the implementation of the loans, program coordination
was an area of concern to the Bank. The projects were complex involving
three participating institutions, an overall controlling authority (NAFIN)
and PAI, an integrating organization. The Bank was fully conscious of the
problems in getting all these elements to work together and efforts were
made to improve coordination by raising this issue with the appropriate
authorities during supervisions and by maintaining a direct contact with
all the trust funds and with PAI. Despite these efforts, it must be
acknowledged that the coordination did not prove effective in getting all
the groups involved in both projects to work together. A major
implementation lesson from the operation of an integrated program with a
central coordinating body and a common financing fund for the several
programs is to confine the coordinating role simply to providing policy
guidance and to monitor projects, and not to directly manage the programs
of independent executing agencies. Above all it is preferable to
capitalize the executing agencies directly and to concentrate project
resources in their institutional strengthening. Accordingly, under the
Fourth SMI project, the Government has decided to: abolish the PAI
financing fund and restrict the role of the technical secretariat to
collecting information. Overall project policy guidance will be provided
by a small high level coordinating committee.
Technical Assistance
7.03      The most positive aspect of the two loans was the setting up and
operation of an extension service for SMI enterprises. Besides its direct
support, the extension service mobilized the assistance of other technical
institutions involved with industrial issues. Under the two projects,
innovative extension approaches were tested, and successfully replicated in
different geographical areas. The support for other technical assistance
institutions proved to be diffuse, and it is difficult to ascertain the
extent to which SMIs benefitted directly from the activities of these.
institutions. An Important lesson is that the technical assistance program
in projects should be developed in detail with specific targets which can
be monitored (para. 6.11).
FOGAIN
7.04      Since the two loans under review were first appraised, FOGAIN
has been successful, both financially (para. 5.05) and operationally
(para. 4.06). It has made profits, and expanded its operations very
rapidly. The acceleration in its loan portfolio, however, had some costs
in that FOGAIN's operating procedures were in some cases applied loosely,
particularly in areas of subproject evaluation and control (para. 3.11).
Despite certain shortcomings, the subprojects have had positive economic
impact in employment .creation and in industrial decentralization (para.
4.09). FOGAIN was also successful in mobilizing financial resources, both
domestically and from international agencies. Its management over the
period (1978-85) has generally been dynamic and its staff capable and
dedicated. Evidence of FOGAIN maturity and capacity was shown by its
ability to adapt and in fact expand its lending operations in the face of
the severe economic constraints faced by the country in the 1982-83
period.



- 29 -
7.05      One of FOGAIN's weaker points has been its subproject supervision
and the lack of data on actual subproject performance and the quality of
the loan portfolio at the commercial bank level (para 3.12). Part of this
problem is the extreme sensitivity in relations between FOGAIN and the
nationalized commercial banks, which consider FOGAIN's information needs,
as an "unnecessary irritant' particularly when the entire credit risk is
borne by the banks themselves. On the other hand, the commercial banks
appear to be more concerned about the collateral aspects of lending and
have not adequately monitored the performance of subprojects, especially
after the construction or equipment installation phase ends. Under the
Fourth SMI project assistance has been provided to help FOGAIN and the
financial intermediaries improve their subprojected information system. In
addition, a time-bound plan was agreed to initiate a system for collection
of key information on the status of subloan rcoveries at the intermediary
level.
7.06      Thus a major implementation lesson from the FOGAIN component is
that the Bank should concentrate from initiation on requiring improvements
in the operating procedures (subproject evaluation, supervision and
monitoring) of the institutions it finances and for this purpose the
technical assistance resources should be clearly targetted. This is
particularly important in the case where the Bank is supporting an already
well established institution like FOGAIN, with in-built resistance to
changes in procedures which have been operating for 25 years.
FOMIN
7.07      FOMIN started its equity financing operations under the 1552-ME
components in 1978 at a t*ime when the concept of providing risk capital for
new SMI investments was virtually unknown in Mexico, and moreover the idea
of a financing partnership with a Government-financed institution was
considered inappropriate by private SMI entrepreneurs. Consequently,
FOMIN's initial investment strategy had to concentrate on image building
working with established entrepreneurs. It performed this task exceedingly
well and helped in the expansion of existing plants and in creating new
projects. The Mexican economic crisis of 1982-83 forced FOMIN into some
unplanned involvement in financial restructuring investments, which has in
restrospect been a good learning experience which is expected to prove
useful under the FOMIN financial restructuring component under the Fourth
SMI project.
7.08      FOMIN has built a significant institutional knowledge and
experience in the difficult field of promotion, appraisal and supervision
of equity investments in SMI. It has filled a critical gap in equity
finance, in the absence of an equity market and any other institutional
source of equity for medium size firms. FOMIN has also promoted the
development of venture capital companies, of which the first five were
authorized in May 1986. In retrospect, while FOMIN has successfully
progressed to an innovative investment institution offering imaginative
financial packages for SMI development, it needs to introduce more rigour
in the selection of its investments which have not enjoyed complete
success; in fact a substantial portion of FOMIN's portfolio has been
adversely affected by the recent deterioration in economic conditions.



- 30 -
7.09      On balance, FOMIN's financial situation appears to be sound
although again the discounting procedures between PAI and FOMIN, and
inflationary distortions may obscure the real financial situation (para.
5.10, 5.12). Since FOMIN does not itself bear the losses on bad
investments, FOMIN shows a continual increase in its equity which includes
capitalization of nominal rather than real capital gains. In practice,
divesture procedures have been the weakest point in FOMIN's operations. In
the absence of a well-established capital market, transactions of minority
shareholdings in medium-size companies remain restricted mainly to
"buy-backs" by the majority shareholders. In determining the sales price
of its participations FOMIN has usually considered the revaluation of its
initial contribution or the book value of shares plus a modest (5%) premium
on risk. Only recently, under Loan 2523-ME has FOMIN begun to explore
other methods of valuation (e.g. projections of firm's future earnings).
Income from interest on convertible loans and interest on sale of shares,
has, in nominal teris, more than covered FOMIN's operating expenses.
7.10      FOMIN's appraisal procedures are still limited to traditional
credit project appraisals and the venture capital aspects of appraisal
(i.e. entrepreneurial abilities of majority shareholders, market life of
new technologies) are not given proper assessment (para. 3.20). Also, the
venture capital approach to investment selection is not yet fully
recognized and there should be a more rapid rejection of nonviable
investment proposals.. Greater promotional effort is required to reach new
potential entrepreneurs and .to use the resources of INFOTEC, IMIT and other
technical institutions, to generate innovative projects.
FIDEIN
7.11      The FIDEIN program has produced .mixed results;  While its park
development schemes have contributed to industrial decentralization the
results of its standard factory building (SFB)construction program, in
common services facilities, and leasing of buildings and equipment were far
less than anticipated at appraisal. While the development of industrial
parks played an important role in industrial location, there were very few
cases of relocation of existing units since the majority of the enterprises
financed by FIDEIN were new and in some cases subsidiaries of existing
firms located in the highly concentrated industrial zones (Mexico City,
Monterrey, and Guadalajara). FIDEIN's SFB program had a good demonstration
effect but as a business proposition public interest in SFBs was limited
since investors preferred custom-made industrial buildings. As a result,
FIDEIN was unable to market its SFBs and its inventory of buildings was
finally liquidated in early 1986 (paras 4.23 - 4.25).
7.12      Management problems plagued FIDEIN operations throughout, due
mainly to a lack of direction which was aggravated by the end of 1981
through (a) an apparently conflicting perspective towards FIDEIN from its
two guiding institutions (SAHOP, the technical supervisor, and NAFIN, the
financial trustee), and (b) irregularities in FIDEIN's financial
management, during 1981, which prompted NAFIN to change FIDEIN's Director
General and its main operational officers. After this there were various
changes in policies and in FIDEIN's role (para 3.24 - 3.26). In its new
role after 1982 FIDEIN reinforced its Technical Department and financing
was limited to infrastructure development on industrial estates. The
successive changes in policy and management since 1979 have hampered
FIDEIN's development and damaged its institutional effectiveness.



- 31 -
7.13      The implementation experience of the FIDEIN component clearly
demonstrates the operating difficulties of an institution which was seeking
to change its role from a technical assistance (engineering type)
institution to a financial intermediary without the necessary wherewithal
to carry out its new role. The Bank appraisal missions recognized the need
for institutionpl strengthening if FIDEIN was to carry out its new role,
and hence appropriate plans for staff strengthening were drawn up under
both loans. During implementation these plans were given lower priority.
Given the complexity of the two projects (with several components) the
small FIDEIN investment component received relatively less attention both
from the Mexican authorities and the Bank supervision missions. Because of
the lack of action in strengthening FIDEIN, this component was excluded
during the appraisal of the Fourth SMI project. The Government and NAFIN
pressed hard for the inclusion of FIDEIN as an excuting agency for the
industrial park component. Recently NAFIN/FIDEIN have taken several
positive measures to improve FIDEIN's performance. During the negotiations
of the Fourth SMI project several additional time-bound measures were
agreed upon for FIDEIN's institutional strengthening.
