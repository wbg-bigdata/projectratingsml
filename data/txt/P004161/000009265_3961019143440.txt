MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:       Project Completion Report on Korea - Third Technology Advancement
Project (Loan 3315-KO)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Korea - Third Technology
Advancement project (Loan 3315-KO, approved in FY91), prepared by the East Asia and Pacific
Regional Office. Part 11 was prepared by all three beneficiary institutes.
This is the third and the last in a series of projects which aimed at providing funds for the
purchase of modern equipment needed by five prestigious national institutes for their research and
development (R & D) efforts. The broad objective of this project was to strengthen industrial R &
D and basic research capacity and to enhance the application of industrial standards to raise the
quality of products. This was in conformity with the Government's policy which sought to expand
and strengthen vocational, technical and tertiary education in science and engineering, as well as
public and private R & D activities to support Korea's quest to join the ranks of the industrialized
countries.
The availability of the new equipment and facilities made it possible for the three institutes to
increase their R & D activities, joint projects, testing for quality improvement and technical and
scientific publications. The Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), for example, has
increased its contribution to national and international academic and engineering publications from
254 in 1991 to 367 in 1993, while the aggregate number of commercialized R & D results have
reached 51 between 1991 and September 1994. At the National Industrial Technology Institute
(NITI), the number of technical assistance projects to the small-and medium-scale enterprises has
grown from 803 in 1991 to 1309 in 1994, while the number of test certificates issued increased to
an annual level of 140,000 in 1994 from 51,000 in 1991.
Through its lending to the education sector and for technology development, the Bank has
been closely associated with the technological advancement of Korea. This association has made it
possible for the Bank to gain valuable insight and experience in the design of technology
development projects and their successful implementation.
Considering the success of the institutes in improving their laboratories, carrying out more R
& D projects and achieving results, the outcome of this project is rated as satisfactory. The
project has had substantial institutional development impact and its sustainability is rated as likely.
The PCR is of satisfactory quality. No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
THIRD TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3315 - KO)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Technology
Advancement Project in Korea for which Loan 3315-KO in the amount of US$60.0
million was approved on April 2, 1991.  The loan was closed or. schedule on
June 30, 1994.  The loan account books were kept open to honor applications
received before October 31, 1994.  The last transaction was made on September
22, 1994. The loan account was closed on September 22, 1994 with a total
disbursement of US$59.8 million or 99.7% of the loan account.
The PCR was prepared in November/December, 1994 by EA1HR (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). The Borrower's Ministry of Finance was
requested to act as the coordinator for the three parts of Part II of the PCR.
The three reports constituting Part II were received in the Bank in November
1994.
Preparation of this PCR was started in November 1993 when a Bank mission
requested the three institutions concerned to complete and return Project
Review from Borrower's Viewpoint (Part II) and Bank-prepared pro-formas for
the preparation of Part III of the PCR. The May 1994 Bank mission followed up
with reminders on the pro-formas and the obligations of the borrower for
submission of Part II of the PCR to the Bank. Based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement dated June 30, 1991, supervision and
progress reports, correspondence between the Bank and Borrower, and internal
Bank memoranda and documents, Bank staff prepared the PCR in
November/December, 1994.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
THIRD TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3315 - KO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
OBJECTIVES
(i) The objectives of the project were largely met (paras. 6 and 15). The
objectives of the project were to improve the quality of research programs for
developing advanced technologies, increasing opportunities for joint basic
research activities through strengthening common research facilities, and to
enhance the development and application of industrial standards. The impact
of the project in all three project institutions was positive (paras. 15 and
16).
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
(ii) Overall implementation experience was generally satisfactory. The
project closed on schedule with no cost overrun. There were three components
- equipment and technical assistance financed by the loan, and equipment-
related civil works, which were financed by the Government. Equipment
procurement was very close to target with disbursements of US$58.5 million out
of loan proceeds of US$60.0 million. Thus actual disbursements were 99.7% of
the loan amount. There was one violation of the Bank's Procurement
Guidelines(May 1985) on the part of the National Industrial Technology
Institute (NITI) which neglected the announcement of the General Procurement
Notice. This was resolved and did not adversely affect the bidding process
for equipment. Cooperation between the Bank and the project institutions was
generally satisfactory, which can be attributed to strong start-up assistance
from the Bank, good project preparation, and the high quality of local
implementation officials.
RESULTS
(iii) The equipment procured under the project was relevant to the project's
objectives. The quality of research programs has been improved at KIST. The
opportunity for joint research activities in the basic sciences has been
increased through the strengthening of joint common facilities at KBSC. The
development and application of industrial standards through the strengthening
of NITI has been enhanced.



- iv -
SUSTAINABILITY
(iv) The government's continued strong emphasis on science and technology
aimed at entering the ranks of technologically advanced countries assures the
sustainability of this project. The project institutions are prestige
institutions in Korea and receive strong support from their parent ministries
and the government (paras. 17-19). KIST is one of Korea's leading multi-
disciplinary research institutes covering a broad spectrum of applied research
activities. Thus it will continue to be well-financed and to recruit high
quality researchers, thereby ensuring the sustainability of the project's
investment. KBSC, which was established to provide more opportunities for
joint basic science research, is given priority according to the government
policy to promote basic science, the very foundation of technological
innovation. NITI is supporting small and medium industry (SMI) by carrying
out mandatory tests and analyses related to industrial standards, product
quality control, weights and measures etc., thereby raising product quality.
The government's determination to reduce dependence on imported technology and
industrial parts is reflected in policies to encourage SMIs to raise product
quality. The importance of this institute will ensure continued strong
support from government which, in turn, will reinforce the sustainability of
the project's investments.
FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED
(v) Project design was consistent with sectoral objectives and with previous
Bank lending in technology development and science and technical education in
Korea. Project design focused on hardware (equipment and civil works) which
was appropriate in view of the well-developed state of the project
institutions. They were well-managed, staffed and financed. The need was for
upgrading the teaching and research laboratories to permit the highly-
qualified staff to work more effectively. Given the straightforward nature of
project design and its successful implementation, there were no major lessons
to be learned. Nevertheless, some insight can be gained. Strong initial
start-up assistance from the Bank and the dedication of competent local staff
enhanced the prospects for successful implementation.

THIRD TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3315-KO)
PART I. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    Project Identity
- Project Name:   Third Technology Advancement Project
- Loan No.:        3315-KO
- RVP Unit:        East Asia and Pacific Region, Country Department I
- Country:         Korea
- Sector:          Education
- Subsector:       Science and Technology
B.    Project Background
1.        Sector Development Objectives  In support of the Government's
industrial restructuring policy, the objectives of the science and technology
sector were to:
-    develop and utilize technology to the fullest;
-    gain continued improvements in productivity;
-    expand high value added output which is technologically
sophisticated, energy efficient and strongly export-oriented; and
-    enhance the role of small and medium industry (SMI) for reducing
industrial concentration and over-dependence on imported parts and
materials.
In line with these priorities, the education sector's objectives were: to
develop R&D capacity in both educational institutions and research institutes;
to develop indigenous technology to overcome the increasing difficulty of
importing technology from abroad; and to upgrade and restructure the skill mix
requirements for meeting the demands of an increasingly technology-intensive
industrial sector.
2.        Policy Context.  The government places heavy emphasis on the
promotion of science and technology with the primary policy directions on
developing selected high-technology areas towards the 21st century,
strengthening science programs for the younger generation, and securing stable
financial resources for R&D investment. The above objectives are reflected in
the Government's strong commitment to the promotion of science and technology.
3.        Research and Development.  The growth of R&D in Korea underwent
three major changes. First, the emphasis in the early stage on Government
expenditures changed to the predominantly industry-funded investments
following the introduction, in the 1970s, of incentives for the private sector
to expand R&D expenditures. Second, total R&D expenditures increased from
0.6% of GNP in 1980 to 2% in 1986 and are planned to reach 3% by 1995 and 5%



- 2 -
by 2001. Third, the ratio of scientists and engineers (the basic human
resource for R&D), was planned to increase from 13 per 10,000 population in
1986 to 30 per 10,000 by 2001. Further, the National Project scheme has been
introduced to develop broader technological infrastructure in priority areas,
strengthen linkage between industry and public R&D institutes and promote
research on industry-initiated topics under joint ventures between SMI and
contracted research institutes.
4.        Science and Technology Education.  In Korea, the development of
education at the secondary and higher levels has generally borne a close
relationship to the country's economic development, especially in relation to
industrial growth and restructuring. The shift from labor-intensive to
capital-intensive and increasingly to technology-intensive industry has been
accompanied by changes in the education system. Early emphasis was placed on
vocational and technical education to produce skilled workers. This was
followed by an expansion of junior technical colleges to train industrial
technicians. As the economy moved towards more technology-intensive
production, greater emphasis was placed on undergraduate science and
engineering programs to produce professional scientists and engineers followed
by priority for graduate education in these fields to supply key R&D
personnel.
5.        Small and Medium Industry.  Industrial policy in the 1970s gave
priority to the development of the large conglomerates. They grew rapidly
while SMI activity declined in terms of share of employment and value added.
In the eighties, this trend was reversed and priority was given to SMI
expansion. This reversal was in response to the need to become more self-
sufficient in the manufacture of parts and materials for large enterprises
thereby reducing the import gap, to encourage regional development and to
restructure SMI towards more technology-intensive production with strong
emphasis on increasing export capacity.
C.   Project Objectives and Description
6.        The broad aim of the project was to strengthen industrial R&D and
basic research capacity and enhance the application of industrial standards to
raise the quality of products. More specifically, the project intended to
improve the quality of research programs in the Korea Institute of Science and
Technology (KIST) by assisting industry in developing advanced technologies,
increasing opportunities for joint research activities in the basic sciences
through strengthening Korea Basic Science Center (KBSC), and encouraging the
development and application of industrial standards through strengthening the
National Industrial Technology Institute (NITI).
7.        The project financed equipment, transportation and installation of
equipment, consumable material and O&M expenditures related to the equipment
for KIST, KBSC and NITI. The equipment lists were reviewed rigorously in each
institution. More specifically, these equipment lists included items for
common use of all research departments and specialized equipment with a focus
on material science and applied science at KIST, expensive research equipment
for basic science in KBSC whose frequency of use could not justify its
purchase by many institutions, and equipment related to tests and analyses of



weights and measures, industrial standards, industrial product control, safety
and energy consumption at NITI. Technical assistance for short-term overseas
training and book purchases were also financed for KIST as per an amendment of
the loan agreement (paras. 8 and 9), and civil works for KBSC and NITI to
house some of the equipment were financed by government.
D.   Prolect Design and Organization
8.        At the time of approval, the Bank had financed two technology
advancement projects under the same title. This project was the third and
last in a series of projects to develop industrial technology in Korea. The
Bank had also assisted technical and science education through seven loans
which complemented industrial development through the training of technical
and scientific manpower. Based upon the previous experience of the Bank, the
conceptual framework for the project was appropriate, and it was clearly
stated in the SAR. The project was prepared over a four month period, with
inputs from the Government's central planning authorities, participating
ministries/institutions and Bank staff/consultants. Following the Bank's
approval of the project, there was only one relatively minor change in project
design. KIST requested the use of unallocated loan funds to finance technical
assistance for overseas training and book purchase. The Bank approved this
and amended the Loan Agreement in March 1992.
9.        The scope and scale of the project were appropriate since it
continued to offer support in those areas in which the Bank had previous
experience, while addressing the needs of three national institutions which
the Government had identified as requiring additional quality-improving
investments. The strengthening of these institutions (KIST, KBSC and NITI)
assisted industry in developing advanced technology, improving opportunities
for joint research activities and raising the quality of industrial products.
The project design's focus on hardware (equipment and civil works) was also
appropriate. The later addition of a small amount of technical assistance for
KIST served to improve the quality of research staff through overseas training
while book purchases contributed to raising the effectiveness of researchers.
The project institutions were found to be well-staffed by highly-qualified
researchers, efficiently managed and well-financed as mentioned in SAR. Their
objectives were clearly stated and these were closely related to Korea's
science and technology development priorities. The main weaknesses were in
the physical aspects of laboratory provision and these were addressed under
the project. Upgraded laboratories were viewed as essential to increasing the
effectiveness of teaching and research staff.
10.       The design of project management centered on the three
institutions, each of which was responsible for the implementation of its part
of the project, with two institutions (KIST, KBSC) under the general budgetary
oversight of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) and NITI under the
Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) respectively. Based on lessons learned



from Ln. 2427-KO2, the Bank requested that the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
coordinate the preparation of Part II of the PCR. This was carried out
successfully and all three project institutions submitted their respective
Part IIs on schedule.
E.   Prolect Implementation
11.       Comparison of "Planned" versus "Actually Performed" in Project
Implementation. There were three components in the project. The first was
civil works which was financed by the Government; the second was equipment
which was financed by loan proceeds; the third, technical assistance (only for
KIST) also financed by the loan. Equipment is dealt with first. For KIST,
procurement of about 158 items of equipment was planned with an estimated cost
of $13.5 million. The "Actually Performed" figure was 210 items and the
contract cost was $13.8 million.   For KBSC, 78 items were planned whose
estimated cost was S14.7 million, slightly less than the loan allocation of
$15.0 million. Procurement of 69 items at a cost of $14.9 million was
achieved. NITI procured 402 items of equipment at a cost of $29.8 million,
which was also slightly less than NITI's loan allocation of $30.0 million.
Therefore, in general, there was little difference between "Planned" and
"Actually Performed", especially for the cost of items procured. In aggregate
there was no cost overrun. Out of the loan amount of $58.8 million for
equipment purchase, $58.6 million was spent on equipment. There was also no
time overrun on equipment procurement, as evidenced by the on-schedule loan
closing.
12.       For civil works, the physical facilities required to house the
equipment to be procured under the project already existed at KIST. On the
basis of available data, it was not possible to compare "Planned" with
"Actual" achievements for the civil works component for KBSC and NITI.
However, supervision missions found that construction of KBSC's new campus at
Daeduk Science Town and some extensions for NITI were completed in time for
the installation of equipment. Regarding Technical Assistance/Book Purchase
for KIST, the difference between "Planned" and "Actual" performance was also
marginal with planned cost $1.5 million and actual cost $1.2 million. As a
whole Project, the amount of loan cancellation was $213,448.13 or about 0.4%
of the total loan amount of $60.0 million, and this can be regarded as
negligible.
2In para. 8 of Part I of the PCR for Ln. 2427-KO dated May 17, 1991, it was
stated that there was a need for a coordinator to oversee the preparation of the
PCRs for projects dealing with more than one institution.
3  The original allocation to equipment for KIST was US$15 million.  The
amendment to the Loan Agreement (May 1993) reallocated US$1.5 million from the
equipment category to technical assistance and books and, therefore, reduced the
allocation for equipment  to US$13.5 million.   Disbursements  for technical
assistance and books were US$1.2 million.   The remaining US$0.3 million was
reallocated back to equipment.   Thus, total equipment procured was valued at
US$13.8 million.

13.       Project Risks.  There were no major risks foreseen during
appraisal. No major problem occurred during implementation. One minor
problem occurred at the initial stage of implementation. NITI neglected the
announcement of General Procurement Notice (GPN) before inviting bids, thus
breaching section 2.8 of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, May 1985. The
Office of Supply, Republic of Korea (OSROK) announced five invitation for bids
(IFB) totalling $7.7 million without checking whether the GPN had been
adequately announced. According to the Loan Agreement dated at June 3, 1991,
this might have been labeled a misprocurement. However, this was resolved by
activating the flexibility part in Article 3.02 of the Loan Agreement as an
exceptional case based on the observation that the number of responses to IFB
was satisfactory. The disbursements were completed during the four month
grace period. There was also no problem regarding compliance with covenants
(Table 9), submission of audit reports including separate opinion on statement
of expenditures (Table 9) and timely submission of progress reports (Annex 2).
14.       There were no unforeseen factors which affected project
implementation, and there were no actions or decisions taken which affected
implementation negatively. There was one change of jurisdiction, with KBSC
being transferred to KRISS from KOSEF in October 1991, and later becoming an
autonomous body in 1993. This did not produce any adverse effect on project
implementation.
F.   Major Results of the Proiect
15.       Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the project were met.
-    The quality of research programs in KIST to enhance its ability to
assist industry in developing advanced technologies has been
improved.
-    The opportunity for joint research activities in the basic sciences
has been increased through strengthening common facilities at KBSC.
-    The development and application of industrial standards through
strengthening NITI has been enhanced.
16.       Impact of Project.  The impact of the project is positive on all
three institutions. The assessment is as follows:
(a) KIST
KIST was established in 1966 as Korea's first modern multi-
disciplinary research institute covering a broad spectrum of applied research
activities. It is also responsible for providing technical services to small
and medium industries. KIST has been successful in these activities as
witnessed by the extensive commercialization of R&D results and the licensing
of industrial know-how to industrial firms. However, KIST as a major research
institute in Korea needs to install and upgrade new equipment continually in
order to promote technological innovation and support the move towards more
technology-intensive industry. In this regards, the 210 items of new
equipment in KIST represent a key factor in improving the quality of research



- 6 -
programs and have also contributed to the ambitious "KIST 2000" research
program which is designed to increase future-oriented developments in key
fields of technology. Approximately 95 researchers benefited from overseas
research. The project's positive impact is therefore obvious.
(b) KBSC
In order to promote a more rational and efficient use of expensive
research equipment in the basic sciences, KBSC was established in 1988 by
MOST. One of KBSC's major functions is therefore to provide common facilities
and equipment for basic research. In line with this purpose, the project
supplied 69 pieces of equipment which were more effectively used in a
centralized location than in individual institutions. The Bank's assessment
is that the newly equipped laboratories have enhanced significantly the
quality of joint research programs and expanded joint research efforts by
scientists from universities and the national research institutes. The number
of joint research projects increased from 1,511 in 1991 to 2,481 in 1994 and
the number of samples tested for outside users increased from 6,873 in 1991 to
15,720 in 1994.
(c) NIRI. now NITI
NITI under the jurisdiction of MTI has a main center in Seoul,
eleven Regional Industrial Technology Institutes (RITIs), and a specialized
center. The equipment installed in the main center included chemistry,
machinery/ metallurgy and electronics, and the equipment installed in the
PITCs was related to basic analysis to reinforce quality control and legal
tasks required by applicable legislation. The newly acquired equipment
strengthened NITI's capacity to develop and apply more rigorous industrial
standards which would contribute to raising the quality of industrial
products. NITI's annual research programs increased from 32 projects in 1990
to 121 in 1994 and technical assistance to SMIs increased from 662 enterprises
in 1990 to 1309 in 1994. The impact on NITI, therefore, was also positive.
G. Prolect Sustainability
17.       The Government's continued emphasis on science and technology
assures the sustainability of this component. KIST has been, and will
continue to be, Korea's leading multisectoral R&D institution and therefore
will continue to receive strong government support. The enhanced research
capacity in KIST would improve its ability to support industry in developing
advanced technologies thereby reinforcing technology development, especially
among SMIs, as the engine of growth in the Korean economy.
18.       To enter the ranks of technologically advanced countries, the
Government is placing strong emphasis on research in basic science, the very
foundation of technological development. This is to achieve the objective of
reinforcing local creative abilities in science and technology which in turn
would strengthen Korea's capacity for technological innovation and reduce
dependence on imported technology. KBSC was established as a leading



institution to meet this priority. Therefore, this will make KBSC sustainable
in the future.
19.       NITI derives its function from its legal responsibility to carry
out tests and analyses under laws relating to weights and measures, industrial
standards, industrial product quality control, safety and energy consumption.
NITI has always played an important role in supporting SMIs but with the
Government's increasing emphasis on SMI development, NITI's support role is
also expanding. It therefore seems certain that there will be no
sustainability problem with NITI.
H.   Bank's Performance During Project Cvcle
20.       Maior Strengths and Weaknesses.  Bank's performance on this
project was in general satisfactory. Processing of the previous projects has
led to the development of standardized documentation for preparation and
implementation. These contain the necessary information in readily accessible
form. This has reduced substantially the number of staff weeks required for
project design, processing and implementation, thus increasing the cost-
effectiveness of project activities. More specifically, the time spent on the
early part of the project cycle, from identification to loan signing was 20.2
staff weeks, which is significantly lower than the 33.5 staff weeks for the
first Technology Advancement Project (TAP I). Bank staff contribution during
implementation was also satisfactory in providing timely assistance on how to
avoid procurement delays and a possible extension of the Closing Date. This
was achieved with total staff input for supervision of 8.9 staff weeks (Table
10) compared to 23.7 staff weeks for TAP I. This also reflects the strong
cooperation the Bank received from highly competent local officials.
21.       Lessons Learned.  Given that the project was the third in the
series and was successfully implemented, there were no major lessons to be
learned. One minor lesson was the need for flexibility in applying
procurement guidelines in the situation when NITI neglected the announcement
of the GPN. If it had been labeled as misprocurement, substantial delay in
equipment procurement would have ensued. Considering Korea' strong
performance in equipment procurement in many projects, finding an appropriate
compromise for NITI was a reasonable solution.
I.   Borrower's Performance Durinq Project Cycle
22.       Maior Strenqths and Weaknesses.  The performance of the three
institutions was in general satisfactory. The actual implementation of the
project had been slow in KIST, and thus KIST requested extension of loan
closing date in April 1993. This request was denied on the basis that Korea
was an advanced borrower nearing graduation from IBRD. Implementation of the
technical assistance component (introduced through the amendment of the Loan
Agreement in May 1993) fell slightly short of the allocation amount by US$0.3
million (para.12). However, this amount was reallocated to equipment and full
disbursement of KIST's loan allocation was achieved. The performance of KBSC
was fully satisfactory. Despite initial delay in implementation due to the
jurisdictional change from KOSEF to KRISS, KBSC made significant progress per
Bank's advice, and full disbursement was achieved within the grace period.



8-
Equipment procurement went ahead of schedule in NITI during the initial
stages. As noted previously, there was a problem with the GPN announcement
but this was resolved satisfactorily and did not adversely affect
implementation. The cancelled amount of $213,448.13 out of $30.0 million was
negligible, and therefore the performance of NITI should be regarded as
satisfactory.
23.       Lessons Learned.  As noted previously, there were no major lessons
to be learned.
J.   Project Relationships
24.       Impact of Relationships on Project Implementation.  The
relationship between the Bank and the three institutions in this project was
excellent throughout the project implementation period. Early emphasis by
Bank staff on implementation requirements and the receptiveness of competent
local staff to this advice contributed significantly to the successful
outcome. No major implementation problems arose. MOF cooperated successfully
with the project institutions in ensuring that Part II of the PCR for each
institution was prepared on schedule. Other relationships, such as those
between the Bank and the two related ministries and those between component
institutions and industry were satisfactory.
K.   Consulting Services
25.       There were no consulting services in this project.
L.   Project Documentation and Data
26.       Adeauacy of Staff Appraisal Report. Major Working Papers and the
Legal Agreement. There is no evidence of any inadequacy in the Staff
Appraisal Report, the working papers or the Loan Agreement.

FART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER 'S PERSPECTIVE
KOREA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (KIST)
A. Objectives of the project
As industry has become more technology intensive, there has been an increasing
need to develop the local capacity for technological innovation thereby reducing
reliance on imported technology.
This requires an increasing commitment by KIST to carry out research programs
on highly advanced technology. Such research has focused on topics which may be
beyond the capacity of thc private sector for reasons c - affordability and lack of
advanced facilites and qualified researchers.
The main objective of the KIST project has been to strengthen KIST's research
capacity to reinforce physical facilities and research manpower by means of
overcomina shortage of advanced equipment and replacement of obsolete
instruments.
ThL.n, KIST has been playing an effective role in conducting research and
development activities for promoting future oriented high technology.

C. Direct Benefits of the Project
Execution of the IBRD Loan(33 15-KO) Project has resulted in reinforcement of
the necessary research equipment, and in modemization of common use test:.
equipment for supporting basic & sophisticated research, which will serve as a
cornerstone for KIST to upgrade its research capacity to carry out more advanced
high technology R&D activities.
Besides the national research projects, KIST has been able to embark on new
ambitious KIST 2000 research programs which are designed to increase potential to
make more creative and future-oriented technological advancements in such fields as
medical welfare technology display devices for information industry, precision
materials processing, three dimension imaging media, and the human robot system.
In particular, more then 210 kinds of research equipment were purchased during
the project period, and more than 95 researchers benefited from overseas research
based upon the IBRD Loan, which also enabled the project to mark a great
contribution to the substantial development of the institute.
Beginning in 1991, a program of collaborative research and study was initiated at
KIST that drew students and researchers from academic institutions and research
organizations.  With the aim of training a high-caliber workforce both in theory and
practice, the program has been implemented recruiting 250 students in collaboration
with several major universities throughout Seoul.

Part II. Project Review from the Borrower's perspective
1. Objectives of the project
The project was the first phase of a large master plan aimed at
irnproving opporunities for joint research activities in the basic research
through strengthening common research facilities and equipments at KBSC.
2. Benefits from the projects
2.1 KBSC could be conmmitted by the project to support the mission of the
MOST(Ministry of Science and Technology) in serving the needs of
university faculty members and professionals from public and private
R & D institutes by helping to build and operate the unique and
state-of-the-art equipment as well. (Table 1, 2)
2.2 The project would lead to improved research cooperation between
center, university and industry through more efficient of research
equipments and facilities for basic research. (Table 3)
2.3 KBSC helps to prepare the scientific and technical work force of the
future by offering a variety of learning and R & D experiences to
graduate students and faculty members(Table 4)
2.4 Close relationship between Bank staff and the executing department has
yielded several institutional benefits to the KBSC.
3. Bank's performance
3.1 Bankl personnel were recognized as professi=al in all respects. Not only
mission members were always highly quaiUed in their respective fields
but also staff appraisal report was appropriae to address the kinds of
implementation problems occurring.
3.2 The constructive dialogue and Bank's supervision effort was quite
beneficial.
3.3 However,  sometimes  we  were  not  able  to  get  some  paper
works.(Payment Advice, Monthly Disbursement Surnm,ary)

4. Lessons learned
4.1 The overall comrnunications between the Bank and the Borrower,
including accounting of comrnitments and draw-down of loan proceeds,
should be sufficiently well documented and thoroughly understanded so
that when the changes in government or mission personnel occur such
changes will deeply affect project implementation.
4.2 The perforrnance of the participating institutions in overall project
planning should be reviewed to compare the results.
4.3 A specialist and manual should be made available to make a thorough
review of equipment specifications before going out to tender. And
clearly stated responsibilities about warranty should be pointed out in
equipment specifications.
4.4 Bidding and reirnbursing procedures should be fully recognized not to
take much time in preparing and geLting documents.
5. Project sustainability
.1 The sustainability of economic benefit is to provide reliable utility
support and the additional necessary infrastructure required to produce
the appropriate environrnent for conducting outstanding research.
5.2 In terms of technology progress, new scientific research fields came into
being as a result of newly acquired equipment and we were able to
commit education program on state-of-the-art equipment.
5.3 The users are strongly recormrnended to carry out research in the basic
sciences to ensure a national competence and knowledge in research
and development.
6. Conclusion
6.1 During the past year, significant effort was expended a working
administrative framework for each of the equipments and KBSC has
continued its outreach programs, ranging from the dissemination of



-21 -
information about facilities to the development of extensive contacts
through the headquarters and nation-wide branches. Therefore,
remarkable progress was made in relatively short periods of time.
6.2 Plans for the future involve the expansion of such efforts and the
assumption of additional responsibility in facilitating scientific education
programs.
6.3 The upcoming year will see completion of many of the activities
developed during the current year.
6.4 R & D interactions between university and industry should be greatly
increased by more exchange of knowledge, personnel and collaborative
projects.
6.5 We shall continue to develop our basic understanding of the stricture of
our activities so that we can define meaningful measures of progress.
6.6 We believe that our enriched research equipments, when fully set up,
will make constructive changes to revitalize the university and industry
research so that our wealth of talent and facilities will contribute more
effectively to our research capacities and economic growth.

About KOREA BASIC SCIENCE CENTER
Today science and technology development competition both at home and abroad is
growing ever fiercer to the point of hegemonism. Korea, therefore, must achieve
indigenous technology development, and first and foremost must implement basic
science research as a technology often finds its application in science after all.
To reach world-class competitiveness in technology, basic science R & D capability
becomes a matter of great importance, so the center installed state-of-the-art
measurement and analysis equipment within its aggressive National User's Facility,
founded in August, 1988, to promote basic science research at uni9versities and in
industry. In addition the Center is striving to lay a solid foundation for creati,c,
advanced science and technology activities to develop programs conducive to the more
effective use of equipment and to conduct research to improve research to improve
research applications and interpretation of analysis results, the better to exploit the
great potential of the universities. To this end the Center has set up its headquarters
at Taeduk Science Town and established four Branches ( Seoul, Taegu, Pusan, and
Kwangju) for systematic support and as an omphalos for cooperative, joint research aLl
over the nation.
Our Taeduck Headquarters is building up a cooperative research system for
academia, industry, and institutes. In particular , we will contribute greatly to
overcoming the obstacles to domestic advanced research, by installing ponderous
upgraded  measurementanalysis  equipment,  thereby  greatly  expanding  intemal
measurement and analytical capacities. The branches under construction, are expected
to help boost regional technology development by securing analytical support through
the use of region-specialized precision instruments to provide an interdisciplinary joint
research arena
We plan initiate and manage a visitor research system  focusing on performance
excellence. This will entail the Center's maintaining a mirnurrm staff for its operation
and then researchers, both Local and foreign, can takle advantage of the Center for
creative joint research. We will thus also reinforce international collaboration, and
prompt exchanges between leading research groups abroad while attracting brand-new
expertise into the Center in relation to the installation and operation of facilities.
The Center will thus provide a convenient system giving domestic researchers free
access to facilities beyond their own means for cooperative research up to with
international standards. In essence, the Center will not only play a catalytic role in
supporting the research of many- scientists in universities and institutes but will also
become a central forum where our own basic science researchers can carry out joint
research. Partly KBSC will continue to be dedicated to acting as the driving force
behind innovative science and technology, and we will do everything in our power- to
propel Korea into a new era of science culture.

The 210 items of new equipment in KIST represent a key factor in
improving the quality of research programs and have also contributed to the
WRIST 2000" research program which iu designed to increase future-oriented
technological advances. Approximately 95 researchers benefited from overseas
research. Beginning in 1991, a program of collaborative research and study
was initiated and drew 250 students and researchers from major universities
and research organizations.
(b) KBSC
KBSC acquired 69 pieces expensive research equipment with the help of
both government support and the IBRD loan in order to provide common
facilities and equipment for basic research. The newly equipped laboratories
have enhanced significantly the quality of joint resoarch programs and
expanded joint research efforts by scientists froo universities and the
national research institutes. The number of joint research projects increased
from 1,511 in 1991 to 2,481 in 1994 and the rrm.m-b of saMples tested for
outside users increased from 6,873 in 1991 to 15,720 in 1994.
(c) NIRI. now NITI
Four hundred and two items of equipment wer procured and these are
helping to strengthen NITI's capacity to develop and apply more rigorous
industrial standards which would contribute to raising the quality of
industrial products. NITI's annual research progrnm increased from 32
projects in 1990 to 121 in 1994 and technical assistance to SMIs increased
from 662 enterprises in 1990 to 1309 in 1994.
