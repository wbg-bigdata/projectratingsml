Risks and Risk   The program faces several risks. (a) Uncertainty in the
Mitigation       international economic environment, including the impact o         f
                 the global economic crisis. The global economic slowdown poses
                 significant risks to growth through reduced exports, remittances,
                 and foreign investment. While this impact may be mitigated to
                 some degree by declining prices of fertilizer, food, and fuel, there
                 is still a risk that a protracted recession in developed countries
                 would lead to reduction in aid and weak demand for Malawi?s
                 exports, putting pressure on its fiscal and balance of payments
                 positions. In this context, we are particularly concerned with its
                 impact on agricultural reforms, given that Malawi is currently
                 implementing a large fertilizer subsidy program and has had a
                 heavily managed exchange rate policy. To mitigate the risk, the
                 Bank is engaged in policy dialogue with the authorities in order to
                 avoid losing momentum in the reform program. (b) Policy
                 fluctuation. The Government?s priorities could shift away from
                 the reform program supported by the PRSG and/or the stated
                 policy stance may change during implementation. This would
                 lead to delays in implementation or abandonment of some
                 reforms. To mitigate this risk, the Bank is engaged in frequent
                 dialogue with line ministries to identify and address emerging
                 concerns. The Bank also provides technical assistance and policy
                 advice to ensure that shifts or reversals in policy orientation
                 happen after due consideration of available options. (c) Capacity
                 risks. The systemic problem of capacity in Government continues
                 to pose a risk for the program and may cause delays in
                 implementation of some measures, especially in public sector
                 reform. To mitigate this risk, the Bank has technical assistance
                 programs in public finance management, agriculture, and private
                  sector development, all covering reforms supported by the PRSG
                  series.    (d) Impact o drosiglit on food securiiy and fiscal
                                          f
                 position. Malawi faces drought in some parts of the country,
                  especially in southern Malawi. The exact impact of the drought
                  on food availability has not been completely assessed, though
                 official estimates show that the country will still have an overall
                 food surplus this year. However, the need for food distribution
                 program to the drought affected areas may require more resources
                 than envisioned in the budget. To address risks associated with
                 weather events, the Bank has been working with government and
                 relevant donors to ensure that mitigation tools, such as weather
                 insurance, call option for grain imports, REP0 on maize, etc., are
                 put into place in a timely and cost effective manner.

                               I.      INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document proposes a Third Poverty Reduction Support
Grant (PRSG-3) to the Republic of Malawi for SDR 35.6 million (USS54 million
equivalent), including SDR 9.2 million (USS14 million) through the Crisis Response
Window. It is to be the third and final operation in a series of three annual programmatic
development policy lending (DPL) operations that are aimed at supporting the
Government's reform program in the implementation of the Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy (MGDS').

2.       As was the case with the last two operations, the proposed PRSG-3 is being
designed and implemented within a harmonized framework for the provision of
budget support in Malawi. Such a framework exists under the leadership of the
Government of Malawi (GoM) with six participating donors, including IDA.2 It
comprises of a Joint Framework, or memorandum of understanding, a multi-year
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), and a review process aimed at reducing
transaction costs for all parties involved.

3.      The program document is divided into six sections, including this
introduction. Section I1 discusses the country context which gives an overview of
Malawi, recent economic developments including government's macroeconomic
program, macroeconomic outlook, and debt sustainability. Section I11 presents the
Government's program (MGDS); section IV discusses how the Bank is supporting the
government program, while section V describes the proposed third PRSG. Section VI
describes implementation issues, with a focus on risks and mitigating measures.

                                11. COUNTRY CONTEXT
                                    A. Country Overview

4.      As a landlocked agrarian economy, Malawi is one of the poorest countries in
the world ranking 160th on the Human Development Index. Unlike many of its
neighbors, Malawi does not benefit from significant mineral endowments. It is heavily
dependent on external aid which amounted to about 65 percent of merchandise exports in
2008. With around 85 percent of the population based in the rural areas, farming is the
main occupation for most households. Agricultural production is predominantly
subsistence and rain fed and subject to high volatility causing frequent food shortages.

5.       Since independence in 1964, Malawi's growth record has been extremely
volatile; and stagnant for a good part of the last three decades. Apart from the
weather effects on agricultural production, this also points to a policy environment
generally not having been conducive to sustained growth. Indeed, per capita GDP (in
constant 2000 US$ teims) hovered below the 1979 peak of US$160 for nearly three

  The MGDS is the country's second generation PRSP.
  Other members of the Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS) are the European Commission,
United Kingdom (DFID), African Development Bank, Norway, and Germany. The UNDP, IMF, and
Ireland have observer status.

decades before taking a strong upward trend past the peak. Incomes strongly declined
following the oil price shock in 1979, accompanied by severe deterioration in the terms-
of-trade. Malawi's terms-of-trade collapsed by 25 percent at the end of the 1970s
beginning a long deteriorating trend. Furthermore, civil war in Mozambique 1985-1992
damaged transport infrastructure and blocked the ports of Nacala and Beira raising
transport costs.

6.       The introduction of legislation in the early 1990s, making it legal for small-
holders to grow export crops, brought about a dramatic shift in the pattern of
agricultural production away from estates (Figure 3). From a negligible base in 1990,
small-holders came to produce around 70 percent of the tobacco crop (Figure 4).
Agricultural output doubled between 1994-2000 largely on account of small-holders and
diversification into cash crops. The rest of the economy did not perform well as high

                                                                                          2
     fiscal deficits combined with exchange rate liberalization rapidly transmitted price
     instability to the rest of the economy and inflation reached a high of 83 percent in 1995.
     Additionally high domestic borrowing resulted in real interest rates exceeding 20 percent
     in 2000-04 strongly crowding out private investment. Volatility in output was
     exacerbated by various external shocks including droughts in 1992 and 1994 which
     caused severe food shortages.

     7.       Since 2004, a strong stabilization policy brought about a rapid turnaround
     in government finances and enabled growth to resume. In extremely difficult fiscal
     circumstances, and for the first time since 1994, the Malawi stayed within the planned
     budget and, as a result, the fiscal position dramatically improved. This led to an increase
     in donor inflows, which in turn allowed further reduction in domestic borrowing and
     created room for private sector investment growth.

8.       Malawi's economy has been growing briskly in recent years, buoyed by
improved macroeconomic management, good weather, and a supportive donor
environment. The annual GDP growth in the last five years has averaged about 7
percent, compared to an average of 2 percent for 1999-2004. Growth for 2009 is
estimated at 7.6 percent (Table 1). This growth is broad-based and anchored in
agriculture which in turn is attributed to smallholders. Growth has come hand in hand
with, or is the result of, improvements in agricultural production, particularly
improvements in maize yields that have led to much enhanced food security (helped by
input subsidies and good weather). The enhanced food security and availability of inputs
also has helped to foster diversification as households at the margin are producing more
and more cash crops further increasing incomes in a virtuous cycle. Agricultural growth
then spilled over to other sectors of the economy (Table 2).

9.       The overall progress in combating poverty and improving the quality of life
has been positive in recent years. In 2005, the poverty headcount was 52.4 percent,
marginally down from 54.2 percent in 1998. The 2008 Welfare Monitoring Survey
reported a poverty headcount of 40 percent, indicating that poverty may have declined in
the last few years in line with the high growth rates registered (to be confirmed in the
ongoing IHS for 2009/2010).3 In education, there have been improvements in school
attendance levels. During the last decade, the proportion of men who had never attended
school dropped from 21 percent to 12 percent, while that of women dropped from 47
percent to 23 percent. There have also been improvements in several health indicators
over the past few years. The 2008 Welfare Monitoring survey indicates that chronic
malnutrition is now at 36 percent, compared to about 49 percent in 2005. Immunization
for children less than one year for measles has improved from 82 percent in 2005 to 89
percent in 2008/09, and is likely to reach the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy

(MGDS) target of 90 percent by 201 1. Life expectancy is now at 52 years compared to 38
years in 2005, partly because of improved nutrition and free anti-retroviral treatment
(ARV). `Similarly, Malawi appears to be making progress in containing the spread of
HIViAIDS, as adult prevalence rates dropped from 14.4 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in
2007.

10.      The 2009 Country Economic Memorandum identifies the purchasing power
of exports - or real exports - as the main driver of economic growth in Malawi4.
Significant positive multiplier effect has been observed, with exports creating the demand
for local services and, to a limited extent, domestic manufacturing. However, Malawi's
exports have been heavily concentrated in a few areas in agriculture, with tobacco, tea
and sugar alone accounting for over 70 percent of total export earnings. The dependence
on rain-fed agricultural exports as well as the concentration in a few commodities leaves
the economy vulnerable. There is thus need for an export diversification. In this context,
Malawi has good prospects to increase its export basket of agriculture products to
neighboring countries and needs to build on the recent progress where annual average
growth in non-traditional exports to the region was 14.6 percent during the period 2000-
2006. The newly opened uranium mine, which started commercial production in
September 2009, is the only significant non-agriculture source of exports, and is expected
to account for 25 percent of Malawi's export earnings per year at its peak.

11.      The prospects for future growth and economic diversification will hinge
importantly on the quality and predictability of agriculture policies. Agriculture is
central to Malawi's economy - to a degree that the President in recent years has served as
Minister of Agriculture. With the extensive margins of agriculture being largely
exhausted, the key issue is to increase productivity by harnessing strengths from the
private sector within a supporting public policy environment. The right balance in this
area is still to be found. Key policy decisions with respect to the roles of government
and/or the private sector in pricing and distribution of inputs, on the role of the large

 The 2009 Country Economic Memorandum, prepared by Bank staff in collaboration with DFID, AfDB,
and the Millennium Challenge Corporation offers useful recommendations on how Malawi can seize
opportunities for growth through trade, particularly with the region.

                                                      5
parastatal ADMARC in regulating the maize market, or on the extent and coverage of
government-determined prices controls are often taken in the absence of a clear and
predictable policy framework. An example is the recent and unexpected establishment of
extensive price controls at the farm gate level to promote a better distribution of benefits
along the supply chain. While the objectives pursued are laudable, those objectives will
not be met through such policies, which could easily have a negative impact on the
welfare of the farmers it is intending to help.

12.     The development of the power sector is another critical area to support
economic diversification and growth. Whilst current generation capacity is 263 MW,
the peak electricity demand is already at 290 MW and growing by 7 percent per year.
Power supply unreliability is growing as electricity is rationed, and aggravated by
technical problems caused by equipment failures and weather shocks such as flooding for
which the country is highly vulnerable since the vast majority of the generation comes
from hydro power stations in the Shire River. Malawi is developing a comprehensive
approach to address this issue through demand management measures as well as the
development of more diversified sources of supply-including power resources from
Mozambique. It will be essential that government gives highest priority to the
development of this sector and that no time is wasted in bringing possible sources of
power into production. In this context, the government's recent decision to postpone the
interconnection program that would bring power from Mozambique is a source of serious
concern.

13.      Malawi's maintenance of a solid macroeconomic environment together with
protection of social sector expenditures will be critical to sustain social sector gains
and poverty reduction. In the coming years and as Malawi embarks on prudent fiscal
policies, including some fiscal consolidation in the coming year, it will be important to
protect the gains that have been achieved. For example, while the education sector faces a
financing gap of over US$200 million to implement its education sector plan over the
three years, the 2009/10 budget has been reduced from 4.3 percent of GDP to 4.2 percent.
Similarly, allocation to the health sector has been cut from 6.2 percent of GDP to 4.8
percent. Government has sought to minimize the negative impact of these spending cuts
to high priority social sectors. For instance, the 2009/10 revised budget has increased
Nutrition and HIV/AIDS spending by 0.24 percent of GDP to offset some of the cuts in
the original budget caused partly due to external aid reductions. The IMF ECF program
also has a floor on social spending. The recent progress on improving public financial
management and public procurement is laudable, but a more clear commitment needs to
be shown in curtailing non-priority spending and in cutting costs of large programs. In
FY2008/09, the spending on the Input Subsidy Program exceeded the budgeted allocation
by about 100 percent, and was equivalent to over 80 percent of the combined
expenditures on education and health. In late 2009, it also emerged that the Government
had replaced the presidential jet at an estimated cost of US$22 million, to be paid over
the next few years in installments.

14.     The Policy dialogue in key areas such as agriculture, the power sector, and
economic management remains rich but very complex. Malawi has made remarkable
progress over the last decade. The strengths of smallholder agriculture, the new

                                             6
developments in mining, and the growing opportunities emerging from the process of
regional integration in Southern and Eastern Africa all bode well for Malawi's potential
to continue in the path of strong growth taking advantage of both the domestic, regional,
and global markets. There is a risk however that Malawi will not fully use these
opportunities. The strengthening of domestic demand that has come with the recent
period of strong growth seems to have encouraged perceptions that Malawi can develop
quickly and in a sustainable way on the strengths of its domestic economy and own
resources. Following a landslide re-election of the President in May 2009, the decision
making process is now highly concentrated in the executive implying that the policy
dialogue on critical issues needs to carried out at the highest levels which is not always
possible. In this context the Bank remains engaged looking for practical ways to keep an
open dialogue on all the key development issues.

                          B. Recent Economic Developments

Macroeconomic performance

15.     Malawi's economy proved to be resilient to the global economic crisis.
Anchored on the strength of the agriculture sector and its positive spillover effects
Malawi weathered the global storm achieving strong growth and moderate inflation.
Real GDP growth of 9.7% in 2008 is estimated to have been followed by growth of 7.6%
in 2009 supported by the continued growth in agriculture, including maize. After rising
in 2008 following the food and fuel shocks, inflation again started a downward trend in
2009 averaging 8.5 percent.

16.      The Crisis however impacted Malawi as it took the country off its intended
course towards fiscal consolidation and strengthening of its international reserves
position. Malawi sought access to the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF). The 12-months
ESF, approved by the IMF Board in December, 2008, was in response to the terms of
trade shocks caused by rapid increases in global fuel, food, and fertilizer prices. Current
account deficit deteriorated to 6.4 percent of GDP in FY2008/09 from 1.6 percent in
2007/08. Fiscal deficit soared to 5.8 percent of GDP in FY2008/09 due to expanded
outlays on input subsidies and other government purchases. Domestic debt also shot up
from 12 percent of GDP in 2007 to 19 percent in 2008. In sum, the events in the global
market introduced an array of macroeconomic imbalances into an economy with limited
means to mitigate the negative impacts.

17.      The crisis also came at a critical time in the country's political cycle with
general elections in May 2009. In the run-up to elections, containing inflation and
maintaining food security surfaced as two primary objectives for Government. In
2008, the index of international real food prices peaked at roughly 140 percent of its 1990
level while prices of individual commodities had risen even more sharply. The sharpest
increases were in dairy, oils and fats, and cereal prices, while sugar prices and meat
prices increased less dramatically. As in other countries affected, Malawi also struggled
to hold down the prices of food which has a disproportionate adverse impact on the poor.
Since in Malawi only about 10 percent of farmers are net sellers of maize, almost
everybody in Malawi is affected by higher food prices. The Government therefore

                                             7
significantly increased the amount of fertilizers imported for ISP at the peak of the global
prices, doubling the cost of the program that year. Concurrently, the Government more
actively intervened in agricultural markets to set minimum prices for maize and cotton,
and auction prices for tobacco.

18.      Fiscal policies loosened significantly in early 2009. Following several years in
which government prudently retired domestic debt whilst maintaining small fiscal
deficits, sizeable budget overruns on fertilizer and general expenditures in goods and
services in early 2009 led to high domestic borrowing. The targets of the ESF program
were missed by a large margin. The overrun on fertilizer expenditures reflected in part
high international markets, but also shortcomings in the procurement practices as well as
unbudgeted purchases of fertilizer that was not eventually used for the 2008/09 planting
season.

19.      The pegging of the exchange rate in the wake of loosened fiscal policies led
to further disequilibrium in the foreign exchange market and further weakening of
the external sector. From 2006 to late 2009, the nominal Malawi Kwacha exchange rate
was pegged against the United States dollar leading to overvaluation of the Kwacha.
Reflecting the challenges with maintaining the peg and the resultant foreign exchange
shortages, the premium between the parallel and official exchange rates has been
widening, by as much as 30 percent, and there have been higher incidence of import
backlogs during this period. This resulted in the loss of competitiveness of Malawi's
exports particularly in the non-traditional sector that is geared mostly to sub-regional
markets, an influx of imports as they became cheap in Kwacha terms. The depletion of
foreign reserves accelerated as the authorities intervened heavily in the market to defend
the Kwacha value. Partly as a result of this policy, Malawi's medium-term objective of
building up reserves to 2.5-3 months of imports was heavily compromised. Reserves have
remained below 1.5 months of imports for most of 2008 and 2009. As at end December
2009, official reserves were below 1 month of prospective imports.

Impact of the Global Financial and Economic Crisis

20.      The most severe impact of the global crisis came through the shock in terms
of trade in 2008 with its spillover effects through 2009. Notwithstanding the
improvements in tobacco prices and volume of exports in 2008 and 2009, the impact of
the increase in fuel and fertilizer prices in 2008 was significant leading to an estimated
deterioration in the balance of trade of US$280 million or close to 7 percent of GDP.
The increase in 2008 fertilizer prices alone was estimated to have contributed to an
increase in import costs of US$120 million or almost 3 percent of GDP given the
government's resolve to maintain the size of the program' in 2008 and expand it in 2009.
With government procurement prices in 2009 being similar to those of 2008, the impact
of this shock was both on the balance of payments as well as fiscal side. While current
account deficits in Malawi are persistent, the deterioration in 2008 and 2009 was
particularly severe. The current account deficit worsened from 1.6 percent of GDP in
2007 to 6.4 percent and 8.6 percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively. This was driven in
2008 mainly by worsening terms of trade, while in 2009 this was partly the result of the
spillover impact of higher prices from 2008 as well as a generally growing import bill to
support the growing economy against moderate growth in exports and net transfers. On

                                             8
the other hand, transactions on the capital and financial account were also heavily
impacted by the financial crisis, and could not support the growing current account
deficit. Both official aid and private capital flows declined between 2008 and 2009.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and other inflows are estimated to have declined by over
50 percent from US$215 million in 2008 to US$110 million in 2009. As a result,'the
overall balance of payments deteriorated from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to -1.0 and -
1.8 in 2008 and 2009.

21.     Malawi's major export commodities were also affected by the crisis. These
include tobacco, cotton, and coffee, and constitute over 70 percent of export earnings.
The 2009 tobacco auction season fetched a total of US$432.6 million from 232 million
kilograms of tobacco sold. Thus, although tobacco output was higher than in 2008, the
drop in prices led to lower proceeds than the 2008 earnings of US$472.1 million fetched
from 195 million kilograms. Similarly, international prices for cotton, tea and coffee
declined between the 2008 and 2009 marketing seasons, leading to lower earnings.

22.      Whilst the country weathered the crisis achieving high growth rates both in
2008 and 2009, Malawi emerged from the crisis with a weaker external position and
the imperative of fiscal consolidation. Malawi emerged from the crisis of 2008 and
2009 with official reserves amounting to less than one month of import cover, an
overheated economy and a growing public sector that needed some containment. Given
Malawi's high dependence on agriculture and foreign aid for its reserves, the low
reserves pose a clear risk to the economy. Any exogenous shock arising from volatility in
weather, international commodity prices or foreign aid would therefore have huge
ramifications on growth and macroeconomic stability. As a result Malawi faces the
urgent task of embarking on a program that will curtail aggregate demand through a
combination of exchange rate policy adjustment as well as fiscal consolidation. Success
in this program will depend foremost on government's resolve to fiscal discipline and
commitment to reforms. However, additional concessional or grant resources in the form
of normal budget support or resources from the Crisis Response Window can go a long
way in supporting this adjustment by providing additional strength to the external
position as well as helping to finance critical expenditures that otherwise may need to be
cut as a part of the fiscal consolidation process.

Revised Macroeconomic Program 2009/10

23.       Following the expiration of the IMF-supported ESF program in December
2009, authorities successfully negotiated a new medium-term macroeconomic
program with the IMF. This has allowed the new Government, re-elected into office in
the May 2009 general elections, to re-align its macroeconomic objectives and strategies
to: (i) restore the external balance and strengthen reserves, (ii) return to the earlier fiscal
and monetary discipline, and (iii) take key structural measures to foster an environment
for sustained economic growth.

24.      Government has shown commitment to return to a prudent fiscal path from
the fiscal year 200940. The 2009/10 budget has a planned fiscal deficit of less than 3
percent of GDP and a net domestic debt repayment of 1.5 percent of GDP. The fertilizer
subsidy program has been streamlined to include maize only, and its budget was reduced

                                              9
to 50 percent of 2008/09 expenditures. While the revenue projections are more ambitious
than last year's, they seem to be achievable given the improvements in the revenue
administration over the past few years. Preliminary estimates from government indicate
that execution through the first half of the fiscal year was generally in line with the
budget. Total revenue collected was 5 percent higher than projected, while total
expenditure was 3 percent lower than budgeted. However, total donor aid disbursements
were 44 percent lower than budgeted. To cover for the aid disbursement delays, net
domestic borrowing increased by 24 percent from the June 2009 position.

25.      Government is committed to cut lower priority expenditures while
protecting social expenditures. To protect poverty-reduction goals the fiscal program
agreed with the IMF includes an indicative floor on social spending in the event
additional fiscal consolidation is required. In addition government has agreed that costs
associated with the purchase of the presidential jet (US$22 million to be paid over several
years) are incorporated into the budget. Steps have also been taken to safeguard against
the deficits in the electricity and water companies as well as Air Malawi.

26.      Authorities have started taking measures to address the foreign exchange
market disequilibrium and return to a more flexible exchange regime. Since early
November, authorities have publicly announced a gradual shift in policy towards a more
flexible exchange regime, a key recommendation in the Bank's 2009 Country Economic
Memorandum. For the first time in three years, the Malawi Kwacha official exchange
rate depreciated against the US dollar in November. As of early February 2010, the
authorities had depreciated the exchange rate to MK150.8 per US dollar from the fixed
rate of MK140.6, representing a 7.3 percent devaluation. Further, as part of efforts to
move towards a more liberal foreign exchange regime, the requirement for 20 percent of
foreign exchange earnings to be converted at official rate through the Reserve Bank of
Malawi has been discontinued, reverting to the previous practice. Over time, the shift to a
more flexible exchange rate regime is expected to reduce the overvaluation of the real
Kwacha and, by dampening import demand and making Malawi's exports more
competitive, contribute to restoring the external balances.

27.     A more prudent monetary policy framework, supported by strong fiscal
consolidation, targets price stability while supporting sufficient expansion of private
sector credit. Over the past 5 years, adherence to fiscal discipline substantially reduced
the outstanding domestic debt from 16.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to 11.8 percent by 2007.
This was accompanied by a reduction in the central bank policy rate, from 35 percent in
May 2004 to 15 percent at the end of December 2009. Correspondingly, commercial
bank lending rates have declined from 36 percent in May 2004 to 19.6 percent as at end-
October 2009. Real interest rates have been declining, thereby contributing to an increase
in commercial bank lending to the private sector. Consequently, credit to the private
sector increased to 14.2 percent of GDP by October 2009, compared to 4 percent in May
2004. This is likely to have contributed to the increase in private investment, estimated at
15.5 percent of GDP in 2008, and projected to increase to 16.5 percent in 2009. The
importance of maintaining fiscal discipline and to coordinate closely with monetary
policy cannot be overstated, as the virtuous circle described above can easily reverse, for
example, in the event of a significant overshooting of domestic borrowing which
happened in 2008109. The Government has therefore renewed its commitment in its

                                            10
2009/10 budget to reduce the stock of domestic debt which had climbed back to 20.3
percent of GDP in the course of FY2008109.

                                             C. Macroeconomic Outlook

28.     Growth outlook for 2009 and 2010 remains robust, though subject to some
downside risks. Projections from the IMF and Government are that growth will be 7.6
percent in 2009 and 6.0 percent in 2010. This positive outlook is anchored on several

                                                             11
factors, including strong maize and tobacco production, the new uranium mine which is
expected to contribute about 10 percent of GDP in exports, and expanding wholesale and
retail trade. However, these growth projections are subject to several downside risks.
Firstly, shortcomings in implementing agreed reforms in the foreign exchange market
could lead to shortages affecting of the capacity of the private sector to import critical
inputs. As discussed earlier, this has already led to cuts in production and delays in
completing projects. Secondly, given the economy's high dependence on agriculture,
adverse weather remains a structural threat. Finally, power sector shortages are
becoming increasingly prevalent and it now seems inevitable that existing' growth
projections will have to be dampened to take into the account the larger than expected
shortages that will result from the inability to bring in 55MW of power into the grid by
2012 through the interconnection with Mozambique. The government's decision to
postpone this project will likely affect programmed private sector investments leading to
both short and medium term impacts on economic growth.

29.      Inflation is expected to remain moderate over the medium term. There has
been a significant decline in world fuel prices and fertilizer prices have also been coming
down. Commodity prices are unlikely to reach the 2008 levels in the short- to medium
term, and the adequate maize yield will help to stabilize food prices. As a result,
authorities and the IMF are projecting inflation to be around 7.1 percent in 2010. One
major risk to this outlook is delayed or reduced donor disbursements, as this could lead to
increased domestic borrowing, thereby exerting upward pressure on interest rates and
inflation. The recent nominal depreciation of the Kwacha and increases in utility and fuel
prices will also exert upward pressure inflation.

30.      The international reserve position is expected to improve only in the
medium term. Outlook on international reserve position remains weak, as the central
bank has not been able to build reserves during the tobacco auctioning period, and the
other domestic sources of foreign exchange supply may not be adequate enough to help
in building the required foreign exchange reserve level. Uranium, which is expected to
contribute about 25 percent of annual export earnings at its peak, may not be a significant
source of foreign exchange in the short term (one to two years) as the company earnings
will need to be used to settle off its foreign capital loans first. In the short-term, donor
inflows in the second half of the fiscal year, coupled with proceeds from the 2010
tobacco auction seasons, are expected to stabilize the current weak position. The ECF
arrangement, just approved by the IMF Board in February 20 10, is expected to boost the
official reserve position but more net inflows are required to reach the recommended
three months of import cover by 20 12.

                              D. Public Debt Sustainability

3 1.     The joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) undertaken
in late 2009 shows that the risk of external debt distress is moderate. Total stock of
public external debt as of end-2008 is estimated at US$683 million or 16.0 percent of
GDP, 90 percent of which is multilateral, with the balance being official bilateral debt.
Although the debt ratios are currently very low as a result of HIPC debt relief and MDRI,
the country's debt carrying capacity has not increased dramatically in recent years.
Malawi's concentrated export base, reliance on rain-fed agriculture, and weak

                                            12
international reserve situation leave it vulnerable in the face of adverse shocks such as the
sharp rise in fuel, food, and fertilizer prices as in 2008. Indebtedness is projected to rise
with the increase in infrastructure investments financed with concessional debt and the
debt-to-exports-ratio is expected to rise towards its threshold during the projection period,
yet will not exceed it. A prudent debt policy covering the contracting of both external and
domestic debt will be critical, together with a sufficiently tight fiscal policy to avoid
excessive borrowing by the public sector.

             111.        THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND
                         PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES
32.      The Government's program is set out in the MGDS, currently in its fourth
year of implementation. The strategy outlines the Government's economic growth and
development priorities for the five years between 2006/07 and 2010/11. It seeks to
achieve the aspirations of Malawi as defined in Vision 2020 and the Millennium
Development Goals. Further, the strategy builds on the Malawi Poverty Reduction
Strategy ( 0 2 ,and integrates a number of new sector strategies, policies and emerging
           20)
issues, such as land reform, publidprivate partnerships, nutrition and HIV/AIDS. The
MGDS is organized around five themes: Sustainable Econoinic Growth; Social
Protection; Social Development; Infrastructure Development; ai-,(! Good Governance.
Each theme specifies medium-term outcomes and strategies to achieve them. Its result
framework, however, has not yet been underpinned by a comprehensive list of indicators
for monitoring and evaluation. Government has already started the process for preparing
a successor strategy to the MGDS, which is expected to be ready for use starting the
201 1/12 fiscal year.

33.      The MGDS recognizes that strong and sustainable economic growth is key
to reducing poverty. As indicated earlier, the long-term vision of the MGDS is to make
Malawi more production and export oriented. The strategy seeks to achieve growth rates
of at least 6 percent a year. The MGDS emphasizes agriculture as the driver of growth
in the medium term. It focuses on increasing agricultural productivity and integrating
smallholder farmers into commercial activities. In the long term, the Government has also
identified four sectors with potential for high growth: tourism, mining, manufacturing,
and agro-processing. There is also emphasis on infrastructure development and the need
to create a conducive environment for export-led growth, building on sound
macroeconomic and public expenditure management.

34.     The design and implementation of the MGDS has involved public
consultation and participation. The process of developing the MGDS was led by
Government, but involved all key stakeholders in Malawi, .including the private sector,
Development Partners, civil society, and members of the public.

35.       The monitoring of the MGDS implementation is conducted with
participation from representatives of Civil Society Organizations and Development
Partners, through the various Sector Working Groups (SWGs). The work of the
SWGs is ongoing and their meetings provide a forum for broad public consultation to
strengthen domestic accountability in the MGDS implementation and monitoring. Each
SWG produces a report at the end of each fiscal year, which forms as part of the input
into the Annual Progress Report (APR) of the MGDS. This process could however
benefit from wider public participation and enhanced coordination between Government
and other stakeholders during APRs.

36.      The second annual progress report (APR) of the MGDS was finalized in
2009 while preparation of the third APR is underway. Overall, in comparison with
the first review, the second APR presented reported that there has been remarkable
progress as many sectors had achieved their expected targets. Overall performance for all

                                           15
priority sectors was satisfactory in terms of achieving MGDS outcomes, core sector
outputs and development projects performance targets, except for energy generation and
supply. In agriculture, further progress was found to have been made in improving
agriculture productivity and maintaining food security, largely as a result of the input
subsidy program. In health, the APR also presents further progress in 7 out of 8 indicators
that are tracked annually. These are the nurse population ratio, TB cure rate, Proportion
of 1 year-old children immunized against measles, EHP coverage, percent of national
budget contribution to the health sector, proportion of births attended by skilled personnel
and OPD service utilization. Only the doctor population ratio showed poor performance.
The finding that the energy sector underperformed is also in line with the CEM's findings
that energy remains one of the constraints to growth in Malawi due to, among others,
under-investment in the sector.



    IV.        BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
                    A. LINKS THE C O U N T R Y ASSISTANCE
                           TO                           STRATEGY

37.      The PRSG series is an integral part of the Bank's assistance program to
Malawi as outlined in the CAS. The current CAS for Malawi was approved in February
2007 and covers a four year period (FY07-10). The CAS is fully aligned to the MGDS
and is designed to help the Government achieve four key outcomes: improving
smallholder agricultural productivity and integration into agro-processing; put in place a
foundation for long- term economic growth through improved infrastructure and
investment climate; reducing vulnerability at the household level to HIVIAIDS and
malnutrition; and sustaining improvements in expenditure management, transparency and
accountability. In achieving these outcomes, the CAS provides for a programmatic
development lending operation every year over the CAS period. PRSG-3 is the last in the
series under the current CAS.

38.     The CAS provides an indication of the role that the DPLs are envisaged to
play in supporting the MGDS. In terms of policy areas, the CAS envisages that the
DPL would support policy reforms that seek to reduce key risks to the development of
markets. Second, the DPL would support policy reforms that create a stable and
conducive environment for private sector growth. Third, the CAS also envisages that the
DPL would seek to support policy implementation aimed at strengthening the institutions
of public management and improving transparency and accountability. Finally, the DPL
will also seek to ensure that the policies of the Government do not jeopardize .debt
sustainability .

                            B. COORDINATION WITH T H E IMF

39.     As was the case with PRSG-1 and PRSG-2, there will be constant
coordination with the IMF at all stages of the third PRSG process. Maintenance of
sound macroeconomic management will continue to be a precondition for the
implementation of the PRSG program. Therefore, staff will work closely with the IMF
team to support the Government in implementing the new Extended Credit Facility (ECF)

                                             16
program. A joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for low-income
countries (LIC-DSA) was recently undertaken in the context of the Article IV
consultations and ECF program negotiations. During the identification of prior-actions
for the PRSG program, attention has also been paid to the benchmarks under the previous
PRGF, ESF and the ECF program to avoid cross-conditionality.

          c . COLLABORATION AND HARMONIZATION OTHER DONORS
                                          WITH

40.      The PRSG program continues to be implemented within the framework of
the CABS. The CABS is a group of donors that have a joint approach to the provision of
budgetary support to the Government of Malawi. In September 2005, the CABS group
and GoM agreed on a Joint Framework (JF) for budget support cooperation designed to
formalize their relationship. The JF represents a memorandum of understanding on
principles governing budget support cooperation in Malawi. Some of the principles
governing this cooperation include alignment to the country's poverty reduction strategy,
joint reviews, and predictability of funding. The PRSG program is IDA'S instrument for
the provision of budget support under the CABS framework.

41.      The CABS Joint Framework among other things provides for a
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) on which to base disbursement
decisions. The PAF consists of a jointly approved set of indicators and targets for
assessing Government performance and progress in the use of budget support. Each
indicator has an annual target which the Government is expected to meet. The CABS
undertakes two annual reviews, one during February-March and another during August-
September. Both reviews are aligned to the budget cycle. The February-March review
takes place just before the Government starts to prepare its budget. The review focuses on
assessing Government performance in achieving the targets for each indicator in the PAF.
Decisions on whether to disburse budget support and how much are based on the
outcome of this review. The August-September review focuses on the annual budget that
will have just been approved by Parliament, public financial management issues, and a
preliminary assessment of the fiscal performance during the previous fiscal year. Over
the years, the annual reviews have become more participatory, and now increasingly
include participation from members of parliament and the civil society.

42.      In this context, the PRSG program is fully aligned with the PAF. In
particular, the PRSG policy matrix is a subset of indicators (and their respective targets)
contained in the PAF. Annex 2 contains a PAF with these indicators and their targets for
2009 and 2010. The collaboration efforts in recent years have also seen a successful
completion of the Malawi Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), undertaken jointly
by four development partners, namely, the World Bank, the African Development Bank
(AfDB), UK Department for International Development (DFID), and the Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC). The report was shared with government ministers at a
meeting held in January 20 10.

                       D. Relationship to other Bank Operations

43.    The PRSG program will continue to complement current and planned Bank
investment operations in Malawi. In this regard, the program is particularly linked to

                                            17
three projects: the Agriculture Development Program - Support Project (ADP-SP) which
was approved on 25 June 2008 and became effective in 2009, the Business Environment
 Strengthening Technical Assistance Project (BESTAP) approved in May 2007, and the
just-ended Financial Management and Transparency Project (FIMTAP). All the three
enable the Bank to provide technical assistance to the Government in implementing the
reform program supported by the PRSG.

    V. THE PROPOSED POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT GRANT
                                 A. Overall Description

44.      The proposed Third Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG-3) is the last
in a series of three annual PRSGs whose aim is to support implementation of the
Government's poverty reduction strategy, the MGDS. It seeks to support reforms for
improving the functioning of agricultural input and output markets as well as managing
weather risks; continuing improvements in the business environment by reducing the
length of time it takes to settle commercial disputes; addressing the vulnerability of poor
households to shocks through improved targeting of the fertilizer subsidy program; and
continuing improvements in economic governance with a focus on reforms to improve
the budget process, debt and payroll management, and systems of accountability in
public financial management.

45.     The PRSG series supports a focused set of policy reforms which can been
categorized under four components:

(1) Improving the functioning of agricultural markets including managing of
climatic risks. The purpose of the reforms is to improve the efficiency of markets
through greater participation of the private sector in input and output markets, bringing
markets closer to farmers; and managing weather risks to ensure that food is available at
all times.
(2) Improving the business climate. The program supports measures to improve the
enforcement of commercial contracts and reduce the length of time for processing
business licenses.
(3) Improving social protection. The program supports improvements in the design,
targeting, implementation, and coordination of social protection programs, with a focus
on the country's huge fertilizer subsidy program.
(4) Improving economic governance. The program supports measures to strengthen
public financial management through improved debt and payroll management, and
financial management accountability.

46.      The three year reform program being supported by the PRSG program is
contained in a policy matrix presented in Annex 3. The preparation of the PRSG
program has been informed by several analytical studies and reviews. These studies and
reviews were outlined in detail in the program document for PRSG- 1. More recently, a
Public Sector Review was completed in 2007 and a Country Economic Memorandum
was completed this, following a successful dissemination program with government and
other stakeholders. These will further inform the process of sharpening existing reforms
and designing new ones.

                                            18
                                B. Development Objectives

47.     The PRSG program aims at contributing to the achievement of Malawi's
medium-term development objectives as outlined in the MGDS. In particular, it is
designed to support the Government in pursuing a development strategy that aims at
accelerating growth while at the same time ensuring that the vulnerable are adequately
protected from shocks. It is therefore expected that at the end of the series, the program will
have contributed towards increased economic growth and poverty reduction by supporting
implementation of policy and institutional reforms that will lead to increased agricultural
productivity, increased private sector investment, improved household resilience to shocks,
and sustained improvements in fiscal management.

                      C. Proposed Level of Support under PRSG-3


48.     The proposed level of funding for the operation is US$54 million, including
an additional funding of US$14 million through the Crisis Response Window
(CRW). As will be outlined in the subsequent section, the PRSG program is expected to
remain on track as evidenced by a broadly successful record government's economic
management over the past few years and successful completion of the March 201 0 CABS
review. Progress on the PRSG and overall reforms program is monitored under the PAF,
in the context of the CABS mechanism. The joint CABS review of March 2010
concluded that overall progress with the reforms program in 2009 was satisfactory.

49.      With regard to the program supported by the PRSG series, Government has met
all the nine prior actions. It is therefore proposed that an amount of US$54 million be
disbursed, in line with the CAS. This also includes US$14 million under the Crisis
Response Window (CRW) to support government's implementation of the
macroeconomic program in the face of the recent shocks to the economy.

     D. Progress in Implementing the Reform Program Supported by the PRSG


50.      Satisfactory progress has been made in implementing the reform program
supported by the PRSG, although there is ongoing dialogue in the agricultural
sector on government intervention in prices. As will be outlined in detail below, all the
nine prior actions agreed under PRSG-3 have been met. Table 5 presents a summary of
the implementation status of all the prior actions including a comparison of the agreed
prior actions with the original triggers for PRSG-3

Reform Area 1: ImprovinP the Functioning of Agriculture Markets

51.       Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for the majority of the
Malawian population. With around 85 percent of the population based in the rural areas,
farming is the main occupation for most households. The majority of agriculture
households are smallholder farmers, who grow crops on less than one hectare of land.
Most households grow maize which is the staple food. Although the crop is grown
principally for subsistence requirements, approximately 15 percent of smallholders are
net grain sellers. Depending on the harvest, about 60 percent are net grain buyers. Other
food crops grown for subsistence and cash requirements are rice, cassava, sorghum, and
pulses. Tobacco is the main cash crop. Other smallholder cash crops include cotton,
groundnuts, and more recently, soya beans and paprika. Further, smallholder farmers are
also increasingly being engaged in tea and sugar production often through contract
arrangements. Smallholders have responded impressively when offered favorable market
opportunities and prices. The broad diversification of cropping patterns largely occurred
after 1994, when markets were liberalized and smallholders were for the first time
allowed to grow tobacco on their own fields rather than as sharecroppers or workers on
estates. This response of smallholder farmers to market and price incentives remains a
critical determinant of future agricultural growth.

52.       Maize food security remains a primary policy objective. Over the past two
decades, the Malawi government has experimented with various initiatives to boost maize
production and alleviate poverty. These include market liberalization (1994) and
agricultural production support programs such as the Universal Starter Pack (1 998), and
the Targeted Input Program ( 0 2 ,which in 2005 was replaced by the Agricultural Input
                             20)
Subsidy Programme (AISP). These programs are meant to help farmers to afford
fertilizer and improved seed, and raise average yields. Over the past five years, the
combination of the AISP with favorable rains, and a good macro-economic environment,
has raised national maize harvests to record levels. The programme has attracted
widespread international interest, and is widely viewed as a favorable example of
national commitment to food security. Recent evidence suggests this program may also
have contributed to reducing poverty levels from 52 percent in 2005 to about 40 percent
by 2008.

53.       Though maize production has grown, and tobacco production is expanding,
the country still faces several challenges in the agricultural sector. These include,
inter alia, low productivity; distorted 'incentives (including import, export, and periodic
trade controls); limited integration of the majority of smallholders into markets,
uncertainty about the payoffs to commercial investment in agricultural trade and
processing and weak institutional capacity.

54.     Although total agricultural output has been increasing, Malawi's
agricultural productivity has shown little growth over the past decade. There remains
a wide gap in Malawi between yields observed in on-farm experimental fields and actual
yields obtained by farmers. For example, while potential yields for hybrid maize range
from 5 to 8 tons per hectare, average actual yields have been around 1.5 tons and rarely

                                            21
reached beyond 2.5 tons. Smallholder tobacco yields average only one ton per hectare
and cotton yields are less than one ton per hectare. Malawi has the potential to become a
regional exporter, but that will require agricultural productivity to rise. This will require
greater investment in the development of input markets, stronger extension support, the
exploitation of contracting arrangements linked with crop management assistance, as well
as favorable macroeconomic policies. A key challenge will be to intensify production and
raise land productivity on the majority of smaller farms.

55.      The problem of low productivity is exacerbated by the country's
vulnerability to weather vagaries and huge variability in prices-especially in the
maize sub-sector. Malawi has experienced several catastrophic droughts over the past
few decades which have contributed to low and volatile economic growth from year to
year. This is because Malawi's agriculture constitutes about 40 percent of the economy,
and the dominant share of production is rain-fed, smallholder farming. And the impacts
of production variability have been exacerbated, in the maize sub-sector, by uncertainty
regarding government interventions in the maize market. If production levels fall short,
traders generally have limited their imports out of fear that government will step in with a
much larger consignment of grain to be sold at subsidized prices. The combination of
limited commercial imports and low levels of grain stockholding simply worsens the
problem of maize price volatility if the government does not act fast enough. Such
problems contributed to the country's substantial maize price volatility in 2001 and 2005.

56.      In this context, well functioning agricultural markets, complemented by
efficient management of weather-related risks, are critical to the welfare of
households and to the growth of the sector in general. The Farm Input Subsidy
program (FISP) has successfully contributed to the achievement of self-sufficiency in
national maize production. Nonetheless, it is estimated that more than 60 percent of
agriculture households in Malawi still rely on buying maize from the market to meet
shortfalls in their own farm production. Therefore, ready access to food markets and low
food prices during the lean season remain critical for food-deficit households to meet
their food requirements. In this regard, the marketing system must be able to move grain
from surplus to deficit areas on a timely basis and at limited cost. Correspondingly, the
system must also make sure that farmers have ready access to produce markets where
crops can be sold at favourable prices. This would ensure that farmers earn reasonable
incomes to cover input costs, expand production, and meet other non-food requirements.
In sum, efficient input markets are essential to provide access to new technologies
necessary to improve productivity. Well functioning product markets are essential to
provide incentives to expand commercial production, while assuring farmers the capacity
to purchases needed food supplies. Various risk management strategies can reduce price
volatility while making the prospects of occasional government intervention more
predictable.

l a . Improved functioning of output mnrkets

57.      Government has been struggling to strike a balance between facilitating the
efficient operation of agriculture output markets and helping to improve farmers'
incomes. Under the PRSG 1 and 2, institutional reforms were implemented on the
operations of the national marketing board, namely the Agricultural Development and

                                             22
Marketing Corporation (ADMARC) to reflect the liberalization steps that government has
undertaken; and establishment of the Malawi Agricultural Warehousing and Trading
Company (MAWTCO) with the objective of enhancing private sector participation in
maize markets. Yet the government continues to intervene in mandating price and trade
controls, particularly for maize markets. In 2008, in the midst of the global food crisis,
the appearance of grain shortages and unexpectedly high prices led to the imposition of
price controls and ultimately the withdrawal of trader licenses. These licenses have now
been re-distributed. And trade remains competitive. But renewed uncertainty about the
timing and form of government interventions undermines investment. These problems
have been discussed in an on-going dialogue between the government and development
partners on how best to improve agricultural incomes with minimal disturbance to the
markets. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security has recently created a
commodity risk management unit and is now more widely consulting with commercial
stakeholders prior to any price and trade interventions.

58.      Positively, government has initiated the use of weather risk management
tools to strengthen efforts in promoting food security. As pointed out earlier, weather
shocks have had catastrophic welfare and fiscal effects on Malawi. The Malawi Poverty
and Vulnerability Assessment (World Bank, 2007) identifies climatic shocks as one
major risk to poverty that households in Malawi face. The 2005 IHS-2 reported that the
two major shocks faced by households in Malawi are large rises in food prices and lower
crop yields due to drought and floods-shocks which are highly covariate. In the past,
these shocks have had huge fiscal implications. For example, the cost of the 2004/05
drought response to government was over US$200 million. Implementation of market-
based commodity risk management strategies would therefore help to mitigate the impact
of these shocks (see Box 1). Since 2005, government has been experimenting on several
instruments under the risk management strategy. This was institutionalized in
government systems in 2009, when Government completed a policy framework for
strengthening maize markets. The framework outlines the various policy instruments that
Government will employ in tackling various issues in maize markets. As a pilot for the
macro-weather insurance, the Government of Malawi entered into an initial transaction
that provided contingency funding in the event of extreme drought during the 2008/2009
agricultural season, and planned to implement a REPO or call option in the 2009110
season to hedge against the variability of international maize prices at the time when
Malawi needs to import maize. However, in light of the weather forecasts for the 2009/10
farming season, it became clear that a REPO or call option was no longer necessary as a
risk management tool. Instead, Government hedged against a general severe drought, by
implementing the macro weather insurance, with the premium paid for by the UK DFID.

            Box 1: Use of Weather Derivatives as a Risk Management Tool

Index-based drought risk management contracts

Recent developments in international risk markets allow Malawi to purchase an index-based
weather risk management contract to transfer the financial risk of severe and catastrophic national
drought that adversely impacts the government's budget, to the international risk markets. Index-
based risk transfer approaches are not insurance in the traditional sense where the insured party is
compensated for the precise monetary loss that can be proved to have occurred. Rather the
protection is based on the performance of a specified index and trigger designed to correlate as
closely as possible with the underlying risk (which in Malawi concerns the level of maize output).
Payouts are automatically made whenever this index crosses the specified contract threshold (the
trigger) at the end of the contract period, without the need of loss assessments and checks to
confirm the occurrence and magnitude of an actual loss. These contracts are legally structured as
derivative contracts (rather than insurance contracts) although they still perform an insurance
function. Consequently, they are sometimes referred to as macro weather insurance contracts.

The counterparties to such transactions, the entities to whom the risk is transferred for a premium
charge, are actors in the weather risk market. Weather market players, from both the reinsurance
and financial communities are interested in new, uncorrelated risks, such as Malawi's, that can
diversify and therefore enhance commercial risk portfolios.

Weather Insurance in Malawi

Malawi first experimented with the weather derivatives contract in the 2008/09 summer cropping
season to test the feasibility and cost of transferring its drought risk to the international risk
markets. The pilot provided up to US$5 million in coverage for a premium of US$500 thousand.
Government contracted a second derivative in the 2009/10 season, for a premium of US$500
thousand. To date, the World Bank has provided technical advice on how the derivative contracl
would work. DFID has paid the premiums for the two derivatives contracts, though it is expected
that the government will pay a growing share of this cost over time. Complementary investments
have been made in up-grading the national weather stations throughout the country and
automating data flows.

1 b. Improved functioning o input markets
                           f

59.     On the input marketing side, attention has been on implementing the input
subsidy program in a market friendly manner. The national input subsidy program
sharply increased in size for the first time during the 2005/06 agriculture season. It
continued to grow until the 2008/09 production season, ultimately encompassing the




                                                24
supply of fertilizer, seed and agro-chemicals to producers of maize, tobac~o,~cotton,tea
and coffee. The program then declined in size in 2009/10 due to fiscal constraints, and
the realization of the need to improve targeting. It now only covers maize inputs.

60.      Since its inception, the fertilizer subsidy program has had a significant
positive impact on food security. Complemented by favorable rainfall conditions,
Malawi has registered surplus national maize production since 2006, even managing to
export some of the surplus grain in 2007. An evaluation of the subsidy program carried
out by a consortium of DFID funded consultants during 2007-08 found that the
combination of the subsidy and favorable rainfall had a significant positive impact on
food security in Malawi. For example, it found that the proportion of households
reporting a major shock from high food prices between 2004 and 2007 decreased from 79
percent to 20 percent. A preliminary analysis of the benefit-cost ratio of the program
conducted by the same consultants in 2009 shows that since its inception, the benefit-cost
ratio has been greater than one, under high as well as medium scenarios of maize yield
response to fertilizer.

61.      However, there have also been concerns surrounding the program. Until
2009, the cost of the program was rapidly increasing. When it started in 2005/06, the
program cost just $70 million, or 1.7 percent of GDP. However during the 2008/09
agricultural season, the program cost rose to $279 million or 5.8 percent of GDP, partly
as a result of the sharp increase in world fertilizer prices. As this level of spending on the
program was not sustainable, the Government's response was to re-target the FISP
toward maize production in 2009/10. Assistance to producers of tobacco, cotton, coffee
and tea was dropped. Even so, the program's targeting system still faces challenges.
Recent assessments suggest that relatively better off households are still more likely to
receive coupons than some of the poorest households. In consequence, efforts are
continuing to improve the selection of poorer households. . Third, while private traders
were initially included in the redemption of fertilizer coupons, the 2008/09 program only
used the two parastatal organizations, ADMARC and the Smallholder Farmers Fertilizer
Revolving Fund of Malawi (SFFRFM). This has undermined the development of
commercial input markets.

62.      Although dialogue has sometimes been difficult, the Bank will continue to be
engaged in order to help improve the program. The Bank has participated in a number
of discussions with government about opportunities for improving the payoffs to the
input subsidy program and making this more market friendly. This has led to the
provision of financial support for research and extension efforts to increase fertilizer use
efficiency and environmental sustainability. Discussions have been held regarding the
value of using variable seed subsidies to strengthen competition in the market. Priority
has also been attached to allowing private stockists to collect fertilizer vouchers. Further,
the PRSG program.continues to support actions that Government is committed to
undertaking in order to address challenges currently being faced.


5
 OP4.76prohibits the Bank from supporting tobacco related activities except in cases where the crop
accounts for more than 10 percent of exports and where the beneficiaries are primarily the poor. In the case
of Malawi, both criteria were met and as a result an exception to OP4.76was granted.

                                                     25
63.      PRSG related actions have highlighted the value of adopting more market
friendly strategies of input subsidy. As part of this process, the Government has
undertaken a performance assessment to evaluate public and private sector involvement
in wholesale and retail trade of subsidized fertilizer, based on four indicators: quality of
product sold, quality of service provided, additional services offered, and other related
issues (PRSG-2 prior action). The assessment found no significant differences between
public and private sector operations in redeeming fertilizer coupons under the input
subsidy program. Therefore, in order to further strengthen private wholesale and retail
trade of agricultural inputs, Government initially sought to prepare an action plan for the
input market development (PRSG-3 trigger at PRSG-2). However, Government also
recognized the need to document its strategy for implementing the input subsidy
program, which currently constitutes over 50 percent of the Ministry of Agriculture's
budget. The government thus launched an initiative to prepare a medium-term action
plan for the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) to be developed in consultation with
various stakeholders.
                                                                                 ~

Reform Area 2: Improving; the Business Climate

64.      The MGDS highlights the importance of the private sector as an engine of
growth in Malawi. In this regard, one of the sub-themes in the strategy is that of creating
an enabling environment for private sector-led growth. As pointed out earlier, the ICA
and Doing Business Surveys have highlighted the various constraints to private sector
development in Malawi, one of which has been an unstable macroeconomic environment.
Following progress in restoring macroeconomic stability, the Government is now
focusing on a broad program of `second generation' reforms in the domestic business
environment which will seek to stimulate private sector investment and employment
creation.

65.      In 2009 Malawi reformed in two areas of business regulation-Trading
across borders and Closing a business. The Ministry of Industry and Trade, in
coordination with the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA), has undertaken a number of
reforms to rationalize customs procedures, including the implementation of a risk-based
inspections regime of post-destination clearance for pre-approved traders. This has
reduced delays for clearing goods in Malawi. Nonetheless, trading across borders
continues to be one of Malawi's worst performing Doing Business indicators, pointing to
the need to strengthen reforms in this area. In the area of closing a business, a new
Companies Regulation was implemented and took effect on June 1, 2009, setting a 5%
cap on liquidator's fees. As a result, the overall cost of the insolvency procedure in
Malawi fell from 30% of the value of the estate to 25%, and the mechanism for payment
of liquidators has become more transparent.

66.     Despite these reforms, Malawi's ranking on the overall ease of doing
business fell slightly from 131st last year to 132nd this year, due to the fact that other
economies reformed more vigorously than Malawi over the same period. Positively,
Government has embarked on several initiatives to enhance the pace of reforms. For
                                            26
example, in November 2009, Government signed a Doing Business Reform
Memorandum with the World Bank, under which the latter would help Government in
implementing key reforms to improve the ease of doing business in Malawi. However,
there have been delays in implementing other Government plans and policies to ease the
process of doing business. For example, the plans to reduce the time it takes to process
business-related permits and licenses, by opening a one-stop investment shop, have been
put on hold for several years. While a revised Malawi Investment and Trade Center
(MITC) bill has been published (PRSG-3 trigger at PRSG-2), it has not yet been
approved by both the Cabinet and parliament. It is therefore no longer necessary to
maintain this as a PRSG-3 prior action, as it does not reflect the institutional reforms that
were intended to be undertaken in line with the fulfillment of the trigger.

2a. Improved business environment through improvements in contract enforcement and
business licensing

67.      One of the key private sector concerns with Malawi's business climate has
been the length of time it takes to settle commercial disputes. The court system has
been faced with capacity challenges in dealing with commercial cases, partly due to the
absence of specialized courts. Priority in the general courts is usually given to criminal
and political cases. In 2006, it took an average of 337 days to enforce a contract through
the court system. Some businesses have therefore been reluctant to enter into contract
arrangements except with the most trusted clients thereby limiting the scope for business
opportunities and growth. For example, most small scale firms have generally found it
difficult to access commercial bank credit as the commercial banks required huge
collaterals in order to compensate for the risk on non-repayment of the loan.

68.      Recently, the length o time it takes to settle commercial disputes has been
                                f
reduced (PRSG-2 prior action). In May 2007, a Commercial Division of the High Court
was established. Four judges were appointed, and the court has been operational. As of
March 2008, it was taking on average 125 days to settle commercial disputes, which is
significantly below the target of 290 days for 2008. In 2009, the average had gone down
further to about 120 days (see table 6 below).

 69.       So far, the Commercial Court has only been hearing new cases. Therefore,
the Government's focus now is on dealing with the backlog of commercial cases that are
 still at the General Division of the High Court. A case audit has been completed to
determine which cases should be transferred to the Commercial Court. The process was
 supported by the World Bank's Business Environment Support for Technical assistance
project (BESTAP). The purpose of the case audit was to isolate all cases that are
commercial in nature from general cases. It is therefore now up to the two interested
parties to push the identified cases to the commercial court. The table below shows the
number of new commercial cases registered per year, number of consent/default
judgments, mediation agreements, judgments delivered by courts and those pending
conclusion.

nature for Possible transfer to the Commercial Court.

Reform Area 3: Improving Social Protection

70.     Most households in Malawi are vulnerable and' experience various types of
shocks. Examples of vulnerabilities include illnesses and deaths of relations, mostly due
to HIV/AIDS, drought related crop failures, and unaffordable food and input prices.
Households are often forced to draw down on their savings or sell their assets in order to
cope with shocks and vulnerabilities. In some cases, households have to re-allocate time
and resources away from their traditional economic activities to either care for household
members or mobilize income and food in order to survive. Shocks tend to drive the poor
into even deeper poverty.

71.       In order to help the poor cope, a number of social protection programs are
being implemented across the country. The programs are being run by various
institutions, including Government, development partners, and non-governmental
organizations. Some are designed to provide the vulnerable or affected households
directly with their needs while others aim at empowering them so that they are able to
undertake productive income earning activities.

72.      To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of various social protection
programs, cabinet is discussing a comprehensive social protection policy. To date,
social protection programs have been poorly coordinated, resulting in overlapping
geographical coverage and in some cases conflicting approaches. The main reason for
poor coordination has been lack of leadership at Government level. First, although a
Social Protection Unit (SPU) was established to coordinate and oversee implementation
of social protection programs, its capacity has been weak, mainly because of low staffing
levels. However some progress has recently been made, with the recruitment of
additional staff in the unit. Second, coordination efforts have been hampered by lack of a
guiding policy. In this regard, a comprehensive social protection policy was developed
and is being discussed by cabinet. The policy was developed after extensive consultation
with all the relevant stakeholders.

73.      The most important social protection program in Government is the
fertilizer subsidy program. As described earlier, the program was established during the
2005/06 agricultural season with the aim of improving food security for poor households
through access to fertilizer. While in previous years the program used to target both
maize and cash crops, the 2009/10 program has been streamlined to food crops only in

                                                  28
order to enhance food security. Each eligible farmer is provided with two coupons which
are used to buy fertilizer at a subsidized price.

74.      A critical success factor in the implementation of the fertilizer subsidy
program is the targeting of beneficiaries. In its conception, the program was intended
for very poor smallholder farmers to be identified by local leaders. In practice, the
                                                                                             `
process of identifying the beneficiaries has proved to be a challenging one, with concerns
raised that some better off households have benefited at the expense of the poor.

75.      Although challenges remain, efforts have been made to ensure that only
eligible households benefit from the program. In an effort to improve the effectiveness
of the program, Government has been working on improving the program's targeting
mechanism. Over the years, Government and development partners have made concerted
efforts to ensure that the program appropriately targets vulnerable households. Targeting
efforts have included changes to the coupon allocation systems, registration of all
farming households, and introduction of "flexible vouchers" to allow farmers to choose
what seed they want to buy. The introduction and implementation of improved guidelines
for targeting in the 2008/09 season (PRSG-2 prior action) led to a more transparent
targeting process than in previous years. While in the past, identification of the
beneficiaries was done by the local leaders only, this year, other community leaders were
involved. Further, the list of beneficiaries had to be confirmed by members of the
community at public meetings specifically called for this purpose. Looking forward,
Government is committed to making further improvements on the targeting of the
program. To that end, it published in 2009/10 the revised guidelines for identification of
beneficiaries based on field experiences from implementing the 2008/09 program.

the 2009/10 Input Subsidy Program based on field experiences from 2008109

Reform Area 4: Improving Economic Governance

76.      Three Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments
have been conducted in recent years, in 2005, 2006, and 2008. The 2008 assessment
found that a number of improvements have been made since the 2006 assessment.
Selected areas where improvements have been made include transparency of inter-
governmental fiscal relations, oversight of fiscal risk from other public sector entities,
recording and management of cash balances, debt and guarantees, effectiveness of
internal audit, quality and timeliness of annual financial statements, and legislative
scrutiny of the annual budget law. The assessment reported that regardless of progress
being made, weaknesses remain in external auditing, particularly, timely submission of
audit reports to Parliament and follow-up, effectiveness of payroll controls, and public
access to key fiscal information (see text table below). In addition, weaknesses in debt
management system were also highlighted by the 2004 HIPC AAP and the 2007 PER.
Based on the findings of these reports, the Government has prepared a Public Finance
and Economic Management (PFEM) Action Plan, which includes the key reforms
supported by the PRSG program. The Bank, in close collaboration with the IMF and the
other development partners, has strongly supported the implementation of the PFM action
plan through the FIMTAP project, with a focus on strengthening the IFMIS, payroll
                                           29
management, procurement, accounting, and auditing (internal and external). One area that
has registered a lot of improvement in the Public Financial Management is the District
Administration, where there has been significant capacity development in the financial
administration. At the moment almost all District Assemblies have Directors of Finance
unlike a few years ago. After a successful pilot with 5 Assemblies, Government is
planning to roll out its IFMIS system to all the Assemblies in the next two years, with the
first twelve Assemblies budgeted for this year.

4a. Improved payroll management

77.      Weaknesses in the management of the payroll have been a major
contributing factor to poor fiscal management in the past. Difficulties have been due
to several factors, including a complex remuneration policy where as much as two-thirds
of the take home pay was in the form of allowances, the lack of a credible integrated
system of managing personnel and payroll records, and the fact that it takes long periods
of time for personnel records (and hence payroll) to be updated whenever life events such
as deaths or resignations occur.

78.     Significant reforms have been taken by the Government to strengthen
control of the payroll in recent years. A civil service wage reform was carried out in
late 2004, which entailed a rationalization of grades and salary levels, and a consolidation
of most non-discretionary allowances into the wage. The Government also introduced in
2006 a new system for managing personnel and pay roll records, the Human Resource
Management Information System (HRMIS), which ensures that payroll data is
automatically updated each time there is a change to personnel data. A database of all
Government employees was compiled in 2006 and reconciled with payroll records.

79.       The HRMIS review and personnel audit that were undertaken in 2008 (PRSG-
2 prior action) revealed that weaknesses i n the personnel management and payroll
system still existed but indicated positive progress from the previous audit The
purpose of the HRMIS review was to test the system's integrity for personnel and payroll
data management. The expectation was that a robust personnel and payroll management
system would help improve management and mitigate problems of ghost workers,
inaccurate wage projections, unauthorized allowances, recruitments, promotions, and
wage increases. The personnel audit covered the whole public service. Results of the
exercise revealed that, over the years, the integrated system for personnel records and
payroll has improved. While a sizeable percentage of take home pay is still in the form of
allowances, the system (HRMIS) has become more reliable and more effectively and
efficiently used. More ghost workers were identified and removed from the system.
Further, Government developed an Action Plan to address the identified weaknesses in
both the HRMIS review and personnel audit (PRSG-3 prior action). At the March 2010
CABS review, Government reported that by end 2009, it had implemented some
activities from the action plan, including the production of five audit trails on the validity
of the payroll data; and commencement of the project to link the HRMIS to the
government's financial management system IFMIS. These changes are expected to
reduce costs, improve efficiency and make the system much more reliable.

PRSG-3 Prior Action: Action Plans to address weaknesses identified in HRMIS review
and personnel audit are developed.

4b. Improved coverage and timeliness in auditing o government accounts
                                                  f

77.     Improving the coverage and timeliness in external auditing has been a key
objective of the public finance management reform program. Due to limited human
capacity, very few Ministries and Departments are audited in a year. Second, preparation
of the audit reports and their submission to Parliament has taken place with long delays,
usually up to several years. Third, there is usually no follow up on audit
recommendations made by the Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee of
Parliament.

78.      Progress has been made to improve coverage and timeliness of Audits. First,
the capacity of the National Audit Office has been strengthened by the recruitment in
2007 of 60 new assistant auditors and 20 interns. This has helped increase the coverage of
external audit. As a result, for fiscal year 2004/05 (backlog), Government entities
representing more than 50 percent of expenditures were audited. The figure is expected to
increase further in the next few years. Second, delays in the submission to the National
Audit Office of financial statements by the Accountant General have contributed to
delays in the preparation and submission to Parliament of Audit Reports. However, since
the roll out of IFMIS in 2005, there has been significant improvement in the preparation
of accounts at the end of the financial year. For example, the financial statements for the
2007108 fiscal year were submitted to the Auditor General towards the end of November,
which is only one month after the statutory requirement of within four months from the
end of the fiscal year. The Financial Statements for 2008/09 were presented to the
Auditor General by early November 2009. This was a few days after the deadline but
represents significant progress. In addition, the Accountant General is planning to
produce financial statements for individual Ministries and agencies to enable the Auditor
General to audit and express an audit opinion on each Ministry.

79.      With increased staffing levels, and the appointment of an Auditor General,
the National Audit Office has been working on clearing the backlog in the
submission of audit reports. After completing audits for 2004/05 to 2007108, the
Auditor General is now up to date with the Audit Reports. The 2008/09 Financial
Statements are currently being audited. Another positive development is that the Auditor
General now directly reports to Parliament and not through the Minister of Finance as
was previously the case. The National Audit Office (NAO) has come up with a 5 year
strategic plan in which it looks at increasing independence (by seeking budgetary
independence) and capacity so that audit coverage could be improved to 70%. NAO's
vision includes adopting a Risk Based approach to audit. .

80.      The focus of PRSG-3 in relation to external audit will be on follow-up
actions to issues raised by the Public Accounts Committee. Apart from improvements
in timely production and submission of audit reports, another area of concern has been
follow-up actions on the reports. In the past, external audit reports were produced and
submitted to Parliament, but nothing would happen. In particular, the Public Accounts
Committee of Parliament would not meet to discuss the audit reports because of lack of
funding. However, there has been noticeable progress in recent times. Funding has been
made available for the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to discuss audit reports, and
concerned controlling officers and other public officers have been summoned to appear

                                            32
before the committee. However, there is still room for improvement with regard to
follow-up on such hearings. In particular, after the public officers have appeared before
the PAC, there have been some outstanding issues requiring follow up by the executive.
Responses to such queries are contained in a report known as the Treasury Minute which
is prepared by the Secretary to the Treasury (ST). Before preparing the report, the ST will
have written all the concerned controlling officers to provide responses on the issues
raised by the PAC. Unfortunately, these Treasury Minutes have not been issued on a
regular basis. In this regard, a prior action for PRSG-3 will be progress on follow-up of
audit queries through the submission of a Treasury Minute to the Public Accounts
Committee of Parliament containing responses to issues raised by the committee. There
has been an improvement in this direction with Government now planning to clear the
backlog of all Treasury Minutes within 12 months. Issues are now more actively followed
up by the Controlling Officers especially with the pressure coming from PAC and the
media.

81.     It is expected that by the end of the program period, significant progress
will have been made in the public finance accountability cycle - financial statements
and audit reports will be prepared and submitted in a timely manner, and there will be
follow-up on issues raised from audit reports.

PRSG-3 Prior Action: Follow-up on audit queries through the issuance of a Treasury
Minute which contains responses to issued raised by the Public Accounts Committee,

4c. Improvedpublic debt management

82.      There has been noticeable progress in improving debt management capacity
within Government. After reaching the HIPC completion point in August 2006, the
Government's attention shifted to undertaking measures that would prevent another
unsustainable build up of external debt. A Government Debt Management Performance
assessment was undertaken in 2007. Further, the 2007 PER undertaken jointly by the
GoM and the World Bank (and which benefited from the findings of a DSA mission in
early 2006) also looked at Malawi's debt management policy and institutional
framework. Both assessments found that the overall framework for debt management is
sound, although some weaknesses remain. Subsequently, a Debt Management Policy was
developed and approved by Cabinet (PRSG-2 prior action). Among other things, the
policy commits Government to annual borrowing limits at concessional terms. The Debt
and Aid Division (DAD) in the Ministry of Finance is now also able to undertake its own
debt sustainability analysis, although the quality of the analysis can be improved.

83.     A follow-up joint World Bank/MEFMI DeMPA, undertaken in September
2009, revealed that good progress has been made in improving government debt
management capacity. In particular, the assessment revealed that Malawi meets the
minimum requirements and above for 9 of the 15 Debt Management Performance
Indicators (DPIs), including the managerial structure, debt management strategy,
evaluation of debt management operations, coordination with fiscal policy, coordination
with monetary policy, domestic market borrowing, external borrowing, debt records, and
debt reporting. However, the following areas require improvement and could be
considered as priorities for capacity building and reform: (i) operational risk

                                            33
 management, including a structured staff training plan; (ii) cash flow forecasting and cash
 balance management; and (iii) performance audit of debt management activities. Also the
 legal framework needs to be clarified.

 84.      Going forward, coordination between debt management institutions needs
 to be strengthened. There appears to be no systematic reporting of information between
 the agents dealing with debt and cash management. For this reason, and in line with its
 Public Debt and Aid Management Policy, Government has established a Debt
 Management Committee composed of representatives of the Reserve Bank of Malawi
 (RBM), the Treasury, and the Accountant General's Office. The committee became
 operational in December 2008, and now meets on a quarterly basis to, among others,
 recommend to the Minister of Finance on whether to contract any external
 loans/guarantees. It last met in February 2010. To further facilitate the exchange of
 information between MoF and RBM, the two institutions are also working on a
 Memorandum of understanding which will, among others, see the MoF assuming full
 control of domestic debt management and limit the role of the RBM to that to an
 executing agent.

I PRSG-3 Prior Action: Debt Management Committee is operational.
 4d. Improved budget process

 85.       A key element of improved economic governance in Malawi has been
 improving the linkage between the MGDS (Malawi's PRSP), and the budget. The
 weak linkage between the budget and the MGDS has been due to many factors. First,
 guidelines on how to actually budget according to the MGDS priorities have been
 unclear. Second, there has been no comprehensive budget classification structure that
 could facilitate the link between the MGDS priorities and the budget, at least at a more
 disaggregated sector level. Third, the MGDS annual progress review is currently not
 properly linked to the budget process. Ideally, the MGDS annual progress reviews should
 be fully integrated into the budget calendar. Further, lack of timely provision of
 allocation ceilings to line ministries and departments has left little time for them to
 prepare their budgets in line with MGDS priorities. Lastly, the budget vetting system
 itself is weak. The Ministry of Economic Planning and Development (MEPD) that is
 responsible for the preparation and monitoring of the MGDS has not taken an active role
 in vetting the budget submissions.

 86.      Government has recently taken several steps to improve the linkage between
 the MGDS and the budget, although challenges still remain. The Treasury has
 prepared and issued more comprehensive guidelines for line ministries on how to budget
 according to the MGDS priorities. The guidelines have been communicated to
 stakeholders through workshops and booklets. Further, a budget calendar that
 incorporates all budget related activities has been introduced (PRSG-2 prior action). As
 a result, for the 2008/09 budget process, allocation ceilings were determined early and
 communicated in good time to line ministries and departments. This gave line ministries
 and departments enough time to prepare their budgets in line with MGDS priorities. The
 presentation and structure of the budget, together with the associated chart of accounts
 (PRSG-3 prior action), have also been improved to become compliant with international

                                             34
fiscal reporting standards and improve the linkages with the MGDS. Further progress has
been made since these changes were implemented. For example, the 2009/10 budget
framework was presented with 19 standardized programs and sub-programs in line with
the Government Finance Statistics (2001) manual. The revised chart of accounts is
already being used in the formulation of the 2010/11 budget.

PRSG Prior Action: Finalize the revised structure of the budget classification and the
associated Chart of Accounts (COA).

87.       Weaknesses observed in the procurement of additional fertilizer during the
2008/09 season point to the need for further reforms in improving the budget
process. As mentioned in an earlier section of this document, towards the end of 2008,
the Government decided to expand the input subsidy program (ISP) by 45 percent in
volume terms without funding being assured. Under pressure to have the fertilizer
delivered before the end of the planting season, the procurement of the additional
fertilizer was fast-tracked by the line ministry, appearing to bypass the control
mechanisms of the Ministry of Finance. This development has highlighted the fact that
beyond linking the MGDS to the budget, there is need to strengthen institutional
arrangements for budget implementation. Government plans to introduce strengthened
procurement procedures and enforce strict observance of available procurement
legislation. The Office of the Director of Public Procurement (ODPP) will only approve
large procurements if there is confirmation from the Ministry of Finance that funds are
available. Further, Government identified several weaknesses in the implementation of
the 2008/09 ISP, including situations where contracts cancelled due to nonperformance
were delivered, and where some steps in the awarding of contracts were not properly
followed. In order to ensure that all the key shortcomings are adequately addressed,
Government undertook a procurement review of the 2009/10 fertilizer subsidy program
to determine whether the procedures, processes and documentation for procurement and
contracting were in accordance with its rules and regulations. The review superseded
Government's earlier intentions to conduct a procurement audit of the 2008/09 ISP, as
information on the 2008109 procurement was already known. Instead, the findings from
the review were compared with both the 2008/09 identified weaknesses and
Government's set procurement procedures. Recommendations from the exercise are now
being used to benchmark and inform future procurement programs. These
recommendations include strengthening evaluation and award criteria in the bidding
documents, publication of award in public media and a further review of the 201 0/11
process in December 2010. The Government has also put in place measures aimed at
increasing the transparency of the budget execution process through requiring all key
ministries to prepare procurement plans for 2010/11 budget by August 31, 2010 and to
strengthen the publication of award of contracts in all key ministries for values above
US$300,000 equivalent. The ODPP has already implemented the recommended action to
review bidding documents for the 2010/11 ISP to strengthen the bidding evaluation and
qualification criteria.

PRSG-3 Prior Action: Undertake procurement review of the FY2009/10 fertilizer
subsidy program and commence implementation of key recommendations.

                          E. Assessing end-series outcomes

88.     This DPL is the third and last in the programmatic series under the current
CAS. The program objective for the series was to contribute towards increased economic
growth and poverty reduction by supporting implementation of policy and institutional
reforms that will lead to increased agricultural productivity, increased private sector
investment, improved resilience by poor households to shocks, and sustained
improvements in fiscal management. Progress towards achieving end of series outcomes
is mixed (See Annex 6).

89.      In agriculture, performance has been mixed. On the input market, there have
been clear improvements on the targeting of beneficiaries in the farm input subsidies
program (FISP) to the poor and vulnerable groups of the society, thereby increasing
efficiency both in the pursuit of the program's objective of enhancing food security and
in use of public resources. Further, the FISP has encouraged the use of new and better
technologies in farming. As a result, the program has surpassed the target on increased
maize productivity. Mid-way through the series, the mid-point average maize
productivity had already increased from 1.45 metric tons per hectare to 1.78 metric tons
against an end of series target of 1.6 metric tons. On the output markets, progress has
been made in managing weather-related risks. Over the past two growing seasons
(including the current one), government has been implementing a macro weather
insurance scheme, to help minimize the negative impacts of catastrophic drought on the
national budget. Parallel efforts to strengthen commercial maize markets through
ADMARC reforms have achieved partial success. Grain prices remain volatile, leading to
interventions in agricultural commodity pricing which have increased investment
uncertainties among both producers and traders. There is ongoing dialogue between
government and development partners to find a solution that both benefits the poor
farmers while maintaining market competitiveness.

90.      With regard to improving the business climate, although progress has been
made in carrying out all reform actions, the envisioned end-program outcomes have
not been fully achieved. The PRSG-1 Prior Action of having a commercial court
established was achieved and the PRSG-2 Prior Action of reducing the average number
of days to settle commercial disputes to 290 or less was exceeded (currently 120 days).
The PRSG-3 prior action of completing the audit of cases that are still at the General
Division of the High Court to determine which cases should be transferred to the
Commercial Court was done, as was the publishing of the Malawi Investment and Trade
Center (MITC) Bill (which, however, needs to be considered and approved by Cabinet
and then presented to Parliament). While there has been progress in meeting the business
climate reforms actions, Malawi's ranking under the Doing Business Surveys continues
to decline since 2007. The number of businesses starting up per month remains at 60,
below the end of program target of 70.

91.     Under social protection, progress has been made towards improving the targeting
of the fertilizer subsidy program to poor households. Qualitative information from
independent monitoring reports show that more poor households are benefiting from the
program.


                                          36
92.      Finally, within economic governance, progress has been made towards reducing
the ratio of domestic debt to GDP, although the end-program outcome may not be
achieved. The ratio of domestic debt to GDP has reduced from 20 percent in 2005/06 to
17.1 percent in 2007108.



Box 2: The Proposed PRSG and Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

The proposed PRSG has been prepared after consulting Government ministries and departments on specific
reform programs that will be implemented in order to achieve the medium-term goals as outlined in the
MGDS. It is out of these reform programs that prior actions and triggers to be supported by the PRSG have
been selected. Together with donors who belong to the CABS, the specific policy and institutional changes
have been translated into indicators and targets and are presented in the PAF.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework

The CABS donors and the Government of Malawi have signed a Joint Framework (JF) of budget support
cooperation. One of the principles contained in the JF is that of carrying out joint reviews. Every year one
of the reviews focuses on assessing Government performance in meeting the targets contained in the PAF.
Disbursements of budgetary support are based on a positive outcome of this review.

Principle 3 : Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances

The CABS undertakes biannual reviews, one during February-March and another during August-
September. Both reviews are aligned to the country's budget cycle. The February-March review takes place
just before the Government starts to prepare its budget. The review focuses on assessing Government
performance in achieving the targets for each indicator in the PAF. Decisions on whether to disburse
budget support and how much are based on the outcome of this review. The August-September review
focuses on the annual budget that will have just been approved by Parliament, public financial management
issues, and a preliminary assessment of the fiscal performance during the previous fiscal year.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

One of the principles of the Joint Framework of budget support cooperation is to have as few indicators in
the PAF as possible. Malawi's PAF has one of the least number of PAF indicators in the region. The prior
actions for the proposed PRSG represent only those actions that will be critical for achieving the program's
project development objectives and the various outcomes.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support

In order to improve predictability of budgetary support from donors, the JF requires donors to indicate
levels of budgetary support that they are planning to disburse well in advance of the start of the fiscal year,
such that the amounts can be included in the Budget submitted to Parliament. Once the main annual PAF
review in February-March has been concluded, all the CABS donors in Malawi indicate to the Government
how much they're planning to disburse in the following fiscal year. The Government uses this information
during the budget preparation process.




                                                      37
                     VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
93.     Implementation procedures for the PRSG-3 (in terms of monitoring and
evaluation, fiduciary aspects, and auditing; as well as environmental, poverty and
social aspects) are the same as described in the program document for PRSG-1 and
2. Details are reproduced below. However, it is worth pointing out that in some cases,
information contained in the previous program documents has been updated.

                   A. Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation


94.      The institutional arrangements for the preparation and execution of the
PRSG fall within the framework of the CABS. On the Government side, the CABS
group is served by a secretariat which is situated in the Debt and Aid Division of the
Ministry of Finance. The secretariat coordinates preparation of the PAF, implementation,
assessment and revision. For these activities, the secretariat mobilizes the relevant people
in various ministries and departments. These are organized into thematic groups based on
the areas covered by the PAF. Since November 2009, the CABS review process has
become more participatory as it now includes the civil society and members of
parliament.

95.      The program will be monitored and evaluated through the CABS review
cycle. As mentioned earlier, the CABS group undertakes two annual reviews, one during
February-March and another during August-September. Apart from looking at the annual
budget that will have just been approved by Parliament, the August-September review
also undertakes a preliminary assessment of the progress made and likelihood of meeting
the targets in the PAF. The February-March review then undertakes a comprehensive
assessment of performance against the targets, and the findings of the assessment provide
a basis for making disbursement decisions.

96.      The general M&E system has improved in recent years although weaknesses
remain. Monitoring and Evaluation of the MGDS is coordinated by the M&E Division in
the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development. An M&E master plan and road
map to its implementation were approved in 2005. Implementation of the road map is
being supported by a joint program of support with basket funding from the European
Commission, DFID, and UNDP. Under the program, M&E officers have been recruited,
trained and deployed in all the district assemblies of the country. This will improve
collection of data from the field for monitoring the MGDS. M&E divisions have also
been established in most line ministries, and economists will also be deployed in all line
ministries to be responsible for monitoring implementation of the MGDS in their
respective ministries. The main weakness remaining is that the indicators currently
identified for monitoring the implementation of the MGDS are not comprehensive
enough for the M&E system to provide data that could also be used for assessing the
indicators in the PAF. As such, data on some of the indicators still has to be collected on
an ad hoc basis. The CABS partners are working with the Government to address this
weakness.



                                            38
97.       Progress against PRSG targets is being monitored using two framework
matrices. The first is Table 4 which is used to monitor progress on the reform program
itself i.e. whether or not Government has met the prior actions for a particular operation
and how the reform program is evolving. The second is Annex 6 which is used for
monitoring progress against end-program outcomes. Annex 6 contains the monitoring
indicators, their baseline values, end-program targets, and progress in the intermediate
period.

                                 B. Fiduciary Aspects

98.   While weaknesses remain, overall, the team is satisfied that the public finance
management system in Malawi is satisfactory to support this operation.

Public Financial Management System

99.      Three Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments
have been conducted in recent years, in 2005, 2006, and 2008. The 2008 assessment
found that a number of improvements have been made since the 2006 assessment.
Selected areas where improvements have been made include transparency of inter-
governmental fiscal relations, oversight of fiscal risk from other public sector entities,
recording and management of cash balances, debt and guarantees, effectiveness of
internal audit, quality and timeliness of annual financial statements, and legislative
scrutiny of the annual budget law. The assessment reported that regardless of progress
being made, weaknesses remain in external auditing. particularly, timely submission of
audit reports to Parliament and follow-up, effectiveness of payroll controls, and public
access to key fiscal information.

100. Since the assessment was done, progress has been made in a number of
areas. First, as discussed in the section on progress under the PRSG-supported reform
program, Government has taken steps to clear the audit backlog and is on course to being
current soon. Second, again as reported earlier, since the assessment was done (in
February), the Government undertaken an HRMIS review and a payroll audit. The
government has also enhanced the Auditor General's independence through the change
that the Audit Report is presented directly to Parliament as opposed to going through the
Minister of Finance as was the case. Implementation of recommendations from these
exercises will help improve management of the payroll. Lastly, the Government is
planning to have a more organized and coordinated approach to improving PFM. In this
regard, a dedicated unit to coordinate implementation of the Public Finance and
Economic Management reform agenda has been created within the Ministry of Finance,
and is already operational. Further, with support from development partners, particularly
those that are providing budget support, the PFEM unit is now working on a road map for
developing a PFEM program that will be supported in a more coordinate manner. In the
interim, an existing PFEM action plan is being updated to take into account some key
findings from the 2008 PEFA.

101.   The 2004 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) found that in
2002, public procurement accounted for 16.2 per cent of GDP, that corruption in
procurement was widespread, capacity low and sanctions for corrupt practices were

                                            39
not effective. The Government has, in response, attempted to comprehensively address
these weaknesses. A new Public Procurement Act, based on international procurement
standards became operational in 2004 with the establishment of the Office of the Director
of Public Procurement (ODPP), headed by a Director and Deputy Director appointed by
the President and approved by the Public Appointments Committee of parliament. ODPP
has policy, standards and monitoring functions and does not directly procure. It has
supervisory oversight of a decentralized procurement system that since 2006 has been
receiving intensive support from the World Bank, UNDP and USAID. This includes
training, by December 2007, of almost 800 procurement staff of Internal Procurement
Committees (IPCs) and Specialized Procurement Units (SPUs) in ministries and
departments; establishment of an ODPP Management Information System and website;
developing the capacity within ODPP to undertake procurement audits; establishing
ministry, department and agency prior review procurement thresholds based on capacity
as assessed by ODPP; establishment of a referral system for mis-procurements identified
in the ODPP prior review and procurement monitoring processes to the Ministry of
Finance and the ACB for investigation; and, facilitation of the establishment of a
professional body for procurement personnel. Specifically for the Farm Input Subsidy
program, the Government has undertaken a review of the 2009/10 procurement and
identified key recommendations to be implemented. These recommendations include
strengthening evaluation and award criteria in the bidding documents, publication of
award in public media and a further review of the 2010/11 process in December 2010.
The Government has also put in place measures aimed at increasing the transparency of
the budget execution process through requiring all key ministries to prepare procurement
plans for 20 10/11 budget by August 3 1, 20 1 and to strengthen the publication of award
                                             0
of contracts in all key ministries for values above US$300,000 equivalent. While
challenges remain, there have been significant advances in moving the public
procurement system towards acceptable standards.

102. An IMF offsite assessment was conducted in July 2001 followed by update
assessments in July 2003 and November 2005 and January 2010. The 2010 Report is
not yet out. The 2005 update assessment concluded that the RBM had implemented
many recommendations of the 2003 safeguards assessment: (i) the external audit opinion
included a second signature from an office in a major financial center and the audit of the
2004 financial statements was completed within three months following the end of the
year; (ii) a task force had been appointed to review the implementation of International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and (iii) staff capacity in the Internal Audit
Department (IAD) had been strengthened. The IAD now verifies program data reported
to the IMF with the underlying accounting records. However, the assessment also
concluded that the role of the IAD in reviewing data reported to the IMF could be
enhanced by the IAD reviewing procedures associated with the data reporting process. In
addition, the positive environment is evidenced by unqualified independent auditor's
reports of the RBM financial statements for 2008 which is publicly available. The
independent auditor's reports comprised the balance sheet as at 31 December 2008 and
the income statement, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year
then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.




                                            40
                  C. Disbursement and Funds Flow Arrangements


103. Upon effectiveness of the financing agreement, expected in June 2010, a
single tranche of SDR 35.6 million (USD54 million equivalent) will be made
available to the Government of Malawi. The Grant will follow the Bank's
disbursement procedures for Development Policy Lending. In particular, the untied
balance of paymentshudget support will be disbursed against satisfactory
implementation of the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases
and no procurement requirements will be needed.

104. The proceeds of the Grant, at the request of the Government, will be
deposited by IDA into an account designated by the Recipient and which forms part
of the country's official foreign exchange reserves. The local currency equivalent of
the IDA Grant funds will be deposited in the Malawi Government Consolidated Account
(MG1 Account) at the RBM and will go towards financing the Government budget.
Through the Ministry of Finance, the Recipient will provide within 30 days of receiving
the Grant proceeds, a written confirmation to the IDA when the amount has been credited
to the Foreign Exchange Deposit Account and the Consolidated Account (MGl
Account). The Recipient will also ensure that all withdrawals from the Consolidated
Account (MG1 Account) are for budgeted public expenditures. The recipient will also
ensure that foreign exchange reserves generated from this Grant are not used for items on
IDA'S negative list. If the proceeds of the Grant are used for ineligible purposes as
defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Government, upon notice from
IDA, to promptly refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA.
Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request shall be cancelled.

105. The following arrangements support the requirements related to fiduciary
assurance:

       Foreign reserve account. The Government will acknowledge to IDA receipt of the
       money into the foreign reserve account and the crediting of the amount in local
       currency to the Consolidated Account. While no external audit will be required, it
       is expected that the confirmation of receipt will be countersigned by the
       authorized signatories, who are the Secretary to the Treasury and the Accountant
       General.

       Public (Government) accounts. The Auditor General is required by law to produce
       his annual report to Parliament on the public accounts within 6 months of the
       financial year-end. IDA will have access to these reports.

   0   Reserve Bank of Malawi. The annual entity financial statements of the Reserve
       Bank of Malawi, audited in accordance with international auditing standards as
       promulgated by the International Federation of Accountants, are publicly
       available.




                                           41
                               D. Poverty and Social Impact


w 106.    It is expected that the policy and institutional reforms being supported by
  the operation will contribute towards the reduction of poverty. This section focuses
  on those policies that have the potential to have the most significant positive as well as
  adverse effects, and what the authorities are planning to enhance the positive effects and
  mitigate the negative ones.

  107. Reforms being undertaken in ADMARC through the setting up of
  MAWTCO are intended to help reduce poverty among rural households. This is
  because the main aim of the. reforms is to ensure that ADMARC concentrates in areas
  which are currently not being served by the private sector. As shown by the PSIA
  undertaken in 2004, it is in the rural areas that ADMARC marketing activities are needed.
  It is possible, however, that some areas may end up having reduced or no access to
  marketing services as a result of mistakes in the rationalization process. As a mitigating
  measure, ADMARC?s monitoring and evaluation is being strengthened to minimize the
  possibility of areas which are neither served by ADMARC nor by the private sector.

  108.     The restructuring of ADMARC will inevitably lead to the retrenching of
  significant numbers of staff. Careful attention has been paid to determining a severance
  package for staff to be retrenched.

  109. The involvement of the private sector in the fertilizer subsidy program is
  also expected to have a beneficial impact on the poor. According to an evaluation
  study of the 2006/07 fertilizer subsidy program, the participation of the private sector in
  the sale of subsidized fertilizer improved availability of fertilizer in the rural areas.
  However, the same study also found that most private traders concentrated in areas which
  were more easily accessible, and that some traders were accepting subsidy vouchers in
  exchange for goods other than fertilizers and seeds. As outlined earlier, the Government
  will be developing an input market deve~lopmentstrategy and action plan in consultation
  with the private sector. It is expected that the strategy will among other things include
  incentives for encouraging private traders to increase their network of retail outlets.
  Further, it is expected that reforms in ADMARC will ultimately lead towards greater
  rationalization of ADMARC?s operations such that its operations will be more
  concentrated in outlying areas.

                                 E. Environmental Aspects
  110.     The program in general has no direct environmental impacts. In order to
  carefully assess environmental aspects of the PRSG program, the team carried out a
  formal environmental assessment in 2007 using the DPL toolkit. The assessment
  highlighted that the PRSG supported reforms in tobacco marketing could potentially put
  significant pressure on the environment. It identified measures that the Government was
  planning to put in place that could mitigate the potential negative effects, although
  challenges were also highlighted. However, as indicated earlier, the PRSG program is no
  longer supporting reforms in tobacco.


                                             42
111.    As part of the environmental assessment, the Bank also reviewed the
possible impact of PRSG-supported reforms in ADMARC and agricultural
marketing, increased fertilizer use, and improving the cost of doing business, but
found that the negative environmental impacts of these reforms is likely to be minimal.

                                F. Risks and Mitigation


112.      The program faces several risks. The first is the macroeconomic risk
emanating from recent events in the world economy. The second is a food security and
fiscal risk, emanating from unanticipated drought in some parts of the country. The third
is the risk of energy inadequacy; and the last one is implementation risk, given the
capacity constraints in Government.

1 13. Uncertainty in the international economic environment: Although fertilizer,
food, and fuel prices have recently been coming down, they are still higher than the
average in recent years, and have already put pressure on the fiscal and balance of
payments positions. Given that Malawi is currently implementing a large fertilizer
subsidy program and pursuing a managed exchange rate, the global economic slowdown
and the subsequent deterioration in terms of trade are likely to put further pressure on the
fiscal and external balances. This could worsen the environment for private sector
development, and hence undermine PRSG supported reforms that aim at improving the
functioning of agriculture markets through improved participation of the private sector in
input and output markets. Further, reduced earnings from commodity exports (tobacco, in
particular) could also further affect the already fragile reserve position, which could in
turn further constrain business production and investment. To mitigate the risk, the Bank
in conjunction with the IMF and other development partners, will be engaged in policy
dialogue with the authorities on how Malawi can deal with such risks.

114. Impact of drought on food security and fiscal position: The country's reliance
on rain-fed agriculture exposes it to drought-related food security and fiscal risks. Malawi
faces drought in some parts of the country, especially in southern Malawi. The impact of
a possible drought in 2010 on food availability has not been completely assessed,
although official estimates show that the country will still have an overall food surplus
this year. However, the need for food distribution program to the drought affected areas
may require more resources than envisioned in the budget, The Bank has been working
with government and relevant donors to ensure that, in the event of a severe drought,
mitigation tools, such as weather insurance, call option for grain imports, REP0 on
maize, etc., can be put into place in a timely and cost effective manner.

115. Energy shortfalls: Malawi is in the midst of an energy crisis that shows little
sign of abating without concerted and urgent action. In particular, lack of reliable
electricity is having a detrimental impact on the productive sectors. Episodes of power
blackouts and load-shedding have been identified as serious impediments to private
sector growth, and impede prospects of huge foreign investments. The favorable growth
outlook for 201 0 and beyond was partly anchored on Government making some



                                            43
1 16.    investments in the generation and distribution of electricity; including the
commissioning of the World Bank financed Malawi-Mozambique Interconnector Project
under the Southern Africa Power Pool. However, over four years after its initiation, the
Malawi Government has not yet signed the project. With no other alternative projects in
place, this could dampen the outlook on growth and the macroeconomic framework.

117. Policy fluctuation: The Government's priorities could shift away from the
reform program supported by PRSG and/or the stated policy stance may change during
implementation. This would lead to delays in implementation or abandonment of some
reforms. To mitigate this risk, the Bank is engaged in frequent dialogue with line
ministries to identify and address emerging concerns. The Bank also provides technical
assistance and policy advice to ensure that shifts or reversals in policy orientation happen
after due consideration of available options.

118. Implementation shortfall: The systemic problem of capacity constraints in
Government continues to be a risk to the program causing delays in the implementation
of some of the reforms. To mitigate this risk, the Bank will monitor implementation of
reforms and provide advisory support as needed through existing technical assistance
projects (public finance management, agriculture, and private sector development).
Furthermore, the team will work closely with other CABS donors in dealing with these
implementation risks.

 Dear Mr Zoellick,

                     MALAWI: LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY

1.      O n behalf of the Government of Malawi, I write to request for the third Poverty
        Reduction Support Grant (PRSG-111) of US854 million from the International
        Development Association (IDA) in support of a policy and institutional reform
        agenda whose framework has been provided for in the Malawi Growth and
        Development Strategy (MGDS), Malawi's second poverty reduction strategy
        paper.

2.      The proposed PRSG-I11 d support policy and institutional changes in the
        following areas: (i) agriculture market reforms, (3)private sector development; (iii)
        social protection and human development; and; (iv) economic governance. In
        agriculture the Government will continue with reforms focusing on the
        agriculture input and output markets. Under private sector development the
        Government d continue with reforms to further improve the business
        environment and enforcement of business contracts. Under social protection the
        Government will continue with reforms in the design, targeting, implementation
        and coordmation of social protection programs. Under economic governance the
        Government wdl focus on budgeting, accounting, audting and follow up of audit
        recommendations. In the budgeting process, the reforms wdl focus on improving
        linkages between MGDS and the budget. In external audt and scrutiny in the use
        of public resources the focus wl be on ensuring the A u d t reports are submitted
                                         il
        to Parliament within the specified period under the law and that

                                                  45
     recommendations made by Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee
     are followed and implemented. In Management of the public procurement
     system, emphasis will be put on strengthening the procurement systems in all
     ministries, departments and assemblies. More details on the proposed reforms to
     be supported under PRSG- I11 are set out in Part C of this letter.

     A. Recent Macroeconomic Performance

3.   Maintaining macroeconomic stability has been the cornerstone of the
     Government's economic policy and has contributed to the sustained h g h growth
     of our economy since 2004. For the first time in many years, Malawi completed a
     full 3-year IMF sponsored PRGF program without interruption. Since then,
     however, Malawi has been facing a number of significant exogenous shocks: (1)
     global fuel, food, and fertilizer price hikes in 2008; and (2) global demand
     reduction in 2009 which depressed the prices of Malawi's key exports. We also
     faced considerable fiscal pressures in the lead-up to the general elections in 2009.
     In order to address these challenges and restore macroeconomic balances, we
     requested a new 3-year macroeconomic program supported by the Extended
     Credit Facility, which the IMF Executive Board approved in February 201 0.

4.   The current macroeconomic program is anchored on fiscal consolidation,
     restoration of external balances, and exchange rate flexibility as well as price
     stability. A number of measures to address external imbalances include market
     liberalization, gradual depreciation of the exchange rate, and strengthened
     budgetary spendng controls. By returning to the path of gradual reduction of
     domestic debt, the program aims to create fiscal space for pursuing our poverty
     reduction agenda and promoting the growth of the private sector. Complemented
     by good weather and generous financial support from our development partners,
     the economy grew at 9.8 percent in 2008 and an estimated 7.6 percent in 2009.
     The average inflation for 2009 was 7.6 percent and projected to be in single digits
     in the medium term.


5. As a result of the low rates of inflation, government has been able to implement
     other policy initiatives, including the lowering of the Bank Rate from 35 percent
     in 2003 to 15 percent since 2007. Domestic debt that had accumulated to 25
     percent of GDP at the beginning of 2004 was reduced to 13.5 percent of G D P at
     the close of 2008/09 fiscal year and is forecasted to go down further to 9.8
     percent and 7.0 percent in the 2009/10 and 2010/11 financial years, respectively.

6.   The overall fiscal deficit, including grants, increased from 5.0 percent of GDP in
     2008 to 5.8 percent in 2009. The rise was to a large extent, explained by a rise in
     expendtures on fertilizers following the rise in international prices for fertilizers.
     The deficit is expected to fall to 0.8 percent of GDP in 2010. Malawi's external
     position has remained weak owing much to declining terms of trade and increased
                                             46
     demand for imports to support the growing economy. The ratio of the current
     account deficit to GDP worsened from -6.4 percent in 2008 to -8.6 percent in
     2009. As a result, usable gross official reserves, which stood at USg238.4 million
     (or 2 months of import cover) in 2008, went down to USg129.8 million,
     representing about 1 month of imports, in 2009.

     Our forecast for 2010 point to a 6.1 percent growth in real GDP whle inflation is
     projected at 8.5 percent. The slowdown in the expected real GDP growth in 2010
     is largely attributed to reduced agriculture output, mainly maize and tobacco
     because of lower tobacco auction prices in the 2008/09 growing season as well as
     some dry spells experienced in some parts of the country at the beginning of the
     growing season. Prices for our export commodties, includmg tobacco, cotton
     and tea, fell because buyers in the developed economies were financially
     constrained following the global financial and economic crisis that began in 2008,
     immediately after the food and oil price shocks. Some sectors like construction,
     dstribution and manufacturing are however, expected to register high growth
     rates. The decrease in production for some food crops, together with the impact
     of rising international oil prices observed lately, will likely exert pressure on
     domestic prices. Ths will pose a risk to our inflation forecast.

8.   The overall fiscal deficit in 2010 is projected at 0.8 percent of GDP while the
     current account balance, excluding official transfers, is projected at -18.7 percent
     of GDP, a slight improvement from -21.9 percent in 2009. Usable gross official
     reserves are estimated to increase to US3276.9 million in 2010, approximately 1.5
     months of imports on account of more donor inflows, higher tobacco auction
     prices and larger quantities of Uranium exported. In the medium term, growth in
     real GDP is expected to average 6.5 percent between 2010 and 2014. With a
     significant investment in irrigation, agriculture will continue to be the largest
     contributor of GDP, to be supported by the Green belt initiative. Agriculture's
     contribution to GDP will strongly be coupled by a growing mining sector as the
     Kayelekera Uranium mine reaches its full capacity and as other new mining sites
     open up, particularly in the northern part of Kasungu District. Increased
     production in the tourism and manufacturing sectors will also contribute to the
     growth in real GDP. The increase in agriculture output will also entail an increase
     in the agro processing and manufacturing activities resulting in job creation and
     export growth.

9.   Inflation is expected to continue trending downward and average 5.9 in 2014.
     Inflation will be kept in check, supported by increased food production through
     intensified agriculture, tight fiscal and monetary policies aimed at reducing
     aggregate demand and controlled broad money growth. Growth of exports of
     goods and non-factor services is expected to average 7.4 percent in the period
     2009-2014. This will mainly come from increased agricultural production as a
     result of the implementation of the greenbelt initiative and expansion in mining
     activities, particularly uranium mining. The production of cotton, sugar, tea and
                                            47
      other agro-processing activities are also expected to contribute to the growth in
      exports. Growth of imports of goods and non-factor services is expected to
      average 4.0 percent in the period 2009-2014.

10.   Domestic revenues are projected to increase steadily from 19.9 percent of GDP
      in 2008 to 23.6 percent by 2014, an average of 22.5 percent of GDP over these
      years. The share of Government expendture to GDP is however projected to
      remain virtually unchanged at around 32 percent of GDP between 2009 and 2014.
      Government's macroeconomic management will however, face a number of
      challenges, including the need for continued expenditure controls, intermittent
      power supply, erratic weather conditions and the need to reduce public debt
      arising mostly from non-performing state-owned enterprises.

11.   The Government, therefore, remains committed to sound macro-economic
      management and will continue with the current program of structural and public
      sector reforms. Beginning toward the end of 2009, a decision was taken to allow
      the kwacha to fluctuate withn a specified band against its major tradmg
      currencies to reflect the changing situation in the market. The decision has helped
      in addressing the weak balance of payments situation. Going forward continued
      policy adjustments, including further exchange rate adjustments, remain critical to
      sustaining our growth objectives.

      B. The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy
12.   In November 2006, the Government of Malawi finalized its second poverty
      reduction strategy, the MGDS, which covers the period 2006 to 2011. The
      strategy's overall objective has been to reduce poverty through economic growth
      and was organized around the following five thematic areas: (i)Sustainable
      Economic Growth; (ii) Social Protection and Disaster Risk Management;
      (iii)Social Development; (iv)Infrastructure Development; and (v)Good
      Governance. From these thematic areas, the strategy identified key focus areas
      that are seen as central to acheving the strategy's overall objective of reducing
      poverty through economic growth. These focus areas, which initially were six in
      number, have since 2009 been increased to nine and these are: (i)Agriculture and
      Food Security; (ii)The Greenbelt, Irrigation and Water Development;
      (iii)Education, Science and Technology; (iv)Transport Infrastructure and the
      Nsanje World Inland Port Development; (v)Climate Change, Natural Resources
      and Environmental Management; (vi)Integrated Rural Development; (vii)Public
      Health, Sanitation and HIV/AIDS Management; (viii)Youth Development and
      Empowerment; and (ix)Energy, hiining and Industrial Development.

13.   The MGDS emphasizes the need for Malawi to register sustained private sector
      and export-led growth in order to make a noticeable dent on poverty. The long-
      term vision of the MGDS is to transform Malawi from a predominantly
      importing and consuming country into a predominantly producing and exporting
                                            48
      countq and seeks to achieve growth rates of at least 6 percent a year. It
      concentrates on agriculture as the driver of growth by focusing on increasing
      agricultural productivity and integrating smallholder farmers into commercial
      activities. In the medium to long term, the Government has also identified four
      sectors with potential for high growth, including tourism, mining, manufacturing,
      and agro-processing.

14.   The hlGDS also acknowledges the role of social development in health,
      education, economic empowerment and social protection, among others. It
      recogruzes that a healthy and educated labor force is necessary if Malawi is to
      achieve sustainable economic growth. The strategy further recognizes the
      importance of increasing the assets of the poor and vulnerable so they can
      contribute to and benefit from economic growth.

15.   Since fiscal year 2006/07, we have undertaken annual reviews of the MGDS
      implementation and the associated Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)
      agreed with CABS partners. The last such review was held on March 16-18, 2010
      with broad-ranging participation of government ministries, the parliamentary
      committees on Budget and Public Accounts the civil society, development
      partners and the m e l a . The reviews have shown that overall, good progress is
      being made in implementing the MGDS, with the 2010 review confirming full or
      partial achievement of targets in 83 percent of PAF indicators. The most recent
      welfare monitoring survey suggests that poverty is likely to have fallen to 40
      percent in 2007/08, down from 52.4 percent in 2004/05.

      C. Specific Reforms to be implemented
16.   In line with the MGDS, and the Government in consultation with the
      International Development Association has outlined its proposed medium-term
      support to Malawi. In this contest, I would like to highlight the various reforms
      that the Government of Malawi intends to undertake not just for purposes of the
      proposed PRSG-I11 to which t h s financing request directly relates, but also under
      subsequent PRSCs so as to present a holistic picture of the Government's reform
      program.

      Agriculture market reforms
17.   The Government's main goal in agriculture is to increase agricultural productivity
      so as to ensure food security and sustainable agricultural growth and
      development. This is envisaged to be attained among others through increased
      food and cash crop production and agro-processing. To achieve these goals the
      Government has identified three areas of focus in acheving sustainable
      agricultural growth and development. The areas comprise food security and risk
      management; commercial agriculture, agri-business and market development;
      sustainable agricultural land and water management. These d l be underpinned by

                                            49
      two support services of research, technology and dissemination; and institutional
      development and capacity budding. Specifically under this policy reform program,
      the Government will focus on the improvements of agriculture output and input
      markets in order to bring in more private sector participation. The focus of the
      reform is as outhned below.

      O u tp u t markets
18.   In output markets, Government's efforts will continue to focus on ensuring that
      deficit households have access to food at affordable retail prices, ensuring that
      farmers have access to markets a t fair and remunerative producer's prices and
      reducing extremes in maize price variations. In t h s regard the Government will
      continue with measures that will ensure that the private sector, farmers and civil
      society organisations have access to extensive, reliable and accurate agricultural
      commodq market information and data. Better market intelligence will help
      farmers to improve their production and marketing decisions.. We also believe
      the private sector has a critical role to play in development of the agriculture
      output markets. Therefore the main policy thrust wdl be to encourage greater
      participation of the private sector in the output markets. Increased private sector
      investment in trading will improve availability of markets. Further, we believe that
      increased competition amongst private traders should result in better prices for
      farmers and lower consumer prices for food deficit households.

19.   In 2008 the Government established the Malawi Agriculture and Warehouse and
      Trading Company (MAWTCO) using the six excess warehouses that belonged to
      ADMARC. To date, the Government has appointed a Board of Directors for
      MAWTCO and is a t an advanced stage of recruiting an Executive Director of the
      company. Meanwhile the Government is moving towards the completion and
      implementation of the operational strategy for commodity risk management. T o
      date the Government has set up a Commod~tyf i s k Management section in its
      Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security. The focal areas of the strategy ulll be
      on issues of weather insurance, price hedging and warehouse receipts. With the
      support of its development partners the Government has implemented one
      commodity risk managing strategy in form of a weather derivative.

      Input Markets
20. Agricultural production in Malawi is rainfall dependent. Due to changes in
      weather, agricultural production fluctuates between surpluses and deficits. Deficits
      have arisen mainly due to droughts. Low production in drought periods is made
      worse due to farmers' low access to improved inputs. O n the other hand,
      surpluses have been acheved due to government intervention in supply of
      agricultural input especially fertilizer and seed, and also due to good weather.
      Considering that Malawi faces acute shortage of land, increased use of modern
      inputs wdl remain a key strategy to improving agricultural productivity. At the
      same time, most Malawian farmers are poor and rely on smallholder farming. It is
                                            50
      in t h s regard that the Government introduced the Farm Input Subsidy Program.
      Specifically, the program aims at increasing the smallholder farmer access to
      improved farm inputs and adoption of improved technologies in maize
      production systems. Natural dsasters, h g h input prices due to high transport
      costs, h g h levels of poverty and low output prices among other factors often
      times h t the smallholder farmer's capacity to access inputs for increasing
      production.

21.   In order to address some of the weaknesses that were identified in the
      implementation of the 2008/09 Farm Input Subsidy Program the Government is
      further improving the functioning of agricultural markets by involving the private
      sector in distribution of inputs. The private sector has been involved in the
      redemption of subsidy vouchers for maize and legume seed. For example in the
      2009/10 agriculture year 975.5 metric tons of legume seed were distributed
      through the private sector. Henceforth, the private retailers will also be involved
      in the redemption of fertilizer subsidy vouchers. Whilst the government
      encourages the involvement of the private sector it also realizes that there is need
      to find a lasting solution to minimize unscrupulous behavior of some private
      traders. The Government is also finalizing its medmm term plan (2011-2016) for
      the Farm Input Subsidy Program. The plan will guide the mobilization of
      resources as well as its implementation, and its coordination. Continuing efforts
      will be made to improve the targeting of benefits derived from the input subsidy
      programme to poorer smallholder households. The Government is aware of the
      difficulty of ensuring adequate targeting of the program benefits in order to
      ensure that the poor and most vulnerable households are not left out. The
      Government would therefore appreciate the Bank's assistance in this area.

      Private Sector development reforms
22.   The Government is committed to implementing reforms that will improve the
      business environment and promote private sector in the country. The Malawi
      Growth and Development Strategy, Malawi Country Economic Memorandum
      (CEM), and the Doing Business Report of the Bank have identified supply side
      constraints such as energy, lengthy business processes and weak infrastructure as
      some of the constraints to private sector development. In the quest to improve
      the business environment the Government is carrying out various reforms.
      Unreliable power supply has been one single biggest challenge facing the private
      sector development. T o address this constraint the Government has embarked on
      a rehabilitation program for all power stations in the country. T h s commitment
      by Government is evidenced by increased budgetary appropriations for the energy
      sector. At the same time the Government has embarked on a program to develop
      new hydropower stations away from the Shire fiver. Ths will increase reliability
      as well as minimize the risk in case of drought. The Government is working with
      private sector companies under a public private partnershp so as to develop new
      hydro energy sources in the country. With the support of our development
                                             51
      partners the Government has started on a program to minimize energy losses as
      well as increase its efficiency through the introduction of energy saving
      technologies. There is recognition that long term supply of reliable power is still
      an issue and Government is looking into more long term alternative solutions to
      the matter. Apart from addressing energy challenges the Government is further
      improving the water supply for industrial development as well as improving the
      national and regional road infrastructure.

23.   The Government has also made good progress in order to improve the business
      environment in the country. Government is in the process of reviewing 40
      economic laws that were identified to have an effect on the ease of doing business
      in Malawi. Among these laws, the Businesses Licensing Bill seeks to introduce
      single business licensing and aims at reducing the number of days it takes to
      register a business. The Companies Act will be revised to take into account
      international best practices. Good progress has been registered in implementing
      reforms aimed at increasing investor confidence by making it easier and cheaper
      to wind-up a business. The ability to efficiently wind-up a business is an important
      consideration for investors. New regulations under the Companies Act covering
      liquidator's fees were issued in May 2009 .These limited liquidator fees during
      insolvency procedures have reduced the cost (as a percentage of the estate) from
      30% to 25%. At the same time the Government is coming up with the National
      Investment Policy which will contain measures that wlll encourage foreign as well
      as local private sector investment.

24.   Following the establishment of the Commercial Division of the High Court in
      January 2007 the process of accessing commercial justice has improved
      significantly. The Government has also made good progress in putting in place a
      framework for transferring backlog cases meeting the' Commercial Court
      threshold from the General Division to the Commercial Division of the High
      Court. The results of the 2009 case audit revealed that 373 cases were eligible for
      transfer to the Commercial Division. Out of these, 83 cases have been
      transferred. The Government is currently strengthening the capacity of the
      Commercial Court through training and recruiting of additional staff. Through
      the University of Malawi the Government in collaboration with the private sector
      has mounted graduate course in commercial law.
25.   There are on-going efforts to streamline processes for trading across borders,
      issuance of construction permits and improving access to credit. Government is
      working on streamlining the number of documents required for exporting and
      importing in line with best practices. Plans are also underway to operationalize a
      single window for cross-border trade transactions at the major borders. The
      passing of the bill on credit reference in January 2010 has created a conducive
      legal framework for the introduction of credt referencing in Malawi and tlm
      should result in better risk assessment by lenders and increased access to credit by
      borrowers.
                                            52
      Social Protection and human development
26.   Social protection remains one of the priority areas of the Government. The
      Government is aware of the challenges it is facing to meet the hfillennium
      Development Goals. Most of the people in the country are poor and are
      vulnerable to various shocks including illness and deaths. The Government has
      therefore prioritised social protection in its growth and development strategy. The
      Government together with development partners and nongovernmental
      organisations has been implementing various types of social support programmes
      to address the various risks affecting the vulnerable groups. These programs have
      included input subsidy programme, cash transfer program, public works
      programme and school feedmg program. The Government will build on the
      success of these initiatives to roll out these programmes to reach more people.
      Already the Government has published guidelines for the input subsidy
      programme to improve the targeting of the beneficiaries who are most vulnerable.

27.   Improving quality and access to education is one of the Government objectives in
      the education sector. Since the introduction of free. primary education in 1994, the
      education system has struggled to cope with the enrolment explosion that
      followed. The excess number of pupils placed a strain on existing infrastructure,
      provision of teaching and learning materials and qualified teachers in the system.
      The outcome has been deteriorating quality of primary education, with the
      challenge being even greater in rural schools where work stations are less
      attractive for qualified teachers compared to urban schools. Government's short
      term strategy to improve the quality of primary education, particularly in rural
      areas, is to increase the annual deployment of qualified primary school teachers to
      rural areas. The Government is currently expandmg primary teacher training
      facilities in order to increase the number of teachers being deployed. To meet this
      goal government is building more Teacher Training Colleges.

28.   The Government continues to make good progress in the fight against under-five
      mortality, maternal mortality, strengthening staff capacity in the health sector and
      in reducing the transmission of HIV and AIDS from mothers to children. For
      example in the previous years the national proportion of one-year olds immunized
      against measles reached 88%, exceeding last year's proportion by 4%, and
      surpassing the set target by 6%. Good progress was recorded in the fight against
      maternal mortality. Compared to the previous year, more pregnant mothers in
      Malawi were attended to by skilled birth attendants in 2009, with the proportion
      rising from 45% in 2008 to 52% in 2009, exceedmg the target by 4%. Good
      progress was registered in improving the quality of health services in Malawi
      through increase in the number of qualified nurses. X total of 5030 nurses were in
      the health system during the period July 2008 to June 2009. Strong progress was
      made in the fight to reduce transmission of HIV and AIDS from mothers to
      chldren. h total of 544 health facilities that provide ante natal care (ANC)
                                             53
      services were targeted in the Prevention of Mother to Chtld Transmission
      (PMTCT) of HIV/AIDS Services Scale-up Plan in Malawi. A11 544 facilities were
      equipped with a minimum package of PMTCT services, representing 100/o
      coverage of health facilities providing ANC services. Furthermore, 66% of HIV
      positive pregnant women received the complete course of ARV prophylaxis to
      reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV, exceedmg the target by 31Yo.

      Public sector, economic and finance management reforms

29.   In order to consolidate the gains achieved in restoring macroeconomic stability,
      the Government plans to undertake several policy reforms in the area of budget
      process, payroll management, external audting, debt and aid management, and
      Public Finance and Economic Management.

      Budget processes
30.   With regard to the budget process, the reforms seek to set a foundation for
      improved linkages between the budget and the MGDS. The Government has
      continued to put in place reforms in order to meet the internationally recognized
      classification of the Government Financial Statistics (GFS). The adoption of the
      new classification brings our budget closer into line with international standards
      making it easier to compare budgets across countries. The Government has also
      changed its budget structure so as to more accurately reflect and monitor its
      strategic objectives as ouhned in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy.
      The revised budget structure makes it easier for users of the budget documents to
      clearly understand what various sectors are delivering on. To reflect these
      changes, the Government has introduced a new Chart of Accounts. Going
      forward the Government d 1 build on these successful reforms to further
      improve the budgeting process. First, the government will be ensuring that the
      2010/11 budget implements the new Chart of Accounts, the revised functional
      classification and revised economic classification. Secondly, the government will
      continue to pursue reforms to improve its output targeting and performance
      management regime, inclulng liaising with the IMF on possible steps towards
      full programme budgeting in the medmm term. Thirdly, there are on-going
      projects to review and potentially amend the legal basis of the budget through a
      new budget law and revised Appropriation Bill.

      External audit and scrutiny in the use ofpublic resources
31.   An evaluation of how well the budget has been executed is a critical element of
      sound public financial management. In thts connection, the Malawi Public Audit
      Act provides for internal audting, external auditing and Parliamentary scrutiny of
      the audit reports. Although some progress has been made in the area of internal
      and external auditing, there are still some challenges in terms quality, coverage and
      timeliness of the audits. Firstly, due to h t e d human capacity, not all ministries

                                             54
      and departments are audted in a year. Secondly, there are weak follow up on audit
      recommendations made by the Auditor General and the Public Accounts
      Committee of Parliament.

32.    In order to deal with these problems, the government has put in place several
       measures. Firstly, the capacity of National Au&t Office has been strengthened by
       the recruitment of staff. This means that more ministries will now be audited than
       in the past. T h s percentage is expected to increase further in the next few years.
       Secondly, the roll out of IFMIS to Local Assemblies will go a long way to
       ensuring the timeliness of the final accounts. In order to increase a u d t coverage
       of the Local Assemblies the Government with the support of DFID engaged
       private auditors who are currently finalizing their reports. In the medium term,
       the aim is to be able to submit the reports withn 6 months as required by law.
       Finally, the government plans to improve follow up of recommendations in the
       audit reports. In t h s regard, the government will start producing reports
       indicating actions taken by ministries and departments on audit related
       recommendations by the Public Accounts Committee through issuance of
       Treasury hlinutes. The Government is aware of the backlog of Treasury Minutes
       which were mainly due to the absence of the Auchtor General and infrequent
       meetings Public Accounts Committee (PAC) due to little fundmg. Since the
       appointment of the Auditor General a backlog of au&t reports has been cleared.
      ?With increased fundng to Parliament, PAC is able to meet more regularly to
       scrutinize the audit report. The Government is currently finalizing the Treasury
       Minute of the 2003/04 financial year. The Government will step up its efforts to
       work on more recent Treasury Minutes and make necessary follow ups with
       controlling officers who have been identified to have issues.

      Management of public procurement systems

33.   Although there has been progress in the area of public procurement management,
      through enactment of appropriate law and publication of regulations and standard
      bidding documents, weaknesses exist in institutional set up and compliance to the
      law and regulations by procuring entities. The Government has now established
      procurement units in all ministries and departments. Recruitment of staff is
      underway to fill key positions in the procurement units starting with top ten
      spending ministries in the 2010/11 fiscal year. The major challenge in this
      endeavor has been the shortage of qualified personnel on the labour market.
      However, the Government in collaboration with various public training
      institutions like the Malawi Institute of Management, the University of Malawi,
      and the Staff Development Institute, has mounted various long-term training
      courses to train various cadres of procurement specialists. Some of the graduates
      from these institutions are already being absorbed by the Government. To
      improve the transparency and timeliness of budget execution through
      procurement activities, Government started enforcing procurement planning as
      part of the budgeting process in five key ministries and will expand t h s
                                             55
      requirement to top ten high spending Ministries and Departments in 2010/11.
      The Government will continue with strengthening compliance monitoring
      through prior review of large value procurement, procurement audlts and post
      procurement reviews. Follow up actions will also be enforced through Audit
      Committees established in all hfinistries and Department. Finally the Government
      will enforce publication of tender results for all contracts above MK45 million in
      order to strengthen transparency in the procurement process.

34.   With regard to the recommendations and findings of the Joint Procurement
      Review of the 2009/10 input subsidy programme, the Government is putting in
      place measures to strengthen the process for procuring inputs. The Government
      is reviewing the 2010/11 Farm Input Subsidy Program procurement process as
      well as the bidding documents for 2010/11 Input Subsidy Programme (ISP)
      procurement to strengthen evaluation and qualification criteria.

      Payroll management

35.   The Government will continue with reforms in the area of payroll management.
      Satisfactory progress has been made in implementing the recommended actions
      from the 2008 HRMIS review and personnel audlt. The Human Resource
      Management Information System (HRMIS), which Government introduced in
      2006 to manage personnel and payroll records, underwent review in 2008 to
      assess its integrity. The HRMIS review found that the system is generally credble
      but that certain actions needed to be undertaken to ensure that it is efficient,
      effective, and secure in the management of the payroll. Concurrently, an audlt of
      the entire civil service database was carried out in the same year. The personnel
      audit verified genuine employees but also found that around 700 employees were
      on the payroll but could not be physically verified.
36.   Subsequently, an action plan for addressing weaknesses identified in the review
      and personnel audlt was developed. One of the recommended actions to be
      undertaken involved production of au&t trail reports on a regular basis. In 2009,
      the Department for Human Resource Management and Development (DHRMD)
      produced five trail reports. These reports help to monitor the validlty of data in
      the system since they show the final data on the payroll, where it originated, and
      who was involved during the process of introducing a person on the payroll.
      DHRMD is' currently working on the production of a report detailing how
      individuals who were involved in the introduction of non-existent persons on the
      payroll were traced and brought before the law. An interface between HRMIS and
      the public expenditure management system, IFMIS was also recommended. T h s
      is aimed a t ensuring any changes to the payroll are instantaneously reflected in
      expenditures on wages and salaries in the affected ministries and departments.
      Good progress is being made and it is being envisaged that the interface will be
      concluded as soon as possible.

      Debt and Aid management
                                            56
37.   hlalawi's external debt indicators have improved significantly after receiving debt
      relief under the .Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and the hfululateral
      Debt Relief Initiative PlDRI) in 2006. (According to a recent Debt Sustainabhty
      Analysis (DSA) conducted by Government, the ratio of the present value of
      external debt to exports is projected at 60% in 2009, w h c h is below the
      sustainability threshold of 150% for medium policy performers under the World
      Bank CPIA. All the other debt inhcators are projected to remain below the
      respective thresholds over the period 2009-2029 under the baseline
      macroeconomic scenario. However, stress tests show that hlalawi's external debt
      is subject to moderate risks of debt &stress, particularly arising from lower GDP
      and export growth. In addition, the overall fiscal sustainability of the public debt
      is still fragile mainly due to the h g h domestic debt burden. Domestic debt is
      unsustainable due to its short term nature which requires frequent roll-over and
      will require sipficant resources to redeem it.

38.   Dealing with the debt problem will require more than exercising fiscal dscipline:
      systems of debt management would also need to be improved. In order to
      improve the management of public debt, the Government is planning to
      implement a multi-year debt management reform program. First, it has conducted
      a comprehensive and systematic debt management performance assessment with
      technical assistance from the World Bank in September 2009. This exercise has
      provided a systematic assessment of strengths and weaknesses of Malawi's debt
      management system, and identified possible areas for improvement. Secondly, the
      Government will strengthen the implementation and monitoring of its debt
      management policy with special regard to contracting both domestic as well as
      external debt. The Government has already operationalized the Debt
      hlanagement Committee which plays a key policy advisory role.

39.   The Government is continuously strengthening the staffing levels and capacity in
      the Debt and Aid Division (DAD) of the Ministry of Finance PIOF), and has
      established mechanisms to improve the coordmation between the Reserve Bank
      of Malawi and the Ministry of Finance. The expectation is that the hlOF will
      among other things work with the Reserve Bank of Malanl in determining and
      forecasting liquidq needs of the government when decidmg how much to
      borrow on the domestic market. The MOF, through the DAD, wdl also analyze
      the costs and risks associated with different financing options and therefore
      advise the Government on least-cost financing options. Finally, the DAD will be
      preparing debt management reports for submission to Parliament.

      Public Financial and Economic Management Reforms

40. Finally, the Government realizes the iinportance of having robust Public Finance
      and Economic Management OFEM) systems in place. In t h s regard the
      Government has set a specialized unit whch will champion and coordinate
                                       57
various PFEM reforms within the public sector. The capacity of the PFEM unit is
being enhanced through training and appointment of additional staff. In adltion
the Government has set up a Public Financial and Economic Management
Technical Team to provide support to the PFEM unit. To date the Government
has come up with a prioritized action plan covering seven major areas as follows:
(i) planning, (ii) resourcing the national development strategies, (iii) budgeting, (iv)
budget execution, (v) accounting and financial systems, (vi) reporting, (vi) PFEM
administration and programmes. The Government is confident that
implementation of the action plan wdl improve and bring our systems in line with
international best practices.

I am confident that the outhned policies, programs and reforms d l create a
conducive environment for the effective and efficient utilization of any assistance
the International Development Association may provide, towards enabling the
government to implement its poverty reduction goals set in the MGDS.

                                 Yours sincerely,

              I M F Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Malawi
                               Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 10/38
                                            March 16,2010

On February 19, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Malawi.1
Background
Malawi stands at a critical juncture following its recent progress on macroeconomic stability. The 2009
Article IV consultation discussions and Extended Credit Facility program negotiations focused on the
design of a medium-term program to restore Malawi's external equilibrium while sustaining a high rate of
growth and poverty reduction, in line with Malawi's poverty reduction and growth strategy.
Malawi's macroeconomic performance has improved significantly over the past two years and the
country's agricultural-based economy has weathered the global economic storm relatively well. Good
weather and the distribution of subsidized fertilizer have contributed to robust growth and moderate
inflation in recent years. After reaching 9.8 percent in 2008, real GDP growth is estimated at 7.6 percent in
2009 buoyed by an increase in agricultural production and the expansion of the service sector. Inflation has
remained moderate. After rising in late 2008, in response to food and fuel price shocks, consumer price
inflation decreased steadily to 7.5 percent in the 12 months to October 2009.
Fiscal policy loosened significantly in the run-up to the 2009 presidential and parliamentary elections.
Sizeable budget overruns on fertilizer and goods and services spending during fiscal year 2008/09,
combined with a modest shortfall in foreign financing, led to a high level of domestic borrowing and meant
that the central government deficit was well above the budget. The fiscal year 2009/10 budget is a return to
a prudent fiscal stance and the preliminary results on the execution through the first half of the fiscal year to
December 2009 are in line with the budget, adjusted for delays in donor support.
A weak balance of payments threatens exchange rate and price stability and medium-term growth. The de
facto pegging of the Malawi kwacha to the U.S. dollar from 2006 to late 2009 contributed to the
moderation of inflation. However, persistent inflation differentials with trade partners and the de facto peg
led to some appreciation of Malawi's real effective exchange rate in recent years. The combination of rapid
growth of domestic incomes in the non-tradable sectors and the exchange rate appreciation have led to an
imbalance between the growth of imports and exports and widened the deficits in the external current
account and balance of payments.
Malawi's medium-term outlook is favorable, within the context of successful implementation of the ECF-
supported program (see Press Release No. 10/52). Growth is expected to remain buoyant, but moderate
somewhat relative to the high growth of the recent past. Over the medium term, growth is expected to be
supported by the expansion of productive capacity at the Kayelekera uranium mine and the exploitation of
niobium (a niche mineral for steelmaking), as well as the development of the sugar sector. Inflation is
expected to remain moderate. Although the depreciation of the exchange rate could exert pressure on
prices, the solid maize harvest, stable fuel prices, and restrained fiscal and monetary policies should contain
inflationary pressures. International reserves should rise as a result of a substantial expected inflow of
donor assistance; seasonal inflows, once the new harvest season begins; and a reduction of import growth
followed by some greater export growth, as exchange rate adjustments and liberalization of the foreign
exchange market bring about a market-based price that can be supported without foreign exchange
rationing.
There are several key downside risks to the economic outlook including foreign exchange shortages,
uncertainties in the external environment, and changes in the international environment for tobacco
consumption. Delays in relieving the foreign exchange shortage could threaten growth, fiscal revenues and
investor confidence. A slower global recovery could dampen export demand, investor interest, remittances,
and access to foreign capital, and thereby impair growth and the balance of payments. The medium-term
prospects for burley tobacco, the largest export commodity, are uncertain.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that the Malawian economy has proven resilient during the global economic
crisis by sustaining high growth and moderate inflation. The financial sector remains well-capitalized and
                                                       59
sound; Malawi's food security was enhanced through increased agricultural output; and progress was made
towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. At the same time, Directors noted that
Malawi's external position remains weak and that official reserves have fallen to well below prudential
levels, and they regretted last year's policy slippages. Directors therefore called on the authorities to seize
the opportunity of their renewed program engagement with the Fund to restore internal and external
equilibrium and address key structural constraints, while supporting strong growth and poverty reduction.
Directors welcomed the adoption of a more prudent fiscal stance in the 2009/10 budget following last
year's slippages, which partly reflected the impact of high fertilizer prices. They stressed the importance of
adhering to the deficit target by containing nonpriority spending. Directors supported the steps to minimize
the budgetary impact of deficits in,key parastatals by announcing tariff adjustments to enhance cost
recovery, and beginning to devise a plan for dealing with Air Malawi's debt. They also welcomed the more
transparent accounting of the fertilizer subsidy program, recent improvements in fiscal accounting and
reporting, and measures to ensure that budgetary targets on priority social spending are met. Directors
encouraged the authorities to make the Public Financial and Economic Management unit in the Ministry of
Finance fully operational, and looked forward to further steps to strengthen public spending management
and develop a strong debt management policy. They supported the ongoing efforts to improve tax
administration and broaden the tax base.
Directors welcomed the tightening of monetary policy and encouraged the Malawian authorities to control
the growth of monetary aggregates by ensuring fiscal discipline and prudent credit expansion. They
encouraged the development of financial markets over the medium term, which would allow greater
reliance on interest rate adjustments to help control inflation.
Directors endorsed the authorities' objectives to build international reserves, achieve a properly valued
exchange rate, and liberalize the foreign exchange market. They saw the reversion of the foreign exchange
surrender requirement and the gradual depreciation of the nominal exchange rate as encouraging steps, and
looked forward to Malawi's full adherence to Article VI11 obligations by end-20 11. Directors welcomed the
authorities' commitment to undertake further policy adjustments, including of the exchange rate, should
continued evidence emerge of excess demand for foreign exchange. They noted the importance of
exchange rate flexibility to avoid an overly contractionary fiscal and monetary stance.
Directors commended the authorities for recent progress in strengthening financial regulation and
supervision. They welcomed the recent passage of the amendments to the Banking and Insurance Acts.
Directors looked forward to cabinet approval and implementation of the Financial Sector Development
Strategy, designed to enhance financial inclusiveness, deepening, and competitiveness.
Directors encouraged the authorities to create an enabling environment for private investment and growth
by developing a comprehensive strategy for reforming the utility companies and expanding access to utility
services. They also advised the adoption of market-friendly agricultural sector policies. Close cooperation
with Malawi's development partners will be important to help build capacity in these areas.
