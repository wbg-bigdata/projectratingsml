INDONESIA
CENTRAL AND WEST JAVA PROVINCIAL IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                     Republic of Indonesia
Amount:                       US$166 million equivalent
Terms:                        RepayabLe in 20 years, including 5 years of
grace, at the standard variable rate.
Project Description:          The proposed project would strengthen the irriga-
tion services of Central and West Java Provinces
particuLarly in project preparation, implementa-
tion, and operation and maintenance (O&N, and
improve cost recovery by provision of O&M funding
for the irrigation systems through increased land
taxes. The project would cover the Government of
Indonesia's (GOI) six-year rehabilitation and
construction program for small- and mediumrscale
irrigation schemes in Central and West Java. The
project includes: (a) rehabilitation of 60,000
ha of existing systems and construction of 74,300
ha of small- and medium-scale schemes; (b) prep-
aration of detailed designs for the rehabilita-
tion of existing systems (45,000 ha), development
of small- and medium-scale systems (45,000 ha)
and upgrading existing systems to be used as
pilot training areas for the field staff
(50,000 ha); (c) construction of a new run-of-
the-river diversion scheme (11,300 ha) in the
Dumpil area of Central Java; (d) surveys for
updating land classification and assessmei-t for
tax purposes to improve cost recovery; and
(e) consultancy services for on-the-job training,
project coordination, construction supervision
and studies for future projects.
Although Indonesia is now largely self-sufficient
in rice, steady increases in national rice con-
sumption and the limited scope for expanding the
irrigated area on Java make it vital for the
country to intensify food production by rehabili-
tating systems where required and by expanding
existing village irrigation schemes. At full
project development, an incremental quantity of
about 347,000 tons of paddy, about 11,000 tons of



- vi -
maize and 15,000 tons of groundnuts would be
produced annually. The increased production
would have a substantial impact on raising the
incomes of about 530,000 rural families, the
majority of whom are smalLholders and laborers.
An equivalent of 45,000 full-time farm jobs would
be created in an area where 45Z of the popuLation
has incomes below the absolute poverty line,
about one fourth of the farm households are
landless, and unemployment is high.
Risks associated with the project include a
possibLe failure to recruit adequate staff,
inadequate provision of O&M funds, and delays in
engaging consultants. These risks have been
addressed in the project design by identifying
staff from completed Bank-assisted projects who
would soon be available to work on the proposed
project, appointment of consultants as a condi-
tion of loan effectiveness, and GOI agreement
that a part of the incremental land tax funds
generated through reclassification and
reassessment of the land tax on irrigated land
inuld be allocated directly to the Provincial
Irrigation Services for O&K purposes.

r. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has requested Bank and European
Economic Community (EEC) assistance for a program of irrigation development in
the provinces of Central and West Java to (a) strengthen the Provincial
Irrigation Services; (b) finance a six-year "time slice" of the provincial
design and construction programs for the rehabilitation of existing systems
and development of new small- and medium-scale systems covering an area of
about 135,000 ha; (c) construction of a new run-of-the-river scheme on the
Lusi River in Central Java; and (d) technical assistance for training, project
management and supervision of construction, studies and detailed designs for
proposed projects Located in Central Java and North Sulawesi. This project
would be the third provincial irrigation development project. East Java
Province is being supported through the Irrigation XVII Project (Ln. 2119-
IND), and eight other island provinces in Sumatra and Sulawesi through the
Second Provincial Irrigation Development Project (Ln. 2375-IND). The major
project objectives are: (a) to improve the capacity and efficiency of the
provinces to design and construct small- and medium-scale irrigation systems,
thus allowing the Directorate General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD)
to focus on major irrigation works and multipurpose water use development; and
(b) to improve cost recovery through a gradual increase in the land tax
(IPEDA) and allocation of the additional amounts collected for operation and
maintenance of the irrigation systems.
The Agriculture and Rural Sector
1.02      GOI's major objectives for the agricultural and rural sector are
to: (a) create productive employment to raise incomes of the rural poor;
(b) increase domestic food supply, especially rice, to keep pace with rising
demand; (C) expand agricultural exports, particularly of smallholder tree
crops; and Cd) ensure productive and sustainable use of Indonesia's land,
water and naturaL resources. Food crop production forms 602 of the agricul-
tural CDP and 18% of the total CDP, with rice being the most important food
crop. Since 1968, rice production has grown substantially in response to
government interventions, including expansion of the irrigation networks,
major changes in rice growing technology and price incentives. While produc-
tion gains of other major food crops (maize, cassava, soybeans, peanuts, and
sweet potatoes) were not so impressive as those for rice, they have exceeded
population growth.
1.03      GOI's policies in food crop production, combined with expansion of
the infrastructure investment program and the strong linkages as well as
multiplier effects between agricultural incomes and other rural industries,
have had a substantial impact on increasing incomes and levels of living in a
large portion of the rural areas. They have also resulted in some reduction
in the incidence of rural poverty, even though this still remains a major
problem facing GOI. Increases in income have not been uniformly spread,
especially to dry land subsistence farmers.



1.04      The Bank, in cooperation with OI, has undertaken a series of sector
studies related to food crop production, the most recent of which are PoLicy
Options and Strategies for Major Food Crops (October 1982, Report 3686-IND)
and the Irrigation Sector Review: An Issues Paper (October 1982; updated in
May 1984) which reviewed the irrigation work program and budget included in
the GOI Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (Repelita IV) for the period
1984-89.
The Irrigation Subsector
1.05      Irrigation and Rice Production.  During 1970-83, rice production
grew from 13.1 million tons to 23.3 million tons. Production increased at
about 4.9Z per year during 1970-80, but slowed to 2.2X per year from 1981 to
1983 mainly due to droughts. A major part of the increase (75Z) is attribu-
table to yield improvements and the remaining 25Z to increases in the area
harvested. About 162 of the production growth can be attributed solely to
expansion and improvement in irrigation, about 9X to improved rice varieties
and fertil'er use, and about 75Z to the joint interaction of those
variables.-/
1.06      Rice consumption increased steadily at 4.5Z per year between 1970-
81, 2.3Z of which was due to population increases and 2.22 to income, price
and other effects. In 1980 and 1981, Indonesia became largely self-sufficient
in rice, and rice imports plunged from 2.0 million tons in 1980 to 0.3 million
tons in 1981. Successive droughts reduced production in 1982 and 1983 forcing
Government to import some 1.3 million tons of rice in 1983 and 0.3 tons in
1984. The 1984 crop was about 25.5 million tons, and buffer stocks have
increased once again to 3 million tons. It is expected that for most "average
rainfall" years, rice production will meet demand, provided the planned rate
of irrigation development is maintained.
1.07      In future, improved rice varieties and fertilizer use are likely to
play a lesser role in increasing Indonesia's rice production. The use of High
Yielding Varieties (HYVs) is already high (about 802 of the irrigated and wet-
land crop) and is unlikely to expand beyond 90X by 1990. Several traditional
varieties are preferred for taste and ceremonial reasons, and are better adap-
ted to difficult growing conditions such as saline, flooded or water-short
areas. Fertilizer use is also high, particularly on Java, where about 135 kg
of nitrogen and 50 kg of phosphate per hectare are now applied. There is
evidence that nitrogen application above this would be wasted and cause crop
losses due to lodging and greater insect damage. With such already high fer-
tilizer and HYV use, future yield increases will depend primarily on improving
the quality of irrigation and water management and expanding irrigation to
existing dryland areas.

highlights the need for increased emphasis on water resources management and
appropriate allocation of supplies. DCWRD is reviewing, with Japanese
Government assistance, aspects of this issue in the Brantas Basin.  Similar
studies in other parts of Java are needed.
1.09      GOI's irrigation sector investments include irrigation works to
sustain self-sufficiency in rice; swamp reclamation for transmigration;
groundwater development to encourage diversification of crops other than rice
and rural water supply; and river control works to develop multi-purpose use
of water resources for irrigation, municipal water supply, flood mitigation,
and hydropower. Bank sector work, assisted by GOI, covering the Repelita IV
plan period (1984-89) concluded that the following investment program would be
justified:
(a) completion of ongoing rehabilitation (0.5 million ha) and new
irrigation works including medium-scale systems (0.2 million ha).
New rehabilitation and small- as well as medium-scale projects (0.9
million ha) would be pursued through provincial irrigatiin
development projects. Construction of at least two major dams in
Java to supply water for irrigation intensification would be
included as part of the program. These irrigation wurks would
enable GOI to maintain self-sufficiency in rice production, which
requires an annual growth of 3.5% (harvested area growth ot 1.4Z and
yield of 2.1%);
(b) construction of 0.1 million ha of tidal swamp reclamation (gross
area) and a further 0.3 million ha of new recLamation works to
accomoodate 20,000 to 25,000 transmigrant families per year.  An
additional 0.1 million ha of already settled inland swamp area need
rehabilitation and improved water control; and
(c) construction of river control and improvement works (levees, dams,
etc.) and volcanic debris control in about 20 river basins
throughout the country for more efficient multi-purpose use of
water.
1.10      Investment Needs.  According to recent Bank sector work, the
indicative irrigation program under Repelita IV is estimated to cost about
Rp 45 trillion (US$4.0 billion) at current costs. About one-third of this
amount, equivalent to the foreign ezchange cost of foreign-assisted projects,
is expected to be financed from external loans. This is somewhat higher than
the share (about one-quarter) financed from external loans during Repelita
III, and is based on the assumption that completion of ongoing foreign-
assisted projects would be given priority over the next few years. The
balance of the funding will come from the Covernment's domestic budget.
However, GOI has reduced the program by 30% partly through cutbacks in
physical programs, due to the overall resource constraint and the changing
rice situation.
1.11      The indicative investment program shows a significant reorientation
of priorities away from large-scale irrigation and towards flood control,
swamp reclamation, and small- and aediumrscale systems through provincial



- 4 -
services.  These changing priorities also reflect a change in the regional
distribution of investments from Java to Sumatra and Sulawesi.
1.12      Major Constraints to irrigation development are the deficiencies in
systems operation and maintenance (O&M) and inadequate cost recovery for
O&M.  Current standards of O&H of the main and secondary syscems arL still
inadequate, though since 1974 GOI has consistently raised the level of funds
(from about Rp 8,000 to Rp 10,500 per hectare in FY85/86). GOI recently
decided to slow the rate of new irrigation construction and divert development
funds to improve O&M standards. Bank assistance in O&M is designed to improve
the organization and on-the-job training of the provincial services which are
responsible for all O&M activities. Nine provinces with major irrigation
areas have been covered under the Irrigation XVII (Ln. 2119-IND) and the
Second Provincial Irrigation Development Projects (Ln. 2375-IND), and two more
would be covered under the proposed project. The cost recovery issue was
reviewed under an extensive two-year study carried out by Gaja Madah
University from 1980 to 1982.  Recommendations of the study were accepted by
both the Government and the Bank, particularly that cost recovery of
irrigation O&M expenditures would best be done through the IPEDA (land tax)
since the IPEDA tax rate is linked to the productive capacity of farmers and
farm lands. Measures to introduce the recommended changes will be carried out
in the areas covered by two recently approved Bank-assisted projects, the West
Tarum Canal Project (Ln. 2560-IND) and the Kedung Ombo Multipurpose Dam and
Irrigation Project (Ln. 2543-IND). A similar approach would be pursued in
areas included in the proposed project. Direct allocation of a part of the
incremental funds generated through the IPEDA reassessment to the Provincial
Irrigation Services for O&M is another goal which would be pursued under the
proposed and future irrigation projects.
The Role of the Bank
1.13      Since 1968, the Bank has provided US$1.2 billion for 22 irrigation
projects in Indonesia. The earliest projects were designed to repair major
systems to increase rice output quickly. Later projects supported rehabilita-
tion of existing systems, drainage, flood control and on-farm tertiary devel-
opment. The most recent projects include measures to strengthen planning,
programming and budgeting capacity and management information systems
(Irrigation XV - Cr. 995-IND and Irrigation XVI - Ln. 2118-IND) and to build
up the capacity of Provincial Irrigation Services in East Java Province (Ln.
2119-IMD) and in eight other provinces (Ln. 2375-IND).
1.14      During Repelita IV, the Bank's involvement in the sector would
emphasize institution-building and address persistent sector-wide problems
such as poor O&M standards. Lending would focus on:
(a)  strengthening national and provincial irrigation services and
improving their performance for effective and efficient O&M of the
irrigation systems;
(b)  a small number of technically complex projects such as multi-purpose
dams or projects which present difficult economic choices or in
which Bank participation can mobilize significant cofinancing.



-5-
These include the West Tarum Canal for irrigation and the Jakarta
water supply (Ln. 2560-IND), the Kedung Ombo Multipurpose Dam
Project (Ln. 2543-IND) and the proposed Jatigede Multipurpose Dam
Project.
1.15      Experience Under Previous Projects.  The first six Bank-assisted
irrigation projects have been compLeted. 2_roject Performance Audit Reports
(PPAR) have been issued for four of them _ and a follow-up Impact Evaluation
Report on the first project (Cr. 127-tND, Report No. 4575) was released in
July 1983. Implementation delays and cost overruns, common to the first
projects, were caused by protracted bureoucratiz procurement procedures,
shortage of local funds, higher than expected inflation, design deficiencies
and poor contractor performance. However, since cost increases were more than
offset by higher rice prices, economic rates of return at completion exceeded
40Z.  The performance audits highlighted the need to improve O&M services;
provide technical and administrative support to Water Users Associacions; and
promote efficient water use.  These problems are recognized in the strategy
adopted for Bank assistance (para. 1.14) and have been used in the planning
and design of this project.
Rationale for Bank Involvement in Provincial Irrigation
1.16      In common with most other countries, Indonesia has found it more
difficult to improve O&M levels for existing systems than to rehabilitate old
systems or construct new schemes. Now that Indonesia is approaching rice
self-sufficiency in normal rainfall years, the pressure to expand irrigation
systems is slowing, and making the best use of investments already made
becomes more urgent. The Bank is playing a key role in supporting decentrali-
zation of responsibilities to the Provincial Irrigation Services and in
resolving difficult institutional issues such as water management; project
preparation, implementation and 0&M capabilities; and funding at provincial
levels. This and other Bank-assisted projects also place major emphasis on
increased cost sharing by project beneficiaries.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
Geographical Background
2.01      The project would cover the provinces of Central and West Java.
Central Java Province extends over some 31,700 km2. It has a total irrigated
area of about 756,000 ha and a population of 25.4 million. Semarang, its
capital and largest city, is connected to other parts of Java with a network
of national and provincial roads. The area is well served by air, rail and
road transport and port facilities in Semarang. West Java has a gross area of

IND, PPAR Report No. 3269, December 1980.



-6-
44,200 km2, a total irrigated area of about 1.1 milLion ha and a population of
31.9 million. Its capital, Bandung, and another large city, Cirebon, are well
served by air, rail and road transport. Port facilities in Cirebon connect
the province to other islands of the country. The alluvial plains and slopes
at the feet of the volcanoes in both provinces are fertile and intensively
farmed.
Climate and Soils
2.02      The climate is characterized by uniformly high temperatures, high
humidity and heavy rainfall (Annex 2, Table 1). Mean air temperature and
relative humidity remain almost constant, at about 270C and 79Z respectively
in both provinces. Average annual rainfall, over 80Z of which falls in the
wet season (November to April), varies from about 2,000 mm in Central Java to
about 2,400 -m in West Java. There is a pronounced dry season from May to
October which makes irrigation essential to sustain intensive agriculture.
Where water is adequate throughout the year, up to five crops of rice may be
grown in two years, though two crops of rice and one non-rice crop is more
comon. Solar radiation is sufficient to grow a wide range of tropicaL and
subtropical crops.
2.03      Java has fertile soils which cover large areas, generally developed
from intermediate to basic volcanic rocks. In areas over 600 m elevation,
volcanic ash soils, younger laterites and podzolic soils predominate. The
areas lying below 600 m are agriculturally most important. Soils originating
from quaternary and volcanic rocks are exceptionally fertile, but tertiary
marl and calcareous soils of low fertility are also found in some parts of
both provinces.
Agriculture
2.04      Over half the land in both provinces is used for agriculture, on
which over 551 of the population depends for its livelihood. The most
economically productive and valued land category is irrigated sawah (paddy
land) covering about 24Z and 26Z of land in Central and West Java respec-
tively. Paddy is cultivated in most of the area in the wet season and, where
irrigation water supplies permit, dry season paddy is also cultivated. As
re.infall and river flows diminish drastically during the dry season, only
aoout 69Z of the agricultural land in Central Java and 12X in West Java can be
planted to rice during the dry season. The remainder is planted chiefly to
maize, soybeans, groundnuts, cassava and sweet potatoes (collectively known as
secondary or palawija crops).
2.05      Other agricultural land includes rainfed sawah where heavy soils
permit wet rice to be grown during the rain3 season without irrigation. Tegal
land consists of dry upland fields where some dry land rice is g:vwn but maize
is the predominant crop. Cassava is extensively planted on tegal land, either
in rotation or intercropped with maize and other crops. A wide range of crops
(including coconuts, fruits, vegetables and medicinal herbs) are grown for
family use and for sale within house compounds. These represent a major agri-
cultura: asset in Java given the excessive density of population, tiny farm
holdings averaging less than 0.5 ha in area, and large number of families



- 7 -
without fields. The distribution of major Land use categories is given in
Annex 2, Table 2.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.06      The Agricultural Census in 1983 indicated that irrigated sawah Land
was distributed among some 2.1 million and 3.2 million farms in Central ann,
West Java, respectively. Farm land in the proposed Dumpil component area,-
located in Central Java, is distributed among 10,900 farms. About 55%, 76Z
and 32% of farms in Central Java, West Java and the Dumpil area, respectively,
are less than 0.5 ha, which, in conjunction with the high population density,
reflects the pressure on land resources (Annex 2, Table 3). Farm sizes tend
to be smaller in West Java particularly near the urban areas. Almost 70Z and
712 of farms are owner-operated in Central Java and West Java, respectively,
and about 79% in Dumpil. Tenants operate about 15%, 181 and 11 of the farms
in Central Java, West Java and Dumpil, respectively, and the remaining 15Z,
11X and 10% are cultivated through sharecropping arrangements in which the
landlord and tenant share total production, input and hired labor costs. The
tenant and his family provide their labor, and the landlord pays the land
tax. Land values vary considerably according to productivity and demand, and
range between Rp 8 to 30 million per hectare for irrigated and Rp 3 to 10
million for rainfed landi in both provinces. Similarly, farm leases range
between Rp 100,000-350,000/ha/year for irrigated land and Rp 60,000-
200,000/ha/year for rainfed land in both provinces.
Irrigation Development
2.07      With few exceptions, existing irrigation systems rely on run-of-the-
river diversion which can assure water supplies from the start of the wet
season through the early part of the dry season. Villages and towns frequent-
ly straddle larger canals and canal structures, which serve a major proportion
of the Java population's drinking water, sewerage and drainage needs.
2.08      Government irrigation services control the eource of each irrigation
unit, primary and secondary canals and tertiary offtakes. Within the tertiary
blocks of 50- 50 ha, farmer groups operate the tertiary canals. The
Provincial Irr_gation Services have field offices organized into irrigation
districts (wilayahs), sections (seksi) and subsections (cabang seksi). The
Central Java Provincial Irrigation Service is operated through six irrigation
districts, 32 sections and 137 subsections. The West Java Provincial
Irrigation Service is organized at the field level into five districts, 25
sections and 125 subsections. The Jatiluhur area (about 240,000 ha) is not
served by the West Java Provincial Irrigation Service.
2.09      From the beginning of World War II until the mid-60s the irrigation
systems throughout Indonesia deteriorated progressively due to lack of
maintenance. The O&M staff carried out only the most crucial upkeep of major

structures with the meager funding available. While system capacities were
declining due to this neglect, water demand was rising due to conversion of
sugar estate areas to smallholder paddy cultivation and increased double
cropping with new rice varieties. Something had to be done with these systems
to arrest the increasing rice imports.
2.10      In 1969, GOI began a large program of irrigation rehabilitation and
upgrading which has received continuous and progressively larger Bank Group
assistance. In Central Java, Bank assistance was provided for the two maior
systems, Pemali Comal and Jratunseluna (230,000 ha) while other systems
(160,000 ha) were upgraded through assistance from the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and
from Japan. Similarly, in West Java, five major systems were rehabilitated
(480,000 ha) under Bank assistance and another 70,000 ha of new irrigation
and/or rehabilitation have been or are being assisted under other bilaterai or
multilateral programs. Since 1975, tertiary development and drainage as well
as flood control works have been carried out in the rehabilitated areas with
assistance from the Bank and other financing agencies. Details covering
areas, loan/credit numbers and periods of implementation are shown in Annex 2,
Table 4. However, about 401 of the total irrigated area serviced by the
Provincial Irrigation Services in both provinces has not yet been rehabili-
tated.
2.11      In addition, in 1979 the Government began a program of upgrading
existing village irrigation schemes and bringing rainfed areas under irriga-
tion. Such schemes for areas of 50 to 400 ha are classified as small-scale
schemes (Kecil). These are simple, and require only a small investment (about
Rp 1.0 million/ha) for diversion works, a short canal and minimal on-farm
works. USAID has supported the Ke:il program since 1975 through its Sedarbana
Irrigation and Land Development I and 1I Projects (Nos. 497-0244 and 497-
0252). Areas larger than 400 ha are covered under medium-scale (Sedang) and
large-scale schemes. Average investment in the medium- and large-scale
schemes ranges between Rp 2.5 million to 3.5 million per ha. Table 2.1 shows
the total area in both provinces still requiring irrigation system improvement
and the area to be covered under the proposed project. The latter constitutes
a six-year time-slice of the total program.

Provincial Irrigation Services
2.12      Most large-scale irrigation systems in both provinces are managed by
project units of Central DGWRD agencies. The Directorates of Irrigation I and
II (DOI-I and DOI-II) and Rivers (DOR) maintain project offices to administer
plaLming and development activities.  In these centrally-controlled project
areas, however, much of the technical staff comes from the provincial staff
who are seconded to project units.
2.13      Within the provincial Public Works Department in both provinces,
there are three major functional services which operate roads, housing and
urban development, and irrigation. The Chief of the Provincial Irrigation
Service (PRIS) is administratively responsible to the Provincial Governor
through the Chief of Provincial Public Works, but for all technical and per-
sonnel matters, he comes under the jurisdiction of the Central DCWRD director-
ate. Within the DGWRD, DOI-I is generally responsible for guiding and coord-
inating provincial irrigation activities.  Each PRIS, at its provincial
headquarters, includes sections for planning and design, operation and main-
tenance, irrigation development (rehabilitation and new systems), rivers and
swamps and logistics (Chart No. 27536). The headquarters offices including
workshops have about 120 and 65 permanent staff (including about 17 and 12
fully qualified engineers) in Central and West Java respectively. Technical
tasks of the headquarters unit include: survey and design for the national
tertiary construction program and for larger rehabilitation; the new irriga-
tion construction flood control program (except tasks handled by central units
- para. 2.12); and supervision and programming for O&M.
2.14      A typical irrigation district (wilayah) employs about 80 staff
(about 50 in the district office) and is responsible for systems serving an
area of about 90,000 to 170,000 ha. Siz wilayahs serve a 750,000 ha area in
Central Java and five wilayahs service the 566,000 ha area in West Java
(excluding the Jatiluhur Authority area). Wilayah office staff are respon-
sible for the design of minor rehabilitation works and repairs, construction
supervision of rehabilitation and new construction, and processing of con-
tracts for works to be carried out under yearly maintenarce budgets.
2.15      There are typically four to seven irrigation sections (seksi) in
each district, each with about 50 staff (30 in a section office) controlling
about 25,000 to 35,000 ha. At this level, attention is focused on O&M
matters, particularly dry season water allocations and supervision of mainte-
nance works carried out by contractors. Section staff also maintain the con-
tact with administrative district officers (Bupatis), executives of the
administrative districts (Kabupatens) and Kabupaten irrigation committees
responsible for water allocation and administration of small irrigation works
constructed with Kabupaten funds obtained under the INPRES program (GOI's
revenue-sharing grant program). There are 32 sections in Central Java and 25
in West Java.
2.16      Each section typically consists of five subsections of about 10
staff each headed by an inspector (pengamat). Each inspector supervises the
work of about eight irrigation overseers (jurus), with che jurus meeting and
dealing with farmers and village leaders in the operation of irrigation



- 10 -
systems. The juru traditionally is responsible for a 500-700 ha irrigation
area, setting siz or seven gates, estimating flows, recording rainfall and
agricultural data, arranging for emergency maintenance of main and secondary
canals within his jurisdiction and persuading farmers through their village
headmen and irrigation water master (ulu-ulu) to maintain tertiary and
quaternary canals, to agree on common planting dates to permit rational
irrigation and prevent water wastage and theft. The only paid assistance
available to the juru has generally been two unskilled laborers which is
clearly inadequate to maintain about 5 km of primary and secondary canals,
6 to 8 control structures-and 6 tertiary offtakes.
Previous Provincial Projects
2.17      The first provincial irrigation project for the East Java Province
(Ln. 2119-ID) has been under implementation since 1982. Due to GOI budgetary
constraints in FY82/83 and FY83/84, some of the construction works have been
delayed. Adequate provisions have been made in the FY84/85 budget and
construction is now progressing. The training component, although limited to
one wilayah and one section of another wilayah, has progressed well and is
considered successful. The second provincial irrigation project for eight
other provinces in Sulawesi and Sumatra (Ln. 2375-IND) has been under
implementation since 1984. The civil works component of the project is on
schedule, but the training component was delayed due to the late engagement of
consultants.
2.18      A mid-term review for the East Java Project was held in Kay 1985
with the participation of the Bank's Resident Staff in Indonesia (RSI).
Lessons learned from the review include the need to fully integrate the
project into the provincial organization and the possibility of expanding on-
the-job training activities to other wilayahs of the province. Those lessons
have been incorporated into the proposed project.
Funding of Irrigation Activities
2.19      Expenditures on provincial irrigation activities between 1979 and
1985 amounted to Rp 56 billion in Central Java and about Rp 51 billion in. West
Java (Annex 2, Tables 6 and 7). Eighty percent of these funds originated from
the national budget (ABPN) and 20X from the provincial government. O&M fund-
ing requirements for main and secondary irrigation systems in both provinces
are estimated to average Rp 18,000 per ha in 1985 prices. For systems desig-
nated as special projects (totaling about 250,000 ha in Central Java and
300,000 ha in West Java, or about 35Z of the irrigated area of these
provinces), O& funding in the current 1985/86 budget year amounts to about
Rp 15,000 per ha, or about 80Z of the desirable level. For the remaining
irrigated areas operated by Provincial Irrigation Services, allocations in the
current budget year, including subsidies provided by the Central Government,
amount to about Rp 10,600 per ha in Central Java and Rp 7,900 per ha in West
Java, or about 60% of the desirable level.  GOI intends to continue tho trend
of recent years of increasing the funding for 00M of irrigation systems by
about 1OZ per year in current terms through the Central Government budget and
expects that full funding of the required OM would be achieved in about five
years. The longer term GOI strategy is to significantly increase provincial



- 11 -
funding of O&M through increased mobilization of revenues under the land tax
(IPEDA) program.
Staff and Budget Implications
2.20      A comparison of the resources available to the irrigation subsector
in both provinces and the magnitude of the development and O&M tasks in the
subsector indicates that the permanent staff responsible for OM and proposed
works are not adequate in terms of numbers, and require changes in organiza-
tion patterns to emphasize more control of physical field work and less
reporting. Additional staff requirements are summarized in Annez 2, Table 5.
With the completion of a major portion of centrally controlled projects,
seconded staff are gradually being transferred to their parent PRIS. The
transfer of experienced staff trained in the implementation of larger schemes
over the last ten years would benefit and make the provincial task somewhat
easier. The availability of staff has been reviewed by the Personnel Depart-
ment of DGWRD and a number of staff to be transferred from DOI-II to the
proposed project in FY86/87 is given in Annex 2, Table 5. Regarding 0)1, the
experiences of the East T-vt Provincial Irrigation Project (Ln. 2119-IND)
indicate the usefulne-s of on-the-job training for irrigation service staff at
various Levels and the usefulness of casual labor to provide real maintenance
capability. OM funding needs to be incireased to about Rp 18,000/ha/year
(Annex 1, Table 5) to employ temporary Labor and provide other required
physical maintenance.

2.21      The budget implications for both provinces are summarized in
Table 2.2. Total investment in the irrigation sector by both provinces will
increase from Rp 57 biLlion between 1980 and 1985 to Rp 255 billion between
1986 and 1991. This represents a 220X increase in constant 1985 rupiahs.
However, the portion of the investment programs financed by the provincial and
the central governments will remain at the same level in real terms during the
six years of the project (1986-91) as during the 1980-85 period.
III. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The main objectives of the proposed project are in line with the
Government's development strategy for the irrigation subsector. The project
aims at complementing previous Bank support to water resources development in
Indonesia's Central and West Java Provinces and increasing food crop produc-
tion to a sustainable self-sufficiency level, thus reducing food grain imports
and foreign exchange expenditures for rice. The project would also enhance
employment and incomes in the agricultural sector.
Project Description
3.02      The project would include:
Central and West Java Provincial Irrigation
(a) Irrigation Development
i)  rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems covering about
60,000 ha, development of new or expansion of existing small- and
medium-scale schemes for about 74,300 ha and support for
upgrading the existing rehabilitated systems as pilot training
areas for the field staff; and
(ii) preparation of detailed designs covering a total area of about
90,000 ha *n both provinces for the rehabilitation of existing
systems and development of small- and medium-scale systems as
well as about 50,000 ha to be upgraded as pilot training areas
for the field staff.
(b) Institutional Development and Facilities
(i) consultancy services for on-the-job training and project coordi-
nation in both provinces;
(ii) construction of offices at the provincial headquarters and
overseer (juru) houses in both provinces;
(iii) initial and recurrent yearly expenditures related to field
training, monitoring and evaluation and strengthening of the
water users associations;



- 13 -
(iv) procurement of vehicles for the Provincial Irrigation Services,
training activities and construction supervision; and
(v) procurement of miscelLaneous office, survey and hydrological
equipment.
(c) IPEDA Surveys and Mapping
(i) aerial photographs, rectified photomaps, demarcation of property
boundaries and listing of land owners for each village covering a
total gross area of about 670,000 ha which were rehabilitated
under Bank and ADB assistance;
(ii) provision of office and survey equipment and computer training
for the IPEDA central and provincial staff; and
(iii) technical assistance through consultancy services for the review
and supervision of mapping and survey activities.
Dumpil Subproject and Studies
(a) Irrigation Development
Ci) construction of a new run-of-the-river diversion scheme on the
Lusi River at Dumpil in Central Java serving about 11,300 ha of
new irrigable land;
(b) Consultancy Services
{i) for the construction supervision and preparation of construction
drawings for the Dumpil area;
(ii) for the detailed design of drainage works in Dolok-Penggaron and
studies as well as related design of the Tuntang-Jragung area
irrigation and drainage development; and
(iii) for the feasibility study and detailed design of the Bongo irri-
gation project in North Sulawesi.
Central and West Java Provincial Irrigation
3.03      Rehabilitation of Existing Irrigation Systems.  A total area of
about 205,000 ha in Central Java and 290,000 ha in West Java requires rehabil-
itation. These areas are under the jurisdiction of Provincial Irrigation
Services and were not covered under the previous rehabilit,ticn program.  GOI
plans to rehabilitate these systems over a period of 15 to 2'. years. An
extensive priority evaluation was carried out during the project prex-ration
which gave weights to water availability and use, size of schemes, expansion
of irrigable areas, condition of the system, a minimum economic rate of return
(ERR) of 13Z and distribution within each wilayah of both provinces. Using a
time-slice approach, the project would finance construction during the first
six years which would cover about 25,000 ha in Central Java and 35,000 ha in



- 14 -
West Java. The project would also provide for detailed design of about 20,000
ha in Central Java and 25,000 ha in West Java. About 121 schemes would be
rehabilitated under this project. The schemes to be rehabilitated will be
restored to their original conditions. However, departures from original
designs will be made when warranted. Siltation, the major constraint on
efficient irrigation deliveries, will be minimized by providing improved
desilting works. In addition, weirs, intakes, cross drainage and control
structures will be repaired; defective or missing gates will be replaced; and
tertiary systems will be built where required.
3.04     Development of Small-Scale Schemes.  Irrigation systems of 50 to 400
ha size are located mainly in the hilly parts of the project. These were
built as village schemes with temporary diversions and short channels. Since
they are not under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Irrigation Services they
have become inoperative due to lack of maintenance. Under the project these
systems would be rehabilitated and improved by constructing permanent diver-
sion weirs, restoring canal cross-sections and repairing their control
structures. Their comnand areas would be extended where feasible and access
to them would be improved. Such systems would cover about 20,000 ha (81
schemes) in Central Java and 30,700 ha (126 schemes) in West Java. Detailed
designs would be produced for about 25,000 ha. To ensure proper operation and
maintenance of such schemes in future, assurances were obtained at negotia-
tions that:
(a) diversion structures would be operated and maintained by the
Provincial Irrigation Services and whenever the service area is
divided into multiple tertiary blocks, channels leading to the
tertiary blocks would also be operated and maintained by the
Irrigation Services;
(b) OI would provide adequate OM funds for such schemes.
3.05     Development of Medium-Scale Schemes.  Mediumrscale schemes are
planned for areas with firm and perennial sources of water. For most of these
schemes, part of the areas are already partially irrigated by existing village
schemes. Service areas of these schemes vary from 400 ha to about 3,500 ha.
The project would include construction of 13 schemes which will combine some
of the existing smaller village schemes covering a total area of about 15,000
ha in Central Java and five schemes covering about 8,600 ha in West Java. The
project works would include diversion weirs, main and secondary canals with
related structures, drainage works and on-farm tertiary development (Annex 2,
Table 11). Detailed designs are available for the 14 run-of-the-river
schemes, which would be reviewed by the project consultants before construc-
tion. The project would provide for the detailed designs of the four
remaining schemes.
3.06     All of the schemes are run-of-the-river diversion schemes except two
in Central Java, the Klogo and the Randugunting schemes. The Klogo scheme now
under construction has a net irrigable area of about 1,600 ha. An equalizing
reservoir with a live storage capacity of about 2.4 MCM is fed from a 2-km
long canal with a designed flow of 1.1 M /sec. The feeder canal abstracts
flow from a major perennial stream. The reservoir works are expected to be



- 15 -
completed in 1986. The Randugunting scheme is designed to serve a net
irrigable area of about 1,450 ha from a reservoir of about 2.5 MCH capacity.
Only 501 of the area would be under palawija crops during the dry season.
From the economic point of view, it is not an attractive scheme because it
would require an investment of about Rp 3.5 million/ha and inundation of part
of a village affecting 500 families. The Central Java Irrigation Service,
with the assistance of consultants, would prepare a detailed feasibility study
during the first two project years which would include a resettlement plan for
the affected families and an environmental study. Construction of the scheme
is programmed during the last two project years, subject to the satisfactory
outcome of the feasibility study and Bank agreement. In the case of West
Java, the Cibuni/Cikaso scheme is programmed to be implemented in two
phases. Under phase I, for an area of about 3,500 ha, the scheme would be
implemented by tapping springs and improving existing temporary weirs witLin
the area as the source of water. Under phase II, an additional area of 4,500
ha would be studied at the feasibility level under the project, and if found
feasible, detailed designs would be prepared by the consultants. Implementa-
tion of phase II works is not included under the project.
3.07      Institutional Strengthening of Two Provincial Irrigation Services.
Training and upgrading of provincial staff is one of the main objectives of
the project. Training would be covered under two categories. The first
category would be for professional and experienced subprofessional staff where
a well defined program is being followed by the manpower training unit
(DIKLAT) of the Ministzy of Public Works (MPW) under a Bank-assisted project
(Ln. 2258-IND). The program covers such disciplines as project management,
project planning and specialized technical aspects related to surveys,
mapping, cost estimating and construction supervision. The courses offered
are of two to three months' duration. The second category would be on-the-job
training which would be carried out under the project. The proposed training
is patterned after the model developed under the East Java Provincial
Irrigation Project (Ln. 2119-IND). On-the-job training would be carried out
by internationally recruited consultants. Training would emphasize project
planning, design and planning criteria, and checking and supervision of
design. The bulk of the training would be through short introductory
seminars, wo,rkshops which would review designs done by the Indonesian consul-
tants and field checking before and during construction. Field training for
O&b staff would cover formulation and application of O&M procedures, planning
and supervision of activities such as upgrading and O&M in the pilot units,
and training of instructors to train lower level field staff. Training wouLd
be carried out by wilayah training teams consisting of three instructors in
each wilayah. The wilayah training team would be trained by the Central
Training Team consisting of three experienced O&M staff and consultants. Pre-
paration of training material and the training of the Central Training Team
would take place during the first project year. The Central Training Team of
each province would train two wilayah training teams each year. The on-the-
job training programs are listed in Annex 2, Table 12.
3.08      Consultants would be engaged for (a) training and upgrading of
project staff; (b) coordinating the application of established procedures
related to planning, design, construction supervision, acceptance of completed
works, operation and maintenance and budgeting; (c) review and acceptance of



- 16 -
detailed designs and tender documents prepared by other consultants; (d)
feasibility study and modification of detailed design for the Randugunting
scheme in Central Java and the second phase of the Cibuni and Cikaso systems
in West Java; (e) preparation of a plan of action related to monitoring and
evaluation and Water User Associations; and (f) mid-term and final completion
review of the project, including assessment of project impact on various
groups of project beneficiaries. Details of consultant input are summarized
in Annex 1, Table 6. Receipt of proposals for training and coordination
consultancy services from short-listed local consultants expected to associate
with directly appointed foreign consultants and approval of tender documents
for construction of the Dumpil diversion dam by concerned GOI agencies and
SEKNEG would be conditions of Board presentation, and signing of the contract
for the services would be a condition ot Loan effectiveness (para. 3.22).
3.09      Office space is limited at both provincial headquarters and
additional space is required to accommodate the consultants, design teams and
project staff. Provision has been made to expand existing facilities by about
500 sq m in Central Java. About 600 juru houses would also be built under the
project. Both provinces would be provided with additional office, survey,
hydrologic and miscellaneous equipment (Annex 1, Table ?').
3.10      Vehicles and motorcycles are locally assembled, and GOI prohibits
their importation. All vehicles and motorcycles for GOr use are centrally
procured through annually negotiated contracts with a small number of
assemblers. These items (US$1.4 million) will be regarded as reserve procure-
ment.
3.11      Vehicle requirements have been carefully reviewed within GOI and by
the Bank and are summarized in Table 3.1. The Provincial Services throughout
Indonesia have limited numbers of vehicles available and such shortages have
recently developed into a major constraint which affects many ongoing proj-
ects. Without mobility, the training component for the project cannot proceed
and construction supervision will suffer. Assurances were therefore obtained
during negotiations that Government would: (a) provide seven four-wheel-drive
vehicles, 20 light servi:e vehicles, five microbuses, 140 motorcycles and 660
bicycles for both provinces before September 30, 1986; and (b) ensure delivery
of the vehicles required for 1987 (Table 3.1) by September 30, 1987. A
schedule of various events from the availability of funds to the delivery of
vehicles is also given in Table 3.1.

3.12      IPEDA Surveys and Mapping.  Under the Kedung Ombo Multipurpose Dam
and Irrigation Project (Ln. 2543-IND) and the West Tarum Canal Project (Ln.
2560-IN), GOI has agreed to reclassify irrigated lands in project areas and
reassess the IPEDA for these lands. The same procedure would be followed
under the proposed project. However, in view of the limited capacity of IPEDA
staff at both central and pro -icial levels, the reclassification would focus
on major systems rehabilitated under previous Bank and ADB-assisted projects.
This is expected to cover a gross area of about 670,000 ha and would include
the Pemali Comal, the western part of the Jratunseluna project (ezcluding the
Kedung Ombo service area) and the Gambarsari-Pesanggrahan systems in Central
Java and the Cirebon, Sumedang, Rentang, Cisedane and Ciujung systems in West
Java. The project would provide funds for: (a) compilation of maps using
existing or new aerial photographs to produce rectified photomaps; (b) demar-
cation of village and landholding boundaries for production of 1:2,500 scale
line maps; (c) reclassification and reassessment of each holding; (d) office
equipment and computer training for the IPEDA central and provincial staff;
and (e) technical assistance through consultancy services for review and
supervision of mapping and survey activities. Prior to loan negotiations, the
Directorate General of Taxes provided a detailed implementation schedule for
mapping, reclassification and reassessment of the areas mentioned above which
aimsat completion of reassessment by September 30, 1990, and a tentative plan
for the remaining irrigated areas of each province.
Duapil Subproject and Studies
3.13      Civil Works.  A new run-of-the-river diversion scheme would be
developed on the Lusi River in Central Java to serve a net irrigable area of
about 11,300 ha. The proposed diversion dam (barrage) located near the
village of Dumpil would consist of a concrete structure with five gates (12 x
7.5 m size), an irrigation intake structure at the right abutment, under-
sluices to flush sediment, a sediment trap, a bifurcation structure on the
primary canal to distribute flow to the right and,left main canal system and a
siphon across the Lusi River for the left bank service area. The conveyance
system would consist of right and left main canals 48 and 31 km long, respec-
tiveLy. Thirteen secondary canals, with a total length of about 45 km, are
planned to serve a 6,700 ha area on the right bank. The remaining area of
about 4,600 ha on the left bank would be served by 11 secondaries, 34 km
long. The on-farm development works would consist of tertiary and quaternary
laterals to serve 40 to 80 ha blocks. Inspection roads with a 4 m wide gravel
pavement would be provided along one bank of both main canals and major
secondary canals.
3.14      Studies and Design. Consulting services would be funded for:
(a) Dumpil (Central Java). Construction supervision and preparation of
construction drawings;
(b)  Dolok-Panggaron Drainage and Tuntang-Jragung (Central Java).
Detailed designs for: (i) drainage works covering about 6,500 ha at
Dolok-Penggaron; (ii) an updated master plan and feasibility study
to integrate the water resources of the Tuntang and Jragung Rivers



- 18 -
to service a total area of about 40,000 ha and (iii) detailed
design, including revision and updating of the Glapan Barrage on the
Tuntang River following review of the study by GOI and the EEC; and
(c) Bongo (North Sulawesi). Feasibility studies for the proposed Bongo
irrigation scheme covering about 12,000 ha. Subject to the findings
of these studies, which would be reviewed by the Bank and GOI,
detailed designs would be carried out.
3.15      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that consultants would be
employed in accordance with Bank 2uidelines to undertake training, coordina-
tion, studies, designs and construction supervision according to terms and
conditions agreed with the Bank.
Water Supply and Demand
3.16      Provincial IrrigRtaon Development.  Estimated water requirements are
based on rainfall, evapotranspiration and soil type. Average annual rainfall
is estimated as 2,000 mm for Central Java and 2,400 mm for West Java.  Annual
evapotranspiration, estimated using the Penman method, varies between 1,300 to
1,400 m. Deep percolation after puddling is assumed between 1 mm and 2
ma/day for most of the soils in Java. Based on these parameters and using
standard crop coefficients, maximum water duties for canal design range
between 1.4 1/sec to 1.7 1/sec per hectare. Water supply calculations are
based on synthesized flows for bigger systems usirg available streamflow data
on streams with similar catchment characteristics :n each province. Because
of limited actual flow data and rainfall records for smaLl-scale schemes, the
estimated flows were checked against standard flow estimates for each sub-
region prepared by the DGWRD Institute of Hydrology. Regional flow estimates
of catchment yields are usually between 25 to 30 1/sec per sq km for the wet
season and 8 to 10 1/sec per sq km for the dry season. During the evaluation
of project investment priorities, consultants assessed the firm water supplies
to arrive at the proposed cropping intensity for each system. The mission
reviewed this assessment and found it reasonable and adequate.
3.17      Dumpil Subproject.  Estimated water requirements are based on
effective rainfall with 80Z probability, evapotranspiration estimated using
the Penman method (4.6 mm/day) and a deep percolation rate of 1.5 mm/day.
Based on these parameters and using standard crop coefficients developed by
DGURD, mean annual water requirements would be about 1,540 mm over a 30-year
period of study. The main canAls have been designed for water duty of 1.65
I/sec/ha. The rainfall-runoff relationship for the Serang River basin was
used to synthesize the streamfLow of the Lusi River at the proposed diversion
site. The size of the project area was determined from simulated operation
studies using the 30-year period of synthesized streamflows at the diversion
site and estimated seasonal water requirements based on a cropping pattern
with the entire area under two rice crops during the wet season and 801 of the
area under secondary crops during the dry season. The proposed cropping
calendar follows an existing calendar except for a short shift to mA imize the
use of rainfall for both tne wet and dry season crops.

Status of Project Preparation
3.18      Provincial Development Component.  The project preparation report
was prepared by the DOI-I with the assistance of consultants Sir. M. MacDonald
and Partners (U.K.). The preparation report is based on information supplied
by the two Provincial Irrigation Services and detailed designs performed by
their design units. Designs for rehabilitation works on about 5,400 ha in
both Central and West Java are ready for implementation during the first pro-
ject year. Detailed designs are more advanced in the case of small- and
medium-scale systems, some of which were prepared under previous Bank-assisted
projects. Designs for about 60% of the small-scale systems (35,000 ha) are
completed and can be put to tender without any revisions. However, although
designs have been prepared for about 75% of the medium-scale systems (19,000
ha), the designs for a large part of Central Java (12,000 ha) would require
careful review and some revision. Land has been acquired for works to be
implemented in FY86/87 and for the remaining works the land acquisition will
be completed a year earlier than the scheduled construction time. No diffi-
culties are foreseen in acquiring the required rights-of-way.
3.19      Dumpil Component.  A feasibility report for the subproject was
prepared by the DOI-II with the assistance of consultants PRC/ECI (U.S.) in
September 1984. Detailed designs of all civil works for the diversion dam,
main and secondary canals, with tender documents, were completed in January
1985. Tender documents for the diversion dam have been prepared on the basis
of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Tenders for main and
secondary canal construction which were orginally prepared for Local Competi-
tive Bidding (LCB) procedures were modified by the Jratunseluna project office
for ICB tendering. Land acquisition for the diversion dam contract will be
completed before February 1986 and for other works will be completed a year
earlier than the scheduled construction time.
Cost Estimates
3.20      Total project costs are estimated at US$302.3 million (including
taxes of about US$24.2 million and reserve procurement for vehicles of about
US$1.4 million) of which US$113.8 million (or 37.6%) would be foreign
exchange. Project costs are expressed in December 1985 prices and an exchange
rate of Rp 1,100 per US$ is used in this report. Unit prices for civil works
are based on recently contracted costs of similar projects carried out by DOI-
I, DOI-II and the Provincial Irrigation Services in both provinces.
Quantities for the provincial irrigation development (rehabilitation, small-
and medium-scale systems) were derived from detailed designs and then
projected for the total area for both provinces. Dumpil component quantities
are based on tender drawings and detailed designs for the diversion dam, main
and secondary systems. Costs of offices, houses and equipment are based on
current GOI contracts. A 15% allowance for physical contingencies has been
included for the rehabilitation and upgrading works; 101 for small- and
medium-scale works, training and IPEDA mapping and survey activities; and 5%
for Dumpil civil works and consultant services. Expected price increases
total about 23Z of the base costs plus physical contingencies and were estima-
ted on the basis of the following inflation rates: for local costs 6% in
1986-90 and 4.5% thereafter; and for foreign costs 7% in 1986 and 1987, 7.5Z

in 1988, 7.7Z in 1989, 7.6Z in 1990, and 4.5Z thereafter. Detailed project
costs are given in Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2 and are summarized in Table 3.2.
Financing
3.21      The proposed Bank loan of US$166.0 million would finance about 60Z
of total project costs excluding taxes (US$24.2 million) and reserve procure-
ment of vehicles (US$1.4 million). The EEC is expected to provide parallel
financing in the form of a grant of about US$18 million for construction of
the Dumpil diversion dam and consulting services for the design of drainage
works for the Dolok-Penggaron area, and feasibility studies and detailed
design of irrigation development for the Tuntang-Jragung area. Effectiveness
of the EEC grant, award of the contract for construction of the Dumpil diver-
sion dam and signing of the consultant's contract for Dumpil construction
supervision would be conditions of disbursement of the Bank loan for the
Dumpil component. External assistance of US$184.0 million (Bank loan and EEC
grant) would cover the foreign exchange cost (US$113.8 million) and 41% of
local costs (US$70.2 million) or 66Z of total project cost excluding taxes.
OI would finance the balance of US$118.3 million (including US$24.2 million
for taxes) through its budgetary allocations. The financing plan is shown in
Table 3.3.

Project Implementation
3.22      According to 001 procedures, Team Ten of the Cabinet Secretariat
(SEKIEG) is to approve terms of reference, the consultants' short list, the
decision on the lead firm (either internationally recruited or local), total
consultant man-months, the ratio between local and foreign input, prequalifi-
cation and tender documents, the list of prequalified contractors, and an
evaluation of the final award of contracts for works, equipment and services.
To avoid delays recently experienced in the clearance and award of contracts
related to a few ongoing projects, the following documents were cleared by all
GOI organizations including SEKNEG prior to negotiations:



- 22 -
(a) prequalification documents for construction of the Dumpil diversion
dam (ICB contract to be financed by EEC); and
(b) terms of reference for the training and coordination consultancy
services related to the provincial deveTnpment component, services
for supervision of construction of the Dumpil subproject and
services for the feasibility study and detailed designs of the Bongo
area irrigation scheme. Clearance also included total consultant
input and division of responsibility between local and inter-
nationally-recruited consultants.
Signing of the two consultants' contracts for project training and
coordination for West and Central Java Provinces would be a condition of
loan effectiveness.
3.23      The project would be implemented over a six-year period starting
with the construction of civil works for the provincial irrigation schemes in
September 1986. Construction of the Dumpil diversion dam would begin in
October 1986. GOI is prequalifing contractors for the construction of the
diversion dam, and clearance of the list of prequalified contractors by
various w0I agencies and EEC is expected by November 30, 1985. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that GOI would t ndertake construction of all
project works in accordance with an implementation schedule agreed with the
Bank. All project works are expected to be completed by end-1991. The
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 1, Table 7 and key indicators are
given in Annex 2, Table 15.
Procurement
3.24      Civil Works.  ICB procedures would be used for the construction of
the Bapang and Randugunting medium-scale schemes in Central Java Province
(US$10 million), the Cimandari (medium-scale) and Cikuntan (rehabilitation)
schemes in West Java Province (US$12 million); and the diversion dam (US$14.7
million) and the mair and secondary canals (US$16.3 million) in the Dumpil
area. The EEC is expected to finance construction of the dam, for which GOI
would follow EEC guidelines. Bank guidelines would be used for the other con-
tracts. The remaining provincial irrigation works, offices and buildings, and
tertiary development and drainage works in the Dumpil area would be packaged
into a series of about 340 smaller contracts, including about 20 multi-year
contracts each exceeding US$1.5 million in value and 320 single-year contracts
most of which would be less than US$500,000 in value (US$138 million).
Further packaging of the 20 multi-year civil works contracts into larger
contracts and combining the IPEDA mapping activities into one contract for
tendering under ICB procedures was considered but was not found feasible.
These contracts are planned for 15 medium-scale systems, about 18 rehabil-
itation schemes with areas larger than 700 ha, and about 10 small-scale
systems with areas larger than 600 ha. The systems are located in 11 wilayahs
in both provinces, with each wilayah administratively responsible for the
works carried out within its boundaries. Packaging of contracts sprpad over
two or three wilayahs would require supervision of works by provincial
headquarters staff, necessitating special organizational arrangements which
would be difficult to introduce. Similarly, mapping work for IPEDA is spread

over eight fragmented areas in two provinces and GOI security clearance for
the aerial photography, if undertaken by a foreign firm engaged through ICB,
would take longer than for a local firm(s). In view of this, it would be
easier and more efficient to carry out the mapping activities under several
contracts than to combine all such activities under one contract. Experience
in the irrigation subsector also shows that contracts below US$3-4 million do
not attract international bidders. Since mzst of the remaining works are
widely dispersed and would be tendered over a six-year period, they are
unlikely to attract international contractors. LCB procedures acceptable to
the Bank would therefore be used, with foreign contractors eligible to
participate.
3.25      Equipment and Consultants.  Small office, survey and minor O&M
equipment (US$0.7 million) would be procured locally in small lots through GOI
procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank. Due to their small size, ICB
would not be suitable for these contracts. Consultants would be engaged in
accordance with Bank guidelines.
Review of Procurement
3.26      The Bank would review, prior to tendering and award, the sir ICB
contracts for three medium scale and two systems to be rehabilitated (US$22.0
million), the three ICB contracts for the main and secondary canals in the
Dumpil area (US$16.3 million) and 20 multi-year LCB contracts each exceeding
US$1.5 million in value (US$51.1 million), thus covering about 51% of the
total contract value of about US$176 million. EEC would review in accordance
with its own guidelines the diversion dam construction contract (US$14.7 mil-
lion). Other civil works contracts (US$86.4 million), each valued at less
than US$1.5 million and equipment procured in small lots not exceeding US$0.1
million in value, would be revie..ed by the GOI Procurement Control Units, and
subsequentLy by the Bank, on a sample basis after award. Table 3.4 summarizes
procurement arrangements. All contracts related to IPEDA mapping and property
ownership identification activities exceeding US$100,000 would be subject to
the Bank's review prior to tendering and award.
Disbursements
3.27      Loan funds would be disbursed against the following categories at
the rates shown below net of taxes.

Disbursements would be made against contracts, except for the cost of train-
ing, designs carried out by Indonesian consultants, IPEDA mapping and
ownership identification survey contracts below US$200,000, IPEDA equipment
and training, miscellaneous equipment, monitoring and evaluation, and civil
works contracts below US$1.5 million which would be disbursed against
statements of expenditure (Annex 5). The proposed allocation of loan proceeds
is presented in Annex 1, Table 3. The disbursement profile (Annex 1, Table 4)
is projected over a six and a half year period from July 1986 to December
1992. The profile follows fairly closely the disbursement profile for
previous Indonesian irrigation projects during the initial three years, a
period of intense on-the-job training, completion of remaining design work and
tender documents for multi-year contracts. With these activities either
completed or fully under way at the end of the third year, project activities
are expected to be slightly (about 4-1OZ) ahead of the current trend in the
disbursement profile. Loan closing is expected by December 31, 1992.
Accounts and Audits
3.28      Separate detailed accounts and records are kept by DGWRD, the IPEDA
Directorate and each Provincial Irrigation Service for each budget item by
project and budget year. Carry-overs of unspent funds (SIAP) are permitted
for two years. Because SIAPs are permitted, cash books and accounts are not
closed until the budget for the line item has been fully spent. Project
accounts are subject to two audits: (a) by the Inspector General of the
concerned ministries; and (b) by the Financial and Development Supervisory
Board (BPKP). The work of both auditors has been found to be generally satis-
factory on Bank-assisted irrigation projects. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that adequate and separate accounts would be maintained for the
project; all project-related contracts, documents related to statements of
expenditure, and orders and receipts would be kept for at least one year after
the Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last
withdrawal from the Loan Account was made; and independent audits by BPKP of
each year's account would be submitted to the Bank within nine months of the
close of each GOI fiscal year.
Environmental Impact
3.29      Irrigated sawah is ecologically the most stable and non-erosive form
of land use in Indonesia and the project would have a very positive environ-
mental impact. Public health authorities, with the cooperation of each
Provincial Irrigation Service, would intensify malaria control efforts as the
irrigation and cropping pattern intensity increases. This would be emphasized
in the Dumpil subproject area and the medium-scale and larger rehabilitation
schemes, where some of the vectors are present and there is already some inci-
dence of malaria. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that appropriate
measures for malaria control would be taken in the project area. These
measures would take environmental aspects into consideration. The construc-
tion of the Kedung Ombo Dam (Ln. 2543-IND) would substantially reduce flooding
in the upper Serang River and at the junction of the Serang and Lusi Rivers.
The provision of drainage under the Dumpil component for the lower areas would
also have a further beneficial effect. The Serang and Lusi watersheds would



- 26 -
be covered under the Upland Agriculture and Conservation Project (Ln. 2474-
IND) supported by USAID and the Bank. The implementation of the project would
not involve an increase in the use of agrochemicals, and the Covernment has
taken steps to allow only soft or degradable pesticides into the country.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
National Level Organization and Management
4.01      DGCRD, through the DOI-I and WDI-II, will be responsible for overall
project coordination. DOI-I would provide technical guidance and administra-
tive support to both Provincial Irrigation Services and serve as the central
funding channel for loan and government funds. This is in keeping with estab-
lished patterns of operations and GOI's requirement that a central government
entity should adm-.nister external assistance. The Subdirectorate of Rehabili-
tation within DOI-I would coordinate day-to-day activities, obtain necessary
GOI approvals and prepare withdrawal applications for forwarding to the Bank
Resident Staff in Indonesia (BSI). This Subdirectorate is currently responsi-
ble for the East Java Provincial Project (Ln. 2119-IND) and would use the same
set-up through deployment of additional staff to carry out the project
activities.
4.02      DOI-II would be responsible for the Dumpil component and the studies
as well as detailed designs included under the project. DOI-II has had exten-
sive experience in administering previous as well as about seven ongoing Bank-
assisted projects. No additional staff would be required at the national
level for this component.
4.03      The Directorate General of Taxation, through its Directorate of Land
Tax, within the Ministry of Finance would be responsible for the mapping,
reclassification, and reassessment activities related to IPEDA. Current IPEDA
staff are handling similar activities for the ongoing Kedung Ombo and West
Tlarum Projects. A project office has been established and a Project Manager
has been appointed who reports directly to the Director of IPEDA and would
manage day-to-day operations of the proposed project and those of the other
two ongoing Bank-assisted projects. The project office would be responsible
for processing of mapping and survey contracts, reclassification of lands by
IPEDA staff, IPEDA reassessment and preparation of project-related studies,
reports and withdrawal applications. At the national level, a coordination
comittee would be established to coordinate mapping and reclassification
activities with other agencies such as DGWRD and the Directorate General of
Food Crops Agriculture (DGFCA). The committee wouLd be chaired by the
Director of IPEDA with members representing DOI-I, DOI-II of DCWRD, and
DGFCA. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOI would establish the
coordinating committee before September 30, 1986.
Field Level Organization and Management
4.04      Provincial Irrigation.  This component would be implemented by the
Central and West Java Provincial Irrigation Services. The heads of these



- 27 -
services would direct the day-to-day field activities as Project Managers,
with the assistance of Deputy Project Managers acting as effective full-time
heads in each province. The project activities would be fully integrated into
the provincial organization. The organizational structure at the provincial,
Wilayah and field levels was described earlier (paras. 2.13 to 2.16) and is
shown in Chart No. 27536. In Central Java, field sections of three of the six
Wilayahs control the work of all three services, namely Irrigation, Roads, and
Housing and Urban Development. The Governor of Central Java has issued a
decree stating that seventeen public works sections of the Pati, Kedu and
Surakarta Wilayahs would be organized into separate irrigation sections on
January 1, 1986. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that by
September 30, 1986, GOI would assign qualified staff and provide adequate
budgets to the reorganized sections in the Wilayahs of Kedu, Surakarta and
Pati in Central Java. Additional staffing needs of the project would be
filled by provincial irrigation staff returning from secondment to DOI-II
under the completed Pemali Comal and Cambarsari-Pesanggrahan Projects in
Central Java and the Cirebon, Cisedani and Ciujung Projects in West Java. In
addition, 20 engineers would be recruited or promoted over the next four
years. Technical staff shortfalls could easily be made up through recruitment
and promotion of staff returning from various universities. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the necessary staff build-up would take place
according to the number and timing shown in Annes 2, Table 5.
Water Users Associations
4.05      The GOI has recognized the importance of efficient water management
at the farm level and in 1975 decreed the establishment of Water Users Associ-
ations (WUAs) at the village level. The situation has been further clarified
by Presidential Instruction No. 2 which sets down the organization structure
of the WUAs. WUA management consists of a Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Secre-
tary, Technical Officer and Treasurer. Committee members are elected by the
WUA members, who own or rent irrigated sawah within the tertiary unit. A
typical association would have an area of about 70 to 100 ha, and a membership
of 100 to 200 farmers. The members are divided into farm groups by sub-
tertiary and quaternary blocks. Most of the WUAs were established at the
village level and are now being reorganized based on tertiary blocks.
Generally, in areas where water is limited, WUAs are active, but where water
is sufficient, especially in upstream areas, they are passive. In areas where
water availability is very poor, WUAs are passive and ineffective. The WUAs
in West Java were evaluated by the West Java Irrigation Service in 1984, and
out of a total of 7,570 WUAs covering a total of some 554,000 ha, only 1,300
(17Z) were active; whereas a similar evaluation in Central Java during 1984
showed that out of a total of 1,680 WUAs, about 700 (41Z) were active. This
indicates the magnitude of the task of motivating and counselling the WUAs.
4.06      The project would provide an opportunity for initially establishing
effective WUAs in 55,000 ha of irrigation schemes to be upgraded as pilot
training areas under the project. Responsibility for organizing and counsel-
ling the WUAs would be assigned to a Provincial Coordinating Committee chaired
by the Assistant Secretary to the Provincial Government for Production, with
conmittee members nominated by the Provincial Services for both Irrigation and
Agriculture. The provincial committee would review the needs and define the



- 28 -
training program for the WUAs and clear training material for distribution to
the various irrigation committees at the Kabupaten level. Each service would
be directly responsible for the training of the WUAs in their area of techni-
cal expertise. The Provincial Irrigation Services would manage training
related to the operation and maintenance of the tertiary network and water
management, while the Provincial Agricultural Services would focus on crop
production and the effective use of the water at the farm level. Training
activities at the Kabupaten level would be carried out jointly by both Provin-
cial Irrigation and Agricultural Services under the general guidance of the
irrigation committee. Expenditures of the Provincial Irrigation Service would
be covered by the project, and training expenses incurred by the Provincial
Agricultural Services would be covered through the proposed National Agricul-
tural Extension III Project. Performance of the WUAs in the pilot areas would
be evaluated during the mid-term project review and, in light of the exper-
ience gained, WUAs would be extended to the remaining project areas of both
provinces.
Dumpil Subproject
4.07      Field activities of the Dumpil area would be under the responsibil-
ity of the Jratunseluna Project (see Chart 27536). The Division responsible
for the Upper Serang irrigation area would carry out implementation through a
Dumpil Subproject Section and three units: one for diversion dam construction
and two for construction of the left and right bank irrigation works. The
subproJect organization is in place and adequate staff are available for
construction supervision in the field.
IPEDA
4.08      The provincial and district level offices of IPEDA would assist the
national project office in carrying out field activities. A subproject office
consisting of a supervisor and three to four assistants would be established
in each province. A Provincial Coordinating Committee would be established to
coordinate field activities and exchange data and information related to
mapping, ownership and crop yields. The Provincial Committee would be chaired
by the Head of the Provincial Tax Office and its membership would be composed
of representatives from the Provincial Planning Office (BAPPEDA), the
Provincial Irrigation Services, Agriculture Service, Agraria and other agen-
cies such as the Jatiluhur Authority and DOI-II.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.09      The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for the project would be
based on existing data collection procedures of both Provincial Irrigation
Services. It is designed to improve operations and water management standards
through regular feedback on results obtained from decisions and actions. The
system would focus on the impact upon project beneficiaries through such
indicators as cropping intensity, crop yields and net farm income. These
indicators would be analyzed with respect to water supply conditions, farm
sizes, crop varieties, input utilization, farm labor supply and other factors
such as technical status of the farm operators. For management information
purposes, the analysis would be restricted to assessing the differences in



- 29 -
cropping results under different conditions before and after the irrigation
systems are rehabilitated or improved. Each subsection would collect infor-
mation from selected farmers and would involve village level extension workers
(PPLs) in the collection of crop data. The information would be submitted to
the relevant section for initial processing and verification. An M&E unit
would be established in each province (Chart 27536), headed by an agricultur-
ist with some statistical and computer background. He would be assisted by
two staff members: one responsible for data processing and analysis and the
second for the supervision of data collection and training of field staff at
the section and subsection level. The information collected at the field
level would be analyzed and evaluated by the M&E Unit. The analysis would
then be submitted for review to the Provincial Coordinating Committee (para.
4.06). The Committee would finalize recommenda:ions and pass these on to the
concerned agencies for further action and improvement. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that: (a) M&E units would be established and staffed
in each province before December 31, 1986; (b) a detailed plan of action for
M&E activities would be submitted for the Bank's review before March 31, 19871
and (c) the M&E units would start implementing the agreed program by September
30, 1987.
4.10      As an input to the mid-term review process, the consultants for
training and coordination would prepare reports assessing the various produc-
tion constraints on irrigated agriculture as well as the performance of Water
Users Associations, using the M&E data in conjunction with additional field
work. At project completion, the consultants would prepare another report
assessing project impact on various groups of project beneficiaries using the
series data on cropping intensities, crop yields and net returns. Provision
has been made for the consultants input (para. 3.08) for these reports.
V. AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT SERVICES AND PRODUCTION
Support Services
5.01      Research. Most crop research is performed by the Central Research
Station (CENTREDIF) at Bogor and at the substations and demonstration plots
located in Central and West Java. The CENTREDIF develops new varieties and
technologies which can be used by farmers under local conditions. The infor-
mation is disseminated through the Agricultural Extension Service. Research
is being strengthened by the ongoing Bank-assisted National Agricultural
Research Project II (Ln. 1840/Cr. 1014-IND).
5.02      Extension.  The agricultural extension service is based on the
training and visit system under which field extension workers (PPLs) are
responsible for delivering the technological package at the farm level through
contact farmers. There are about 2,300 and 2,400 PPLs in Central and West
Java respectively. The PPLs are supervised at the district level by middle
level workers (PPMs), who in turn are supervised and trained by subject matter
specialists (PPSs) at the provincial level. The extension service has been
successful in its rice intensification program, but has encountered some
difficulty in convincing farmers to use the recommended inputs for palawija



- 30 -
crops due to the unavailability of a complete technical package and credit,
which are available for rice, and unfavorable prices at harvest time. OI and
the Bank have emphasized the strengthening of agricultural extension activi-
ties through the completed Agricultural Extension Project (Ln. 1267-IND) and
the ongoing National Agricultural Extension II Project (Cr. 996-IND). The
proposed Agricultural Extension III Project would put greater emphasis on the
improvement and production of palavija crops. Seed production aspects have
been supported through the completed Seeds I Project (Cr. 246-IND) and ongoing
Seeds II Project (Ln. 1267-IND).
5.03      Credit.  The Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) is the main Government
source of credit for irrigated rice production through the BIMAS program. The
credit is extended in the form of fertilizers, agrochemicals, high yielding
variety (HYV) seeds, cost of living allowances and extension advice for crop
production. The INMAS program also provides farmers with subsidized inputs
and extension advice, but the farmers are expected to pay cash. For irrigated
rice production, farmers can obtain credit for up to Rp 75,000/ha (US$68/ha)
for seven months at an interest rate of 1Z per month. In Central and West
Java the BIMAS/INMAS programs cover about 90% of the irrigated rice crop.
However, credit for palawija crops is not developed to the level of the
BINLS/INMAS programs and farmers mostly rely on private sources.
Present and Future Cropping Patterns
5.04      Central and West Java Subprojects.  Annex 3, Table 1 presents the
average net area harvested, production and yields for major crops in Central
and West Java for the year 1981-82. Total crop areas, crop intensities, and
yields for the present, future without project, and the future with project
situation have been estimated for small- and medium-scale irrigation schemes
(Annex 3, Tables 2 and 3) and for irrigation systems to be rehabilitated
(Annex 3, Table 4). Future cropping patterns without the project will not
change from the present cropping intensities of 190% in Central Java and 140%
in West Java for the new irrigation systems, while the cropping intensity
would decrease from 150X to 140% for systems needing rehabilitation.
5.05      The cropping intensity in the future with project case would
increase to 200% and 255Z for the small- and medium-scale schemras in Central
Java, while in West Java the cropping intensity would be 180% for the small
and 200% for the medium-scale schemes. For rehabilitated irrigation systems,
the cropping intensity would increase to 170% in both Cent:al and West Java.
The increased cropping intensities would be possible due to a slight shift of
the cropping calendar resulting in better use of the available irrigation
water for growing crops, mainly rice during the dry season.
5.06      Dupil Subproject.  Present cropping intensities in the area are
high, averaging about 212X, of which about 10% is irrigated wet season rice;
the rest is wet season rainfed rice and dry season rainfed palavija crops.
The cropping intensity would increase with the project from 212% to 275% while
the area under irrigation would increase from 10% to 177%. The area under
irrigated rice would increase from 1,170 ha to about 11,785 ha, while about
8,250 ha of rainfed palawija crops would also be brought under irrigation
(Annex 3, Table 5).



- 31 -
Yields and Production
5.07      The present average yields of irrigated HYV rice in Central and West
Java are 4.0 t/ha for the wet season and 3.6 t/ha for the dry season (dry
unhusked rice); while the average yield for the Dumpil subproject area is
3.2 t/ha for irrigated and 2.8 t/ha for rainfed rice. The project would
increase the yields of irrigated HYV rice in Central and West Java to 5.0 t/ha
in the wet season and 4.8 t/ha in the dry season   The yields of palawija
crops under irrigated conditions would double with the project at full devel-
opment: groundnut from 0.6 to 1.2 c/ha, maize 1.2 to 2.5 t/ha and soybean 0.5
to 1.2 t/ha. Such yield improvements are considered modest as they have
already been attained in Indonesia under other ongoing irrigation projects.
Yield improvements for rice and palawija crops occur because of the inter-
action of several factors such as better extension, improved seeds, and
greater water availability, the latter being critical because it reduces the
risk of crop failures and induces the farmer to apply more and better inputs.
Activities under the ongoing AgricuLtural Extension II and Seeds II Projects
(Cr. 996 and Ln. 2066-IND) within the project area would provide the necessary
linkages.
5.08      The estimated annual incremental production generated by the project
at full development would be about 347,000 tons of paddy, about 11,000 tons of
maize, 15,000 tons of groundnuts and 4,000 tons of soybeans. Details are
given in Annex 3, Tables 2 to 6.
VI. PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND RECOVERY OF PROJECT COSTS
Prices
6.01      Economic and financial prices for major agricultural inputs and
outputs are presented in Annex 3, Tables 7 and 8. Estimated farm inputs and
outputs have been valued in constant 1985 prices for both the economic and
financial analyses. Economic prices for paddy, maize, groundnut, fertilizers
and pesticides are based on January 1985 world market forecasts for 1986,
1987, 1990 and 1995 of the Bank's Commodity Studies and Projections Division
and have been adjusted for quality, transportation, processing and handling to
the farmgate prices. Financial prices for all commodities and economic prices
for inputs not traded internationally have been derived from the farmgate
prices observed during appraisal. For the medium/long term (1995-2015), it
was assumed that subsidies on inputs and outputs will be phased out as
Indonesia is reaching self-sufficiency in rice.
Farm Incomes and Payment Capacity
6.02      Farm budgets have been developed for the different types of schemes
in both provinces and the Dumpil area. Table 6.1 summarizes the expected
incremental per farm income resulting from the project and the estimated pay-
ment capacity of the farmers in both provinces according to landholding size.
The average size of a farm family was assumed as 4.5 persons, providing
480 man/woman-days of farm labor per year. A specific farm labor assumption



- 32 -
was used (see Annex 3, Table 10) in which the off-farm Income of surplus farm
labor is estimated at 50% of the on-farm daily wage at harvest time and in
wt,ich the time dedicated to management of the farm increases in proportion to
the size of landholding. Financial prices have 'een used for all inputs and
outputs; however, the price received by the fa.-..r for dry paddy (Rp 138/kg)
is substantially less than the BULOG official "floor price' of Rp 175/kg
because it takes into consideration the impurity and moisture content and
represents the estimated average price paid by BULOG in 1984/85. As shown in
Table 6.1, incomes of all farms are expected to rise as a result of the
project. Small farms generally rely on off-farm employment for a higher
proportion of their income, which would decrease with the project because of
higher family labor demand. A minimum yearly living allowance of about
Rp 535,000 has been assumed for an average family of 4.5 people, based on an
equivalg}t figure of Rp 119,000 in rural Java per capita per year at 1985
prices  1  After subtracting the minimum living allowance from net income, the
farmer's surplus would be about Rp 132,000 for 0.4 ha farms with small-scale
schemes in West Java, increasing to a maximum of Rp 1,245,000 for 1.0 ha farms
in medium-scale schemes in Central Java. The farmer's surplus is about 45%
higher for Central Java because of current higher yields and cropping inten-
sity.  In the Dumpil area (details in project file), the farmer's surplus
would be about Rp 137,400 and Rp 778,000 for 0.4 ha and 1.0 ha farms, respec-
tively. The farmer's capacity to pay additional IPEDA or other taxes can be
estimated using as a basis the surplus shown in Table 6.1.

Operation and Maintenance Funding
6.03      One of the main objectives of the project is to increase the quality
of operation and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation network through adequate
financing, proper staffing and training, and improved monitoring and evalua-
tion systems. Responsibility for O&M of the network is divided between two
groups: the on-farm system of tertiary and quaternary canals handled by local
Water Users Associations (WUAs) and the main and secondary systems operated
and maintained by the Irrigation Services of each province. The maintenance
of tertiary systems has traditionally been and will remain the responsibility
of the farmers through the WUAs (see para. 4.05). Under this arrangement, the
farmers are expected to contribute the following: (a) an in-kind contribution
of 20 kg of paddy per ha per crop paid to the WUA and (b) about 12 man-days of
labor per ha per year for the maintenance of the tertiary and quaternary
canals. Both labor and the in-kind contribution, if effectively collected,
would adequately cover the O&M needs of the tertiary network. Under the above
assumptions, the total contribution would average some Rp 12,300 per ha per
year in 1985 prices.
6.04      Maintenance of the main and secondary irrigation network is
currently inadequate, primarily due to a lack of trained staff and inadequate
funding. This has shortened the economic life of the systems and necessitated
costly rehabilitation programs. In part, the financing constraint stems from
the lack of any direct irrigation water charges in Indonesia, except for
contributions to the WUA. The lack of revenue results in a chronic shortage
of Provincial Government funds which has forced the Central Government to
finance the bulk of O&M although this is a purely provincial responsibility
and should rightly be funded by the provinces. Though GOI has consistently
raised the Level of O&M funding from Rp 2,900/ha in 1974 to about Rp 10,600/ha
in 1985, this is still inadequate compared to average annual O&M expenses
required per ha of irrigated area estimated at Rp 18,000 in 1985 prices (see
Annex 1, Table 5). GOI is concerned about the continued budgetary input from
the Central Government for O&M purposes and fully supports the shift through
increased IPEDA revenues. However, the shift has to be gradual, systematic
and nationwide and must take into account the current economic environment
particularly in the agricultural sector.
6.05      Land Taxes (IPEDA).  IPEDA is collected at the village level (Desa)
and turned over to the Provincial Governments for district (Kabupaten) and
other development. The tax has traditionally been used for a variety of pur-
poses, but not for the upkeep of main and secondary irrigation systems. IPEDA
is, however, the most practicable and equitable way of increasing revenues for
irrigation O&M and charging farmers for the water used since the tax is based
on the price of paddy, land productivity and the size of landholding. GOI has
recently begun to recognize the contribution of irrigation development to the
level of IPEDA and has agreed to allocate about 2X of IPEDA collections to the
Provincial Irrigation Services. Since the present rural net IPEDA collection
only reaches Rp 5,000/ha and Rp 3,000/ha in Central and West Java respec-
tively, the recent allocation of 2% of IPEDA collections represents under 1Z
of total 06M requirements, but could be increased substantially through the
following reforms to IPEDA assessment and collection procedures:



- 34 -
(a) the calculation of the tax could be improved by (i) changing the
base paddy price from Rp 95/kg to Rp 138/kg, which represents the
average price paid by BULOG to farmers in 1984/85, (ii) mapping and
reassessing the project areas in order to reclassify landholdings
according to their present productivity (the last assessment of land
classes on which the tax calculation is based is about 10 to 15
years old), and (iii) revising the tax matrix to create two new
classes for production, from 8 to 10 tons per ha and over 10 tons
per ha;
(b) the collection rate of the tax varies considerably among the
provinces and is sometimes very low. In 1984, the IPEDA collection
rate in Central and West Java was 82% and 40% respectively. An
improvement in the collection process and imposition of penalties in
case of default would increase revenues significantly; and
(c) some mechanism should be developed to link irrigation O&M funding
with IPEDA and to allocate those funds directly to the Irrigation
Services.
Preliminary calculations based on the above changes and available data show
that the scope for increasing IPEDA revenues in the irrigated areas is good.
In most cases, it is possible to achieve at least a three-fold increase over
the IPEDA revenues presently collected.  In Central Java, average collection
per ha in the irrigated areas could theoretically increase from Rp 5,500 to
Rp 37,000, and in West Java from Rp 10,000 to Rp 33,000 per ha. Such an
increase could only be achieved gradually, because of the time required for
mapping, reclassification and reassessment. Moreover, a sudden three-fold
increase would neither be practical nor politically acceptable. Annex 4,
Table 4 summarizes the expected IPEDA collection increases resulting from the
more limited changes to be introduced under the project.
6.06      Measures to introduce IPEDA reassessments and to increase funds for
irrigation O&M in Central and West Java have already been included in two
recently approved Bank-financed irrigation projects in Indonesia, the West
Tarum Canal Improvement Project (Ln. 2560-IND) and the Kedung Ombo Multi-
purpose Dam and Irrigation Project (Ln. 2543-IND). Under these projects GOI
has agreed to aLlocate a portion of the increenntal IPEDA collected in the
project areas to the Provincial Irrigation Services for O&M of the main and
secondary systems. Action plans are also being prepared under these projects
for the IPEDA reassessment, including a formula to allow the allocation of
IPEDA for O&K and a mechanism to channel these funds to the Provincial
Irrigation Services. Under the proposed project, these measures would be
expanded to cover the remaining irrigated areas in both provinces, and during
negotiations assurances were obtained from GOI that:
(a) the Directorate of IPEDA will reclassify irrigated lands and
reassess IPEDA rates for the areas listed in Annex 2, Table 14 by
September 30, 1990 and beginning April 1, 1990 would carry out
similar exercise for the remaining irrigated areas of both Central
and West Java provinces according to a plan of action agreed with
the Bank;



- 35 -
(b) the Central and West Java Provincial Governments would allocate a
part of the incremental IPEDA collected through reassessment to the
financing of O&K of main and secondary systems in the reassessed
areas in accordance with a plan of action, acceptable to the Bank,
to be furnished to the Bank by December 31, 1988 and by December 31,
1989 for the remaining irrigated areas of both provinces; and
(c) the Directorate of IPEDA will furnish to the Bank by September 30,
1987, a plan of action for improving the method of collecting IPEDA
and will carry out such plan in both provinces taking into account
the Bank's com_ents.
Cost Recovery Indexes
6.07      The cost recovery index represents the ratio between the present
values of the incremental project charges and the incremental project costs
(including investment and 06W expenses). The project charges consist of the
incremental IPEDA, the WUA payment and the farmers' in-kind labor contribution
for maintenance of the tertiary network. On the basis of present and esti-
mated future levels of per hectare IPEDA contributions and other charges (see
Annex 4. Table 4). the cost recovery index ranges from 10Z to 38% which com-
pares favorably with similar irrigation projects. The cost recovery index
also increases in step with the landholding size because of the progressivity
of the IPEDA tax. For small-scale systems, the cost recovery index ranges
between 31% and 38Z; for medium-scale systems it falls in the range 10 to 122
which still compares favorably with recent irrigation development projects in
Indonesia. The relatively large difference between the cost recovery indexes
of small and medium-scale systems is due to the IPEDA tax structure (Annex 4,
Table 3), which currently has a "maximum" paddy production class of 8 t/hal
year: since this production plateau is frequently reached in the medium-scale
systems, and farmers who produce more do not pay proportionally any additional
tax. Using economic prices the cost recovery index will increase from 122 to
45%.
6.08      The rent recovery index represents the ratio between the present
value of incremental project charges and the project rent, defined as in Annex
4, Table 2. The project rent is a measure of the additional net income to the
farmers as a consequence of the project. The project rent recovery index
ranges from 112 to 45% using financial prices and from ax to 21Z using econo-
mic prices. The rent recovery index shows the proportion of additional rent
which is captured by additional charges. As shown in Table 6.2, the rent
recovery index is significantly higher in Central Java where the farmers are
presently better off and have a higher capacity to pay. Larger farms
contribute to the project charges a greater proportion of the project rent
than smaller farms.
6.09      The O&M recovery index is the ratio between the present value of
incremental project charges and the 0&K expenses (see paras. 6.03-6.04). On
average, the incremental charges resulting from the project are sufficient to
cover the maintenance costs of both the main system and the tertiary
irrigation network.

YII.  BENEFITS, ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATIOI AND RISKS
Benefits
7.01      The proposed project complements previous Bank support to water
resources development in both provinces. The project would increase food crop
production in Central and West Java, reduce or avoid foreign exchange expendi-
tures for rice and food grain imports during years of shortfalls and enhance
employment and income in the agricultural sector. Major benefits and bene-
ficiaries are summarized in Table 7.1. At full development, an incremental
quantity of about 347,000 tons of paddy, about 11,000 tons of maize and 15,000
tons of groundnuts would be produced annually. The total population of the
two provinces, estimated at 57.3 million in 1984, is expected to grow at an
average annual rate of 1.5X until the year 2000. About 530,000 rural families
would benefit directly from the project and an equivalent of 45,000 full-time
farm jobs would be created as a result of crop intensification. The standard
of living of the rural families in the project area measured on an income per
capita basis will increase by an average of 35Z in Central Java and 60X in
West Java (para. 6.02). It would benefit about 240,000 rural families (45Z of
project population) whose current income is below the absolute poverty line.

Main Assumptions Used in the Economic Analysis
7.02      Financial costs have been converted to economic costs using the
conversion factors given in Table 7.2.  Following are the major adjustments:
(a) taxes - including the new Value Added Tax (VAT) of 10% - have been
excluded from economic costs;
(b) the expected price increases during the construction period (23%)
have been excluded from economic costs. Physical contingencies,
however, have been maintained as a component of economic costs;
(c)  the cost of future studies, which have no impact on project
benefits, have been excluded from the economic costs; and
(d) operation and maintenance expenses at the provincial and at the
village levels were not considered as a project finAncial cost but
were included in the project economic costs.
7.03      Labor pricing.  Because of the considerable population pressure in
both provinces and the significant proportion of landless laborers, the oppor-
tunity cost of unskilled rural labor used in farm production has been esti-
mated at 65Z of the prevailing average farm wage of about Rp 1,300/day.
7.04      Agricultural prices.  All farm inputs and outputs in the economic
analysis as well as in the farm budget are valued in constant 1985 prices (see
para. 6.01 and Annex 3, Tables 7 and 8).
7.05      Foreign exchange.  The exchange rate of US$1.00 = Rp 1,100 has been
used in the appraisal and is considered to reflect the value to the economy of
the foreign exchange used in the project.

Economic Analysis of Typical Schemes
7.06      A separate economic analysis has been undertaken for the Dumpil
subproject, and for small- and medium-scale systems and rehabilitation schemes
in each province. Table 7.3 summarizes the economic rates of return (ERR) and
net present value (Nm) at 102 and 20Z for each project component.

/a  All calculations on a per ha basis.
7.07      Based on the above assumptions and a project life of 30 years the
overaLl ERR is estimated at 24Z, which is satisfactory. The detailed costs
and benefits for each component and for the project as a whole are presented
in Annex 4, Table 1.



- 39 -
7.08      Given the great number of systems to be developed or rehabilitated
under the project, the different components in each province have been ana-
lyzed on a per ha basis. Estimates for development costs per ha, the existing
and future yields, and cropping pattern represent the average conditions in
each province. Experience gained from the First and Second Provincial Irriga-
tion Development Projects (Lns. 2119 and 2375-IND) has been incorporated in
the costs and benefits estimates.
7.09      The Dumpil subproject, however, has been analyzed separately and has
an ERR of about 13X, which is above the estimated opportunity cost of capital
in Indonesia of IOZ. The relatively lower ERR of the Dumpil component is due
to the high investment cost per ha (around US$3,000). About 60,000 people
live in the project area, 73Z of them depending directly on agriculture.
Average income in the Lusi Valley is lower than in the rest of Java because
off-farm employment opportunities are minimal; therefore, the project would
significantly contribute to increase the average family income (by over 95X
compared with 351 in Central and 601 in West Java) and generate some 400,000
man-days of employment at full development.
7.10      The medium-scale systems in both Central and West Java have
estimated ERRs of about 20%. The small-scale systems would achieve high rates
of return in both provinces due essentially to the low investment cost per ha
and the short construction period. The ERR of such systems is estimated at
some 30% in Central Java and 33Z in West Java. The overall ERR for Central
Java is 25%, lower than the ERR in West Java (28%). This is due to the
existence in Central Java of a more productive agricultural sector. The
impact of the project on production is therefore somewhat lower than in West
Java where the scope for improvement is greater. Rehabilitation schemes were
also analyzed on a per ha basis and have an ERR of the order of 28Z. The
investment per ha varies from US$500 to US$2,000 depending on the system. An
investment of US$1,900/ha would still result in an ERR of 14x. Future yields
and cropping patterns would restore these schemes to their original production
potential.
Sensitivity Analysis
7.11      Four key variables have been identified as crucial to the success of
the project. Table 7.4 summarizes the results of the sensitivity analysis
with respect to changes in the price of rice, higher investment costs, delays
in implementation, and duration of the economic life of the project.
7.12      The project as a whole is economically strong, relatively insensi-
tive to cost overruns, and reduced benefits from both lower production and
rice prices. A 32Z reduction in the projected rice price during the 1990-2015
period would lower the ERR from 241 to 202 and a 201 cost overrun on all
project components would lower the ERR to 21%. The project is relatively more
sensitive to delays in implementation: a two year delay in the project
benefits would reduce the ERR to 16%. The project would remain marginally
viable even if its economic life were reduced to eight years in small-scale
systems and nine years in medium scale systems.

/a  Such a reduction in Bank projections for 1990 would result in a rice
price of about US$2371ton, similar to the 1985 price (f.o.b. Bangkok, 5Z
broken).
7.13      For the Dumpil subproject, a 32Z reduction in the projected rice
price during 1990-2015 would lower the ERR frou 131 to 101 and a 20Z cost
overrun on the investment would lower the ERR to 111. A two year delay in the
subproject benefits would reduce the ERR to 91. The Dumpil subproject would
remain marginally viable if its economic life were reduced to 17 years.
7.14      Sensitivity to Different Levels of O&M.  The optimum level of 0&M
expenditure per hectare is estimated at Rp 32,000/year, divided between
fp 18,000 for the main and secondary systems and Rp 14,000 for the tertiary
and quaternary laterals. The impact on project benefits of lower Levels of
0&M expenditures has been analyzed based on the assumption that there is a
direct correlation between the real level of OM expenses and the duration of
the economic life of the project (Table 7.5). An expected economic life of 30
years would correspond to 0&M expenses of Rp 32,000/ha/year and lower O&M
expenses would proportionally lower the economic life of the project. For
mediumrscale systems, the ERR would drop to under 101 for 001 expenses under
Rp 9,000/ha/year. For small-scale systems, the minimum level of OM ezpenses
necessary to reach an ERR of 10Z is Rp 7,500 ha/year, which shows that the
project remains viable under the present 00M funding conditions. Lhe impact
of different levels of O& expenses can be estimated by the ratio between the
net present value of the output forgone due to the project's shorter lifespan
and of the savings resulting from lower 0&M expenses. For small-scale
systems, this ratio stands between 4.3 and 6.0 for a 101 discount rate, and
between 1.2 and 2.5 for a 201 discount rate. Because the opportunity cost of
capital in Indonesia is closer to 101, every rupiah spent by the Government
above the present levels up to Rp 32,000/ha/year would increase the project
benefits by some 5 rupiahs according to the assumptions of the scenario for
the small-scale systems. For the medium-scale systems, the importance oa
proper O&M funding is enhanced by the larger initial investment, and the net

implicit rate of return of incremental 01M expenses is high. The project
remains viable under present funding conditions but it is nevertheless true
that an inadequate level of O0K funding could significantly reduce the
ezpected benefits.
Risks
7.15      As discussed above, the project is not excessively sensitive to
change in the main variables and its overall risk Level is acceptable.
Several elements could, however, contribute to a significantly Lower than
expected ERR for the project. Among them, two can be controlled by the
Provincial Irrigation Services: the timeliness of construction and adequate
0&K funding.
7.16      Because the proposed project focuses on strengthening the Provincial
Irrigation Services rather than on establishing a new central project manage-
ment organization, local manpower resources would be used extensively and
consultant input would be almost exclusively limited to the training of the
provincial staff. Inadequate staffing in the first year of the project,
de.ays in consultant contract award and therefore delays in training con-
sL. ite a risk that has been minimized by making consultant contract approval
a condition of loan effectiveness and by the expected availability of staff
from other Bank-financed projects which are reaching completion (see Annex 2,
Table 5).
7.17      As shown above (para. 7.14), the level of OWN funding is one of the
key aspects of the project. While present levels of OLW funding are still
below the recommended standard, a significant improvement was achieved in



- 42 -
1985/86 - especialLy in Central Java where the O&M allocation reached some
Rp 10,700/ha. Nevertheless, the risk of inadequate funding in the near future
remains unless: (a) both the Central and Provincial Governments increase
their commitment for O&M funding in the short term; and (b) some permanent
mechanism is found, satisfying both the Ministry of Home Affairs and the
Ninistry of Public Works, on how to apply the incremental IPEDA collection
resulting from the land reclassification financed under the project. While
the analysis developed in para. 7.14 shows that the project remains viable
with the present level of O&M expenditures, a comparison of the NPVs of the
incremental O&M expenses and the resulting incremental benefits shows that the
present funding level is too low and very costly in terms of forgone output.
The risk of inadequate O&M funding has been gradually reduced in the last two
Bank irrigation loans to Indonesia (Lns. 2543 and 2560-IND) by financing the
mapping and reclassification of the project areas in order to increase the
IPEDA collection and by obtaining GOI agreement to allocate a share of the
incremental IPEDA revenues to the O&M of main and secondary canals. In this
project, a similar approach has been adopted. In addition, a detailed program
for land mapping and reassessment in the project areas has been agreed (para.
6.06).
VIII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      Before loan negotiations, GOI furnished the Bank with:

reassessment of major systems rehabilitated under previous Bank and
ADB-assisted projects, including the Pemali Comal (about
117,000 ha), the western part of the Jratunseluna project (about
75,000 ha), the Gambarsari - Pesanggrahan (about 60,000 ha) systems
in Central Java and the Cirebon (about 123,000 ha), Rentang (about
115,000 ha), Sumedang (about 73,000 ha), Cisedane (about 50,000 ha)
and Ciujung (about 57,000 ha) systems in West Java. The plan aims
at completion of reassessment by September 30, 1990. A tentative
plan for the remaining irrigated areas of each province was also
provided (para. 3.12); and
(b) a letter indicating clearance by all GOI Grganizations including
SEKNEG of prequalification documents for construction of the Dumpil
diversion dam (ICB contract) and of terms of reference (including
