LESOTRO
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This project's two major components, a highway component and an
experimental labor-intensive component, differ substantively in origin and
justification and are discussed separately.
li.       Lesotho's rugged topography and sparse road network make internal
communications very difficult and exclude large areas from the country's
national life. The existing road system predominantly serves the western
lowlands, where a high proportion of the nation's population and production
are concentrated. The only previous Bank Group credit in the transport sector
contributed to the construction or reconstruction of 140 km of this lowland
road network.
iii.      As reflected in the Second Development Plan (1976-80), Government's
strategy has shifted emphasis from lowlands development to opening up the
country. The road construction component of this project was identified as
a priority project in the recently completed British Government-financed
Lesotho Transportation Study. It is essential to a general program of de-
veloping the mountain areas, beginning with a recently initiated Mountain
Area Development Project prepared under the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program.
iv.       In addition to improvement, reconstruction and construction super-
vision of the 147 km St. Michaels-Thaba Tseka road, the road-related component
of the project also includes provision of maintenance facilities along the
project road and technical assistance to strengthen the Ministry of Works
(MW).
v.        The total cost of these elements is estimated at US$6.9 million
(US$7.3 million including taxes), with a foreign component of US$5.45 million,
about 79% of net of tax cost.
vi.       MW will be responsible for executing this component.  The road will
be improved/reconstructed under a unit-price contract which will be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
Guidelines. Road construction, which is expected to start towards the end
of 1976 and be completed by the end of 1978, will be supervised by consultants
whose employment under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association
and the British government is a condition of credit effectiveness.
vii.      The main benefits from improving the St. Michaels-Mantsonyane section
will be significant savings in vehicle operating costs; the estimated economic
return is 13%. The other section, Mantsonyane-Thaba Tseka, is developmental
and has negligible traffic at present; it must be viewed as part of the Mountain
Area Development package, the overall rate of return on which is about 11%.
Some important unquantified benefits are better integration of the remote
Thaba Tseka region and mountain areas to the east in national political, social
and economic development. The maintenance and technical assistance elements



- ii -
should produce improved Roads Branch operations and an increase in trained
manpower.
viii.     The other major project component is a provision for implementing
the recommendation of the 1974 UNDP/IBRD Migrant Workers Re-employment Mission
that Government's labor-intensive construction capabilities be developed.
The spectre of Lesotho's migrant workers coming home en masse from the
Republic of South Africa (RSA) in the wake of possible labor disorders has
prompted interest in a contingency employment plan. The project will estcblish,
and operate for 3 years, an experimental Labor-Intensive Construction Unit
(LCU) and will strengthen the employment service functions of the Labor Com-
missioner's Office.
ix.       Estimated cost of this componient is US$1.7 million (with a US$1.1
million foreign element). There are no taxes.
x.        The MW will be responsible for execution of this component, assisted
by consultants employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Asso-
ciation to manage the LCU.
xi.       The main benefits from the LCU will be an increased ability to cope
with any recurrence of the recent unemployment emergency and an indication
of the merits of using labor-intensive methods as a long-term employment
generating strategy.
xii.      The combined cost of the road and labor-intensive components is
US$8.6 million (US$9.0 million, including taxes), with a foreign component
of US$6.5 million, about 76%. The project will be financed by an IDA credit
of US$5.5 million, a British Government grant of US$1.5 million and a Lesotho
Government contribution of US$1.6 million net of taxes (about 19%). If the
Lesotho Government successfully concludes negotiations with SIDA and UNDP for
US$0.5 million and US$0.2 million respectively, its contribution would be re-
duced to US$0.9 million, or 10% of the total cost.
xiii.     During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Government
will provide required funds for local project costs and adequate road mainte-
nance; review Central Mechanical Workshop and Plant Pool procedures and
submit a plan for improvement to be discussed with the Association; appoint a
local counterpart to the expatriate economist employed by the MW Planning
Unit; and employ consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Association.
xiv.      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$5.5 million to the
Kingdom of Lesotho on the usual terms, to cover about 64% of total project
costs excluding taxes.
xv.       If the Lesotho Government successfully concludes negotiations with
the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa for US$2.5 million, a cor-
responding amount of the proposed IDA credit will be cancelled.



T _r.S,{2TH'(I
APPRAISAL UF   SECOiN_L HIGHWAY PROJECT
1 .  iT U'RODUCTIO Y
1.01      The Government of Lesotho has requested IDA assistance in financing
a highway project.  A project suitable  ;r Bank Group participation includes
the construction of a 147 km road to connect Thaba Tseka in the central miountain
region with the capital, Maseru.  This road was identified as a priority pro-
ject in the recently completed Lesotho Transportatioa Study (para. 3.04).  It
is essential to the Governiment s recent strategy of developing the mountain
regions, commencing with a recently begurk fLirst phase Mountain Area Development
Project prepared under the FANUIBRD Cooperative Program (para. 6.03).
1.02      In addition, Covernment and IDA agreed that the project should
include consul-ting services to finalize construction documents and supervise
road construction, provision of maintenance facilities for the road and
technical asssistance to the MW.
1.03      PrGvision has also been made to implement the recommendation of
the  UNDP/IBRD Migrant Workers Re-employment Mission that Government develop
its capabilities fo- labor-intensive construction.  Riecause the road-related
project elements differ substantively from the labor-intensive component
in origin andi justification, the two components are discussed separately
throughout this appraisal report.
1.04      Total cost of the road component is estimated at US$6.9 million
(US$7.3 million including taxes), with a foreign element of US$5.45 million,
about 79%. This component would be financed by IDA, the British Government
and the Kingdom of Lesotho.
1.05      Estimated cost of the labor-intensive componenit is US$1.7 million,
with a foreigra element of US$1.1 million, about 65%.  This component is to
be financed by IDA and the Lesotho Government.
1.06      The combined cost of both components is US$8.6 million (US$9.0
million, including taxes), with a foreign component of IJS$6.5 million, about
76%.  The project will be financed by an IDA credit of LS$5.5 m.illion, a
British Government grant of US$1.5 million and a Lesothio Government contri-
bution of USl .6 raillion, net of taxes.  If the Lesotho Government successfully
concludes negotiations withi STDA und UNDP for US$0.5 million and US$0.2
million, respectiveliv  its contribution would be reduced to US$0.9 million.
Further, if the Government's negotiations with the Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa (BADEA) for US$2.5 million are successful, a corres-
ponding amount of the IDA credit wil1E be cancelled.
1.07      The project was appraised i?n April 1975 by Gabriel I. Oluonye
(Engineer) and Philip W. Blackshaw (Transport Economi½stl, who, with Brendan P.
Kennedy (Engineer) prepared this report. The report was edited by Marie
Garcia-Zamor,

2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.  Effects of Geographic and Economic Setting on Transport
2.01      Lesotho, a small mountainous country in the southeastern Dart of
Africa (30,300 km2), is surrounded by the Republic of South Afrira e-l3AI, on
which it relies for external communication. Altitudes range froml about ,500
m in the western lowlands to 3,500 m in the eastern mountain areas. This
topography presents major obstacles to construction of transport facilities.
2002      In 1973 the population was about 1.1 million and is growing at
approximately 2.2% p.a. About 80% of the people live in the western lowlands
and foot:iills and in the Orange river valley, which compri'se 43% of the land
area.  The rest live in the mountain region. Density averages 36 persons/km2
for the country as a whole, but in rural lowlands reaches 100/km2.  Conse-
quently, transport development has been concentrated in these western low-
lands.  There are no roads in the mountain areas apart from tracks, constructed
in recent years using Food Aid Labor, 1/ which ere negotiable virtually only
by pack animals and four-wheel drive vehicles.
2.03      Per capita GNP, about US$100 in 1973/74, is among the lowest on the
African continent. Agriculture, an important source of income for 85% of the
population, contributes almost 55% of GDP. Services contribute 35% and
manufacturing, mining and construction account for the remainder.  Crop pro-
duction is mainly for subsistence; wool and mohair account for the oulk of
exports. With few identified mineral resources, it seems that the country's
future development must largely be based on the improved use of its agricultural
resources. To date, development efforts, have concentrated on improving crop
production in the lowlands and foothills, but population pressures have
intensified the need to make bet ter use of Lesotho's isolated mountain regions,
where production, under traditional methods, is declining. Government has
therefore just started a comprehensive long-term developmelnt effort with an
agriculture project, the CIDA-financed Mountain Area Development Project (para.
6.03)e
B. The Transport System
2.04      While Lesotho's primary route density seems generally adequate for
the country's limited internal needs, the quality is poor. The network
comprises 2,725 km of roads, of which 80% are tracks. Apart from a short
rail connection to the South African Railways, the only other transport
1/   Labor (mainly female) remunerated chiefly by food rations,



-3-
infrastructure is a network of 31 airstrips. Generally, only small aircraft
are used because of the need for maneuverability in landing on short strips
in mountainous terrain. Lesotho is therefore almost entirely dependent on
its roads for internal transport and for access to RSA's well-developed
transport system (mainly rail and road) on which it relies for traffic beyond
its boundaries.
Roads and Road Transport
2.05      This subsector is discussed in Chapter 3.
Air Transport
2.06      Of the 31 airfields in Lesotho, only two are paved and only Maseru
has terminal and navigation/communication facilities (though none for night
flying). All the others have grass or gravel surfaces. Until recently,
these airfields provided the only access to many mountain areas other than
by foot or animal, but because of the recent construction of access tracks
only a few areas still rely solely on air service. Even so, air transport
remains important, and the Second Five-Year Plan (1976-80) provides for
improvement of some of the more important airfields.
2.07      Maseru airport can accommodate aircraft up to the Hawker Siddley
748, used to connect with RSA, although there are operational limits on account
of short runway length, the surrounding terrain and occasionally adverse wind
conditions. A 1972 study confirmed that, even with major expenditure, the
airport could not be improved to meet the requirements of larger aircraft.
A study into the feasibility of constructing a new international airport
began in March 1974 and is nearing completion.
2.08      Lesotho Airways, a government-owned corporation which operates at
a profit, provides most internal services as well as charter flights into RSA.
Two South African-owned companies provide services to the southeast and north-
east, chiefly for transport of migrant workers. Lesotho Airways plans to
take over the services in the southeast and is investigating the possibility
of taking over the other as well. Services to Durban, Cape Town and other
centers which would serve the tourist industry are contemplated. International
connections consist of 3 flights a week between Maseru and Johannesburg by
South African Airlines on behalf of Lesotho Airways. Government would like
to participate more actively in external air transport and has initiated
discussions with Botswana and Swaziland on the possibility of a regional
airline.
Railways
2.09      Railways play no part in the country's internal transport.  However,
most external freight traffic is carried by South African Railways to and from
Maseru and six railheads at border posts; the customs union transport agreements
(based mainly on RSA's own regulations) favor railways for long distance
traffic. Within Lesotho, there is only 1 km of single track connecting Maseru
to the South African Railways.



-4-
Inland Waterways
2.10      This mode plays no part in the country's transport since most rivers
are not navigable.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
2.11      In the past, transport policy was directed almost exclusively tc
serving the main population and producition centers along the north-south
lowland corridor on the western border. Present policy is directed towards
opening up the country (para. 3.13), while pursuing the long-term goal of
reducing transport dependence on RSA (paras. 2.07-.08).
2.12      The Central Planning and Development Office of the Ministry of Plan-
ning and Statistics is generally responsible for overall policy and plan formu-
lation and for ensuring intersectoral c:oordination. Staff shortages impair the
Office's functioning, but its capacity has been improved by recent appoint-
ments.
2.13      Coordination among the transport modes is not a major issue, given
the lack of internal rail and water transport and the essentially complement-
ary tasks performed by air and road transport.
D. Previous Projects in the Transport Sector
2.14      There has been only one other Credit (82-BL, US$4.1 million) to the
transport sector, for the construction/reconstruction between 1967 and 1969
of 123 km of the main north-south road from Leribe to the Matsieng turnoff, and
a 27 km gravel feeder road between Leribe and Pitseng. The work was completed
satisfactorily for less than the estimated cost and it was possible to pave
the whole 123 km section of the main north-south road, instead of only 107 km
as originally envisaged.
3. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
3.01      The country's highways, classified in 1914 as primary, secondary or
tertiary roads, comprise some 2,725 km of which only 200 km are bituminous
paved, 370 km are two-lane gravel, and the rest are dry weather tracks
(Table 1). The 1,240 km primary system consists mainly of a peripheral road
in the west and south supplemented by an east-west link in the middle of the
country and a north-south link in the east. As mentioned earlier, the better



-5-
sections of the primary system, and virtually all other roads, are in the
lowlands. While the bitumen roads have been built to an adequate standard
and are satisfactorily maintained, the others were constructed to low standards
and maintenance is poor.
B. Traffic Growtlh and Characteristics
3.02      The vehicle fleet grew at an average annual rnte of 8% from 1970
to 1973, at which time there were about 5,700 vehicles in circulation (Table
3), or one motor vehicle per 200 inhabitants. In 1973 ~he fleet consisted
of 1,790 passenger cars, 2,620 light commercial vehicles and trucks, 170
buses and 1,120 other vehicles. Most trucks are owned either by Government
(32%) or by traders carrying their own goods. Although conditions for
entering the trucking industry are not onerous, there are few commercial
transporters because few nationals can raise the capital and such operations
are relatively unattractive to South African operators. As a consequence,
much of the freight ii carried by buses which are built to satisfy this dual
role. Under the Agrirultural Marketing Regulations, Government prescribes
maximum rates to be charged for the transport of agricultural produce. This,
along with the element of competition provided by the steadily-expanding
transport operations of the Government-owned Coop Lesotho, 1/ should ensure
that any savings in vehicle operating costs from improved roads are passed
on in lower freight rates.
3.03      Before 1970, the MW Roads Branch (RB) conducted traffic counts
only to provide traffic information for specific schemes.  The locations
generally were not adequately identified, so comparison with later counts is
not possible. Since 1970, the RB has carried out regular counts at 34
locations along the main and secondary roads. From those counts, a traffic
pattern has been established. The traffic volumes average less than 10 vpd
in the mountain area and about 70 vpd on some secondary roads; in contrast,
volumes averaging 200 vpd are found on the primary system in the western
lowlands,
3.04      The Lesotho Transportation Study, completed in early 1975 by
the UK consultants, Roughton and Partners, resulted in a ten-year road develop-
ment plan. This plan provides a sound developmental framewoik, but the appro-
priate scale and timing of individual projects will depend otL traffic growth
patternis. Accordingly, Government has begun implementing a British Govern-
ment-financed program to improve its procedures for collectinig data on traffic
levels and composition.
1/   Coop Lesotho is an agricultural cooperative under the Ministry of
Agriculture and is the biggest single public haulage organization.
It transports fertilizers, seeds, crops, etc., for membors and non-
members.



-6--
C. Administration
3.05      The MW is responsible for all classified roads (Table 1) other than
those administered by the Community and Rural Development Office (CRDO). CRDO,
using Food Aid Labor, has developed and maintains a network of earth tracks in
the mountainous areas. However, there is a program for MW to progressively
take over these tracks by 1980.
3.06      Individual MW branches (Chart 1) deal with the various aspects OL
road administration. The RB is discussed in para. 3.07 and the Planning Unit
in paras. 3.11-.12.  The Central Mechanical Workshop and Plant Pool (CMW &
PP) provides equipment for hire to Government agencies (including the RB)
and maintains the equipment. A Technicians Training School provides train-
ing facilities for technicians, including road maintenance personnel.
3.07      The RB, headed by a Chief Roads Engineer, has two major sections,
Planning and Design, and Maintenance and Construction.  The branch presently
plans, designs, constructs and maintains about 1,070 km of roads and maintains
the airfields on behalf of the Civil Aviation Department. As noted in para.
3.05, by 1980 it will be responsible for the whole classified network of
2,725 km. Planning and design are handled at the Ministry's headquarters
located at Maseru. Maintenance and construction are carried out through two
divisions, the Northern and Central and the Southern, each headed by an
engineer currently operating from headquarters.
3.08      One of the major constraints on RB work has been the shortage of
qualified staff, due to the scarcity of trained local personnel and the diffi-
culty of attracting expatriates on the terms offered. At present, some 40 of
the 74 posts authorized for the Branch, including some top level posts normally
filled by expatriates, remain vacant.  However, given this constraint, the
RB operates reasonably satisfactorily.
3.09      Some improvement is expected in the staffing situation as a result
of recent Government initiatives, including salary increases, the first
in 10 years. Also, Government has requested the British Government and the
United Nations to provide trained senior personnel under technical assistance.
However, the 2-3 year expatriate staff contracts generally result in lack of
continuity and high turnover costs. To increase the supply of suitably qualified
local personnel, the Government, together with some donors, is financing 6
nationals' study in professional technical fields and intends to sponsor 8
more. However, the country's education system does not produce enough can-
didates with backgrounds suitable for professional technicaLl training and
until this situation improves (para. 3.25), Government will continue to depend
on expatriates for professional staff (para. 5.06).
3.10      Road usage is regulated by the MW under the 1970 Road Traffic and
Transport Regulations. Under these reguLations, which are adequate, axle
loads are limited to 18,000 lbs as in RSA. Since heavy loads are usually
those to and from RSA, Lesotho has generally relied on enforcement in RSA to



-7-
protect its own roads. But as its internal road network and local vehicle
fleet expand, Lesotho will have to carry out its own enforcement. Government
intends to install weighbridges in Maseru, Mohale's Hoek and Leribe during
1976 and to supplement these later with portable weighbridges.
D. Planning
3.11      The Central Planning and Development Office in the Ministry of Plan-
ning and Statistics is responsible for overall planning and coordination, assis-
ted by planning units in other ministries. The MW Planning Unit is responsible
for preparing and evaluating capital projects, carrying projects through to the
approval stage, coordinating projects within the Ministry, framing annual capi-
tal estimates and monitoring the physical and financial progress of projects.
Neither the MW Planning Unit nor the RB has any capacity for major road plan-
ning or evaluation, which is carried out by consultants.
3.12      The Planning Unit staff consists of one expatriate economist on
short-term contract. To ensure continuity and develop a local capacity, the
Ministry should employ a local economist as a counterpart. The Association
has received an assurance from Government that this appointment will be made
during 1976.
3.13      Road investments planned for the Second Five-Year Plan (1976-80)
are those recommended by the Lesotho Transportation Study and are primarily
directed at opening up the country. Apart from the project road, it is
planned to upgrade parts of the peripheral road and to connect Semonkong in
the foothill area by gravel road to the main north-south road in the western
lowland. This represents significantly more construction than in the preceding
five years, approximately US$17 million compared with US$4 million, and is
probably a little ambitious. The road plan is generally sound, however, and
there are substantial indications that the requisite donor financing for
construction will be available. This work program will require a considerable
strengthening of the RB (paras. 3.08-.09), to which this project will contri-
bute.
E. Financing
3.14      Capital and current estimates are prepared in the MW, reviewed
by the Ministry of Finance, and then included in the General Budget for
Cabinet and Parliamentary approval. Annual appropriations are made in full
at the beginning of the fiscal year for capital works and quarterly in advance
for recurrent expenditure. External grants have financed practically all
capital expenditure and part of recurrent expenditure. The locally financed
component of appropriations can be reallocated between branches of MW with
Ministry of Finance approval. While capital funds unspent at the end of the
year require reappropriation, the allocation is automatic. The unspent
balance of recurrent allocations lapses at the end of the fiscal year.



-8
3.15      As shown in Table 4, RB construction expenditure increased from
R 345,000 in 1970/71 to R 828,000 in 1974/75. Expenditure over these five
years totalled R 3.1 million which represented about half of planned expend-
iture and about 15% of central government's total capital expenditure over
that period. Maintenance expenditure increased steadily (Table 4) but was
inadequate (about half the amount requested by the RB). However, allocations
for 1975/76 are almost double those of the previous year and are now adequate.
3.16      Road users contribute to Government revenue through cuQtoms unicn
duties on vehicles, fuel, lubricants and spare parts, and through local
license and registration fees. All customs and sales duties paid into the
common customs area (RSA, Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland) go to a common revenue
pool. Lesotho neither sets the rates nor collects the duties. No specific
data are available on exactly how much of Lesotho's share of the revenue
pool is attributable to its imports of road transport equipment and fuel,
but Government estimates suggest that revenue from this source was approxi-
mately R 1.1 million in 1974/75. Revenue from fees and local taxes on road
users accounted for an additional R 240,000 (Table 5). Total transport related
revenue for the last few years has substantially exceeded road administration
and maintenance expenditures.
F. Engineering
3.17      The RB has the capacity to design only minor roads and bridges.  Its
capacity is unlikely to increase significantly until stafiE shortages are over-
come. For the preparation of major road and bridge designs and construction
supervision, the RB relies on consultants. The design of the project road and
the preparation of construction documents were carried oul: by UK consultants
Roughton and Partners, financed by the British Government. Design for the
Mantsonyane-Thaba Tseka section was carried out to two alternative standards,
and the appropriate one, gravel 4 (Table 2) was agreed during appraisal. The
construction documents are being finalized accordingly.
G. Construction
3.18      Major works are done by contractors; the RB undertakes only minor
works using its own construction units which are equipment-intensive and
employ about 100 unskilled laborers. Al: present there are two such
units; a third will be set up in the near future with UK Crown Agents assist-
ance and British Government financing.
3.19      Only a few small local construction firms are active in the country;
most are engaged in building construction and are not equipped for road works
due to a shortage of trained professionals, subprofessionals and managers.
Although at some future time the Bank may be able to assist in developing a
local road construction industry, there is little it can do until sufficient



-9-
trained manpower becomes available (para. 3.25). Government, however, is
anxious to improve the building trade's capacity and for this reason has
requested the British Government to finance the setting up of a "Building
Contractors' Advisory Panel" within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry
and the appointment of two Clerk of Works (Buildings) Advisors within MW.
The Panel would assist and advise local contractors on tender preparation;
organization, measurement and evaluation of work; equipment procurement and
usage; and control of finance. The Advisors would train local clerks of
work and contractors' site agents in organization and control of work. The
requests are under consideration by the British Government.
3.20      In view of the present interest in labor-intensive construction
(Chapter 4), the appraisal mission considered the possibility of constructing
the project road by this method but concluded that the road does not present
a suitable opportunity in view of the heavy earthworks component and the
absence of a suitable organization.
H. Maintenance
3.21       RB maintains 1,070 km of which 200 km are bituminized; it also main-
tains the countryTs 31 airfields.  The rest of theinetwork ism-alintained by
traders and church organizations for a nominal annual fee of R 6.0 per km and
by Food Aid Labor under the CRDO of the Prime Ministerts Office. As mentioned,
the tracks now maintained under the Food Aid Program are to be progressively
taken over by RB by 1980.
3.22      The main work involved in routine road maintenance consists of
keeping the running surface in good condition by patching potholes, correcting
wheel-tracking on gravelled roads, cleaning drains and culverts, and cutting
grass. Minor improvements, such as improving sight distances and providing
new drains, are often done as part of routine maintenance. RB policy is to
carry out periodic maintenance, consisting of resealing paved roads and resur-
facing gravel/earth roads, once every five years but shortage of funds has
led to a backlog of such maintenance. While the level of maintenance on
paved roads seems satisfactory, it is poor on others due to the high cost of
maintaining roads of low construction standards and to poor availability of
trained personnel, equipment and equipment repair facilities. Government is
taking some steps to improve maintenance (paras. 3.15 and 3.24) and the pro-
posed project provides for maintenance assistance (para. 5.05). The borrower
has given an assurance that the project road and the access road from
Masianokeng to St. Michaels will be adequately maintained.
3.23      To cope with increased maintenance demands from the take over of
roads and from the extensive road development proposed over the next five
years, Government intends to reorganize the RB. Its activities, now directed
entirely from headquarters, will be decentralized. The country will be
divided into three districts and district offices set up at Leribe, Maseru,
and Mohale's Hoek, each under the direct control of a senior technical officer
and ultimately under a district engineer. This should result in improved
maintenance.



- 10 -
3.24      Because poor equipment availability has limited road construction
and maintenance in Lesotho, the British Government in 1969 financed a study of
Government equipment, vehicles and workshops. The study recommended that Gov-
ernment establish a plant pool with a management which has full responsibility
for the purchase, maintenance and a:Llocation of equipment to Government agen-
cies on a hire basis. In 1972 Government established the CMW & PP and there-
after absorbed the MW's equipment into the pool. To date, the pool has not
operated as effectively as envisaged with consequent inefficiencies in. zoad
construction and maintenance.  To a large extent, this is due to lack    work-
shops and equipment and shortage of mechanics, which Government is takirg
steps to remedy with British Government financial assistance. Under the
present project, the British Government will also finance a district work-
shop at Thaba Tseka and technical assistance for mechanics training (paras.
5.05-.06). However, the poor service provided by CMW & PP is also in large
measure attributable to operational shortcomings. 1/ During negotiations Gov-
ernment agreed to review CMW & PP organization and procedures with ODM and
formulate and implement, after agreement with the Association, a plan to make
the pool more responsive to user requirements.
I. Training
3.25      Reflecting the general manpower problem in Lesotho, MW suffers from
a shortage of professional and subprofessional staff and relies heavily on
expatriates provided under technical assistance. Government has taken several
steps to improve the situation. It is financing professional studies for
nationals; 6 civil engineers are presently receiving training overseas and
another 8 are to be trained during the 1976-80 Plan period., At the subpro-
fessional level, a three year post-secondary course in civil engineering
(shortly to be expanded to include electrical and mechanical engineering)
recently commenced at the MW Technicians Training School within the Lerotholi
Technical Institute. The Institute, which also provides training for artisans
(mechanics, blacksmiths, welders, etc.), is being expanded under an IDA
Education Project (Credit 497-LSO, 1974). 2/
3.26      Due to lack of candidates with appropriate qualifications, the
initial output of technicians from the MW School (about 15 p.a.) will be
1/   The requirement that users transport hired equipment, the lack of hire
charges intermediate between 24 hour and three month rates, and the un-
satisfactory system of assigning and charging out operators are examples
of factors which limit use of the pool.

No. 363a-LSO, June 14, 1974.

insuffitient to satisfy MW's needs. Government has recognized the lack of
mathematical/science/practical content in present secondary education and,
under a general program also supported by the above-mentioned IDA Education
Credit, is re-orienting secondary education accordingly. However, it will
be some time before this program produces sufficient candidates for technical
training. In the meantime, intake and output at the School would be sub-
stantially increased by offering remedial courses, particularly in mathematics,
and the present project provides for such assistance (para. 5.06).
4. LABOR-INTENSIVE CONSTRUCTION
4.01      Apart from the Food Aid Program (para. 2.02), there has been little
interest until recently in labor-intensive construction methods in Lesotho
because of the strong demand for Basotho workers by South African mining
companies. Presently, some 175,000 Basotho men (60% of the male labor force)
and 25,000 women are employed in RSA; the number has increased by 6-7% a
year over the last decade. This makes Lesotho extremely vulnerable to condi-
tions in RSA. This vulnerability was brought home sharply in the beginning
of 1974 when, following disturbances in the RSA mines, between 10,000 and
15,000 migrant workers suddenly returned. The total male work force in wage
employment in Lesotho was only about 16,000, and the domestic labor market
was incapable of absorbing the sudden influx, even though it was small in
relation to the number of Basotho who could return from RSA. Accordingly,
the Government requested the UNDP and the Bank to organize a mission to:
(a) make proposals on how to deal with any immediate unemployment problems;
(b) recommend a contingency plan which would enable the Government to handle
such emergencies; and (c) identify broad strategies to maximize long-term
employment opportunities within Lesotho.
4.02      Although that particular emergency had abated by the time the
UNDP-financed Inter-Agency Migrant Workers Re-employment mission visited
Lesotho in September 1974, the mission concluded that similar emergencies
could well arise in the future and that Lesotho was particularly ill-equipped
to handle them. There was no labor-recruiting agency, little previous know-
ledge of or experience with labor-intensive techniques, a lack of managers and
supervisors trained in organizing and handling large labor gangs, and no
ready supply of projects designed for labor-intensive construction. Accord-
ingly, the mission recommended the establishment of a Labor-Intensive Con-
struction Unit (LCU) and ant employment service. 1/ Although the work of the
LCU would not be confined to or even give priority to road construction, it
is included as part of this highway project for administrative convenience
(paras. 5.15-.25).

5. THE PROJECT
A. The Road Component
Objectives
5.01      This component is designed to promote development of the centr-l1
mountain area by linking it to the national capital with an all-weather road,
to ensure proper maintenance of the rcoad, and to improve MW operations.
Description
5.02      The road component comprises:
(i)  improving the gravel road between St. Michaels and
Mantsonyane (95 km) and reconstructing the earth
track between Mantsonyane and Thaba Tseka (52 Ian);
(ii) providing consulting services to finalize the construction
documents and supervise the work in (i);
(iii) providing road maintenance facilities along the project road;
and
(iv)  strengthening MW through technical assistance.
(i)  Road Improvement/Reconstruction
5.03      The two road sections will connect Thaba Tseka, the official admin-
istrative center of the central mountain region and focal point of the Moun-
tain Area Development Project, with the capital, Maseru.  The St. Michaels-
Mantsonyane section (95 km), an engineered two-laae gravel road built between
1952 and 1962, has seriously deteriorated and in wet conditions is passable
only by 4-wheel drive vehicles due to poor surface condition, steep gradients
and sharp bends. Improvement to both the vertical and horizontal alignments
is necessary to assure all weather accessibility. Stretches of the road with
gradients in excess of 10%, totalling 25 km, will be bituminized and the rest
gravelled. This section will be built to gravel 3 standard (Table 2). The
Mantsonyane-Thaba Tseka section (52 km), a single-lane earth track with grades
up to 20% and passable only by 4-wheel drive vehicles, is closed for up to 60
days a year by rain or snow. The construction will involve considerable re-
alignment and earthworks to improve gradients and sight distance and avoid
accumulation of snow. It will be built to gravel 4 standard (Table 2).
(ii) Consulting Services
5.04      Consulting services will be provided to finalize the construction
documents, to assist in prequalifying contractors, bidding procedures and
evaluation, and to supervise construction.



- 13 -
(iii) Maintenance Facilities
5.05      To ensure that the road is well maintained, the project will pro-
vide along the road a mechanical workshop and two maintenance depots, includ-
ing housing for workers and their families, small offices and storage for
tools and essential materials. The project will also provide road maintenance
equipment, workshop tools and equipment, and radio communications equipment.
(iv) Technical Assistance
5.06      To help implement the project and generally increase MW's limited
operational capacity, the project will provide five experts, each for two
years: a costing adviser for the RB, a mathematics instructor for the MW Tech-
nicians Training School, and three mechanics training supervisors.
Cost Estimates
5.07      The road component costs are estimated at US$7.3 million, or US$6.9
million excluding taxes. The foreign exchange component is US$5.45 million
or 79% of cost, net of taxes, which are estimated at about 6% of total cost.
Cost estimates are detailed below:

- 15 -
5.08      These estimates reflect costs in January 1976, the date of
negotiations, and were arrived at as follows:
(i) Road Improvement/Reconstruction: the costs of road improvement/
reconstruction, including foreign costs, were estimated by
consultants in January 1975 on the basis of their detailed
engineering. As no major road construction contract has been
carried out in Lesotho since 1968, rates and unit-prices were
arrived at after a detailed study of prices published by the
National Institute for Road Research, RSA, and after a review
of information obtained from contractors on rates for major
road contracts executed recently in the surrounding areas.
The cost estimates, which have been updated to January 1976
levels, are reasonable. -Provision has been made for a physical
contingency of 10% to cover quantity variation and a price
contingency of about 35% to cover price escalation throughout
the execution period. Price contingency for foreign and local
costs has been estimated on the basis of 16% p.a. for 1976,
1977 and 1978. 77% of the total costs are foreign and about
7% are taxes.
(ii)  Consulting Services:  to enable construction to start as early
as possible, the construction documents are currently being
finalized and assistance with tender procedures is being
provided under contract for US$13,000 equivalent, which
should be financed retroactively. Costs for construction
supervision are based on estimated staff requirements and
on recent average man-month expenditures by the consultants
who carried out the detailed engineering and are in accord
with international market conditions.  Included are 10% for
physical contingency and a price contingency of 10% p.a.
(iii) Maintenance Facilities: the estimates are based on MW's recent
experience and include a 10% physical contingency and a price
contingency of 16% p.a. for buildings and 14% (1976), 12%
(1977) and 10% (1978) for equipment. Local costs for the equip-
ment include local handling and transport costs.
(iv)  Technical Assistance:  costs are based on similar services
already being provided in Lesotho. A physical contingency
of 10% to cover possible extensions of service and a price
contingency of 10% p.a. have been included.
Financing
5.09      The financing plan for this component is detailed in para. 5.26.



- 16 -
Implementation
5.10      The MW, assisted by consultants, will be responsible for project
execution. The road improvement/reconstruction will be put out to contract,
to be let on a unit-price basis and awarded through international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA Guidelines for Procurement. There are
no domestic road contractors or manufacturers, so a preference margin pro-
vision for domestic contractors and manufacturers is not needed.
5.11      Since the MW does not have the capacity to supervise the constru -
tion, it will be done by consultants employed under terms and conditions
satisfactory to Lesotho, the British Government and IDA. The services will
be jointly supervised by the British Government and IDA. The employment of
supervising consultants is a condition of credit effectiveness.
5.12      The road construction contract is expected to be awarded by
September 1976 and work completed by the end of 1978. The road runs through
tribal land, but Government has the right of eminent domain so no problems
are expected in acquiring land for right-of-way.
5.13      During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government on a
project implementation schedule (Chart 2) and progress reporting procedures
(Annex).
Disbursements
5.14      See para. 5.27.
B. The Labor-Intensive Component
Objectives
5.15      The aim of this component is to prepare Lesotho to deal adequately
with any recurrence of the recent employment emergency, along the lines rec-
ommended by the UNDP/IBRD Migrant Workers Re-employment Mission (Chapter 4).
Description
5.16      The component will consist of establishing a LCU and concomitant
strengthening of the employment service functions of the Labor Commissioner's
Office.



- 17 -
5.17       The LCU will consist of 35 staff (Table 8), together with a labor
force of about 200, 1/ engaged in ongoing labor-intensive construction. The
work program will be relatively small but the LCU is to be planned so as to
expand quicklv in the event of an employment emergency. Specifically, the
main functions of the LCU, which will be an independent entity within MW, are:
(a) to gain experience by carrying out labor-intensive
public works construction, soil conservation, etc.;
(b) to formulate administrative procedures on which to
base large-scale adoption of labor-intensive techniques;
(c)  to develop an inventory of appropriately designed projects; and
(d)  to provide on-the-job training for local staff of the LCIJ and
for appropriate staff from other Ministries and Agencies.
The Project will finance the establishment of the LCU and its operation for
three years, after which a decision will be taken as to its future.
5.19      To complement the LGJ, the Migrant Workers Re-employment Mission
recommended the establishment of a National Employment Service. Since that
mission's visit in September 1974, Government has established labor offices
in each district. At present these two-man offices are attempting to monitor
the employment situation while also handling numerous other labor-related
matters, such as mediation of disputes, workers' compensation, and enforcement
of minimum wage legislation. Government has requested that, instead of estah-
lishing a separate National Fmployment Service at this stage, an expert be
attached to the Labor Commissioner's Office to examine its inadequate employ-
ment service operations and recommend improvements. This may or may not entail.
the establishment of a separate National Emplovment Service. In accordance
wiLth the Government s request, the project will provide consulting services
to formulate and implement employment service procedures and to Prepare a com-
prehensive plan for future activities. Provision is also made for exoansion
and training of staff engaged in employment service functions.
Cost Estimates
5.19      Costs of the labor-intensive components are estimated at UJS$1.7
miILion (there are no taxes), of which USS1.1 million are foreign costs. Cost
estimates are detailed below:
1/   This is about half the size oriTinally envisaged by the Migrant Workers
Re-employment Mission. Government and IDA believe that this reduced scale
is more consistent with the size of other institutions in Lesotho and with
the available supply of skilled and semi-skilled local staff.

Implementation
5.22      Thae l.ClJ will be a special unit in the MW, reporting directly to
a Coordinating Committee chaired bv the Senior Permanent Secretarv in the
Prime Minister's Office and including senior representatives of relevant
Ministries (MW, Finance, Planning and Statistics, Commerce and Industrv, Agri-
culture, CRDO) as well as the Labor Commissioner and the senior engineer in
charge of the LCU. The MW will be responsible for staffing and implementing
the lCU. However, in view of MW's current work load and the general short-
age of Professional mannower in Lesotho, the three senior positions for the
LCU (Table 8) will have to be filled bv expatriates. Because it would he
difficuilt to obtain individuals of the necessarv caliber who could nuickly
form an integrated team, the best course is to employ a team of consultants
for three vears to fill these nositions, take responsibility for the operation
of the LCl! and train local counterparts. During negotiations, terms of
reference for these consultants were agreed with Government who also gave
dsslil.lncez that tile (onsultants would be employed under .-ondftic,ns satisfactorv

as much as possible but, subject to the approval of the Coordinating
Committee, shall have authority to hire from other sources.
5.24      During negotiations, aRreement was reached with Government on a

C. The Total Project
Financing
5.26                 The combined cost of the road and labor-intensive components is
US$8.6 million (US$9.0 million including taxes), with a foreign component of
US$6.5 million, about 76%. The project will be financed by IDA (US$5.5
million), ODM (UK) (US$1.5 million), and the Kingdom of Lesotho (US$1.6
million net of taxes, or US$2.0 million including taxes).  Executioni and
delivery of a Grant Agreement between the Lesotho Governument and ODM4 is a
condition of credit effectiveness. During negotiations, the Lesotho Govern-
ment gave assurances that it would make available its contribution and provide
facilities, services and other resources promptly as needed, and upon completion
of the project assure continued maintenance of the project road and its access
link (Masianokeng-St. Michaels). Lesotho has requested SIDA and UN])P assistance
of US$0.5 million and US$0.2 million, respectively, which would reduce Lesotho's
contribution to the project by a corresponding amount. Further, if the Govern-
ment's negotiations with BADEA for US$2.5 million are successful, a corres-
ponding amount of the IDA credit will be cancelled. The financing plan is

(a) 86% of expenditures on road improvement/reconstruction;
(b) 100% of foreign costs of consulting services for finalizing
construction documents; and
(c) 100% of the costs of consulting services for the LCU.
Retroactive financing of approximately USS13,000 will be required
for item (b).  The estimated schedule of disbursements, reflecting the agreed
implementation schedule for the project, is shown in Table 7. Any surplus
funds remaining in the credit account upon completion of the project will be
cancelled. If Government's negotiations with BADEA for US$2.5 million towards
the cost of the road are successfully concluded, a corresponding amount of
the IDA credit will be cancelled and the proposed disbursements amended
accordingly.
6. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. The Road Component
Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.01      The road improvement will provide an all-weather link between Thaba
Tseka, the designated administrative center for the central mountain region,
and the national capital, Maseru, in the western lowlands. The main benefits
from the St. Michaels-Mantsonyane section are the conventional savings in
transport costs. Benefits from the Mantsonyane-Thaba Tseka section accrue
primarily in the form of increased net value of production in the road's
area of Influence. As noted in para. 3.02, Government regulation of and
participation in transport of agricultural inputs and produce should ensure
that a significant proportion of the benefits from the road improvements
accrue to the local population. Additionally, a major unquantified benefit
will be better integration of the remote Thaba Tseka region (and mountain
areas to the east) with national economic, political, and social development,
including facilitation of civil administration and improved availability of
health and education services.
6.02      Population in the road's direct area of influence (conservatively,
10 km on either side of the road) is about 56,000. About 48,000 live along
the St. Michaels-Mantsonyane section. The remaining 8,000 people are con-
centrated on the relatively undulating area surrounding Thaba Tseka. The
altitude of most of the region between Mantsonyane and Thaba Tseka is above
2,500 m, and it is generally uninhabited, although used for summer grazing of
cattle and sheep. No income figures are available for the area of influence of



- 22 -
the St. Michaels-Mantsonyane section, but a recent survey of the population
in the Mantsonyane-Thaba Tseka area of influence suggests that 80% have an
annual income below US$85, more than half of this coming from earnings in RSA.
6.03      Thaba Tseka is the center of the US$8 million Mountain Area Develop-
ment Project, directed at increasing crop and livestock production and at
improving living conditions in the villages through basic investments in
water supply, sanitation and forests. The improved access provided by the
Second Highway Project road should enicourage farmers to switch from mairiv
subsistence maize to cash crop production of wheat, for which the lands are
much more suitable. (This change in cropping pattern occurred west of
Mantsonyane when that road was initially improved.)
6.04      As noted, this agricultural project is regarded as the first phase
of a long-term mountain area development program to be directed from Thaba
Tseka, whose central location will facilitate expanding road connections
to the north, east and south. In fact, between now and 1980, the Food Aid
Labor Program will concentrate on improving tracks into this area, whose
population is estimated at 60,000-70,000 and which may be regarded as the
proJect road's secondary area of influence.
6.05      The economic analysis compares the expected costs and benefits of
the road, in constant prices, with financial costs adjusted for indirect taxes
and subsidies to arrive at economic costs. Shadow pricing was not considered
necessary. Investment costs include supervision and physical contingencies.
Separate analyses have been made of the two sections of the road.
St. Michaels-Mantsonyane
6.06      In 1973, traffic on this section was measured at 50 light vehicles
and 29 heavy vehicles (11 trucks and 18 buses) per day. The evaluation
assumes the road improvement would initially generate new traffic equivalent
to 30% of existing traffic and that traffic would grow thereafter at 5% p.a.
for heavy vehicles and 8% p.a. for light vehicles. Applying the vehicle
operating cost savings shown in Table 6, the economic return on this section
is 13% (Table 9) and the first-year rate of return is 12X. The most likely
causes of any divergence from this forecasted rate of return would be construc-
tion cost or traffic level variations. If construction costs increase by 10%
or if traffic growth is only half that assumed, the economic return is still
attractive at 12% and 11%, respectively.
Mantsonyane-Thaba Tseka
6.07      This section has negligible traffic at present and must be viewed
as part of a total regional development package. It is not meaningful to
cite a rate of return on the road in isolation. Rather, a rate of return
has been calculated for the whole Mountain Area Development Project, based
on the report of the FAO/IBRD Cooperativre Program Preparation Mission on a
Phase I Development, and assuming a Phase II commences in 1980. Thus, the



- 23 -
costs of constructing and maintaining the road, as well as the costs of
agricultural inputs have been compared with benefits consisting of increased
value of agricultural production and vehicle operating cost savings to
traffic not associated with the Development Project. The resulting rate
of return is about 11% (Table 10). If Phase II is not proceeded with, the
rate of return on Phase I (including the road costs) is about 10%. An
analysis was made of the incremental benefits of building the road to a
higher standard than gravel 4, but this was found unjustified at present.
Maintenance Facilities
6.08      No separate rate of return analysis has been made of the investment
in maintenance facilities. However, this investment is reflected in the
maintenance costs incorporated in the economic analysis of the two road
sections (Tables 9 and 10).
Technical Assistance
6.09      The technical assistance benefits, which are not quantified, will
be improved RB performance and greater numbers of trained staff.
B. The Labor-Intensive Component
6.10      The main benefit of the experimental LCU will be Lesotho's increased
ability to cope with possible employment emergencies arising from a sudden
return of migrant workers from RSA. Further, labor-intensive methods suitable
for normal, non-emergency use may be identified. These benefits have not been
quantified.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RFCOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will:
(a)  during 1976 appoint a local counterpart in the MW Planning
Unit (para. 3.12);
(b) review, with ODM, CMW & PP procedures and formulate
a plan to improve them, for discussion and agreement
with the Association (para. 3.24);
(c)  employ consultants for the LCU under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association (para. 5.22); and



- 24 -
(d) make available the additional financing required to complete
both components of the project and expend sufficient funds to
ensure continued maintenance of the project road and the
Masianokeng-St. Michaels access road (para. 5.26).
7.02      During negotiations, Government and the Association agreed on a
project implementation timetable and on progress reporting procedures, for
both project components (paras. 5.13 and 5.24). Also agreed or. were terms
of reference for consultants for the LCU (para. 5.22).
7.03      Conditions of credit effectiveness are:
(i) the employment of consultants to supervise the road
improvement/reconstruction (para. 5.11); and
(ii) the execution and delivery of the Grant Agreement between
Government and ODM (para. 5.26).
7.04      The proposed project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$5.5 million
equivalent to the Kingdom of Lesotho, on the usual terms.

contingencies and supervision, less indirect taxes.
2/ Represents cost of maintaining the project road, less maintenance expendi-
tures which would have been made in absence of the project. Assumes periodic
maintenance is carried out continuously along the road, a quarter of the
total length being covered each year, beginning 1980 for the improved road.

Economic Return: 11%
1/ Economic cost is financial cost of construction plus physical contingencies and
supervision, less indirect taxes.
2/ Represents cost of maintaining the project road less maintenance expenditures
which would have been made in absence of the project. Assumes periodic main-
tenance is carried out continuously along the road, a quarter of the total
length being covered each year, beginning 1981 for the improved road.
3/ Based on the FAO/ World Bank Cooperative Programme Preparation Mission Report
on Lesotho First Phase Mountain Area Development Project, 1975, and assuming
implementation of a second phase from 1980.
4/ Represents savings to traffic which is independent of the agricultural project;
savings to traffic associated with agricultural project are reflected in net
value added to agricultural production.
5/ Evaluation assumes that benefits and costs of agricultural project would
continue to 2010; provides for reconstruction of road in 1994-1995.
