REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Lesotho for the equivalent of US$5.5
million on standard terms to help finance improvement and reconstruction
of a road and for establishment and initial operation of a labor-int:ensive
construction unit. The United Kingdom Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM)
will participate in the co-financing with a grant of US$1.5 million equivalent.
WART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "The Economy of Iesotho"
(331a-LSO) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 25, 1974.
An updating economic mission visited Lesotho during November 1975 and is
expected to issue its report shortly. The findings of the mission are
summarized below. The most recent country economic data are given in
Annex I.
3.        Lesotho is among the 25 countries designated as "least developed"
by the United Nations. Landlocked within the Republic of South Africa, it is
mountainous, with few natural resources, and wit' less than 15 percent of the
total land area suitable for crop production. Per capita income was estimated
at $100 in 1973/74. The general shortage of skilled manpower is one of the
main constraints to development and is aggravated by the continuing migration
of workers for employment in South Africa. Of a total population of about 1.2
million,approximately 175,000 Basotho-men (60 percent of the country's male
labor force) and 25,000 women are employed as migrant workers in South
Africa mainly in the mining and agriculture sectors. This contrasts with only
16,000 Basotho men at work in Lesotho's modern sector. Over the last six
years, the number of Basotho men employed by South African mines has increased
by some 40,000, while wage employment in Lesotho grew by approximateLy 2,000.
In 1974, net earnings of migrant workers reached an estimated $75 mi'tlion,
almost the level of the country's own GDP. For the foreseeable future approxi-
mately 80 percent of the natural increase in Lesotho's labor force well look
for employment in South Africa due to the higher wages in South Africa and the
small absorptive capacity of Lesotho's economy.
4.        The migrant labor force is thus of critical economic importance to
Lesotho. There are, however, certain disadvantages. The absence of much
of the able-bodied population aggravates the shortage of both unskilled
and semi-skilled manpower, and renders difficult the implementation of long
term programs for the economic development of the country. Furthermcre, the
country is now extremely vulnerable to conditions in South Africa over which
the Lesotho Government has no control. This was brought home sharply in the
beginning of 1974 when, because of disorders at some South African mines,
between 10,000 and 15,000 migrant workers suddenly returned to Lesotho. Al-
though the emergency situation was resolved and most of the migrant %.orkers

returned to employment in South Africa, the risk of similar occurrences, which
might be of longer duration, remains real. Also, mechanization in the South
African mines may in the future lead to a slackening in the demand for migrant
labor. Because of the uncertainties facing Basotho laborers in the South
African labor market, the Lesotho Government had detided to investigate the
use of labor-intensive techniques in the execution of public works. The
Government hopes that developing the capability to utilize labor-intensive
techniques will enable it to cope with future emergency employment situations,
as well as provide a long term strategy in the event that employment opportu-
nities for Basotho in South Africa level off.
5.        Agriculture, mostly subsistence in nature, provides the major source
of economic activity for about 85 percent of the resident population and con-
tributes about 50 percent of GDP. The sector is characterized by traditional
methods of cultivation, low productivity and serious problems of soil erosion;
production of the main crops (maize, sorghum, wheat) is inadequate to meet
domestic food needs. The most recent agricultural census indicates an in-
crease in production of almost 50 percent between 1969/70 and 1973/74, but
this is due largely to the vagaries of climatic conditions rather than to a
long term trend in agricultural output. In fact, crop production in 1973/74
was only 13 percent higher than in 1960/61, implying a long term growth
slower than the 2.2 percent per annum increase in the population. In recent
years, the Government has implemented a program of rural development which
offers some prospects for improving agricultural productivity and arresting
the deteriorating soil conditions.
6.        Manufacturing, mining, construction and public utilities together
contribute less than 5 percent of GDP. A recent agreement with the DeBeers
mining group provides for an investment of $40 million in diamond production
and the creation of about 500 jobs; production is scheduled to begia in 1977.
Manufacturing and industrial production has been limited by the smaLl size
of the domestic market and the relative unavailability of low-cost Local
labor due to the migrant situation. There are, however, some prospects for
developing small scale industries, particularly in the fields of handicrafts,
construction materials and light manufacturing.
7.        In recent years, there has been a rapid development in tourism; the
number of visitors staying in hotels increased from about 4,000 in L969 to an
estimated 75,000 in 1974. The Government has recently established a Tourist
Development Authority to promote the industry. A luxury hotel is presently
under construction in the capital, Maseru, and plans are in hand to broaden the
base for tourism development by opening up the country's scenic mountain region.
8.        Lesotho, together with South Africa, Botswana and Swaziland, be-
longs to the Southern Africa Customs Union. Merchandise trade which is
carried on mainly with the Republic, shows an increase in recorded Lmports
from $32 million in 1970 to $116 million in 1974 as against a corresponding
rise in the value of exports from $6 million to $14 million. So far these
deficits have been more than offset by migrant remittances and transfers to
the Government as well as to the private sector. The Customs Union is the
source of about 60 percent of government revenue which increased from $16



-3-
million in 1969/70 to $42 million in 1974/75. Recurrent expenditure in the
same period rose from $16 million to $27 million.  IJK grants in support of the
current budget were discontinued in 1973/74 when a surplus of S8 million was
realized; in 1974/75 the current surpltus was $15 million. Over the next few
years, the Government should be in a position to finance a small portion of
its capital investment program. However, this will depend to a large extent
on thie outrome of cuirrent negotiations to amend the Customs Union Agreement in
order to reverse the present slowdown in the growth of the revenues from the
Uillon pool.
9.         The Government is currently preparing its second National Develop-
ment Plan (NDP) for 1976-80.  Provisional data indicate that during the
period 1969/70 to 1973/74 GDP grew at about 6 percent annually in real terms;
progress was made in improving the educational system, the chronic budgetary
deficit was eliminated; and the Covernmeent's financial and implemen.-ation
capacity improved considerably. The growtlh of domestic employment has not,
however, kept pace with the increase in thle labor force.
1(1.      Che guiidelines for the second NUP indicate an investment program
of about $100 million, of which about one-third would be directed towards
agricul ture and rural development (as compared to 23 percent in the first
plan) .  Domestic employment creation would be emphasized by strengtlhening
the role of the T.esotho National Development Corporation (LNDC).  In the
past, a serious constraint to development has been the country's low absorp-
tLive capacity.  However, in recent years the Government has increased its
capacity to identifv investment opportunities.  The results of a nunber
of pre-investment studies which have been carried out in various sectors
of thle econony are now available (transportation, tourism, power, m-Lnerals,
telecommunications) and should enlhance the specific project content of th-ie
second NDP. A substantial program of technical assistance is operal:ing an(d
ediucation, training and governiment adminiistration are continuing to improve.
As a result, we expect the country's overall implementation capacitLl to
continue improving.
ll.   -   Debt service is presently at a lows level; in 1974, service paynments
on external public debt came to under $0.5 million, which represents only
about 2 percont of currenlt revenue.  Since Lesotho likely will cont nue to
receive most of its -apital assistance as grants or concessionary credits,
the servicing (of external public debt will probably not exceed 2 pe-(cent of
governmiient revenues over the next several years.
1 2.       ,esotho's lack of natural resources and tihe constraints imposed by
the' miigrant lahor siI-u;ation under line its difficult task of developi,ent.
Current revenue is critically dependent on the Customs Union, and it is un-
certain whether revenue from thiis source will continue to grow in tl,e future.
Ont the other hand, thie recent revision in civil service salaries, the first
since 1964, will cause current expenditures to rise, placing limits on the
amnount whichi can be transferred to the capital budget.  As a consequence,
donor agencies should be prepared to continue financing in most projects not
only all the foreign costs, but also a part of the local costs.
.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LESOTHO
13.       To date Lesotho has received IDA credits for three projects total-
ing $13.7 million . The first, in FY66, was a $4.1 million credit for the
First Highway Project which provided for paving a section of the main north-
south road; the project was successfully completed in 1969. The second was
a $5.6 million credit, approved in FY73, for the Thaba Bosiu Rural Develop-
ment Scheme. This project is currently meeting its targeted obj-ctives of
providing 12,000 rural families with a minimum package of inpul's, credit <:w d
extensioni services in order to increase their incomes and the productivity of
their land. The third, a $4.0 million credit for an Education Project, was
approved in FY75. The project has made a promising start on expanding
Lesotho's vocational and commercial training capacity, and improving the
country's rural educational program. At the end of 1974, IDA's share of
Lesotho's total external debt (disbursed and undisbursed) was 87 percent
(due to the fact that most external aid in the past has been provided on
grant terms). Servicing of IDA credits accounted for only 11 percent of
total debt service. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits
and notes on the execution of the two ongoing projects.
14.       In our proposed operations we are aiming to support the stated
objectives of the Government's draft second NDP which are: (i) creating new
employment opportunities in both the modern and traditional sectors; (ii) in-
creasing agricultural productivity and introducing erosion control neasures;
(iii) improving the quality of education and expanding vocational training
and educational opportunities in rural areas; and (iv) improving communica-
tions among regions within the country.
15.       Preparatory work is now underway on several potential projects.  We
are helping the Government to prepare a follow-up project to the current Thaba
Bosiu Rural Development Scheme to distribute basic agricultural inputs to the
rest of Lesotho's lowland and foothill areas. We also expect to make a loan
to the Lesotho National Development Corporation for industrial and commercial
subprojects. In addition, we propose to continue assisting Lesotho's educ-
ational system and expanding the transport network.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
16.       Transportation facilities in Lesotho are limited.  At present the
country's transportation network consists of roads (mostly tracks), a short
rail connection to the South African border and 31 small airfields. Only
two of Lesotho's airfields are paved and only one has navigation/communica-
tion equipment. All the others have grass or gravel surfaces and are re-
stricted to small aircraft. Given the expense of air transport, the country
depends almost   entirely on roads for internal communications and for access
to South Africa's extensive transport system, which carries all of lesotho's
international trade.



-5-
17.       The road network comprises about 2,700 km and is concentrated in
the western lowlands where the bulk of the population lives. Eighty percent
are tracks, generally below standard and consequently difficult to maintain.
On the other hand, the 200 km of bituminous roads are well built and satis-
factorily maintained. The heaviest trafficked nonurban road section carries
about 850 vehicles per day (vpd). Some gravel roads handle 100 vpd while most,
particularly in the mountains, have considerably less traffic. Pack animals
handle much of the short-haul regional transportation in the mountain areas.
18.       The Ministry of Works (MW) oversees all roads other than low
grade roads constructed under the food-aid program and administered by
the Community and Rural Development Office. Various branches within the
MW control different aspects of road administration:
(i) The Roads Branch (RB) plans, designs and maintains the
roads and also maintains Lesotho's airfields;
(ii) The Central Mechanical Workshop and Plant Pool (CMW and PP)
provides equipment for hire to government agencies and
maintains the equipment;
(iii) The MW Technicians Training School provides training
facilities for technicians, including road maintenance
personnel; and
(iv) The MW Planning Unit prepares and evaluates capital projects,
coordinates projects within the ministry, frames annual
capital expenditure estimates and monitors the physical and
financial progress of projects.
At present the Planning Unit staff consists of one expatriate economist on
short term contract. The Borrower has agreed to appoint a suitably quali-
fied Basotho econbmist to the Planning Unit (Section 4.04, Development Credit
Agreement).
19.       The RB maintains Lesotho's roads and gravel tracks.  Over the
next five years, the RB will assume responsibility for maintaining 1100 km
of earth tracks from the Community and Rural Development Office. The
Government intends to decentralize the RB to improve its operational capa-
bility. The RB will have'three district offices, each initially under the
control of a senior technical officer, and ultimately under a district
engineer.
20.       The RB has had difficulty in maintaining the country's road net-
work, primarily because equipment and mechanics were not available as
required. This is largely a result of operational problems within the CMW
& PP. The Borrower proposes to review CMW & PP procedures with ODM. The
Borrower agreed to submit to the Association by December 31, 1976, a plan
for improving the CMW & PP (Section 4.05, Development Credit Agreement).



-6-
21.       Because of limited design and construction capacity, the RB under-
takes only minor works using its own equipment-intensive units. There are
two units now; a third will be set up soon under UK Crown Agents assistance.
A few small local building construction firms exist, but they are not equipped
for road works due to a shortage of engineers anL supervisors. Consequently,
all major works are executed by expatriate construction firms. After examining
the possibilities for stimulating a local road construction industry, we have
concluded that the first step is to expand the supply of skilled manpower.
The First Education Project began this task by providing support for the KW
Technicians Training School,  The project will cbntinue this assistance b-
adding an instructor to the school.
22.       A team of British consultants completed a national transportation
study for Lesotho in 1974. The study's proposed work program aims to open
up the country by upgrading rural roads in the lowlands and constructing
gravel roads and tracks in the mountainous areas. The preliminary alloca-
tion for roads in the second NDP is $17 million, a significant increase above
the estimated $4 million expended during the first plan period. The Govern-
ment expects external sources to finance a large proportion of the total road
budget.
23.       Road users in Lesotho pay fees in several forms:  (i) vehicle
registration fees; (ii) an excise tax on fuel and lubricants; (iii) customs,
excise duties and sales taxes on motor vehicles and components. Due to
Lesotho's participation in the Southern Africa Customs Union, customs and
sales duties on goods imported into the common customs area, as well as
excise and sales duties on goods produced within the area, are paid into
a central revenue pool. Total transport-related revenue for the last few
years has substantially exceeded road administration and maintenance ex-
penditures.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       The project consists of two separate components:  the improvement
and reconstruction of a road and the establishment and operation of a labor-
intensive construction unit (LCU). Although these components are unrelated
in origin and scope, we have combined them into one project to facilitate
their administration.
25.       The road component was identified in mid-1974 on the basis of the
study mentioned in para. 22. Improvement of this road initially was to be part
of a larger Mountain Area Rural Development Project which was prepared under
the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program and included livestock and crop production
components. Subsequently, the Canadian International Development Association
agreed to finance the agricultural component as a separate project and the
Association, the road component. British consultants financed by ODM completed
the detailed engineering in early 1975. The Association reviewed and commented
upon the engineering studies before appraising the proposed project in April
1975. ODM agreed to participate in the project on the basis of the Associa-
tion's appraisal.



- 7 -
26.       The LCU component is the result of a Bank-led mission which the
Lesotho Government requested in early 1974 to provide emergency advice on
absorbing Basotho migrant workers returning suddenly from the Republic of
South Africa (paras. 3 and 4 describe problems of migrant workers). The mis-
sion recommended creation of a LCIJ to gain familiarity with labor-intensive
methods and to provide a basis for coping with future emergencies (Report of
the Migrant Workers Re-employment Mission, No. 614a-LSO). A mission visited
Lesotho in October 1975 to discuss LCU's administrative and financial arrange-
ments. The mission recommended that the Government create a smaller LCU than
proposed by the Employment Mission to be more consistent with the availability of
skilled and semi-skilled local staff in Lesotho. The mission also recom-
mended that the project provide technical assistance to the Labor Commis-
sioner's office to recommend and implement improved procedures for the
collection of labor information.
27.       An Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Highway Project,
Lesotho" (Report No. 952a-LSO) is being circulated separately. A credit and
project summary is provided as Annex III. The proposed credit was negotiated
in Washington, D.C. in January 1976. The Government's negotiating team was
led by tHr. A. M. Monyake, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Planning and
Statistics.
Description
28.       The project's two components would provide for the following:
(i) The improvement of the gravel road between St. Michaels
and Mantsonyane (95 km) and reconstruction of the earth
track between Mantsonyane and Thaba Tseka (52 km).
Funds are also included for (a) consultant services to
finalize the construction documents and supervise the
work, (b) road maintenance equipment and facilities
along the project road, and (c) technical assistance to
strengthen MW. These two road sections would substantially
improve the transportation link between Thaba Tseka, the
commercial center of the central mountain region, and
Maseru, the country's capital and economic center.
(ii) The establishment and operation of a LCU for a three-year
period and the provision of technical assistance to
strengthen the Labor Commissioner's office. Through its
ongoing operations the LCU would prepare Lesotho to cope
with a sudden return of migrant laborers as well as in-
vestigate the merits of using labor-intensive methods as
a long term employment strategy. The LCU's work program
would be relatively small (employing about 200 laborers),
but the LCU would be capable of quickly expanding its
activities in the event of an employment emergency. The
LCU's objectives would be: (a) to train supervisory
staff in labor management techniques; (b) to gain experience
by carrying out labor-intensive construction work; (c)
to formulate administrative procedures for large scale
adoption of labor-intensive techniques; and (d) to
develop an inventory of appropriately designed projects.



-8-
Cost and Financing
29.        The total net project cost (road and LCU) is estimated at $8.6 mil-
lion, of which $6.6 million or 76 percent would be for expenditures on goods
and services outside Lesotho. A detailed breakdown of costs is given in
Annex III. Donors would provide at least $7.0 million, 81 percent of total
cost, although possible additional co-financing could raise the total to $7.7
million, 91 percent of total cost. The cost sharing arrangements for the
project components would be as follows:
(i) Road Improvement/Reconstruction
- IDA to provide $5.0 million to finance the foreign
cost and a substantial portion of the local costs
of the construction contract and the costs for revising the
construction documents; 1/
-  ODM to provide $1.5 million to cover the total costs of
the maintenance buildings and equipment, technical
assistance to MW and consultants' costs of supervising
the construction contract;
- Government to provide $390,000 for local costs.
(ii) LCU
- IDA to provide $500,000 for the total costs of the
engineering consultants;
- Government to provide $1.2 million for equipment,
fuel and labor costs of the LCU and the costs of
strengthening the Labor Commissioner's office. 2/
/   The Lesotho Government is negotiating with the Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa (BADEA) for a loan of approximately $2.5 million
to assist with the co-financing of the road improvement/reconstruction
contract. If BADEA and the Lesotho Government agree on the terms and
conditions of a loan, then an equal amount of the IDA credit would be
cancelled.
2/   The Lesotho Government is negotiating with Sweden and UNDP for grants
totaling $700,000 to substitute for part of the Government's con-
tribution to operating the LCU and assisting the Labor Commissioner's
office. If negotiations are successful Sweden would provide $500,000
towards the costs of operating the LCU for a three-year period; UNDP
would provide $200,000 for two years of technical assistance for the
Labor Commissioner's office and associated local costs. In the
event SIDA and UNDP assistance should not materialize, the Government
is able and willing to provide the necessary finance.



-9-
Project Execution
30.       The Roads Branch would implement the road improvement component
of the project. Engineering consultants, employed on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association and ODM, would supervise the actual work
(Section 3.02, Development Credit Agreement). Employment of these consult-
ants has been made a condition of credit effectiveness (Section 6.01 (b),
Development Credit Agreement). The RB expects to award the contract by
September 1976 and complete work by the end of 1978. The appraisal mission
considered improving the project road using labor intensive construction,
but concluded that this was not feasible due to the heavy earth works com-
ponent and the area's remoteness and harsh conditions.
31.       A Coordinating Committee would make LCU's policy decisions and
approve its work program. The Senior Permanent Secretary would chair the
Coordinating Committee which would comprise senior representatives of the
relevant ministries (MW, Commerce and Industry, Agriculture, Finance, Plan-
ning and Statistics, Community and Rural Development Office), the Labor Com-
missioner and the Senior Engineer in charge of the LCU. The Borrower agreed
to establish by September 30, 1976, the Coordinating Committee on terms
agreeable to the Association (Section 3.07(a), Development Credit Agreement).
32.       A team of three engineering consultants, employed on terms and con-
ditions satisfactory to the Association, would direct LCU's operations during
the initial three-year period. During their first four months, the con-
sultants would set up the administrative apparatus of the LCU, select the
estimated 35 permanent Basotho staff in conjunction with MW, and draft a
proposed work program of labor-intensive projects to submit to the Coordinat-
ing Committee for approval. By the completion of its second year of opera-
tion, the LCU would submit a preliminary evaluation report documenting its
operational costs and making recommendations on future operations. The LCU
would submit a final report on completion of its initial three-year operation
period (Section 3.07(b), Development Credit Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
33.       The road improvement/reconstruction contract would be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
Group guidelines. Contractors were prequalified in November 1975, and bids
would be called for in April or May 1976. The tender documents did not in-
clude a preferential margin for domestic contractors since there are none
who qualify. Construction of maintenance buildings and procurement of mainte-
nance equipment would follow normal ODM procedures; procurement of equipment
for the LCU would follow normal government tender procedures.
34.       Disbursements of the IDA credit proceeds would be made as follows:
(a) 86 percent of the total expenditures (net of taxes/duties)
of the road improvement/reconstruction;



- 10 -
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for the consultants
to revise construction documents (this amount - approxi-
mately $13,000 that has been spent after October 1, 1975 -
would be financed retroactively);
(c) 100 percent of the total expenditures (net of taxes) of the
consultants employed by the LCU.
Benefits and Justification
35.       Benefits from the improvement/reconstruction of the St. Michaels-
Thaba Tseka road would accrue largely to the 56,000 people living in the
immediate area of the road's influence in the form of savings from reduced
transport costs and increased net value of agricultural production. Improv-
ing the St. Michaels-Mantsonyane section is expected to reduce sufficiently
the cost of transport for existing and generated traffic to justify that
portion of the road. Reconstructing the M4antsonyane-Thaba Tseka road is
justified as part of a total regional development package. Thaba Tseka has
just been named the headquarters of Lesotho's Tenth District. It is also
the center of a $8.0 million Mountain Area Rural Development Project (see
para. 25). The Mountain Area Project aims at increasing crop and livestock
production and improving living conditions through infrastructure investments.
The improved road should enable farmers to improve livestock production and
to switch from subsistence maize production to wheat, for which con(litions
are much more suitable. A major unquantified benefit is the increased access
that the people in the remote Thaba Tseka region and the mountain areas would
have to Maseru, the nation's capital, and the social services available in the
more developed lowlands.
36.       The rate of return, assuming a 15 year economic life, is -3 percent
for the St. Michaels-Mantsonyane section and 11 percent for the Mant:sonyane-
Thaba Tseka section (calculated in conjunction with the Mountain Area Develop-
ment Project and assuming Phase 2 begins in 1980). If construction costs
increase by 10 percent or if traffic growth is half of that anticipated, the
rate of return for the St. Michaels-Mantsonyane section would be 12 and 11 per-
cent respectively. If the Mountain Area Rural Development Project is not
extended in a second phase, the Mantsonyane-Thaba Tseka rate of return would
be 10 percent.
37.       Although not quantifiable, several benefits of the LCU can be iden-
tified. Primarily, the LCU would give Lesotho a potential capacity to handle
large numbers of returning laborers, should the need arise. As mentioned in
paragraph 4, South Africa has annouinced its intention to further mechanize
its mining sector and reduce dependence on migrant labor. Thus, the possi-
bility of Lesotho's having to absorb large numbers of workers sometime in the
futuire is real. Without contingency plans, such a development would cause
severe economic and financial dislocations in the country. The LCU would
also train local staff as supervisors. In addition, the evaluation of LCU's
operations would help judge the feasibility of labor-intensive operations in
Lesotho's circumstances irrespective of an emergency reoccurring.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdon of
Lesotho and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of
a resolution approving the proposed development credit, are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
39.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms substantially to
the pattern of recent agreements used for highway projects. Special features
are referred to in paragraphs 18, 20, 30, 31 and 32 of this report.
40.       An additional condition of effectiveness is that the ODM Grant
Agreement between the Lesotho Government and ODM has, or will concurrently
with the Development Credit Agreement, become fully effective (Section 6.01(a),
Development Credit Agreement).
41.       1 am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit Agreement would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       1 recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
developrnent credit.

Ihe project is making good progress.  Sales of agricultural inputs
have greatly increasod.  Construction of senior staFf housing is completed,
as are 24 km of access roads. Soil conservation works are in progress but
will reqtuire n.ore research, as techniques thuls far adopted have proveen too

conservation activities is proceeding well. The project has already achieved
its major goal of setting up village distribution centers to facilitate the
spread of basic agricultural inputs throughout the project area.  The hiring
and retention of Lesotho personnel seems to be the major problem, as salary
levels are too low.  The Government has promised to take corrective measures.
