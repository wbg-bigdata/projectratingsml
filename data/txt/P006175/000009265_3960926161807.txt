MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENKDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIV'E DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO BOLIVIA
FOR A SECOND EMERGENCY SOCIAL FUND PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommenidation on a proposed
development credit to Bolivia for SDR 19.0 million (US$ 27.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance a second project
with the Emergency Social Fund (ESF). Several other donors have already
committed funds totalling US$22.1 million equivalent to ESF's program for
use during the project period, under separate agreements.
2.       Background:  For over two years the Bolivian Government has
sustained an uphill effort to carry out a comprehensive economic
stabilization, adjustment and reactivation program. It has achieved
considerable success, seen against the economic turbulence and decline of
the preceding era. By October 1985 inf'ation had reached 24,000Z, whereas
by late 1987 it had slowed to about 1OZ; and GDP, which had declined every
year since 1980, in 1987 finally reversed its trend and grew by at least
1.5Z.  The Government is now focussing on longer-term measures.  In July
1987 it issued an economic reactivatiorn decree designed to address key
issues for growth, notably implementation of externally funded public
investments and stimuletion of private investments and exports. Social
pressures, however, have continuously posed a serious threat to this
program.  Since 1986 the Government has increasingly turned its attention
to the short-term unemployment problems linked to the depression and the
stabilization measures, as well as the longer-term need to improve social
conditions. An Emergency Social Fund was set up, aimed at providing
emergency relief and carrying out an employment-generating program over the
three years 1987-89, as a bridge until the recovery gains momentum.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement:  J DA strongly supports this program
of far-reaching structural adjustment, both at the macro-economic level and
the sector level. It has embarked on a substantial lending program,
consisting so far of seven IDA projects and one IFC operation since 1985,
aimed at rehabilitating essential parts of the public sector and the
financial system, and reactivating the private sector. The centerpieces of
this program have been two Reconstruction Import Credits now being
implemented, for a total IDA contribution of $102 million, together with
Japanese cofinancing of $50 million. IDA has also chaired the Consultative
Group for Bolivia, which met in December 1986 and plans a second meeting in
May 1988.



-2-
4.       IDA's strategy for future assistance envisions continued support
for the promotion of non-traditional exports, based primarily on lowland
agriculture and backed up by a more efficient, lean civil service and a
rebuilt banking system. At the same time it attaches great importance to
structural reform in health and education, addressed especially to the
needs of the rural and peri-urban poor; this involves decentralization of
public-sector responsibilities to local governments and non-governmental
organizations, and a shift of funding priorities towards basic health care
and primary education.
5.       Among the IDA operations mentioned, of particular significance is
the credit approved in June 1987 for the Emergency Social Fund (ESF), since
it was the Bank group's first operation specifically designed to address
the social costs of economic adjustment. It provided SDR 7.8 million to
support ESF's first year of operation, with the intention of following this
up with a larger main phase, subject to good progress. The credit is
financing small-scale employment- and income-generating sub-projects and
social assistance activities, as well as institutional support (technical
assistance and selected fixed-term personnel). IDA's participation has
already encouraged contributions from other sources, including Switzerland
(providing Sw.Fr. 15 million as co-financing administered by IDA), the
Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom. the US Agency for
International Development, the Inter-American Develomnent Bank and the
United Nations Development Programme.
6.       Implementation has been rapid and effective.  By the end of
December (after ten months of operation) ESF had approved subprojects
costing US$37 million, creating 13,600 man-years ef employment and
providing direct health, nutrition and educational assistance to some
155,000 beneficiaries. It had disbursed US$10 million. As for the IDA
credit, by February 8, 88Z had been committed and 32Z disbursed.  It .s
expaected that the credit will be fully committed by the end of February and
80Z disbursed by May 1988.
7.       This creditable performance therefore warrants further IDA support
to ESF. It is hoped that such support will also act as a catalyst for
ot1p: donor financing of ESF's program.  The tim' g of :his project is
dictated by ESF's need for funds in the second quarter of 1988.
8.       Proiect Objectives:  The aim of the project is to help strengthen
the Government's ability to address the social costs of its adjustment
program, which continue to threaten the attainment of economic recovery and
longer-term development. In the process, ESF also offers a means to
implement certain short-term requirements of the restructuring of the
health and education sytie-s. Specifically, the project would support
ESF's second and third years of operation (1988-89), by (i) financing
social assistance activities and small-scale employment-generating projects
in infrastructure, construction and production; and (b) helping ESF
consolidate its management and implementation capacity.



- 3 -
9.       Project Description:  The credit will finance, on a grant basis, a
range of small-scale sub-projects sponsored by municipalities, community
organizations and NGOs, in four broad categories: (i) social assistance
(food and nutrition, basic health serv.ces, vocational training and support
to education); (ii) social infrastructure (drinking water and sewerage,
construction and repair of schools and health posts, low-cost housing, and
cultural projects); (iii) economic infrastructure (rural roads maintenance
and drainage, street paving and other urban improvement, irrigation,
erosion control and fort-tation, and other construction); and (iv) support
to production (working capital credit and other forms of support to co-
operatives and small manufacturers). Wherever feasible, the sub-projects
will be carried out by small private contractors using labor-intensive
methods. The oredit will also finance institutional support, consisting of
technical assistance and selected fixed-term personnel for various parts of
ESF's project cycle.
10.      The project, to be carried out over two years, is defined as that
portion of ESF's 1988-89 program for which financing is dssured, which
amounts to about US$59 million. It is hoped that the entire program will
reach US$90-140 million, the eventual amount depending on donations
forthcoming from other sources. If in due course other donors propose
fotmal cofinancing arrangements, IDA stands ready to consider any
Government request to amend the credit agreement as necessary. The foreign
exchange compon(ent of the project is estimated at US$6 million (10Z). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank group operations in Bolivia are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7066-BO, dated February 10, 1988, is also attached.
11.      Agreed Actions:  As conditions of effectiveness, ESF will (a)
revise and up-date its appraisal manual, to cover separately social
assistance, production, and infrastructure/construction sub-projects; and
(b) hire a consultant costing expert. Further, ESF has agreed to send IDA
by March 31, 1988, the outline of a report on (a) arrangements to be made
with ministries and other agencies for them to assume responsibility for
ESF-funded activities after 1989, when ESF is to terminate, and (b) options
and a recommended course of action for retaining functions and personnel of
ESF in other public agencies thereafter; the report itself is to be
submitted by July 31, 1988. Finally, IDA will conduct reviews of
procurement performance in May 1988, November 1988 and May 1989 and a
comprehensive mid-project review in November 1988.
12.      Benefits:  Benefits will be of four kinds:  (i) sub-projects under
the US$59 million project are expected to create direct employment of about
21,000 man-years (35-50,000 for the entire program); (ii) about 400,000
social assistance beneficiaries will receive food, improved health care and
other services under the project (600,000-950,000 under the entire
program); (iii) the users of the new infrastructure and housing will enjoy
better sanitation, lower transport costs, and less erosion damage; and
(iv) the GovFrnment will gain experience with an effective mechanism for



delivering development assistance to municipalities and small businesses
and mobilizing grass-roots efforts, which could subsequently be put to use
by other agencies.
13.      Risks:  ESP's procedures and criteria aim to strike a balance
between a speedy response in an emergency situation and the efficient use
of scarce funds. Experience with 1SF I has demonstrated that the risk of
poor use of funds is small, considering ESP's excellent management, capable
and motivated staff and its direct accountability to the President of the
Republic and the public. Furthermore, agreement has been reached on
strengthened appraisal and implementation procedures, and on technical
assistance targeted at key phases of ESF's project cycle. The procurement
reviews and comprehensive mid-project review are intended particularly to
protect againet any detrimental changes in ESF management.
14.      Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
