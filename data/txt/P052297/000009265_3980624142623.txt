Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan                                            Training and Employment Support Project
Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The Training and Employment Support Project (TESP) is a pilot project intended to introduce an
efficient and effective linkage between public expenditures for short-term training, and the business
community skill requirements. It is one component of the Government of Jordan's (GOJ's) Social Productivity
Program (SPP), which is a comprehensive strategy to address the problems of poverty and unemployment
through productivity improvements. The TESP will create a Fund (the Training Fund) that will issue monetary
awards to enterprises which will provide or purchase training and related services (e.g., intermediation, needs
analyses) which are necessary for the recruitment of the unemployed to fill genuine vacancies. The objective
of TESP is to pilot test the demand for, and the effectiveness and efficiency of, employer-based training
supported by a Training Fund. It will test whether training can be more cost-effective and efficient when it is
demand-driven, public training funds are competitively awarded between public and private providers, and
employment services are also offered by private offices whose operations have been until recently illegal (this
is the "productivity" part of the project). The project funds for training will be targeted to poor job-seekers
(this is the "social" part of the project).
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
Cost Inc.     %o
Component                                 Category   Contingencies      % of
(US$ M)      Total
Pilot Training Fund (TFC). It will provide funds for in-service     Other         5.0          83
training of short duration (up to six months) and related support
services such as occupational needs analysis and employment
intermediation. Training funds can be given to single enterprises
or groups of enterprises. Training can be provided by the
enterprise(s) or purchased from public and private providers. The
beneficiaries of training must be unemployed and be offered
employment in a genuine vacancy (incremental employment) or in
work currently undertaken by a non-Jordanian.
Monitoring, Studies and Evaluation (MSE).  This component        Capacity         0.3           5
would fund surveys and studies to evaluate the wage and           building
employment impact of the type of training support provided by
the project ("public funding" of training) in comparison to
existing training programs ("public provision" of training).
Project Implementation Unit (PIU).   The PIU  would be             Project        0.7           12
responsible for overall coordination/management of the project's  management
activities.
Total        6.0          100
3. Benefits and target population:
Project Benefits: The project would: (i) improve employment impact of public funds for training
which have so far been confined to mainly supply-driven, lengthy, pre-employment training; (ii) increase the
supply of skills (through greater involvement of the private sector) and reduce costs of training through

Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan                                          Training and Employment Support Project
competition among public and private providers of training; (iii) increase utilization of and provide income to
Jordanian unemployed workers (vis-a-vis immigrant labor); and (iv) improve and expand the information base,
strengthen policy making and improve public/private collaboration in the design and management of training.
Social Benefits: By design, the project would: (i) increase access to training and employment of the
unemployed poor; and (ii) enable the private sector and NGOs to develop and implement their own training
programs and increase their role in poverty reduction.
Other Benefits: The project would provide an additional and possibly an alternative mechanism for
public support for training (i.e., it will provide "public funding" for a wider range of training activities than
those that have been so far supported by giving block grants to public vocational centers for "direct public
provision" of training). This will increase the instruments at the discretion of the Government for increasing
social productivity. It can lead to efficiency gains, if the pilot proves successful, to the extent that future public
funding makes greater use of competitively-based awards compared to grants to existing but outdated public
training institutions and structures.
Target Population: The project is targeted at the unemployed poor. It will also encourage Jordanian
job-seekers willing to undertake work in jobs currently performed by non-Jordanians, and women to work in
non-traditional occupations.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: three years
Project Oversight & Coordination
The Government of Jordan (GOJ) has established a National Steering Committee (NSC) to oversee the
execution of the Social Productivity Program (SPP). The NSC is an inter-rninisterial committee chaired by the
Minister of Planning and composed of key Ministers (including the Minister of Labor) each responsible for the
implementation of a specific SPP component. The NSC sets overall policy guidelines and directions and
oversees SPP progress. To assist NSC in its functions, the Ministry of Planning established a Project
Coordination and Support Unit (PCSU) in charge of coordinating all activities executed under the SPP,
including transmitting policy directives and guidelines formulated by the NSC to the various Project
Implementation Units (PIUs) in charge of specific SPP components.
Project Implementation (full description in Operational Manual):
The Ministry of Labor (MOL) is the executing agency of the project. The Minister of Labor is a
member of the NSC and is responsible before the NSC for the affairs of the TESP.
An independent Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established within MOL to supplement its
capacity and to ensure effective and timely implementation of the project. The PIU will consist of five
members to be recruited on a competitive basis preferably from the private sector: Project Director, Financial
Officer, Procurement Officer, and two Project Assistants.
To assist the PIU in project implementation, a nine-member Training Fund Executive Committee
(TFEC) will be established with equal representation from the public and private sectors and will convene
regularly to: (i) evaluate and approve/reject training proposals submitted by the PIU; and (ii) discuss other
matters of relevance to the project.



Project Appraisal Document                                                                       Page 4
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan                                              Training and Employment Support Project
To ensure that project benefits are realized by all potential beneficiaries and to supplement the PIU's
outreach capacity to target groups, five-member Local Committees (LCs) will be established in Ministry of
Labor Employment Offices nation-wide, one per Governorate except for Amman which will have two (one in
Jabal Hussein and another in Sahab). The LCs will convene regularly to promote the project's objectives;
assist in the identification of target beneficiaries and potential employers; provide interested parties with the
necessary application forms and relevant instructions; receive training proposals from potential enterprises and
submit them to the PIU after establishing eligibility and recommending approval/rejection; coordinate with all
relevant bodies at the Governorate level; follow up the approval process and monitor the actual implementation
of the Fund's activities in enterprises in their respective Govemorates; and provide the PIU with the necessary
field information, periodically and as needed.
A typical sub-project cycle
1. Enterprises (or group of enterprises) will prepare and present proposals for financing training
programs to LCs in the relevant Govemorate; proposals covering more than one Govemorate or of
national significance will be submitted directly to the PIU which will arrange for eligibility to be
assessed by the relevant LCs.
2. LCs will screen proposals for eligibility according to specified selection criteria and present them
to the PIU for consideration recommending approval or rejection.
3. Following receipt of the screened proposals from LCs, the PIU Director may approve individual
proposals costing up to JOD 2,500 each, and will convene the Training Fund Executive Committee
(TFEC) to evaluate and approve/reject proposals costing above JOD 2,500 each.
4. For approved proposals, the PIU prepares a contract which will define the terms of the financial
agreement and the responsibilities of each party (enterprise, beneficiary, Fund), and agreed
timetable for implementation. The PIU will also notify LCs of its decision to approve/reject the
proposals. The contract will comprise the following information: (a) the job for which the selected
beneficiary is to be trained; (b) an outline of the training program would include, for example,
course description, location and duration; (c) agreement with public or private training providers, if
the program (or part of it) is subcontracted outside the enterprise; and (d) CV of trainers
(professional or in-company). The contract is signed in three documents by the enterprise, the
Director of the PIU, and the trainee (one copy for each). At the end of the training, the beneficiary
is awarded a certificate stating the duration and type/level of training, which is signed by the
enterprise and the PIU Director.
5. Payments: The beneficiary enterprise will submit all claims for payment under the Training Fund
Component (TFC). This will include the costs directly incurred by them and any fees or costs
charged by third parties such as training providers. Claims will be submitted to the PIU at the
enterprises' initiative provided this is no more frequently than monthly. The PIU will assess the
claim, undertaking whatever checks are necessary to verify it, and will process the claim within
two weeks of receipt unless it has some reason to question it. In this case, it must inform the
enterprise also within two weeks of the claim being received. The following conditions ensure that
funds will be allocated according to the project's objectives and reduce possible employer abuse of
project funds: (i) the employer will employ the trainee for at least six months; and (ii) the PIU will
regularly monitor the amount and quality of training provided to beneficiaries (trainees).

Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan                                         Training and Employment Support Project
To ensure timely implementation of the Fund, the LCs will process the proposals and submit them to
the PIU no later than one month from receipt of the proposal. The PIU will process the proposals of up to JOD
2,500 and notify enterprises within two weeks of receipt from LCs. For proposals above JOD 2,500, the
PIU/TFEC will process the proposals and notify enterprises no later than one month of receipt from LCs.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements
The PIU will be responsible for financial management of the project, reporting and auditing, following
systems and procedures acceptable to the Bank. Project accounts, including the Special Account, would be
audited in accordance with the "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the
World Bank (March 1982)." Within six months of the end of each fiscal year, IBRD would be provided by the
PIU with an audit report of such scope and detail as IBRD may reasonably request, including a separate
opinion by an independent auditor acceptable to IBRD, on disbursements against certified SOEs and on the
Special Account. The separate opinion would mention whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year,
together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support
the related withdrawal applications. Retroactive financing will exist for eligible expenditures incurred after
January 1, 1998 up to US$500,000.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
The PIU will develop and maintain a Management Information System (MIS) which will give financial
and operational data on a continual basis. The MIS will be computerized and will include information inter
alia on: amount of funds allocated to different providers; type and amount of training delivered by each group
of providers; unit costs of training courses/programs; changes in the structure of training provided by public
training centers through the TFC; number and profile of trainees by socio-economic group. Performance
indicators related to development objectives will be monitored and evaluated on the basis of data gathered by
the PIU and measured against agreed targets.
Surveys and studies will be conducted during the life of the TESP to assess the impact of training on
the beneficiary trainees, the sponsoring enterprises and control groups. In addition, an evaluation of the
Training Fund will be carried out in the third (final) year of the TESP in the form of a national report that will
assess its cost effectiveness and efficiency compared to established mechanisms of allocating funds to existing
public providers (see Operational Manual, Part 3). Evaluation activities will be carried out by international and
national technical assistance recruited on a competitive basis.
The PIU will monitor project implementation and the achievement of project objectives. It will
maintain continuity in project management and will ensure that all project documentation is well prepared and
on schedule and that procedural problems are reduced to the minimum. The PIU will submit quarterly and
annual progress reports, and annual audit reports to the Minister of Labor and the Bank. Monitoring will be
carried out with the support of international technical assistance specialized in training fund implementation
and management.
The Bank will supervise the project with three missions the first year, and two missions per year
thereafter. Within the first year of the project, there will be an Early Implementation Review followed by a
mid-term review no later than eighteen months into implementation. The PIU, in collaboration with the
Ministry of Planning/PCSU, will prepare an implementation completion report (ICR) for review by the Bank
and donors within six months from the Bank loan closing date. The ICR will be done in accordance with the
latest applicable World Bank guidelines which will be made available to MOP/PCSU in due course.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project:
Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Report No. 14999-JO, October 24, 1995.
*  Strengthen private sector development. The project will improve linkages between training and
employers' needs and will contribute to the growth of private training sector and private employment
services.
*  Remove human capital constraints to growth. By reducing the effective cost of training (through
competitively awarded public funds for training) and targeting the poor (who are less in a position to
finance their own training), the project will increase the skills base and will help to reduce constraints
to growth.
*  Reduce unemployment and poverty in a sustainable way.  By targeting the poor among the
unemployed and inducing Jordanians to undertake work currently performed by non-Jordanians, the
project will increase employment opportunities and income generation ability of the poor, and will
reduce the reliance of the poor on social assistance.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The overall Government strategy to combat poverty in Jordan has been to design and implement
growth-oriented economic reforms supported under the World Bank-sponsored Economic Reform and
Development Loans. Since 1996, the Government has also placed a high priority on addressing the immediate
problems of poverty and unemployment. The long-term Social Productivity Program (SPP) subsumes the
economic reforms as well as sector-specific actions, all intended to increase productivity and reduce
unemployment and poverty. Unemployment and poverty reflect primarily an increasing population and a
small domestic economic base, especially with respect to private sector employment. The Government has
correctly identified the role of macro factors for growth and employment creation and is currently engaged in
substantial reform programs that are expected to increase investment, contain the size of the public sector, and
boost the activities of the private sector. The SPP supplements these "macro" policies and addresses through
various sectoral components the needs of low-income communities. The sectoral components of SPP are: (i)
the Community Infrastructure Project (CIP: this project is financed by the Bank and aims at creating or
improving basic physical and social infrastructure); (ii) the National Aid Fund Project; (iii) the Microfinance
Project {both (ii) and (iii) are to be financed by Government and donors and aim respectively to improve
social assistance and support self-employment}; and (iv) the Training and Employment Support Project
(TESP).
In the area of skills development, though on aggregate, the supply of human capital is relatively
adequate, and Jordan "exports" workers to neighboring countries, the public training system offers primarily
pre-employment vocational education and training of long duration (typically three years) to those who do not
proceed to the secondary general education system or fail to be accepted in a university program. More
specifically, Vocational Education and Training (VET) is offered in an uncoordinated manner by, first, the
Ministry of Education's schools which are inadequately linked to business, industry and labor market
demand, and their quality and efficiency tends to be low; second, the Vocational Training Corporation (VTC)
centers that are adversely affected by lack of instructors' practical technical expertise, weak training standards
in several industrial fields, problems with regard to inadequate, poorly maintained or missing equipment for
instructional purposes, inadequate supervision and high drop-out rates of apprentices, all of which result in
high cost and low quality of training and low levels of student and employer interest; and, third, Community

Colleges (CC) which offer courses that tend to be unconnected with enterprise needs, and their graduates
having the highest unemployment rates among job-seekers. In all, CCs suffer serious problems with regard to
the quality of practical instruction in workshops, a lack of a clear concept of technician training which is
delivered mainly by academic instructors, and difficulties in placing students in meaningful internships.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project:
The TESP will address two main issues: first, the amount, relevance and efficiency of public funding
of training; and second, the access by the poor to training. It will do so by providing an additional mechanism
of funding in-service (demand driven) training through competitive awards to public and private providers
thereby increasing the internal efficiency of training and its relevance to employment. Through targeting the
unemployed poor, it will enable those who could not previously participate in training programs for financial
reasons to acquire the necessary skills to obtain employment.
In this respect, the TESP will reduce the dominance of the public training sector (though not
necessarily its size) in skills development and will also increase the internal and extemal efficiency of
publicly provided training. In the long-term (at the conclusion of the TESP), an ad hoc committee will
prepare an evaluation report on the experience and lessons learned and will assess to what extent the funding
mechanism of TESP can be used to address the issues of the training system outlined in the previous section
(Section 6).
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Social Fund. The establishment of a Social Fund to implement the entire SPP was rejected because:
(i) coordination and overall management of the SPP could be achieved through a small project management
unit within the Ministry of Planning, the leading government entity responsible for the SPP; (ii) and the
Community Infrastructure Project, the National Aid Fund (NAF) and Microenterprise components of the SPP
would add an unacceptable amount of managerial complexity for competing funds if handled together with
the TESP project; and (iii) the sustainability and possible future operations of TESP could be accomplished
better through addressing issues of training independently of the other components in a way that would lead to
the establishment of an innovative public/private financing and management of training.
Direct Support to Existing Public Training Institutions. Funding to existing institutions was rejected
because: (i) Jordan already has mature institutions that are more in need of diversification and innovation to
become demand-responsive rather than expanding their current operations that are subject to the comments
raised in Section 6; (ii) the Training Fund, as designed in this project, would in any case allow public
institutions to get additional funding; and (iii) there are already other projects addressing specific VET issues
(such as HRDSIL II, VTC component) that should be replicated only after their performance is evaluated.
Training Vouchers. Though student vouchers remain a future possibility, they were rejected for this
pilot project because: (i) they operate mainly on the supply side of labor without any guarantee for
incremental employment - the latter being an objective of the Government's SPP (that is, the absorption of the
unemployed); and (ii) given limited information among job seekers and the fact that the private training sector
is under-developed, it is likely that vouchers would have been appropriated by public providers for services
that are already proven to have weak links to employment. In addition, Jordan has recently abolished voucher
schemes in other areas, with some significant political implications. In any case, the Training Fund awards
can be thought of as training vouchers to employers who would nevertheless be obliged to follow the
objectives of the SPP.

Tax Exemption of Training Expenditures. This remains again a future possibility but was rejected as
it would require time to be implemented (changes in tax regulation), and also because Jordan is a developing
country with relatively basic accounting procedures and structures that make training difficult to be funded
and monitored as a separate entity.

10. Lessons learned aind reflected in the project design:
One of the lessons from the World Bank's experience is that while many basic skills can be usefully
provided by the public sector, employer-specific skills are more efficiently provided in the workplace. The
project will concentrate on precisely such skills, that is short-term, in-service training. Longer term training
(such as apprenticeships and training that lasts for more than six months) will still be the responsibility of
established providers and can be revisited after the evaluation of the pilot Training and Employment Support
Project.
Another lesson is that increasing competition among public and private training providers reduces
costs, increases the amount of training, and improves the relevance to employment needs. The project, by
favoring neither public nor private providers, but ensuring a level playing field in the issuance of awards, is
expected to achieve these results.
In the case of Jordan, the expansion of the public sector (in the form of VTC and CCs) has by now
been significant and additional increases in the area of training can more usefully come from a more balanced
public-private mix. Also, graduates of general education and training institutions can benefit from short-term,
employer-driven training, which is the focus of the project. In short, the project will take advantage of the
Jordanians' education and training attainments and will bring employers, public and private training providers
closer to each other with beneficial effects on the total supply of skilled labor, the cost of skills creation, and
the relevance of training to employment and employment creation.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Borrower has demonstrated commitment and ownership by forming full-time task forces for each
of the various components of the SPP, and by forming an SPP Steering Committee chaired by the MOP, who
provides policy guidance. H. M. King Hussein, H.R.H. Crown Prince Hassan, the Prime Minister, and several
Ministers have publicly endorsed the SPP. With respect to commitment for the TESP, the project has the
support of the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of Labor. The Ministry of Labor has introduced changes
in the legislation that legalizes the activities of private employment services.
12. Value added of Bank support:
Value added from Bank participation in the TESP comes from several areas:
* Initial Bank support and financing helped the Government to define the broad outlines of the SPP.
The Bank is playing an active role in linking together the components of the SPP to improve its
overall impact.
*  The Bank has considerable experience working on training issues in Jordan and other countries. This
experience is reflected in the project. For example, the project supports the development of the total
training system (both public and private); restricts eligibility to unemployed workers and reduces
"crowding out" (that is, it supports incremental employment that would not have taken place
otherwise); avoids the feature of some Training Funds that provide wage subsidies to beneficiaries as
this often amounts to replacing existing workers by those who are eligible for a wage subsidy.
* Bank support is currently the only source of official external funding for the program.

(Annex 4):                           Benefit         Analysis:
Analysis
The project will increase training by encouraging a greater role for the private sector along with the
existing (or greater) supply of publicly provided training. Under-investment in training can arise from the
employers' side (for fear of having their workers "poached" by competitive enterprises) or the workers' side
(due to the inability of meeting the costs of training). The project addresses these market failures and would
bring training closer to its social optimum, avoiding "over-investment" in training as funds will be made
available only to those employers who would provide employment to trainees.
The reduction in the supply price of labor (by paying for workers' training costs) and the increase in
the demand for labor (by increases in productivity by better employer/employee matching and greater
relevance of training) should ensure that the project results in net employment gains. The eligibility and
selection criteria also ensure that only incremental employment among Jordanians will be supported since the
project will target the unemployed or those willing to replace non-Jordanian workers.
The project is expected to increase the cost-effectiveness of public funds as the awards will be made
on a competitive basis which should reduce costs and increase the relevance of training.
The project should, therefore, produce both efficiency and distributional effects. Though the direction
of these effects is known (net efficiency gains and beneficial distributional outcomes), their magnitude cannot,
at present, be estimated. This is why the project is designed as a pilot project, the outcomes of which will be
monitored and evaluated with the view of replicating or being suitably amended in the future, thereby
increasing the developmental impact of public expenditures allocated to training.
In less formal terms, the project can be justified on the following three grounds. First, there is a clear
rationale for public intervention in the sense that the project deals with the efficient use of public expenditures
on training. Second, since it is unlikely that the Government would have alone proceeded with alternative
forms of funding public training for political and economic considerations, a small pilot project can help
demonstrate, subject to an evaluation, the usefulness of competitive funding for training. Third, there are no
significant fiscal costs associated with the project (see next section).
Fiscal Impact
The project is estimated at US$6.0 million for the initial three years. The World Bank will provide
US$5.0 million, the Government US$0.7 million, and the UNDP US$0.3 million. The fiscal cost to the
Treasury is thus US$333.000 per year compared to: (i) total Government recurrent expenditures on education
and training (at all levels) of approximately US$450.0 million in 1996; and (ii) a recurrent budgetary
allocation to the VTC of US$13.0 million also in 1996. Thus, the additional Government funds for TESP are
manageable and the Government has already agreed to make these allocations.
The long run implications of TESP should also be manageable if the project is deemed successful at
the end of the three year period. The expected efficiency gains should enable most of the current allocations
towards established public training institutions to continue while savings can be used to fuel the Training Fund
to provide a parallel public/private mechanism for demand-driven, employer-based training to the established

block grant allocations only to public training providers. Following the evaluation of the TESP, partial cost-
recovery from employers and selected individuals can be introduced when the project is completed, if this is
deemed appropriate.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5):
The project's financial arrangements on issuing training awards are based on the average annual costs
of apprenticeships offered by the VTC. These amount to JOD 1,200 per year for apprenticeship, and given
that the training awards under the project will last for a maximum of six months, individual awards will be no
greater than JOD 500. As some awards will be for training that would last less than six months and all awards
will be awarded in a competitive way, financial support can often be for amounts less than JOD 500.
The project's administrative costs (local salaries, materials, equipment, etc.) are based on local
conditions as evaluated and proposed by the taskforce.
15. Technical Assessment:
Actual employment needs and vacancies will be identified by enterprises themselves or with the help
of project funds that will help them carry out occupational needs analysis that would be purchased from public
or private providers. The TESP will also provide awards to enterprises or groups of enterprises to develop and
implement short-term training programs or purchase them on a competitive basis from public and private
providers. Training will be offered to eligible workers selected by the employers and will be directly linked to
pre-identified employment opportunities.
In making awards, the following two eligibility criteria would apply: (i) enterprises, individually or as
a group, should be registered; and (ii) the beneficiaries should be unemployed persons of Jordanian
nationality. Among competing applications, the selection will favor proposals that would: (i) benefit the most
disadvantaged (such as NAF recipients); (ii) encourage the replacement of foreign workers; (iii) enable women
to enter non-traditional occupations; (iv) support training programs primarily accomplished within the
enterprises; (v) provide employment intermediation and occupational needs services to enterprises that do not
have corresponding internal mechanisms; and (vi) make the most cost-effective use of resources.
16. Institutional Assessment:
The MOL has little experience implementing Bank projects. Thus, the establishment of an
independent PIU to undertake the responsibility for all project activities. The PIU will be staffed with
qualified individuals to be recruited on a competitive basis. PIU staff will be trained on Bank procurement
and disbursement procedures. In addition, technical assistance will be recruited to develop financial and
accounting management for the PIU office and to train its staff appropriately. The PIU will recruit the
services of consultants, local and foreign, to advise on technical aspects of the project. In addition, the PIU
will rely on TFEC for review of proposals. Major stakeholders such as employers' associations and workers'
organizations will be used as intermediaries to reach potential employers and to boost the PIU's outreach
capacity. The MOL and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) local offices will play a vital role in
promoting TESP objectives and in facilitating the matching of employers and beneficiaries. The PIU will
benefit from its close collaboration with the PCSU at the Ministry of Planning.

17. Social Assessment:
The project targets, in general, the unemployed poor. As Jordan does not have reliable unemployment
data and well-developed income tests, it is generally difficult to assess who is unemployed and who is poor.
The project attempts to address these deficiencies that could jeopardize its economic and social impact in two
ways. First, giving priority to proposals submitted by enterprises that include prospective workers who come
from families that receive NAF support: such persons are unlikely to be working or have incomes above the
poverty level (these two conditions are already established before NAF awards are made).  Second,
encouraging the replacement of foreign workers by Jordanian nationals: most foreigners are engaged in low-
paying jobs that are unlikely to attract the Jordanian unemployed who are relatively better-off. Three
stakeholders' workshops, held in Amman in March 1997, October 1997 and February 1998, indicated strong
support for the project objectives and comiitment of employers, workers' organizations and NGOs to
contribute to the success of the project.

20. Sustainability:
The TESP is a three-year pilot project. If the project is deemed successful, in terms of labor market
outcomes of trainees and efficiency of public spending on training (i.e., compared to other public training
expenditures), and continues/expands, it will not result in a significant increase of public spending on human
resources development (e.g., public expenditures on education were US$450 million in 1996 and VTC training
US$13 million). Overall, the Government has expressed strong commitment in successfully implementing the
SPP and ensuring sustainability of project benefits for economic and political reasons. The TESP will be one
of the smallest components of the SPP and, coupled with the efficiency gains that it is expected to generate
and possibilities for cost-recovery, it should not present problems of sustainability.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Public providers of training may misunderstand the objectives of the TESP, in particular the support
for an increase in total (public and private) training and may be reluctant to its implementation, if it is
perceived as a way of privatizing training. This can be avoided if they are sufficiently informed that the
project will make available additional funds which would be available to public and private providers on a
competitive basis, and that this can actually increase the funds available to public training providers.
There may be political opposition to giving public funds to the private sector for the development of
training. This issue should be addressed up front on the grounds that support to the private sector is given
under strict conditions that would enhance the impact of public funds with respect to creating additional
employment benefiting primarily the unemployed poor who are a main concern for the Government.

HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
Training and Employment Support Project
Project Description
(Details in Operational Manual)
The Government of Jordan (GOJ), concerned with rising poverty and unemployment, has
launched a program with donor assistance to improve the conditions of the poor and the
unemployed. This program, the Social Productivity Program (SPP), consists of four major
components designed to better target the poor and the unemployed, namely: (i) providing
demand-driven training targeted to the poor; (ii) improving targeting and social assistance
programs by the National Aid Fund; (iii) providing essential infrastructure to improve the living
conditions of the poor; and (iv) providing credit facilities and services to promote
microenterprise development to create productive jobs.
The Training and Employment Support Project (TESP) is a pilot project, part of the SPP,
and would finance short-term, in-service training and related employment services. The TESP,
like other components of the SPP, is envisioned as the first phase of a long-term program of
financing mechanisms for programs that would reduce poverty in a sustainable way. Given the
commendable education attainment of Jordanians, training offered by TESP could play a
significant complementary role to education, and provide job seekers with the necessary skills
that are required for the transition from an education system to the workplace.
Objective
The objective of the project is to pilot test the demand for, and the effectiveness and
efficiency of, an employed-based Training Fund. It will make better use of public funds
dedicated for skills development by demonstrating that training can be more cost-effective and
efficient when it is demand-driven, training funds are competitively awarded between public and
private providers, and employment services are also offered by private offices whose operations
have been until recently illegal (this is the "productivity" part of the project). The project funds
for training will be targeted to poor job-seekers (this is the "social" part of the project).
Description
The project would be a three-year pilot that would: (i) finance necessary in-service
training and related activities for approximately 7,000 job-seekers to fill new vacancies across
the labor market; and (ii) undertake evaluations of these interventions.



Annex 2
Page 2 of 5
Project Component 1- The Training Fund (TFC), US$5.0 million.
A Training Fund Component (TFC) would support in-service training of short-duration
(up to six months) and related support services (such as occupational needs analysis and
employment intermediation) that are necessary for the unemployed to fill new vacancies.
The training would be: (i) identified by employers; (ii) in-service though not necessarily
on-the-job; (iii) provided by the employers themselves or by public and private training
organizations; and (iv) undertaken to new recruits (incremental employment) drawn from
the unemployed. There will be an employment contract of at least six months.
Project Component 2 - Monitoring, Studies and Evaluation (MSE),
US$0.3 million
Monitoring, Studies and Evaluations (MSE). This would fund surveys, assessments and
studies to evaluate the wage and employment impact of the interventions of the project.
A major study will be undertaken during the final (third) year of the project to evaluate
the performance of the project's interventions in relation to existing training programs.
The study will also propose reforms that may change the basis of funding for training,
i.e., away from direct public provision of training toward competitive funding of public
and private providers on performance-based criteria.
Project Component 3 - Project Implementation Unit (PIU), US$0.7 million
This component will fund the necessary expenditures for the PIU operations (see below).
Project Implementation (full description in Operational Manual):
Project Oversight & Coordination
The Government of Jordan (GOJ) has established a National Steering Committee (NSC)
to oversee the execution of the Social Productivity Program (SPP). The NSC is an inter-
ministerial committee chaired by the Minister of Planning and composed of key Ministers
(including the Minister of Labor) each responsible for the implementation of a specific SPP
component. The NSC sets overall policy guidelines and directions and oversees SPP progress.
To assist he NSC in its functions, the Ministry of Planning established a Project Coordination
and Support Unit (PCSU) in charge of coordinating all activities executed under the SPP,
including transmitting policy directives and guidelines formulated by the NSC to the various
Project Implementation Units (PIUs) in charge of specific SPP components.
Project Implementation:
The Ministry of Labor (MOL) is the executing agency of the project. The Minister of
Labor is a member of the NSC and is responsible before the NSC for the affairs of TESP. An
independent Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established within MOL to supplement
its capacity and to ensure effective and timely implementation of the project. The PIU will
consist of five members to be recruited on a competitive basis preferably from the private sector:
Project Director, Financial Officer, Procurement Officer, and two Project Assistants. The
following are the general functions and responsibilities of the PIU (specific Terms of Reference
for each PIU member are provided in the Operational Manual):



Annex 2
Page 3 of 5
1. assume day-to-day responsibility for coordinating project implementation;
2. prepare the project's annual work plan, including operations and budget;
3. conduct promotion campaigns of the project's objectives and programs;
4. assist and support participating ministries and agencies in carrying out their tasks;
5. process all training proposals and submit those above JOD 2,500 to TFEC for evaluation;
6. appoint and supervise the consultants to be recruited under the project;
7. handle all procurement and contracting arrangements under the project;
8. manage all financial transactions and handle disbursement of funds;
9. liaise among the various project stakeholders, domestic and foreign;
10. prepare and submit quarterly progress reports to the Minister of Labor;
11. maintain project accounts in sufficient detail to the satisfaction of GOJ and the Bank;
and
12. act as secretariat to TFEC.
To assist the Minister of Labor and the PIU in project implementation, a nine-member
Training Fund Executive Committee (TFEC) will be established with equal representation from
the public and private sectors and will convene regularly to: (i) evaluate and approve/reject
training proposals submitted by the PIU; and (ii) discuss other matters of relevance to the project.
To ensure that project benefits are realized by all potential beneficiaries and to
supplement the PIU's outreach capacity to target groups, five-member local committees (LCs)
will be established in Ministry of Labor Employment Offices nationwide, one per Governorate
except for Amman which will have two (one in Jabal Hussein and another in Sahab) and will
convene regularly to promote the project's objectives; assist in the identification of target
beneficiaries and potential employers; provide interested parties with the necessary application
forms and relevant instructions; receive training proposals from potential enterprises and submit
them to the PIU after establishing eligibility and recommending approval/rejection; coordinate
with all relevant bodies at the Governorate level; follow-up the approval process and monitor the
actual implementation of the Fund's activities in enterprises in their respective Governorates; and
provide the PIU with the necessary field information periodically and as needed.
A typical sub-project cycle
I. Enterprises (or group of enterprises) will prepare and present proposals for financing
training programs to Local Committees (LCs) in the relevant Governorate; proposals
covering more than one Governorate or of national significance will be submitted
directly to the PIU which will arrange for eligibility to be assessed by the relevant
LCs.
2. LCs will screen proposals for eligibility according to specified selection criteria and
present them to the PIU for consideration recommending approval or rejection.
3. Following receipt of the screened proposals from LCs, the PIU director may approve
individual proposals costing up to JOD 2,500 or five trainees each, and will convene
the Training Fund Executive Committee (TFEC) to evaluate and approve/reject
proposals  costing  above  JOD   2,500  or  above  five  trainees  each.



Annex 2
Page 4 of 5
4. For approved proposals, the PIU prepares a contract which will define the termns of
the financial agreement and the responsibilities of each party (enterprise, beneficiary,
Fund), and agreed timetable for implementation. The PIU will also notify LCs of its
decision to approve/reject the proposals. The contract will comprise the following
information: (a) the job for which the selected beneficiary is to be trained; (b) an
outline of the training program would include, for example, course description,
location and duration; (c) agreement with public or private training providers, if the
program (or part of it) is subcontracted outside the enterprise; and (d) CV of trainers
(professional or in-company). The contract is signed in three documents by the
enterprise, the Director of the PIU, and the trainee (one copy for each). At the end of
training, the beneficiary is awarded a certificate stating the duration and type/level of
training, which is signed by the enterprise and the PIU Director.
5. Payments: The beneficiary enterprise will submit all claims for payment under the
TFC. This will include the costs directly incurred by them and any fees or costs
charged by third parties such as training providers. Claims will be submitted to the
PIU at the enterprises' initiative provided this is no more frequently than monthly.
The PIU will assess the claim, undertaking whatever checks are necessary to verify
it, and will process the claim within two weeks of receipt unless it has some reason
to question it. In this case, it must inform the enterprise also within two weeks of the
claim being received.
To ensure timely implementation of the Fund, the LCs will process the proposals and
submit them to the PIU no later than one month of receiving the proposal. The PIU will process
the proposals of up to JOD 2,500 and notify enterprises within two weeks of receipt from LCs.
For proposals above JOD 2,500, the PIU/TFEC will process the proposals and notify enterprises
no later than one month of receipt from LCs.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements
The PIU will be responsible for financial management of the project, reporting and
auditing, following systems and procedures acceptable to the Bank. Project accounts, including
the Special Account, would be audited in accordance with the "Guidelines for Financial
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March 1982)." Within six
months of the end of each fiscal year, IBRD would be provided by the PIU with an audit report
of such scope and detail as IBRD may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an
independent auditor acceptable to IBRD, on disbursements against certified SOEs and on the
Special Account. The separate opinion would mention whether the SOEs submitted during the
fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can
be relied upon to support the related withdrawal applications.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
The PIU will develop and maintain a management information system (MIS) which will
give financial and operational data on a continual basis. The MIS will be computerized and will
include information inter alia on: amount of funds allocated to different providers; type and



Annex 2
Page 5 of 5
amount of training delivered by each group of providers; unit costs of training courses/programs;
changes in the structure of training provided by public training centers; number and profile of
trainees by socio-economnic group. Performance indicators related to development objectives
will be monitored and evaluated on the basis of data gathered by the PIU and measured against
agreed targets.
Surveys and studies will be conducted during the life of the TESP to assess the impact of
training on the beneficiary trainees and on the sponsoring enterprises. In addition, an evaluation
of the Training Fund will be carried out in the third (final) year of the TESP in the form of a
national report that will assess its cost effectiveness and efficiency compared to established
mechanisms of allocating funds to existing public providers. Evaluation activities will be carried
out by international and national technical assistance recruited on a competitive basis.
The PIU will monitor project implementation and the achievement of project objectives.
It will maintain continuity in project management and will ensure that all project documentation
is well prepared and on schedule and that procedural problems are reduced to the minimum. The
PIU will subrnit quarterly and annual progress reports, and annual audit reports to the Minister of
Labor and the Bank. Audit reports will be submitted to the Bank within six months from the end
of each fiscal year. Monitoring will be carried out with the support of international technical
assistance specialized in training fund implementation and management.
The Bank will supervise the project with three missions the first year, and two -missions
per year thereafter. No later than eighteen months into implementation there will be a full mid-
term review of the project. The PIU, in collaboration with the Ministry of PlanninglPCSU, will
prepare an implementation completion report (ICR) for review by the Bank and donors within six
months from the Bank loan closing date. The ICR will be done in accordance with the latest
applicable World Bank guidelines which will be made available to MOP/PCSU in due course.

HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
Training and Employment Support Project
Economic Analysis
Program Context in Country Strategy
1.    The Training and Employment Support Project (TESP) is a program of financing training
and related employment services to benefit primarily the poor in Jordan. It is one component of
the Government of Jordan's (GOJ's) Social Productivity Program (SPP), which is a
comprehensive strategy to address the problem of poverty. The TESP, like other components of
the SPP, is envisioned as a first phase of a long-term program of financing mechanisms for
policies than would reduce poverty in a sustainable way.
2.     The most recent CAS for Jordan (October 1995) identifies, inter alia, improving
productivity and increasing employment as a priority for Bank assistance. As a result of a
relative deterioration of the living conditions of the poor, the GOJ asked the Bank to assist in the
preparation of a program to address rising poverty and unemployment. The results of this joint
effort between the Bank and GOJ - the SPP - was formally adopted by the GOJ in late 1996.
The SPP has formed the basis for GOJ policy and has provided a framework under which the
GOJ will solicit other donors, some of whom have already expressed their interest.
3.    The SPP has four thrusts: (i) social assistance; (ii) physical and social infrastructure;
(iii) micro-finance to support self-employment; and (iv) training for wage employment
generation. The TESP addresses the last of the four thrusts. The commitment and priority
accorded to this program by the GOJ is high.
Proiect Objectives, Strategy and Design
4.     The principal objective of the TESP is to test pilot the demand for, and the effectiveness
and efficiency of, an employer-based Training Fund. Thus, employer participation is critical to
the achievement of this objective as is the Government's ability to finance training in a more
effective, efficient and targeted way.
5.     The strategic consideration for a training intervention in Jordan was: to what extent can a
new program: (i) be implemented relatively quickly; and (ii) be sustainable in the long-run. In
this respect, the labor market condition in Jordan needs to be better understood.
6.     The Jordanian labor market is subject to increasing pressure from the growth of the labor
force and constrained by a small economic base. Employment has grown on average by only
30,000 a year since 1990 (excluding 1992) which is roughly equal to the labor force growth and
inadequate to absorb the currently 150,000 unemployed. The effects of these quantitative
imbalances are intensified by a distorted incentive system in the labor market; the public sector
remains one of the most attractive employers as the ratio of applications to recruits suggests
(Table 1). The regulatory regime of the private sector affords significant protection to employees
and does not incluce recruitment unless business expectations for permanent employment are well
founded. Additional distortions in the product markets (in the form of parastatals) further reduce



Annex 4
Page 2 of 4
the Jordanians' employment opportunities. Employment opportunities abroad have attracted
many Jordanians, but this increases the reservation wage of Jordanians in Jordan who benefit
from remittances and opens up opportunities for foreign labor at the lower end of skills in the
labor market. In turn, behavioral reasons preclude less-qualified Jordanians from undertaking
employment traditionally associated with immigrant laborers. This particularly affects the poor.
Table 1: Applications and Appointments to Civil Service
Year    Applications   Appointments  Ratio
1981        7,175          6,188          1.2
1985       23,854          5,771         4.1
1990       47,555          2,346        20.2
1996      136,823          5,491        24.9
7.     The situation of the poor is aggravated by the demographic composition and labor supply
characteristics of their households. In the end, there is little room for direct labor market policies
for decreasing poverty through wages and unemployment benefits interventions; even large
increases in wages or the introduction of generous unemployment benefits will have little effect
on poverty. In addition, such policies would require heavy budgetary outlays, increase the
implicit tax to employers (and labor), and further distort household labor supply incentives
(World Bank 1994: Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Poverty Assessment. Report No. 12675-JO).
A last option for increasing the employment opportunities of the poor is to decrease their supply
price of labor, and through training, increase their productivity level (that is the demand for their
labor).
8.    Jordan has an advanced education and training system which is by far superior to its
neighboring countries and also to countries at the same stage of development. In many respects,
enrollments at most levels of education resemble those of industrialized countries. Jordan has
achieved near universal basic education defined generously to include 10 years (compared to six
years in primary in most developing countries). Basic education is followed by a comprehensive
system of general, vocational and technical secondary education, which is in turn supplemented
by a large number of public and private community colleges, universities and cultural (private)
training centers. However, a large number of national and international studies point to potential
improvements in the education and training that could reduce costs, improve quality and
relevance, and increase efficiency. Though these are areas that should be addressed in the long-
run, the Government is keen to introduce more or less immediate measures in the areas of
unemployment and poverty.
9.     The introduction of a Training Fund for short-term training "ta'ahil"="rehabilitation/
adjustment" in contrast to "tadrib"="training/apprenticeship") can provide an additional
mechanism for increasing matching among young job-seekers and employers provided that it " is
designed in an appropriate way. And to be effective and low cost, new funding formulas should
be used. An experimental Training Fund that is employer-driven and competitively awarded to
public and private providers can, therefore, prove to be a useful experimentation.
10.   Despite the lack of explicit estimates of the quantitative impact of a Training Fund on
employment in the short-term (which may not be that much given the current underutilization of
existing employees), a far bigger benefit may arise in the near future: if successful, the Training
Fund can pave the way for the Government to reduce the direct provision of training and move
toward more competitive funding of training. At present, public providers of training have
guaranteed allocations from the budget and are in fact expanding. There are few incentives for



Annex 4
Page 3 of 4
the public providers to adapt to the changing needs of employers despite the high unemployment
rates among their graduates. If funding for training is awarded on a contract basis (i.e.,
competitively and subject to achieving certain targets prescribed by the Government and
reflecting the status of the labor market), then the relevance of publicly offered programs will
increase and, assuming that administration costs are kept under control, there could be budgetary
savings.
11.   It is therefore proposed to establish a Training Fund of adequate duration (three years) to
empirically assess the desirability of such an intervention. Three years would allow concrete
understanding of the properties involved in such an intervention, through tracer surveys and
impact evaluations.
12.   At the third-year of TESP, a national report will evaluate the experience of the Fund
(relatively to other training interventions) and will propose directions for reforms that will
improve/enhance the basis of funding for training, (i.e., possibly away from direct funding the
public provision of training toward funding public and private providers on a level playing field
and on the basis of agreed performance criteria). This should increase the effectiveness of
training. It can also result in budgetary savings or achieve greater impact of public expenditures
at the same level of funding.
13.   In conclusion, the establishment of a Training Fund should not be seen as a short-term
solution to the continuing problem of unemployment, although it can contribute to some
reduction of unemployment among the groups it targets. Its greatest potential is to evolve as a
supplementary funding mechanism for training that can increase the effectiveness and efficiency
of public social spending in this area of human resource development.
Fiscal Impact andI Cost Recovery
14.   TESP is estimated to cost US$6.0 million for the initial three years. The World Bank
will provide US$5.0 million, the GOJ US$0.7 million and UNDP US$0.3 million.  The
Government commitment compares to total government recurrent expenditures on overall
education and training of about US$450 million per year. This commitment is manageable after
Bank financing comes to an end.
15.   The long-run implications of TESP should also be manageable if the project is deemed
successful at the end of the three year period. The expected efficiency gains should enable most
of the current allocations to established public training institutions to continue while savings can
be used to fuel the Training Fund to provide a parallel public/private mechanism for demand-
driven, employer-based training to the established block grant allocations only to public training
providers. Following the evaluation of the TESP, partial cost-recovery from employers and
selected individuals can be introduced when the project is completed, if this is deemed
appropriate.
The Risks
16.   It is doubtful that the establishment of a Training Fund will provide a quick fix to the
massive unemployment problem (and underemployment of the employed and hidden
unemployment arnong the "idle"). And it will not address the main causes of unemployment
(increasing population growth and small economic base). It can, however, contribute positively
by reducing the supply price of youth for employers (labor costs in as far as they include
adjustment/specific training expenses of employers) and increasing productivity.  These
rightward changes in the supply curve and demand curve should increase employment. There are
not, however, any studies with respect to the magnitude of this increase.



Annex 4
Page 4 of 4
17.   The potential risks are:  (i) proposed targeting mechanism may be too restrictive
(selected job-seekers may not be the poorest); (ii) use of training funds by employers may be low
(despite the incentives, there may not be enough job vacancies at the level of support that the
project will provide); and (iii) response by private sector providers of training and employment
services may be slow and erratic.
18.   The risks will be minimized by: (i) using a pilot project to test the proposed instruments
and performing rigorous evaluations and impact analyses to assess their efficiency and cost-
effectiveness; (ii) restricting eligibility to Jordanians, some of whom would undertake jobs
currently performed by foreign workers; (iii) enforcing of monitoring procedures, reviewing and
re-evaluating eligibility criteria, worker selection and enterprise awards; and (iv) implementing
recent changes in legislation that would enable greater participation of the private sector in
training and employment services.
Institutional Capacity
19.   The Ministry of Labor has weak capacity and limited experience to implement the
project. It is chosen as the natural and relatively more relevant agency for training and
employment issues. Its operations will be assisted by a Project Implementation Unit that will
cooperate with the overall SPP's Project Coordination and Support Unit (PCSU) located at the
Ministry of Planning under the supervision of a National Steering Committee of the SPP (details
in the Operational Manual).
Addressing Poverty
20.    One of the project's objectives is to benefit the unemployed poor and reduce poverty in a
sustainable way. To the extent that the project will correctly identify the poor and successfully
place them in wage employment, this objective should be achieved (see also Risks in paragraphs
16 and 17).
Environmental Analysis
21.   The program is classified as Category C for environmental purposes. Most investments
are small and none are expected to have environmental effects.
Economic Performance Criteria
22.    The project will monitor inter alia the following indicators: (i) percentage of funds
allocated to public and private providers and amount of training delivered by each group of
providers (this will indicate whether there is competition between the two sectors); (ii) unit costs
of training courses and programs (this, properly adjusted to take into account differences in
length, inputs, etc. of training, will show the cost-effectiveness of different providers); (iii)
changes in the structure of training provided by public providers (this will indicate the response
of public centers to new demand, hence, an increase in the relevance/external efficiency of their
operations); (iv) number and socio-economic profile and trainees (an indication of achieving the
"social" objective of the SPP); and (v) length of training, employment characteristics and wage
levels of trainees. This information together with tracer studies which would monitor the post-
training employment outcomes of unemployed beneficiary and firms would help determine the
economic efficiency of the project's interventions and assess its usefulness for future replication
and expansion.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
1.    All Bank-financed goods would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines:
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits of January 1995 (revised January and August
1996). Consultants' services would follow the Bank's Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers of January 1997. A procurement plan detailing the
packaging and estimated schedule of the major procurement actions is presented in Table 1. A
summary of the proposed arrangement of procurement methods is provided in Table 2. Other
procurement information, including the current or estimated date for publication of GPN and the
Bank's review process is presented in Table 3.
2.    PIU Capacity to Manage Project Implementation. The PIU will be staffed with a Project
Director, Financial Officer, Procurement Officer, and two Staff Assistants. The PIU Director
was appointed by the Minister of Labor in December 1997. The other PIU staff, essential to the
successful implementation of the pilot project, will be appointed before June 1, 1998. The PIU
staff will be recruited under a competitive basis and will have private sector experience in project
implementation, procurement and disbursement issues. PIU staff will have to be trained in Bank
procurement, disbursement, and financial areas; it is recommended that they participate in the
Bank's procurement seminar organized by the ILO in Turin, Italy. The unit will require training
in the use of software to carry out monitoring of procurement/disbursement, and financial
monitoring. With regard to the Training Fund Subprojects, the PIU, in addition to being
responsible for organizing formal review  of Training Award applications, will monitor
expenditures as they are submitted by the enterprises for proper disbursement/reimbursement
(See Section 4 of PAD "Typical Subproject Cycle" and Annex 2 for details).
A.    Procurement Methods
3.    The project will purchase goods and technical assistance (no civil works are being
considered under this project).
Training  Fund Subprojects.   Qualified firms/institutions or individual
specialists would be invited to submit proposals under the Training Fund to receive
awards based on pre-defined criteria (see Annex 2 for details and the Operational
Manual). Consultant firms/institutions and/or individuals would be procured using
Commercial Practices (para. 3.12 of the Consultant Guidelines of January 1997).
Goods. The Bank loan will finance simple office equipment and materials
necessary for project management. Therefore, contracts for goods estimated to cost less
than US$100,000 up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$200,000, containing



Annex 6
Page 2 of 6
small quantities of a variety of items, and which would not be expected to interest
international suppliers, may be awarded under National Shopping (NS) procedures based
on price comparison between at least three suppliers eligible under the Guidelines in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Technical Assistance (TA). Qualified firms or institutions as well as individual
specialists would be invited to submit proposals for a comprehensive package of
consultant services in accordance with the Consultant guidelines of January 1997.
Consultants would be procured using Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)
procedures, with the exception of small contracts where the selection would be based
Single-Source (SS) selection.
Bid Documents and Contract Review
4.    Prior Review Thresholds. The threshold for prior review of contracts (as described in
paras. 2 and 4 of Appendix 1, of the Guidelines) would be those contracts costing the equivalent
of US$100,000 or more for goods and equipment, US$100,000 for consulting/training firms, and
US$50,000 for individual consultants. IBRD will review all Terms of References for technical
assistance contracts under US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. The remaining
contracts will be subject to selective post-award reviews by IBRD. The Bank will review all
Sole-Source consultant contracts that are under US$100,000 (for both firms and individuals). All
consulting services will use Standard Forms for time-based or lump sum contracts as appropriate
for the type of assignment.
5.    The PIU will be responsible for monitoring procedures and maintaining proper records
for easy review by IBRD.
Disbursements
6.    The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of about three and a half years. The
additional six months is necessary to take into account start-up activities for the PIU. The
closing date of the IBRD Loan is scheduled for February 28, 2002, six months following the
project completion date. The scheduling should be considered as tentative, as project execution
will be subject to the capacity of the PIU to prepare and implement the activities outlined in the
Operations Manual.
7.    Statement of Expenditures.  Under the project, purchase of goods and equipment
amounting to less than US$100,000, and for consultant services amounting to less than
US$100,000 for firms, US$50,000 for individual consultants, would be disbursed under
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). In addition to the above, the Training Fund Subprojects,
training and operating expenses would also be disbursed under SOEs.
8.    Special Account. To facilitate disbursement of funds, the PIU would establish a Special
Account (SA) at the Central Bank of Jordan on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
The Authorized Allocation to the Special Account is determined at US$500,000. Initially, the
allocation would be limited to US$250,000 until disbursements reached US$1,000,000, at which
time the full Authorized Allocation could be claimed. Applications for the replenishment of the
Special Account would be submitted monthly or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been



Annex 6
Page 3 of 6
utilized, whichever occurs earlier. The replenishment application would be supported by the
necessary documentation, bank statement of the Special Account, a reconciliation bank statement
of the Special Account against Bank records.
9.    Project accounts, including the Special Account, would be audited in accordance with
the "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank
(March 1982). Within six months of the end of each fiscal year, IBRD will be provided by the
PIU with an audit report of such scope and detail as IBRD may reasonably request, including a
separate opinion by an independent auditor acceptable to IBRD, on disbursements against
certified SOEs and on the Special Account. The separate opinion would mention whether the
SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls
involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal applications.
Supervision
10.   Project Launch Workshop.  Project activities will be launched at a Project Launch
Workshop in mid-1998. The Workshop will introduce the project activities to all designated
counterparts and discuss project issues, technical and operational and in particular procurement
and disbursement procedures. The PIU will design and organize the Workshop. Participants will
include key counterparts in addition to major stakeholders in the project, i.e., representatives of
employers, workers' organizations, Training Fund Executive Committee (TFEC), and Local
Committees (LCs).
11.   The IBRD Task Manager for the project will be based at headquarters in Washington,
D.C. and will undertake three missions the first year, and two missions per year thereafter.
Missions will be staffed with training and institutional development experts. No later than
eighteen months into implementation, a mid-term review of the project would be conducted. The
agreed performance indicators related to development objectives (Annex 1) will be monitored
and evaluated on the basis of data gathered by the implementing agencies and measured against
agreed targets.  An Implementation Completion Report will be produced upon project
completion.
