MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DE mLOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA '
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH MANAGEMENT JROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$35.3 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years'
grace, at the standard variable rate, and would assist the Government of
Indonesia's (GOI) efforts to improve the basis for sustained agricultural
development by increasing the efficiency and relevance of the national
agricultural research system. The project is expected to be cofinanced by the
Government of Japan for US$3.4 million equivalent.
2.       Background.  Differences in geological origin, topography and vast
distances lead to great variation in rainfall, climatic conditions, soils and
vegetation in the country; and hence to diverse agricultural systems and
opportunities for agricultural production, which put special demands on the
organization and implementation of an integrated national agricultural
research system. Indonesia's impressive agricultural and economic growth so
far resulting, inter alia, in rice self-sufficiency, is a feat vhich would not
have been possible without a significant contribution from agricultural
research. A major national objective since the early 19709 has been to expand
and strengthen, with the Bank's and other donors' support, problem-oriented
agricultural research to sustain agricultural development, increase rural
employment and incomes, and expand non-oil export earnings. While the
performance of this important subsector has been impressive, research
management has been slow to adjust to the vast expansion which has occurred.
In the past decade, professional staff of the Agency for Agricultural Research
and Development (AARD) had increased tenfold, and there has been a substantial
expansion of facilities and programs. AARD currently manages two research
centers, five research coordinating centers, 27 research institutes, 51
research stations and 197 experimental farms and ponds. There is a need to
improve internal efficiency, to consolidate and, where necessary, to re-orient
research activities in line with changing conditions and evolving national and
sectoral policies, to support growth in the agricultural sector, address
emerging problems of sustainable resource use, and increase productivity and
income.
3.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Investment in agricultural research
to date has mainly addressed the major challenges facing Indonesia in
attaining food self-sufficiency. As a result, rice yields have almost doubles'
over the last two decades, and management of lowland and irrigated rice has
received significant attention. The challenges facing agriculture in the next
phase include: improving the production of secondary crops for
diversification, especially legumes, oil seeds, and fibers; increasing the
competitiveness of export crops (horticulture, rubber, palm oil) by employing
efficient technology to reduce the cost of production; and expanding research
skills to address specific problems facing farming systems in major ecological
zones. These challenges can be met by better utilization of esisting research
capabilities and modernization and expansion of several facilities to meet the
emerging demands among the various research coordinating centers and the



- 2 -
institutes of AARD. The in.creasing complexity of managing the vast research
network in the country requires special support to enable AARD to provide
adequate direction and supervision of research efforts. The Bank has
supported MARD's research program since 1975 under the Agricultural Research
and Extension Project (Ln. 1179-IND) followed by the (still ongoing) National
Agricultural Research Project (Ln. 18401Cr. 1014-IND). Both these projects
have successfully contributed to AARD and physical expansion and strengthened
research capabililities, but reviews conducted under the second project
indicated a need for greater emphasis on research programming and management.
The Project Completion Report on the first project concluded that objectives
had been achieved and that no significant prcoblems had affected
implementation. After assisting GOI initiall.y in expanding its trained staff,
research infrastructure and capacity, Bank assistance is now needed in
strengthening GOI's efforts to fully and effe:ctively utilize the expanded
facilities and personnel by improved planning and management of resources and
more efficient research in support of continlued agricultural growth.
4.       Pro3ect Obiectives.  The major objective of the project would be to
increase the efficiency and relevance of the agricultural research system for
continued, sustained agricultural development. The project would have a two-
pronged approach: (a) operationally supporting critical elements of the on-
going research programs, particularly by strengthening research in the
relatively neglected fields of socio-economics, fisheries, post-harvest
technology and biotechnology in line with established GOI research priorities;
and (b) introducing institutional and management reforms to improve research.
Specifically, the projbct would (a) improve the data base and planning
mechanism, including the preparation of a rolling national Agricultural
Research Master Plan, for improved research programming; (b) reform research
management by establishing a network of management information systems (MIS),
and by introducing improved accounting practices and regular monitoring and
external research reviews; (c) improve integration of research through
fostering AARD links with universities and private enterprise, and
facilitating rapid technology diffusion; (d) ensure adequate research
financing by providing for a minimum targeted growth in operational
expenditures; and (e) improve resource allocation for research in accordance
with the Government's Agricultural Research Policy Statement and Action
Program.
5.       Project Description.  The project would be implemented over five
years as part of a long-term development program and would strengthen AARD's
management at various levels. Specific components to be financed would
include: (a) Improving Research Management and Organization (US$16.14
million) by (i) establishing a planning and programming section within AARD
(Center for Agricultural Research Programming-CARP), (ii) supporting
development of rolling research master plan, (iiij strengthening management
information systems, (iv) improving financial management, accounting and
reporting and technical assistance and training; (b) Strengthening Research-
Extension Linkages (US$6.76 million) by (i) improving flow of information
between research workers, and from research to policy makers,
(ii) strengthening library services, (iii) organizing farmers' field days,
(iv) improving on-farm research and technical meetings between researchers and
subject matter specialists; (c) Providing Overall Support to the National



Research System (US$27.52 million) by (i) providing incremental operating
costs, (ii) strengthening research in the fields of agro-economics, bio-
technology, post-harvest technology, and fisheries; and (iii) providing funds
for universities to conduct research.
6.       Total project cost is estimated at US$50.4 million, of which
US$0.8 million would be in duties and taxes and US$12.8 million in foreign
exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$35.3 million would finance 702 of the
total project cost. The Government of Japan is expected to provide US$3.4
million equivalent of grant funds for technical assistance which would be
administrated by the Bank. The loan would finance 76Z of foreign costs and
about 68? of local costs. A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and .methods of procurement and disbursement are shown
in Schedule B. A time table for key processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedule C and D respectively. A
map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7504-TUD dated March 1,
1989 is being distributed separately.
7.       Agreed Actions.  The project would be implemented in accordance with
the Government's Policy Statement and Action Program for Agricultural Research
and assurances were obtained from GOI at negotiations that: (a) annual
reviews would be conducted and agreed with the Bank on funding levels for
research operations based on agreed work programs to be submitted by
October 31 each year; (b) funds for research O&M would be provided using
standards satisfactory to the Bank, and an inventory of research assets by
type and by institute would be completed during the first two years of the
project to provide a firm basis for determining actual O&M requirements;
xc) funding for research would be increased by a minimum of five percent
annually in real terms over the five-year period 1989/90-1993/94; (d) the
formalized re-establishment of Center for Agricultural Research Programming
would be completed by June 30, 1990, and a Research Grants Board would be
established by September 30, 1989; and (e) a MIS in the areas of program,
financial, staff and facilities management and a detailed plan and proposed
schedule for introducing improved accounting and financial control would be
prepared by June 30, 1991.
8.       Benefits.  The proposed project would ensure that full benefits would
be derived from GOI's earlier substantial investments in developing
agricultural research infrastructure and manpower. It would permit GOI and
AARD to undertake essential actions and reforms required for a more sharply-
focused, effectively-managed, and cost-effective agricultural research
services. Moreover, it would assist in correcting earlier imbalances and gaps
in the development of the research system, and increase emphasis on research
in subsectors previously neglected or having become higher priority because of
changed economic conditions. Improved linkages and two-way communication
between research and extension on the one hand, and research and policy makers
on the other, would facilitate faster and wider application of new technology.
This would ensure that agricultural research effectively supports national and
sectoral objectives in agriculture. The benefits of the project would be
wide-spread throughout the agricultural sector, as reflected in more effective
and efficient use of research resources, with its ultimate effects on
agricultural growth and development. An economic rate of return for the
project has not been calculated because of the inherent risks and
uncertainties of the timing and value of research results, and the
difficulties in separating the potential benefits of research from those of
complementary inputs like extension and irrigation, preclude exact
quantification of expected benefits.



9.       Risks.  In addition to the normal risks associated with any research
undertaking where results can never be guaranteed, the main risks of the
proposed project are associated with unsatisfactory implementation of project
actions in rationalizing the national agricultu-al research program due to:
(a) resistance to policy and institutional change (requiring action at
different levels of government) and continued institutional weakness in
carrying out the required reforms, and (b) inadequate funding for operation
and maintenance expenditures. These risks will be addressed by: (a) reaching
agreement with GOI on a phased action plan, including a comprehensive
operational financing plan involving GOI and various donors, in joint annual
program reviews; (b) providing strong support for operational funding of
research and under the project; and (c) strengthening research planning and
management through technical assistance under the project and improved
monitoring and regular reviews, including a joint GOI-Bank mid-term review.
Since GOI is committed to institutional development and policy reform,
perceived risks in the proposed project would be minimized.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
