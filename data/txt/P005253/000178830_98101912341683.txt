CHAPTER I
THE WATER SUPPLY
AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
General
1.01      The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, located in the arid zone of the
Middle East has an area of approximately 87,000 Km2, of which about 81,000
Km2 lies on the East Bank of the Jordan River. The last official census
was conducted in 1961, and as substantial movement of population has occurred
since then, population statistics referred to in this Report should be
regarded as approximations only. Population distribution at year-end 1975
was estimated by the Jordan Statistics Department as follows:
Governorate                        Estimatea Population
Amman                                   1,098,000
Irbid                                     564,000
Balqa                                     130,000
Karak                                     108,000
Ma'an                                      52,000
Total Population             1,952.000
1.02      The overall pattern of settlement in Jordan is characterized by
a large metropolitan area (Amman Region), a few medium-sized towns and many
small villages. The annual rate of population growth in Amman Region ex-
ceeded 11% during the period of 1966 to 1976, while the national growth rate
was a significant 3.5% per annum.
1.03      Not only is the city of Amman the capital of Jordan, but it is also
the center of the country's main commercial activity.  With a population that
has more than doubled twice during the past two decades the need for adequate
water supply and sewerage services in Amman continues to accelerate.  Addi-
tionally, the influx of refugees into Amman has exacerbated the growth problem
within the 13 municipal areas of the city.  Although there are several smaller
enclaves of refugee population totalling approximately 20,000 residents,
the two large camps, Hussein and Wahdat, account for approximately 165,000
residents.
1.04      The Government is now making a major effort to expand and improve
the water supply and sewerage services in Amman through a combined program
which will directly benefit an estimated 270,000 persons with improved water
supplies and 316,000 persons with improved sewerage services. As part of
the financing arrangements for this program, the Government has requested
IDA's assistance for a project which will provide piped water supplies to
approximately 92,000 users and piped sewerage systems to more tian 121,000.

Water Resources and Sewerage
1.05      Rainfall in Jordan averages from 50 mm/year in the desert areas to
600 mm/year in the highland areas. Surface water sources in the Jordan Valley
are estimated by the National Planning Council (NPC) to provide an average
annual flow of 635 Mm3, and in the Dead Sea Basin 194 Mm3 is the estimated
flow. However, exploitation of surface water resources for community water
supplies has not occurred to any great degree as yet, largely due to the
sporadic flow patterns and the relatively long distance from population
centers. Any future exploitation of such resources will involve high develop-
mental costs due to the large capital investments required for transmission
systems, and high operating costs inherent in the 600 to 800 m. lifts from
source to distribution.
1.06      Most of the community water supply systems in Jordan presently
depend upon groundwater. Even with full development of these groundwater
sources, demands still exceed supply. Average national per capita consumption
in 1975 was estimated at 28 lpcd. A 1973 Ministry of the Interior report
showed that of 794 villages covered in the survey, 391 did not have proper
water supplies. Further, in the remaining communities (with piped water
supplies) demands exceeded supply in all cases. Water tankers were depended
upon to bridge the gap.
Types of Domestic Water Supplies in Towns and Villages
-----------Governorate-----------

bution through

bution without
house connections         10      6      7      -       8     31           4

1.07      Physical and chemical quality of drinking water is acceptable in
most areas of Jordan, although the nitrate level has reached 80 mg/l in the
Amman-Zerqa area. However, the bacteriological quality of water in several
areas is poor, indicating contamination of groundwater supplies through
unhygienic domestic waste disposal or through back-siphonage due to inter-
mittent service.



1.08      Only three cities in Jordan, Amman, Salt and Aqaba, have sewage
collection systems and treatment plants. In other communities cesspools
are used for domestic sewage disposal. Under the aegis of the Ministry
of Municipal and Rural Affairs (MRA) the Salt collection system is being
renovated and extended, and the ineffective treatment plant is being con-
verted to aerated lagoons. Overflowing cesspools in most communities are
a constant nuisance as well as a continuing health-risk indicating the need
for improved design, construction and maintenance. A study is underway for
the Irbid sewerage system and studies for Zerqa and Jerash are planned.
Sector Organization
1.09      The Natural Resources Authority (NRA) has overall responsibility
for water resources studies and water planning throughout Jordan. In con-
sultation with IDA, the Government created the Amman Water and Sewerage
Authority (AWSA) through Law 19 in 1973, which has the responsibility for
water supply, sanitary sewerage and surface drainage in Amman (paras. 3.03
and 3.04).
1.10      In 1973 the Water Supply Corporation (WSC) was established, succeed-
ing the NRA Water Supply Department. WSC assists the smaller municipalities
in the design and construction of water supply projects. After commissioning,
WSC transfers the system to the municipalities which, in turn, assume main-
tenance and operation responsibilities. WSC also acts as a bulk supplier of
water to a large number of towns and villages. The WSC Board of Directors is
headed by a Director-General and is responsible to the MRA. WSC employs about
700 persons, 70 technicians and 630 unskilled workers. At present, a reorgani-
zation is being undertaken after the departure of some key staff; and it is
not clear how the final organization will evolve. In any event the Corpora-
tion will require substantial strengthening of its technical, operational
and administrative staff in order to effectively develop and execute the
Government's water supply program in WSC's area of responsibility.
1.11      The East Jordan Valley is under the jurisdiction of the Jordan Val-
ley Authority (JVA), and domestic water supplies in the valley fall within
the JVA purview. As a successor to the Jordan Valley Commission (JVC) which
had been established in 1973, JVA was incorporated in 1977 to assume JVC's
program of development, policy making, project financing, and construction
contract administration.  In the area of water supply, JVA has three geogra-
phical sub-divisions: Northern Ghor (10 settlements); Central or Middle East
Ghor (18 settlements); and Southwest Ghor (8 settlements).
1.12      The MRA is responsible for design and construction of sewerage
systems outside Amman. Responsibility for maintenance and operation of the
existing rudimentary systems, principally cesspool pumping, rests with the
municipalities. In 1973, consideration was given by the Government to form
a National Water and Sewerage Board; and enabling legislation was drafted.
However, no further action has yet been taken.



- 4 -
1.13      The Municipal and Village Loan Fund (MVLF) assists the WSC with
the financing of small projects in some villages, and also lends directly to
municipalities and village councils. Established within MRA as a specialized
credit institution to provide finance for municipal and village projects, the
MVLF depends upon WSC and MRA for technical assistance in processing its water
supply and sewerage loans. The Government has requested Bank assistance in
reviewing the operation of MVLF with the objective of the Bank's future tech-
nical and financial support for the institution.
Sector Program
1.14      Within the context of the current Five-Year Plan (1976-80), which
emphasizes the extension of public services to all communities in the country,
based on a rational relationship between economic and regional planning, the
program for water supplies and sewerage is as follows:
(i)  drill new wells to increase the quantity of drinking water
produced in the various regions;
(ii) expand water networks and contruct new storage tanks in
the various governorates;
(iii) adopt a progressive water tariff structure to control
consumption; and
(iv) undertake sewerage projects to improve facilities in Amman
and Salt and sewerage studies in other main cities.
1.15      The sector investment programs as presented in the Plan and as
revised to reflect the proposed project for Amman and Salt is tabulated as
follows:

Sector Priorities
1.16      At present over 60% of the urban population in Jordan has house
connections to piped water supply systems and about 10% of the urban popula-
tion has service connections to sewage collection systems. By the end of
the current Five-Year Plan (1980) it is estimated that 66% of the total urban
population will enjoy water connections and 25% sewerage system connections.
1.17      The continuing major problem will be to increase the amount of water
available for community water supplies. The scarcity of water or high cost
of transportation is reflected in the low national per capita consumption,
estimated at 28 lpcd in 1975 and expected to rise to 38 lpcd by 1985. In
small villages and in refugee camps consumption figures of 10-15 lpcd are
not uncommon. Water allocation problems occur between irrigation needs and
potable water needs, particularly in the Jordan Valley. The King Talal Dam
was originally intended for irrigation purposes, and planning for the Maqarin
Dam is on the same basis. However, recent AWSA water resources studies have
indicated that Amman must depend on these resources to meet the bulk of its
future demand. Consequently, about 17 Mm3 per year of the King Talal Dam
outflow is being allocated to Amman in connection with this project. Mean-
while, Government engaged consultants to conduct an overall review of the
existing policies and organization of the sector, and the recommendations
of the consultants' study will be taken into account by the Jordanians in
developing an overall policy and strategy for the future planning of opera-
tions in the sector.
1.18      Although the Government plans to proceed with a number of urban
projects, the rural sector has not been neglected. Of the current Five-Year
Plan budget of JD 53.12 million for domestic water supplies, approximately
JD 26.62 million (about 50%) will be invested to serve rural areas with
urgently needed water supplies outside the city of Amman. However, because
of the concentration of population in Amman and the constant threat of serious
epidemics of waterborne diseases due to unsanitary conditions, the highest
priority at present is given to the provision of safe water supplies and waste
disposal systems in the municipality.
1.19      Continuing budgeting constraints limit the investments which can
be made by Government and so bilateral assistance will continue to be heavily
relied upon to meet the financial requirements of the water supply and sewer-
age projects. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
has expressed an interest in participating in the financing of AWSA's program;
US$28.5 million has been allocated for FY78, and an additional US$12.0 million
is under consideration for FY79. The Saudi Fund for Development has indicated
interest in providing a loan of US$20.0 million to assist AWSA in financing
the King Talal Dam Transmission Project. Ongoing water supply and sanitation
programs have been assisted by the Federal Republic of Germany, Iran, United
Kingdom and the United States.

Performance in Previous IDA Lending
1.20      IDA Credit 18-JO was extended to the Government in 1961 in order to
cover the foreign exchange costs of augmenting and improving the Amman water
supply. The Credit was on-lent by the Government to the Amman Municipal Water
Department. Subsequent to overcoming initial delays due to political distur-
bances and to lack of local funding the Credit amount of US$1.5 million was
fully disbursed by January 1968. Among the objectives of this project was
the institutional development of the Department. This objective was not fully
achieved. In December 1963 the Credit 43-JO, for US$2.5 million was utilized
by the Government to assist with the financing of water supply projects in
Ramallah-El Bira (Jerusalem), Azraq-Irbid and Zerqa. Credit 385-JO, which was
the first to support AWSA's establishment and program, became effective in
1973. The US$8.7 million Credit was to cover 75% of the estimated US$11.5
million project cost for extending the water supply and sewerage services and
reducing unaccounted-for water. As of November 1977, all major construction
had been completed, and the civil works elements have entered the guaranteed
maintenance phase. A balance of US$300,000 remained in this credit and should
be disbursed within three months. Substantial progress was made in achieving
the project objectives, particularly in expansion of the systems and improve-
ment in AWSA's operational and managerial effectiveness.
IDA's Objectives for the Sector
1.21      IDA's immediate objective in the sector is to continue the develop-
ment of AWSA's institutional and operational capabilities to enable it to
provide effective water supply and sewer services in the major urban area in
Jordan. This objective is expected to be achieved under the present Credit.
IDA's further objective should be to assist WSC in overcoming its present tech-
nical, organizational and administrative problems to enable it to effectively
implement the Government's strategy of improving water and sewerage services
in other urban and rural areas in Jordan.

CHAPTER II
PROJECT AREA
Water Resources - Amman
2.01      Amman now depends on two aquifers in the Amman-Zerqa basin for its
water resources. AWSA has at present 48 wells, but only 28 are in actual
production. Instability of production typifies the performance of the exist-
ing well fields. A review of the performance of the wells was conducted in
August 1977, and from examination of the data obtained it can be concluded
that the aquifers are being mined. The combined capacity of the operating
wel:Ls is such that approximately 1,800 m3/hour (500 1/sec) can be pumped
into the Amman system. AWSA has embarked on a rehabilitation program covering
12 wells and expects to restore at least six wells to their former capacity.
2.02      Thorough investigation of the two aquifers has led to the conclusion
that the future demands of Amman cannot be met from these sources. Therefore
studies have been conducted by AWSA and its consultants in which alternative
potential sources have been examined to determine their possible utilization
for the Amman water supply.
2.0:3     Six groundwater and four surface water sources were studied.
Recommendations for the use of one groundwater source at Qastal were made
(para. 2.04). The groundwater in the Azraq area, presently supplying Irbid,
can be diverted to Amman when an alternative source will be available to
Irbid after construction of the proposed Maqarin Dam. The Zarqa-Maeen spring
water is unsuitable for potable water use because of the high degree of
mineralization, and Zarqa-Maeen has been designated as an historic tourist
site. The remaining three small groundwater sources were unsuitable for
development due to unpredictable production following exploration and major
investment in transmission which made their development uneconomic. Of the
four surface sources only the King Talal Dam reservoir is available for
development to meet Amman's immediate needs. Dams for the other three have
yet to be designed and constructed. Only one of these sources, Upper Wala
Dam, would be suitable for future use in Amman as the other two will depend
upon rainfall flood for water storage.
2.04      Several wells in the Amman municipality provide water to outside
areas within the purview of WSC and NRA. While the reported capacities of
these wells varies, the average total yield is over 1.0 Mm3/year, which rep-
resents an average of about 6% of AWSA's present annual production. The
water supply for Madaba, for example, is pumped from two wells in Amman
through a 300 mm main to Madaba. Passing in close proximity to the Qastal
area, in which limited groundwater is available, the transmission main could
be used to augment Amman's supplies (if producing wells were developed in
the Qastal area) and to meet Madaba's need as well. During negotiations
agreement was reached that the Government will cause WSC to develop alterna-
tive sources for Madaba prior to June 30, 1980 in order to allow retention
of this source for use in the Amman water supply system.



Existing Facilities - Water and Sewerage
2.05      The existing water distribution system serves over 80% of the Amman
population through house connections, and the sewage collection system serves
about 28% through service connections. Approximately 75% of the water supply
system and 100% of the sewerage system have been constructed during the past
15 years.
Urban Poor
2.06      AWSA's work program for the five years, 1977-1981, of which the
proposed IDA project is a part, has given high priority to water and sewerage
system construction in urban poor areas. All of the urban poor have access
to public water and as a result of AWSA's program it is estimated that water
service through house connections for the urban poor will increase from 34%
in 1977 to 84% in 1981 and sewer connections from 18% to 74% (Tables I and
II). The estimated number of urban poor to be provided with improved water
service through this project will increase from about 41,000 to 56,000.
Sewerage service will benefit about 36,000 users as compared with an ini-
tially served urban poor population of 11,000. Approximately 20% of the
target population is to be directly affected by the project; and concur-
rently, approximately 20% of the project cost for water and 19% of the
project cost for sewerage will have a significant impact on the urban poor.
Per capita expenditures on urban poor in the project will be approximately
US$175 for water supplies and US$157 for sewerage.

Unaccounted-for Water
2.07      The principal operating problem in the water supply sector in Amman
is the high percentage of unaccounted-for water. Details for the period 1975
through 1977 are shown as follows:
% of Unaccounted-
Year       Population    Water Produced        Water Sold           for-Water
('000)      ---…   ---('000 m3)…--------
1975          626             17,560              9,140                47.9
1976          655             14,210              8,330                41.3
1977 /1       685            17,500              10,850                38.0
/1   Projected.
2.08      The leakage survey conducted by AWSA in 1974 estimated an annual
loss of 1.9 Mm3/year, or approximately 12% of production, through leakage,
above ground defects, and substandard repair methods. In 1975 more than
3,000 leaks were reported and properly repaired; therefore, it is essential
that the program should be continued. No illegal connections were detected
during the survey. AWSA now estimates that, as a result of the ongoing leak
detection and repair program, the annual loss due to leakage is less than 10%.
2.09      Through the installation of improved telephone systems and with
the inauguration of the portable radio communication system, AWSA has greatly
improved communication between key elements of the water distribution system.
This has led to a reduction in losses to less than 1% caused by overflowing
reservoirs.
2.10      Inaccurate metering is responsible for the largest element of
unaccounted-for water. Production meters were found in 1972 to be over-
registering by at least 6% of the gross production. In 1975 over-registration
was estimated to have reached 10% of production. While AWSA is now testing
and monitoring production meters, the procedures need further improvement.
The bulk supply from Wadi Sir to Amman was initially recorded at 80 1/sec,
but a recent AWSA check at the point of entry into the Amman system showed
the flow to be negligible due to increased off-taking by Wadi Sir Municipality.
AWSA pays all the operating costs of the Wadi Sir system in addition to an
annual fee to the Municipality of Wadi Sir for the right to use surplus water.
Dur:Lng negotiations an assurance was received that the Government shall ensure
that the Wadi Sir Municipality and AWSA shall make, by December 31, 1978,
arr<angements whereunder AWSA shall receive a specific daily supply of water
from the Wadi Sir springs in return for operating the facilities and the
payment of a specific fee to the Municipality of Wadi Sir.
2.11      Undoubtedly, the greatest determinant of unaccounted-for water is
the large number of consumer-owned meters on house services. Since these are
generally velocity meters, registration of low flow is inaccurate, partic-
ularly in view of the equalizing effect induced by the roof tanks. In 1975



- 12 -
AWSA's consultants estimated an annual discrepancy of 4.8 Mm3 or 27% of pro-
duction through unmetered flows.  Under Credit 385-JO, AWSA purchased 12,000
volumetric meters to replace the unsatisfactory consumer-owned meters. How-
ever, the majority of these meters were in stock until recently as a court
decided that AWSA was not authorized to remove private meters, install the
Authority's meters and charge a meter rent. The problem has now been resolved
(para 3.03). Under AWSA's recently established meter replacement program,
6,000 meters were replaced through January 1978.  AWSA has initiated a water
conservation program among Government agencies. In the program, AWSA is
conducting a continuing survey of water meters and replacing defective and
inoperative meters in schools, hospitals and institutions.  Faulty valves
and fittings are replaced by the agencies under AWSA direction.
2.12      As a result of all the above activity, the level of unaccounted-for
water has been reduced from 64% in 1972 to 41% in 1976 and is projected as 38%
in 1977.1/  During 1975, for example, the total of over 47% unaccolnted-for
water was based upon the following estimates: 10% due to leakage, 10% to in-
accurate production metering and 27% to under registration in users' meters.
However, fragmentation of responsibility has precluded the implementation of a
successful program for reduction of unaccounted for water. In order to ensure
that top priority is assigned to continuing the efforts to reduce unaccounted-
for water and to achieve the targeted 28% in 1984, agreement was reached
during negotiationis that AWSA will, prior to September 30, 1978:
(a) appoint a senior engineer to be responsible for coordinating
the program for reducing unaccounted-for water with direct
responsibility for (i) leak detection staff; (ii) calibrat-
ing and testing production meters; (iii) consumer meter
replacement staff; and
(b)  establish a meter replacement program to replace not less
than 750 meters per month.
Sewerage Connections
2.13      The Law establishing AWSA provides that all premises in areas pro-
vided with sewer laterals must have a connection installed and the cesspool
closed within three months following official notification by AWSA. The Law
also provides that, if the property owner fails to comply within the statutory
period, AWSA should install the connection and recover the cost plus a 20%
penalty. AWSA has been experiencing difficulties in securing voluntary com-
pliance with this provision, especially for rental properties. Landlords
have not been allowed to increase the rent of sitting tenants during the last
five years and therefore are reluctant to improve their properties. AWSA has
been more active recently in using its statutory power to connect properties.
Up to June 1977, about 300 properties have been compulsorily connected, and
AWSA at present has an ongoing contract of JD 500,000 to connect most of the
premises presently in default. Connections to the sewer system in the two
1/   For comparis;rn. percentage unaccounted-for water for other cities is
as follows: Istanbul, Turkey - 44% (1977), Hodeida, YAR - 40% (1977),
Aleppo, Syria - 29% (1976).



- 13 -
refugee camps under an ongoing contract (para 2.17) will be installed free of
charge. The average connection cost of JD 70.0 has not caused a major problem
for owner-occupants. The existing covenant under Credit 385-JO requires that
AWSA will take all necessary steps to ensure that all premises for which sewer
laterals are constructed under the project will have sewerage service connec-
tions made not later than nine months following completion of the sewer
laterals. This covenant was repeated in the new Project Agreement. In
addition, agreement was reached that AWSA will levy a sewerage surcharge on
properties that are not connected to the sewerage system within the statutory
three month period.
Other Works
2.14      In addition to the IDA project, AWSA will undertake additional
works to improve water supply and sewerage service in Amman.
2.15      USAID will finance part of the AWSA program in which sewerage
extensions will be installed in the Tadj-Mahatta area whose total population
for 1981 is estimated at 136,000. Upon completion of the works, the number
of persons served will be over 62,000 of which approximately 13,500 urban
poor will be included. The USAID project also has a component in which the
existing sewage treatment plant will be upgraded. Major emphasis will be on
improvement of sludge handling and disposal operations.
2.L6      The King Talal Dam reservoir, located about 35 km northwest of
Amman on the Zarqa River, has been defined (para 2.03) as the only presently
developable water resource for Amman. In order to utilize this resource
in an amount of up to 17 Mm3/year (2 Mm3/year for villages en route), final
engineering designs and documents are being prepared by the French consul-
tants, SOGREAH, for AWSA. The first stage elements in this surface water
transmission project include: floating intake, treatment plant, pumping
stations, transmission line and terminal reservoirs. Water will be pumped
from the intake directly into the treatment plant which has an approximate
capacity of 650 lps and thence into an 800 mm transmission line. Three
pumping stations will provide the 900 m lift from the dam reservoir to two
terminal reservoirs in Amman, which have planned capacities of 10,000 m3 each.
These reservoirs will be installed at an elevation approximately 100 m below
the highest service area in Amman, and the final lift into a high level dis-
tribution system will be via booster pumps. Final designs and tender docu-
men,ts are scheduled for completion by mid-1978. Saudi Fund and USAID have
expressed an interest in participating in the financing of this project; in
this regard the delivery date of the documentation may be revised to corre-
spond with these agencies' contracting procedures. Completion of this project
is essential to the provision of sufficient water for Amman's needs by 1982.
Agreement was reached with the Government on a schedule for the preparation of
tender documents and the date of contract award for the King Talal Dam intake,
treatment and transmission facility that will enable construction of the
facility to be completed by 1982. Confirmation of the Government's recent
decision to allocate 17 Mm3 per annum to AWSA from King Talal Dam was secured.
2.L7      AWSA is presently providing piped water supply and sewage collection
systems to the refugee camps (Hussein and Wahdat) and will supply approxi-
mat:ely 165,000 people with both services when construction is complete.

CHAPTER III
THE BENEFICIARY
Introduction
3.01      The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan will be the borrower of the proposed
credit of US$14.0 million and will on-lend the Credit to the Amman Water
and Sewerage Authority (AWSA). This is the third Credit to be provided for
the expansion of the Amman water supply and sewerage systems (para 1.20).
Organization and Management
3.02      A major objective of Credit 18-JO to develop the Amman Municipal
Water Department into an efficient organization was not fully achieved. The
Department was handicapped by poor organization and lack of delegation of
authority, and the engineering and accounting unit remained weak. The opera-
tion and maintenance of water supply facilities suffered from a shortage of
trained supervisory, operational and maintenance staff, caused in part by the
low salary structure. Substantial progress has been made by AWSA in solving
these problems during the last four years, but a considerable amount of work
remains to be done to consolidate the progress made and to improve the opera-
tional and managerial practices.
3.03      AWSA was established by law in 1973 as an autonomous authority to
take over and operate from the Amman Municipality all water supply, sanitary
sewerage and stormwater drainage functions. A new law was enacted on
December 16, 1977, the principal function of which was to authorize AWSA's
compulsory acquisition of customers' meters and to charge meter rent. The
new law was required after a court had held that AWSA did not have this power
under its original law. AWSA's legal structure is adequate.
3.04      Control of AWSA is vested in an eight-member board consisting of
the Lord Mayor of Amman as Chairman, the General Manager of AWSA, two members
of the Municipal Council, one representative each of the Ministry of Health
and the Natural Resources Authority and two representatives of the private
sector. The General Manager, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recom-
mendation of the Board, is responsible for implementing the board's policy
and for the day-to-day operation of the Authority.
Personnel
3.05      AWSA has established a salary structure which is competitive with
the private sector in Jordan and which has enabled it to recruit qualified
staff. Staff turnover is high, averaging 16% per annum during the last three
years, due mainly to the high salaries offered in neighboring Arab countries.
AWSA, in common with the private sector, cannot attempt to offer competitive
salaries to stem this movement and consequently is undertaking an active
training program to maintain the capability of its staff (para 3.06). In



- 15 -
addition, AWSA has overstaffed its departments in order to ensure that adequate
staff are available at all times. Staff increased by 32% in the three-year
period ending July 1977, which was not justified by the increased operational
responsibility. At present, AWSA has 1,040 employees, 770 in the water
section and 270 in the sewerage section, compared with 620 recommended by their
consultants. AWSA is overstaffed by international standards, but not by the
standards of neighboring countries. However, AWSA has an adequate salary
structure and so should be able to achieve increased productivity, thereby
reducing overall staff requirements. Assurance was obtained during negotia-
tions that prior to December 31, 1978 AWSA will undertake a review of staffing
requirements through 1984, prepare a report and discuss the report with IDA
prior to implementation and that during the interim, AWSA will maintain its
staff level under 1,100.
Training
3.06      During the four years, 1974-77, AWSA undertook an active training
program for its staff. Seventy staff members attended courses in Jordan
conducted by foreign consultants and local institutions, and ten members
attended foreign institutes. With the turnover of staff at 16% per annum,
AWSA loses some of the benefits of its training. However, remittances from
these emigrant workers contribute substantial amounts of foreign exchange
to the Jordanian economy; and eventually the majority are expected to return.
To sustain and improve the competence of AWSA's staff, it is essential that
an active training program be maintained. Provision has been included in
the Credit for US$180,000 for the foreign exchange cost of training. The
emphasis in training will be to upgrade the capability of incumbent staff in
order to meet the additional requirements imposed by the expanded facilities
evolving from the proposed investment program. The British Overseas Develop-
ment Administration (ODA) has provided three engineers for design, construc-
ticin supervision and training of counterparts; and training will be provided
by the engineering consultants. AWSA also expects to avail itself of other
bilateral training assistance. During negotiations agreement was reached that
AWSA would prepare a training program by September 30, 1978 and would implement
the program after discussions with the Association.
Accounting
3.07      AWSA had the assistance of an accounting advisor from ODA until
December 1976. An adequate billing and collection and stores control system
is now in operation. However, since the departure of the ODA advisor, diffi-
culties and delays are being experienced in processing of the financial
accounts. To overcome these problems, AWSA has signed a contract with its
local auditor, Shair and Company, to assist in developing the accounting
system and coding the accounts for future transfer to a computer after
implementing the manual accounting system. It is planned to introduce
the new accounting system next year, but a decision to computerize will
not: be made until the manual system has been properly established. This
arrangement is satisfactory and should enable AWSA to overcome the present
accounting problems by mid-1978.



- 16 -
Audit and Insurance
3.08      As required by under Credit 385-JO, AWSA's accounts are audited
annually by independent auditors. AWSA also has standard insurance coverage
for water supply and sewerage installation. The requirements for insurance
and audit under Credit 385-JO are adequate and were repeated in the new
Credit Agreement.

CHAPTER IV
DEMAND AND
MARKET ASPECTS
?2pulation Forecast
4.01      The AWSA consultant, Vattenbyggnadsbyran/Fawzi (VBB), projected
future population for Amman on the basis of the 1961 population census
(246,000), the 1967 Government estimate (330,000) and the 1971 estimate
(521.000). A medium level projection with an annual rate of increase of 5%
gradually decreasing to 3% was used by the mission as the basis for population
forecasting (Figure 1). With this assumption the population of Amman in 1977
would be approximately 700,000 and would reach 850,000 in 1982, and 1,800,000
in 2005. With no official population census since 1961 the only confirmation
of the above forecast is the broadly estimated 25,000 per year population
increase which seems to coincide roughly with the forecast. Average popula-
tion densities vary from 30/1,000 m2 to 60/1,000 m2.
Preseant Consumption
4.02      During the past few years there have been water shortages during
the summers due to seasonally increased demands and to drought conditions
which have prevailed until 1977.  As of mid-1977 the water shortage was
alleviated to a degree, and the reliance on ad hoc measures such as the
widespread use of mobile tankers was reduced considerably. However, per
capita usage has remained relatively low because of the limited groundwater
resources which makes it impossible for AWSA to provide a continuous supply.
In 1977 the consumption was 43 lpcd which is considerably lower than that
for other cities such as Damascus (159 lpcd) and Aleppo (90 lpcd). At
present AWSA provides a minimum of one 24-hour day continuous supply per
week. Through the use of roof tanks this supply assures continuous service
to a majority of AWSA's consumers. Water conservation by individual users
is evident in Amman, and only through the increase in water supplied can a
corresponding increase in demand occur. Maximum day demands therefore are
confined to the very limited area in which daily continuous supply is pro-
vided. The variation in maximum day factor in this area is expected to
reflect a reduction from 1.50 in 1975 to 1.40 in 1981 due to growing popula-
tion and urbanization.
4.03      Water consumption in Amman is principally made up of domestic and
commercial and Government institutional consumption. Industrial consumption
with,in the municipality is limited, because industrial development is gener-
ally, concentrated in the neighboring municipality, Zerqa.
4.04      An analysis of the number of meters in use in 1976 and the range
of consumption in which the meters were operative shows that 69% of the
connections use 31% of the water consumed.



- 18 -
Consumption Forecast
4.05      In 1976 there were 41,607 water connections in the Amman system, and
it is projected that there will be 60,000 connections in 1984. It should be
noted, however, that in Amman, multi-purpose buildings may be served by single
water meters. Therefore, with the recent introduction of the stepped-tariff
and increased rates, it could be advantageous for users to install individual
meters in apartments; and the result would be a relatively substantial increase
in the number of meters installed without an accompanying increase in water
usage. Projections of water connections to the year 2000 are shown in Figure
2.
4.06      The mission's forecasts of water production and consumption as agreed
upon by AWSA are shown in Figure 3. Per capita consumption is expected to
increase from 35 lpcd in 1976 to 58 lpcd in 1984 and approximately 90 lpcd in
2000. This projection of relatively low consumption is reasonable, given the
past history of consumption, high costs of the service, and the scarcity of
water. No provisions for public standpipes have been made in this project.
The non-connected population has traditionally depended upon water tanker
service and roof tanks as well as temporary connections to neighbors'-piped
supplies. AWSA has 31 stationary tankers serving non-connected users.
4.07      Sewerage connections in 1976 totalled 7,900.  By 1984 it is estimated
that a total of 40,000 service connections will have been installed in Amman.
Figure 2 shows the projection of service connections to the year 2000. Connec-
tion to the collection system is compulsory, and a sewer surcharge is levied
on the water rates for properties connected to the sewage collection system.

CHAPTER V
THE PROJECT
Project's Objectives
5.01      The overall project objective is to continue the development of
AWSA's institutional and operational capabilities by:
(a) assisting AWSA in its expansion program of the water
supply and sewer service, for all of the population of
Amman, in accordance with the priorities established
for them by the Government;
(b) establishment of a more progressive tariff structure
which will ensure AWSA's financial viability, provide
access to the services by the poor at a price they can
afford, and establish a rate for large consumers in line
with the marginal cost of supplying the service to ensure
the economic allocation of resources and the conserva-
tion of water;
(c) assisting AWSA during project supervision and monitoring
progress to improve its operation by increasing produc-
tivity, continued emphasis on reduction of unaccounted-
for water, and to assume increased responsibility for
project supervision which has hitherto been undertaken
by expatriate consulting firms;
(d) improving AWSA's maintenance and operation activities
through the furnishing of needed specialized equipment;
and
(e) upgrading the technical and professional skills of the
AWSA staff by assisting in the implementation of a
training program.
Scope of the Project
5.02      The proposed project, which is part of AWSA's ongoing work program,
was prepared by VBB and consists of extending the Amman water distribution
system and the sewage collection system in order to improve the levels of
service in Amman including those areas in which the urban poor reside.  Con-
nections to the water supply system are expected to increase from 41,600 in
1976 to 52,200 in 1980, with a concomitant increase in consumption from 35
lpcd to 48 lpcd.  Water produced will increase from 14.21 Mm3/year in 1976 to
20.00 Mm3/year in 1980, while the figures for water sold in the same years are
8.33 Mm3 and 13.80 Mm3, respectively. Percentage of unaccounted-for water is



- 23 -
expected to improve as well, moving from 41.3% in 1976 to 31.0% in 1980.
AWSA will continue its policy of metering new connections. Sewerage connec-
tions are expected to increase from 7,900 in 1976 to 28,000 in 1980. Sewage
flow will increase from 2.3 Mm3/year in 1976 to 8.0 Mm3 in 1980.
5.03      Present limitations in the number and types of maintenance equip-
ment available for AWSA use which are reflected in existing time-consuming
approaches to maintenance, repair and system augmentation will be reduced
through the provision of such equipment in the proposed project. Routine or
preventive maintenance such as scheduled sewer cleaning, will be expedited
through the use of mechanical rodding equipment, and emergency action will
be reduced considerably. The availability of well-acidizing equipment will
allow for a planned program of well-rehabilitation on a continuing basis.
Project Description
5.04      Project Components:
A.   Water Supply:
Included in the water supply element of the project are:

Cost Estimates
5.05      The total estimated cost of the project is JD 11.19 million
(US$33.91 million) with a foreign exchange cost of JD 6.19 million (US$18.78
million) equal to 55% of the total cost. Details of the cost estimate are
shown below.

TOTAL PROJECT COST               15,129       18,783      33,912       100.0
5.06      The cost estimates were prepared by VBB and revised by the mission
and are based on actual construction price levels prevailing in Jordan in
August 1977. As AWSA is tax exempt, no import taxes were included. Because
final engineering designs have reached or are nearing completion, physical
contingencies of 10% of the base costs are adequate. Construction supervision
is estimated at 5% of base costs. To provide for price escalation during
project execution the expenditures for equipment supply were increased at an
annual rate of 7.5% for 1977, 1978 and 1979, and 7% for 1980. Civil works



- 25 -
expenditures were escalated at annual rates of 15% for 1977, 12% for 1978 and
1979, and 10% for 1980. These relatively high rates for civil works reflect
the effects of protracted shortages of skilled labor in Jordan compounded by
considerable construction activity under way and planned. Calculations of the
foreign exchange component were based on detailed analysis ot works in progress
where applicable, and also on previous experience of AWSA and VBB in Jordan.
Project Implementation
5.07      The network diagram for project activities, covering as well the IDA
functions as they relate to the construction schedule, is attached as Figure
4.  Final designs and tender documents are being prepared by VBB and will be
completed by May 1978. These cover the water supply and sewerage aspects
of the project as well as other activities such as sewage treatment plant
modifications. According to the project time schedule ac+reed upon by AWSA,
IDA and VBB, construction would be completed by mid-1980. The Credit would be
fully disbursed by end 1980.
5.08      The level of construction capability in Jordan is such that the
installation of pipelines and construction of pumping stations and reservoirs
can be competitively executed by local contractors. Several projects with
construction elements of similar scope and complexity are in progress at
present or have recently been completed. This allows for realistic estimating
of the various components of the project.
5.09      Although foreign consulting engineers will be engaged by AW4SA to
supervise construction it is noted that some of this responsibility can be
readily assumed by AWSA, since AWSA has already demonstrated its ability in
this aspect of project implementation. During negotiations an agreement
was reached that AWSA would directly supervise water system installation
and sewer construction in Jebel Hussein, Jebel Amman and Sport City and
sewer construction in Smissani and Nuzha. Agreement was also reached that
AWSA will continue to employ engineering consultants satisfactory to IDA
for supervision of other works.
Procurement
5.10      Procurement of civil works contracts for the water and sewerage
services in Abdoun, Shamsani, Smissani, Nazzal, Nadif and Zuhour areas, which
forms part of the project, will not be procured under ICB procedures as AWSA
expects to secure USAID financing for this work. No IDA financing will be
provided for these civil works contracts. All major contracts financed by the
Association would be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement. For bid evaluation
purposes, a 15% margin of preference or an amount equal to customs duties,
whichever is lower, would be applied in the case of equipment manufactured
in Jordan. Contracts for civil works, materials and equipment of less than
JD 66,000 (US$200,000) aggregating to not more than JD 330,000 (US$1,000,000)
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally.

CHAPTER VI
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
6.01      AWSA's financial results in the water supply sector during the
three years 1974-76 were unsatisfactory, with operating losses of JD 69,000
in 1974 rising to JD 509,000 in 1976 (Table 4). The major cause of these
losses has been the high rates of inflation during these years resulting in
an increased operating cost of about 100% in the two years 1975-76. Other
contributing factors were overstaffing and the severe drought experienced
during this period which resulted in a 20% shortfall in volume of water sold
in 1976 compared to projections. However, during this period AWSA adhered to
the financial covenant of Credit 385-JO of charging not less than 75 fils/m3
for water sold. AWSA achieved a small profit on the operation of the sewerage
section in 1974-76 which was satisfactory in view of the high inflation rates
and better than the break-even financial performance required under the
previous credit.
6.02      On January 1, 1977, AWSA increased average water tariff by about
50%, in order to cover operating costs and generate the required 6% rate of
return for 1977. Early in 1977, electricity charges were doubled and AWSA
salaries and wages were increased by 25%. Revised projections for 1977
indicate that AWSA will break-even on operating costs including depreciation
for the water supply and sewerage sections. AWSA performance in taking the
necessary actions to comply with the revenue covenants has been satisfactory,
but mainly due to inflation and lack of cost control the desired financial
results have not been achieved. Work on maintaining the systems and com-
pleting the project work has not been disrupted by shortage of funds as the
Government has provided the necessary finance on time.
Tariffs
6.03      On January 1, 1973, AWSA introduced a flat tariff for water sup-
plied of 75 fils/m3 (US$0.23). In April 1975 a progressive tariff system was
introduced which maintained the average 75 fils/m3 rate, but provided for a
20% decrease to 60 fils/m3 for low consumption to ensure access to potable
water supply by poor members of the community. This tariff was in line with
the agreement reached during negotiation of the first Credit to AWSA. On
January 1, 1977 and 1978, AWSA increased the average water tariff by about
50% and 63% respectively, but maintained the 60 fils/m3 rate for the first
block. The average tariff for water sold is presently 196 fils/m3 (US$0.65).
The tariff progressivity (ratio between maximum and minimum) at 4.33 is satis-
factory. The present cost of water supply and sewerage services to about 20%
of AWSA's poorest customers represents about 1% of the estimated urban house-
hold income of those at the poverty line. The sewerage surcharge on water
consumed has remained unchanged for the last four years but was increased by
about 65% to 50 fils/m3 (US$0.16) on January 1, 1978. At present, AWSA
derives 31% of its sewerage income from the surcharge and the balance of
69%, from connection charges (29%), sewerage tax (31%) and other income (9%).
The water surcharge is projected to yield 52% of AWSA's sewerage income in



- 31 -
1981 as the present sewerage tax is fixed by law at 4% of the rental value
of all property in Amman.
6.04      AWSA is presently committed under the Project Agreement for Credit
385-JO to earn a rate of return on water supply net fixed assets in operation
of 7-1/2% in 1978. The new tariff introduced in 1978 is projected to yield
13.1% which is sufficient to meet the current rate of return and to make up
the shortfall for 1977. The Project Agreement also requires AWSA to break
even on operating costs in the sewerage section, and the current surcharge
is sufficient to meet this requirement. AWSA's performance in adhering to
the revenue covenants has been excellent.
6.05      AWSA's investment program for the four years 1978-81 to extend the
water supply and sewerage systems and to transport water from King Talal Dam
is estimated to cost JD 36.8 (US$111.5) million. This is very high and
reflects the considerable expense of supplying water to Amman. AWSA's own
resources available for development over the program period are limited by:
(i) high cost of providing water, (ii) the need to preserve a low first block
tariff to cover the requirements of the poor, and (iii) the timing and size
of the increases which can be reasonably asked from other consumers. Never-
theless, in addition to providing revenue for AWSA a highly progressive tariff
is rLeeded to insure a more equitable distribution of the limited amount of
water which will be available during the next few years and assist in the
essential task of conserving water in semi-arid regions. Taking all of these
factors into account, it is considered that AWSA would only be able to con-
tribute a moderate 10% towards its investment program from its own resources
over the period 1978-81. This would require on average a higher rate of
return than the 7-1/2% presently covenanted. To meet the 10% contribution
AWSA would need to increase tariffs again by about 30% in 1980.  Assuming
a 30% increase is implemented in 1980, present forecasts indicate rates of
return on historically valued assets of 13.1% in 1978, 9.3% in 1979, 15.7% in
1980 and 14.3% in 1981. When this increase has been implemented the top step
of the tariff will approximate the average long-term incremental cost of water
(para 7.02); but the average revenue per m3 will still be about 40% below this
cost, and further tariff increases would be required. After project comple-
tion and assuming a further tariff increase of 40% in 1982, it is expected
that AWSA would be able to increase its contribution to development to about
20%, with rates of return on historically valued assets in the 6-9% range.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that prior to September 30, 1979
(when all major contracts would have been awarded) AWSA will review the water
supply tariff and will implement revised rates, not later than January 1,
1980, which are adequate to cover operating expenses (excluding depreciation),
debt service and increased working capital and to provide revenue sufficient
to finance, during the period 1978-81 not less than 10% of the investment
cost, and beginning with the year 1982 AWSA will implement tariffs which will
finance each year not less than 20% of the average cost of investment during
each consecutive three-year period comprising an actual and two forecast
years.



- 32 -
6.06      The present Credit requirement for the sewerage section that rates
be fixed so as to yield sufficient revenue to meet operating and maintenance
costs, provision for depreciation, and debt service requirement to the extent
they exceed the provision for depreciation, is satisfactory and was repeated
under this credit. This provision will require AWSA to raise charges by about
37% in 1981 when the sewer system in new areas come into completion.

NPC is holding discussions with the Saudi Fund for Development, USAID and
bilateral agencies to secure funds for AWSA's investment program. Most of the
funds will be borrowed by the Government and onlent to AWSA at the current Gov-
ernment onlending terms for water authorities, 25 years, including four years'
grace at an interest rate of 6% per annum. It was agreed that IDA funds would
be onlent on the same terms. Because of AWSA's major investment program at
this stage the Government has decided to make an equity contribution of US$20.0
million. The Government has requested the Saudi Fund to provide a loan of
US$20.0 million for AWSA's investment program and USAID proposes to provide a
loan of US$28.5 in FY1978. A condition of effectiveness of the credit is that



- 33 -
the SaLudi Fund Loan Agreement and the USAID Loan Agreement have been signed.
USAID is expected to make a further loan of US$12.0 million for AWSA's program
in 1979. This would leave the Government with a balance of US$19.0 million
(excluding interest during construction of US$7.2 million) to be provided
from its own resources or other bilateral agencies for the financing of this
project.
Future Financial Performance
6.08      The projected firnancial statements of AWSA for the period 1978-84
are in Tables 4-7. The principal financial assumption used in the projection
were as follows:
(a) AWSA would maintain its present staff levels until the
King Talal transmission system comes into operation in
1982;
(b) the King Talal transmission system will supply 2 million
m3 of water per annum to villages en route. The pumping
cost of this water was not included, and it was assumed that
AWSA would be reimbursed for this cost by the Government
or villages supplied; and
(c) operating costs were inflated by 11% in 1978-79, 9% in 1980-81,
7% in 1982-83 and 5% in 1984.
AWSA"s capital structure is projected to increase by about 300% during the
four years 1978-81 to JD 46 million. The debt equity ratio is projected to
change from 40:60 in 1977 to 65:35 in 1981 due to the Government's policy
of providing the major part of finance to water authorities in the form of
loans. The water supply section's net fixed assets are projected to increase
by about 500% to JD 30 million in 1982 while the sewerage fixed assets are
projsected to increase by about 175% to JD 14 million.
6.09      AWSA's debt service will increase over threefold between 1977 and
1983, and the percentage of gross revenue required to meet debt service will
increase from 30% to 38% during the same period. Net cash generation from
operations is projected to cover debt service 1.2 times in 1983. Under the
Project Agreement for Credit 385-JO, AWSA is committed not to incur any
long-term debt without the Association's concurrence, unless its net revenue
is not less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service. During 1977 AWSA secured
three loans amounting to JD 1.3 million to finance its ongoing water and
sewerage investment program without securing IDA's agreement as required by
the Project Agreement. One loan is repayable within twelve months, and the
other two loans are for a period of five years at an interest rate of 8% per
annum. Such short term borrowing is unsuitable for financing long-term
investment in water and sewerage systems, and the Government has agreed to
assume liability for these three loans as part of the proposed financing plan.
The current covenant was repeated in the new Project Agreement.

CHAPTER VII
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Solution
7.01      The proposed project aims at improving the water supply and sewerage
facilities in Amman. Design of the proposed systems is in accordance with
sound engineering principles utilizing acceptable design criteria and valid
approaches. The proposed project will utilize existing principal mains. The
overall design of the proposed system was reviewed, and the pipe sizes and
configuration of the mains and laterals as well as the location and design of
the reservoirs and pumping and lift stations were reviewed by the mission.
Several alternative options were studied in connection with sewage force mains,
and the force mains and lift station proved to be the least cost solution.
A discount rate of 10% was used for the calculations. The project works
represent the least cost solution for expanding and improving the Amman water
supply and sewerage systems.
Average Long-Term Incremental Cost - Water Supply
7.02      The average long-term incremental cost of water supply in Amman,
including the King Talal transmission system, is estimated at about 330 fils
(US$1.00)/m3 at a discount rate of 10% which is the estimated opportunity cost
of capital in Jordan. AWSA is expected to maintain the present relationship
between the average tariff and the highest step of the progressive tariff
structure. So the tariff to be levied on consumption in excess of 100 m3 per
quarter would be 471 fils/m3 (302 fils/m3 in 1977 prices) and would compare
favourably with the long-term incremental cost of this seivice. Based on
present consumption patterns, over 30% of AWSA's water sales would be charged
at the high rate.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
7.03      There are a variety of benefits associated with the provision of
a convenient and safe water supply and sewerage system i. Amman. Among the
more important benefits of the improved water supply and sewerage systems will
be the health benefits and the control of water pollution. These benefits
are partially revealed through medical cost savings, a general improvement in
individual well-being, and a cost savings to, or an increased productivity
of, business enterprises. This follows from the fact that a healthier popula-
tion will require less health care, tend to have lower employment absentee
rates, and to be more productive while in the job. These benefits, however,
cannot be accurately quantified. The major justification for the project
investment is that the provision of adequate water supply and the collection
and treatment of sewage in Amman is necessary for healthful and orderly
development of the area and that the proposed extension of the water supply
and collection and treatment of sewage is the least cost solution.



- 39 -
7.04      The internal economic rate of return on the water supply component
of the project, was calculated using incremental water sales at 1978 prices as
a minimum measure of benefits. The internal economic rate of return on the
water supply investment is estimated at 9%. Because connection to the sewer-
age system is compulsory, the consumer's willingness to pay cannot be based on
the present tariff and therefore an internal economic rate of return for the
sewerage investment based on incremental revenue is not meaningful.
Risks
7.05      AWSA's experience in project supervision, in addition to the assis-
tance to be received from engineering consultants, will ensure that the risks
in construction of the project will be normal for a water supply and sewerage
project. The willingness of the Amman users to pay for water supply is evident
at present. The conservative increase projected in per capita consumption of
water will not be difficult to absorb even at the higher tariff levels in view
of the widespread shortages in the recent years. Except for a recurrence of
the severe drought conditions of 1974-75 which would limit the groundwater
resources, the risk of not achieving the technical, financial and organiza-
tionial objectives of the project is low.
Environmental Impact
7.06      Through implementation of this project the Authority will supply
safe water to a larger number of persons including urban poor, thereby
reducing possible dependence upon unsafe water. Similarly, the provision of
piped sewage collection systems to a larger segment of the population of
Amman will reduce the use of cesspools and thereby lessen the greatest danger
of contamination of the aquifers which are the source for Amman water supply.

CHAPTER VIII
AGREEMENT REACHED AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on various issues
referred to in Chapters 1 through 4 and 6 of the report, including the fol-
lowing which is of particular significance:
AWSA will review the water supply tariff prior to
September 30, 1979 (when all major contracts would
have been awarded) and will implement revised rates,
not later than January 1, 1980, which are adequate
to cover operating expenses (excluding depreciation),
debt service and increased working capital and to
provide revenue sufficient to finance, during the
period 1978-81 not less than 10% of the investment
cost, and beginning with the year 1982 AWSA will
implement tariffs which will finance each year not
less than 20% of the average cost of investment during
each consecutive three-year period comprising an
actual and two forecast years (para 6.05).
8.02      A condition of effectiveness of the Credit is that the Saudi Fund
Loan Agreement and the USAID Loan Agreement have been signed (para 6.07).
8.03      Agreement having been reached on the issues set forth in this report,
the project is suitable for an IDA Credit to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
of US$14.0 million.
