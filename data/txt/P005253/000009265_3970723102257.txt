AMMA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT III
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This report reviews the preparation, implementation and Pchievements
of the Amman Water Supply and Sewerage Project III (Credit 780-JO), Jordan,
for which a credit of US$14.0 million was made to the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan. The credit was signed in May 1978. became effective in October 1978,
and was closed in June 1983. The Amman Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA)
was the implementing agency for the project.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East
and North Africa Regional Office on the basis of the findings of a project
completion mission which visited Amman in November 1983 and of a review of the
President's and Staff Appraisal Reports, the Development and Project
Agreements, and other reports related to project implementation.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Government and AWSA for their comments. Comments received have
been reproduced as Appendices A, B and C to the report.

HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
CREDIT 780-JO
AMMAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT III
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
Credit 780-JO, approved in March 1978 for an amount of
US$14.0 million, was the Bank's fourth credit to Jordan in the water supply
and sewerage sector. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan was the borrower and the
Amman Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA) was the project implementing and
executing agency. Credit 780-JO was expected to finance about 75 percent of
the estimated foreign exchange requirements and to cover about 41 percent of
total project cost of US$33.9 million.
The project aimed at continuing the development of AWSA's
institutional and operational capabilities and improving the water supply and
sewerage services.
The credit became effective with a slight delay (para 3.01). Project
start-up was delayed by about 5 months mainly because tender evaluation took
longtr than expected (para 3.02). A change was made in a major element
affecting but not included in the project, namely the development of the Azraq
ground water source instead of the King Talal dam (para 3.06).
The estimated project implementation schedule was relatively well
maintained and contract execution well organised; the extension of the
project completion period was due mainly to the inclusion of additional works
(paras 3.08, 3.09). Credit disbursements were similarly affected.
Total project costs as adjusted for revisions amounted to JD 7.10
million as compared with appraisal estimates of JD 11.19 million (para.
3.18). The reasons for overall savings appear to have been very favorable
bids and to some extent overestimation of costs at appraisal.



- vi -
Unaccounted-for water remains high due mainly to increased leakage
caused by increased water pressure and continuous water supply (para 4.07).
Remedial actions are being taken (para. 4.08)
AWSA's overall financial performance was below appraisal
expectations. Due to alterations in project scope and the consequent changes
in sources of finance, the Government had to meet a large part of AWSA's debt
service.  Recent changes in Government policy combined with improved efforts
in reducing unaccounted for water should improve AWSA's financial situation
(paras. 4.06, 4.07 and 5.07).
The recalculated rate of return (8X) is slightly lower than the
appraised one (9%). This stems from lower revenues partly offset by lower
than anticipated project costs (para. 8.03).
The project was successful in all major aspects. An important lesson
learned is the need for increased efforts in reducing unaccounted for water,
both to postpone investments and tariff increases (para. 9.01).



HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
CREDIT 780-JO
AMMAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT III
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I.   INTRODUCTION
Background Data
1.01     The project constituted an integral part of an ongoing
development program for the extension of water supply, sewerage and
sewage disposal facilities for the municipality of Amman, and was a
continuation of previous IDA financial assistance in the water supply and
sewerage sector. It's cost was estimated at US$33.9 million including a
US$18.8 million (55X) foreign currency component.
1.02     The borrower was the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the project
implementing agency was the Amman Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA),
created in 1973 as a semi-autonomous entity with the responsibility for
water supply, sewerage and storm water drainage in the Amman
Municipality, except that its tariff's and budget were subject to the
decision of the Council of Ministers.
Bank Role in the Sector
1.03     The Bank group involvement in the water supply and sewerage
sector began in 1961 with the financing of the foreign exchange component
of a project to augment and improve the Amman water supply.  This was
followed in 1963 by the financing of water supply projects in Ramallah-El
Bira, Azrate-Irbid and Zarqa.   Then in 1973 the Bank group helped
finance the extension of water supply and sewerage services for Amman and
was instrumental at that time in the establishment of AWSA. This was
followed in 1978 by the project under review and subsequently in 1982 by
the Zarqa-Ruseifa project (Loan 2213-JO) which is still under
implementation and aims at improving water supply and to establish a
modern sewerage system in Zarqa and Ruseifa. In 1984 a loan was made for
the Eight Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan 2425-JO) for
water supply and sewerage in eight medium size cities, six in the north
and two in the south of Jordan.

II.   PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Pro lect Orisin and Preparation
2.01     Ammar- is the capital and the center of Jordan's commezcial
activLty. During the two decades which preceded the appraisal its
population had quadrupled and with the influx of refugees the need for
adequate water supply and sewerage services had accelerated.
2.02     The King Talal impoundment had been selected for development as
a new water source, and AWSA had employed consulting firms (foreign and
local) to undertake feasibility studies and final engineering. With
increased water supply, however, the waste water disposal problem would
be aggravated with enhanced risk for ground water pollution. To increase
the sewerage coverage, the same consulting firms as for water supply were
appointed to carry out related feasibility study and engineering works.
2.03     IDA financial assistance was requested by tne Government for the
works related to water distribution and sewage collection while other
financing was being secured for water source development.   The project
was appraised on the basis of the feasibility study, in August 1977,
after about six months of project preparation.
2.04     IDA's contribution to project preparation consisted mainly in
providing assistance in the appointment of consulting firms and in the
identification of a project package. AWSA and the consulting firms
performed well in their respective functions.
Project Objectives
2.05     The project objectives were to ti) continue the development of
AWSA's institutional and operational capabilities; and (ii) provide
effective water supply and sewerage services in Jordan's major urban area.
Project Description
2.06     The project originally consisted of:
(i)    Water Supply:
-    approximately 207 kmal' of mains and house
connections, a 4000 m3 capacity reservoir and a
booster station;
-    supply of electrical and mechanical equipment for the
pumping plant;
" Out of 207 km about 116 km were for mains and 91 km for
connections.



- 3 -
supply of pipes, valves and fittings;
supply of 15,000 water meters; and
consultant services for construction supervision.
(ii)    Sewerage:
-    approximately 225 kmt' of mains, laterals, and
service connections and two lift stations;
-    supply of electrical and mechanical equipment for
pumping plants; and
-    consultant services for construction supervision.
(iii)    Miscellaneous:
-    operational and maintenance equipment; and
-    provision of training.
2.07     The project was scheduled to be completed in about 30 months by
December 31, 1980.
Other Works
2.08     Other major works to be executed concurrently with the project
were: (i) development of the King Talal water source including works for
intake, water treatment, transmission main and pumping station; (ii)
extension of the sludge handling facilities at the Ain Ghazal Treatment
Works (ACTP); and (iii) extension of water distribution and sewage
networks as needed and to the extent not being covered under the
project. Financial assistance was to be received for works under 2.08
(i), (ii), and (iii) from USAID and for works under 2.08 (i) also from
the Saudi Fund.
Loan Covenants and Conditions of Effectiveness
2.09     A Development Credit Agreement (Credit 780-JO) was entered into
between IDA and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (the Borrower) and a
Project Agreement between IDA and the Amman Water and Sewerage Authority
(AWSA). The Borrower further entered into Loan Agreements with USAID and
the Saudi Fund and a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with AWSA.
2.10     According to the Development Credit Agreement the Borrower was
to ensure (i) the allocation of local funds to AWSA; and (ii) the
2' Out of 225 km about 127 km were for mains and laterals and 98 km
for connections.

execution of the King Talal water source development with a secured
annual allocation of L7 mi'lion cubic meters (HCM) to AWSA.
2.11     According to the Project Agreement AWSA was to:
{i)    appoint 3n experienced senior engineer to be responsible
for r-.quired steps to be taken for reducing lnaccounted-for
wat-.er (Section 3.01[b][il);  this is discussed in paras.
4.J5 through 4.07;
(ii)    undertake a review of its staffing requirements and
maintain its salary structure (Section 3.0l[b][ii);
(iii)    enforce the legal requirements for connecting to the sewage
system and levying a sewerage surcharge in case of
no-connection (Section 3.06 [a] and [bl);
(iv)    establish and maintain a- meter replacement program with at
least 750 meters to be replaced per month (Section 3.07);
{v)    carry out a staff training program (Section 3.08);
(vi)    have its accounts audited and submit relevant reports to
IDA by no later than 4 months after the end of each fiscal
year (Section 4.02);
(vii)    establish and maintain water charges sufficient to cover
all operational expenses, debt service, working capital
needs and 10% of capital investments for the fiscal years
1978 through 1981 and 20% thereafter (Section 4.03ta][iJ to
[ivl); this is discussed in para. 5.07;
(viii)    establish and maintain sewerage charges sufficient to cover
all operational costs and debt service to the extent not
covered by depreciation (Section 4.03[b]); and
(ix)    incur no debt without prior IDA approval and maintain net
revenues covering not less than 1.5 times debt service
requirement (Section 4.04).
All covenants except the one described in para. 2.11 'vii) above were
basically complied with.

III.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01     The execution of the Loan Agreements between the Government and
the USAID and the Saudi Fund, which was a special condition of
effectiveness was carried out promptly and the credit was declared
effective on October 17, 1978 or about 5 months after signature.
3.02     The final engineering progressed roughly as originally envisaged
but the first construction works commenced some five months behind
estimated schedule mainly because tender evaluation took longer than
expected.
Revision of Scope of Work
3.03     Following a review of the King Talal Reservoir it was concluded
that the water quality was not satisfactory for use as a source for
domestic water supply. Neither was the projected water availability
considered to be sufficiently reliable. Consequently the Government
decided (July 14, 1979) to use the King Talal Reservoir exclusively for
irrigation water supply and to develop the Azraq ground water source for
domestic water supply. The yield of the Azraq ground water source would
be about 15 HCM or slightly below the 17 MCM originally expected of the
King Talal water source. The Bank Loan documents were amended
accordingly in October 1979, while the loans from USAID and Saudi Fund
were cancelled and local financing was made available for the Azraq
ground water source development.
3.04     Within the description of the project and in line with its
objectives, the Bank agreed in 1981 to finance the laying of a 4 km
transmission main between the Ain Ghazal and Taj pumping stations and of
24 km of trunk and sewage network; and the purchase of 15 water tankers
to serve areas not covered by the distribution system.
3.05     Because of the change in water source (para. 3.03), the water
eventually entered the distribution system at a lower elevation than
originally planned which necessitated additional pumping capacity.
During final engineering it was also found that the booster station could
be omitted and related funds were instead used for the extension of
existing pumping plants. It was also found feasible to omit the two
proposed sewage lift stations, by realigning pertinent trunk mains.
3.06     A comparison between appraisal and actual lengths of pipes and
number of connections is shown below;

/    This shows the situation in December 1983 or six
months after project completion.
Project Implementation
3.07    The major contracts entered into under the project as appraised are
summarized as follows:
Contract No.                 Item
2s          Sewers in Shimesani and Nushz Areas.
3WS         Water mainS and sewers in J. Hussein, J. Amman and
Sports City.
4WS         Water mains and sewers in Hashemi, Qusour and Nazzal;
and reservoir at Rashemi.
6WS         Water mains and sewers in Martea.
7MW         Pipe supply for 3WS, 4WS and 6WS.
8MW         Equipment for pumping plants.
9mW         Supply of water meters.
Various     Additional works (para. 3.04)
3.08     A comparison between appraisal estimates and the actual
implementation of the major contracts is shown on Chart 1. Contract 3WS was



- 7 -
completed with about 12 months delay mainly because of the contractor's
financial problems. The completion of contract 4WS was delayed because of the
commissioning of the storage tank which took 2 years longer than anticipated
as a result of a leakage problem, which was, however, satisfactorily
corrected. Contract 8MW was revised because of changes in water source
development (para. 3.03) and the timing for its execution was adjusted
accordingly (3.09).  Finally the additional contracts, which were agreed upon
in 1981, were executed on schedule.  The estimated project implementation
schedilde was relatively well maintained and contract execution was well
organized and the extension of the project completion period was mainly due to
the inclusion of additional works (para. 3.04). AWSA's project management and
construction supervision unit supervised the execution of contracts 2S and
3WS (para. 3.07), while other contracts were supervised by consultants.
3.09     The Azraq ground water source development with transmission main -as
completed in September 1980 after a comparatively brief construction period
and the change of water source did not delay the provision of additional water
supply to the Amman area.
Reporting
3.10     The reporting system consisted of quarterly and annual reports
utilizing key indicators as agreed upon. Both reports were submitted on a
fairly regular basis.
Procurement
3.11     AWSA's consultants prepared the tender and contract documents and
carried out tender evaluation. Preparation was timely as was rDA's review and
response. AWSA entered into 13 contracts of which 7 were under ICB and 6
under LCB. No contract was awarded to a foreign bidder.
3.12     According to the Project Agreement contracts for civiL works and
equipment of less than US$200,000 aggregating to no more than US$1,000,000
could be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally
(LCB). As a result of IDA's agreement to finance additional works (para.
3.04) contracts totalling about US$4.3 million equivalent and amounting to
about 20% of total project costs were awarded on the basis of LCB.
3.13     The provision for retroactive financing up to US$1.5 million was not
used.
3.14     The comparatively high cost of construction supervision which
amounted to US$1.3 million or about 6% of total construction costs, was mainly
due to the rather significant use of foreign consultants.
3.15     Contracts for the water distribution system contracts were initially
awarded separately for civil works and equipment supply. This created certain
coordination difficulties and experience indicates that combined contracts
would have been preferable.

3.19     Final project costs including additional works (para. 3.04) were 63%
and 61% in JD and US$ respectively of appraisal estimates. In the project
execution period actual and forecast inflation were relatively close. The
reasons for overall savings appear to have been very favorable bids and to
some extent overestimation of costs at appraisal.
Disbursement
3.20     Disbursements started some 12 months later than appraisal and were

completed about 36-months later than originally forecast. This reflects {i)
the delay incurred in getting work underway (para. 3.02); (ii) the lower than
estimated costs; and the decision to finance addtional works (para. 3.04).
Performance of Consultants. Contractors, Suppliers and AWSA
3.21     In general the consulting firms performed well.  The civil works ar.d
equipment supply contracts were basically completed on schedule and the
quality of most of the work was satisfactory. The initial testing results
were approved except for the storage tank where rather significant remedial
works had to be undertaken to achieve water tightness. AWSA performed very
well and developed its capability in project management and construction
supervision significantly.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Introduction
4.01     The subject areas addressed in the evaluation of the operating
performance are the following: (i) water sources development; (ii) increase
in population coverage by public water supply;  (iii) control of unaccounted-
for water; (iv) increase in population coverage by sewerage system; and (v)
coverage of urban poverty popuiation groups.
Water Sources Development
4.02     The water production capacity has increased slightly less than
projected from 17 MCM to 32 MCM through the addition of 15 MCM from the Azraq
groundwater source. The daily per capita water production has increased from
72 liters (1978) to 118 liters (1983) and the water distribution has changed
from partly intermittent to continuous supply.
Water Supply
4.03     According to a population census undertaken in 1979 the population
figures used at the time for appraisal were on average overestimated by about
20%. A comparison between appraisal and revised projections for the
municipality of Amman is shown below.
1977     1978      1979     1980      1981     1982      1983

The population coverage by a piped water supply system has increased from
about 80% at the time of appraisal to about 98% in 1982 which is broadly in
line with the appraisal estimates. Remaining population is served by water
tankers.
4.04     Estimated and actual data on water production, water sold,
unaccounted-for water and number of water connections are summarized as
follows:

In the period 1977 to 1983 an additional 160,000 people were served by water
connections while many more received improved service. Analyses also show
that water quality has improved. The number of water connections exceeded
estimates by a wide margin due no doubt to the new practice of installing
water meters for individual apartments. However, the total quantity of water
sold was below estimates due mainly to an overestimation of the population.
The forecast reduction of unaccounted-for water was not realized (para.
4.06-4.07); as a result more water had to be produced than had been originally
foreseen.
Unaccounted-for Water
4.05     In 1975, unaccounted-for water amounted to 47% of water produced. It
was then estimated that 10% was due to leakage, 10% to inaccurate production
metering and 27% to underregistration of users' meters. AWSA has now
appointed a senior engineer to coordinate its program for reducing
unaccounted-for water which includes (i) leak detection; (ii) calibrating and
testing production meters; and (iii) a meter replacement program with no less
than 750 meters to be replaced per month.
4.06     Actions taken or being taken include: (i) a monitoring system
established for each distribution zone with appropriate data being recorded;
(ii) production meters being installed where needed and properly calibrated;
(iii) velocity meters, which were the only ones existing by 1978, are
comparatively inaccurate at low flows, are being replaced by volumetric



- 12 -
meters; 70% of all meters are at present volumetric and it is planned to
increase the coverage to 100% by the end of 1984; (iv) it is currently
estimated that out of the present unaccounted-for water of about 44%, between
25% and 30% (as compared to 10% estimated in 1975 [para.4.061) is due to
leakage which has increased because of higher and continuous distribution
system pressure, while the unaccounted-for water related to metering
inaccuracies has decreased; and (v) leak detection is being undertaken on a
continuous basis with about 70 repairs being done per day; the leakage mainly
occurs at small diameter pipes and at connections points.
4.07     Additional steps contemplated for further reduction of
unaccounted-for water consist of: (i) the total renewal of the metering
system, which however, is expected to have only a limited effect; (ii) the
strengthening of the leak detection teams and (iii) water distribution system
rehabilitation.
Sewerage Coverage
4.08     Estimated and actual data on population served and number of sewer
connections are summarized below:

-' The data are based on the same proportion as apply for water sold and
water surcharged for sewerage.
From 1977 through 1983 some 360,000 additional people have been served by
sewer connections. The increased coverage was less than forecast at the
beginning of the implementation period but accelerated after 1979.
Urban Poor
4.09     The provision of adequate water supply and sewerage services for
urban poverty groups was a major project objective which has been achieved



- 13 -
since (i) almost the total population has been provided with satisfactory
water supply; and (ii) the bulk of the densely populated areas (including
refugee camps), where most of the urban poor resides, has been covered by a
sewerage network.

V.   FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Introduction
5.01     The appraisal forecast and actual Income Statements, Cash Flow
Statements and Balance Sheet for AWSA from 1978 - 1983 are in Annexes 1 - 4.
A summary analysis of AWSA's financial performance follows.
Opera:ting Results
5.02     AWSA's operating results were less favorable than foreseen at
appraisal. This was mainly due to its water supply operation where revenues
were lower and operating costs higher than forecast. The revenue shortfall
was due to excessive unaccounted-for water in a period of unsatisfied total
demand and higher than originally forecast production. Appropriate action has
been initiated by the Water Authority, AWSA's successor (paras. 4.06 and
4.07). Increased operating costs have been affected mainly by rising
personnel costs.
Sources and Application of Funds
5.03     The appraisal forecast (1978 - 1981) and the actual (1978 - 1983)
sources and applications of funds may be summed up as follows:

5.04     Overall funds requirements were remarkably close to appraisal
forecast, although substantial changes occurred in planned expenditures
(paras. 3.03 to 3.06). Sources were affected mainly by lower cash generation
and higher debt service than foreseen at appraisal. This shortfall was
compensated by Government and other contributions and higher borrowings. The
lower cash generation stenmed from overall lower revenues due to lower volume
and average revenues per cubic meter of water and higher operating expenses
than originally foreseen. The higher debt service resulted mainly from the
replacement of concessionary borrowings from USAID and the Saudi Fund (para.
3.03) by much more costly and shorter financing in the local bond market.

5.06     The water tariff in Jordan is very high, and although actual average
charges have been somewhat below the projected ones, the level of these
charges would have been generally adequate had the expected reduction in the
unaccounted-for water been realized (para. 5.02).
Financial Covenants
5.07     The cash generation covenant for water supply was not met for the
reasons given in para. 5.02 and 5.04, and the Government serviced most of
AWSA's debts. During the course of project implementation IDA had recommended
that the Government agree that the proceeds from the bonds be treated as
equity, by officially assuming the corresponding debt service. During the
recent negotiation of the Eight Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan
2425-JO) the Government pledged to continue the practice of servicing all
charges associated with these bonds. On this basis the covenant should be met.

VI.   INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organizational Development
6.01     The major institutional objective of the project which consisted of
AWSA's assuming an increased share of responsibility for the supervision of
project implementation was accomplished. However the objective of increasing
productivity though staff reduction was not fully met although as can be seen
from Annex 5 there has  been a substantial reduction in the number of  staff
per 1000 customers served. It is generally admitted that AWSA's water supply
system which consists of dispersed water wells and balancing reservoirs is
fairly labor intensive. A study of the staffing needs is to be undertaken in
the context of the recent creation of the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ).
6.02     AWSA's organizational structure had remained about the same as at
appraisal until it was absorbed by WA in early 1984. The operation of the
Financial Department was affected by the difficulty of recruiting a suitable
Financial Director. However, AWSA benefitteo Lrom the assistance of financial
and technical advisors provided by USAID. Its taking over responsibility for
water meter repairs contributed to improved maintenance.
Training
6.03     The training activities undertaken by AWSA have been two-pronged with
the training of AWSA staff members overseas and the establishment of a
training unit conducting training courses.
6.04     The overseas training has covered 17 staff members mainly at the
higher managerial levels and has basically been undertaken through ccoperation
with the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC), where the trainees
have been exposed to WSSC's daily management and operational practices.
6.05     A training unit was established in 1982 and a Training Director
appointed. Progress to date may be summarized as follows: (i) physical
facilities and training material have been arranged; (ii) 24 courses have
been prepared; the training is concentrating on operating and maintenance
matters which initially has highest priority; and (iii) during 1983, 60 staff
members have attended different training courses; this number is expected to
at least double in 1984. Training is progressing satisfactorily.

VII.   IDA PERFERKANCE
7.01     A good rapport existed between !DA, the Borrower, and AWSA throughout
project preparation and implementation. During the implementation of this
project the Government requested the Bank to carry out a Water Sector Study
for Jordan. Recommendations made in this study (Report No. 4699-JO) have been
well received by the Government and forms the basis for development of further
strategies in the sector. IDA's good relationship with AWSA also facilitated -
access to other governmental departments, bilateral agencies and international
agencies resident in Jordan.
7.02     IDA supervised the project about twice a year on the average which
was adequate. Missions fielded by IDA were balanced, provided continuity and
had the necessary expertise to provide the level of supervision deemed
practical for AWSA's project implementation and stage of development. An
additional project was prepared during the project period.

VIII.   PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Background
8.01     The project justification at appraisal covered three subject areas,
i.e., (i) the least cost solution; (ii) the average long-term incremental cost
for water supply; and (iii) the internal economic rate of return for water
supply. The works undertaken under and outside the project represent
least-cost solutions and extended facilities are being fully utilized.
Incremental Cost Analysis
8.02     The incremental cost analysis at appraisal was based on the phased
extension of the King Talal dam for domestic water supply, which was
subsequently replaced by the development of the Azraq ground water source.
The present incremental cost analysis (in 1978 prices) (Annex 6) is based on
the Azraq water source development and related extensions of the water
distribution system, which give at 10 discount rate an average incremental
cost of 246 fils/m3 water (appraisal: 330). The present average revenue
(1983) is about 192 fils/m3 ( in real terms) and represents 802 of the
average incremental cost which may be considered satisfactory.
Internal Rate of Return
8.03     The recalculated rate of return, (Annex 7), is 8% which is slightly
lower than the appraisal estimate of 9%. This is due to lower than projected
water revenues, offset in part by lower than anticipated project costs.

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PLANS
9.01     The project was technically well conceived and represents a
least-cost solution. The primary objectives of increasing and improving the
water supply and sewerage services were achieved. AWSA made good progress in
its institutional development and adjusted well to its larger workload. The
project brought into sharper focus the need to reduce unaccounted for water
particularly in a situation where water is very scarce and the price already
very high. Increased efforts in this regard would postpone the need to
develop additional resources and increase water tariffs. This has been taken
into account in the design of later projects and is being monitored closely.
