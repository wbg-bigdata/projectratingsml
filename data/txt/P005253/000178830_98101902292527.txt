AMMAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT III
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
Beneficiary:        Amman Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA).
Amount:             US$14.0 million equivalent.
*       Terms:               Standard.
Relending Terms:    25 years including 4 years grace, at interest rate of 6
percent per annum.
Project             The project is part of AWSA's ongoing 1978-81 program
Description:       to expand water supply and sewerage services in order
to improve the levels of service in Amman including
those areas in which the urban poor reside. The project
includes the following main elements.
(a) construction of approximately 207 km of water
mains, laterals and house connections, a 4,000 m3
reservoir and one booster pumping station;
(b) construction for approximately 225 km of sewerage
mains, laterals and house connections and two sewage
lift stations;
(c) supply of 15,000 water meters, pipes, fittings,
relevant electrical and mechanical equipment and
maintenance equipment;
(d) consulting services for construction supervision;
and
(e) staff training.
The project would extend further the water and sewerage
systems in Amman as well as help protect the groundwater
resources there from pollution. In addition a large
proportion of the project will benefit low income users.
No particular project risks are presently foreseen.
AWSA's experience in project implementation during the
last four years under the previous IDA Credit and assis-
tance from the engineering consultants would minimize
project implementation risks. Except for a recurrence
of the severe drought conditions of 1974-75 which severely
limited AWSA's groundwater resources and sales, the risk
of not achieving the technical, financial and organiza-
tional objectives of the project is low.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
FOR A THIRD AMMAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in the amount in various currencies
equivalent to US$14.0 million on standard terms, to help finance a Third Amman
Water Supply and Sewerage Project. The Credit would be relent to the Amman
Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA) for 25 years, including a grace period of
4 years, at 6 percent per annum.  The Credit together with a US$20.0 million
loan from the Saudi Fund for Development (Saudi Fund) and a US$40.5 million
loan from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) would
help finance AWSA's 1978-81 investment program. The terms for the Saudi Fund
and USAID loans are still to be arranged.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Jordan in June/July 1977 and its report
entitled "Country Economic Memorandum on Jordan" (No. 1738-JO, dated January 9,
1978) was distributed to the Executive Directors on January 19, 1978. Its
findings are reflected herein. Country data sheets are attached as Annex 1.
3.        Jordan is a small country of only 2 million people (East Bank).
Due to limited physical and mineral resources, the structure of output and
employment is service and trade-dominated. An important characteristic of
the economy is its service-oriented role in its regional setting. This is
reflected in its role as a provider of manpower to neighboring countries
and a regional tourist center, particularly since the disruptions in Lebanon.
Jordan has benefited from its regional setting in terms of foreign exchange
inflows in the form of external grants, workers' remittances, exports and
tourism revenues. However, the costs of this role to the Jordanian economy
have been the outflow of scarce skilled labor and a low domestic savings rate
which is partly also a result of the high defense expenditures.
Recent Developments
4.        During the Three Year Plan (1973-75), GDP grew at about 5 percent
per year, with agriculture stagnating as a result of droughts and the indus-
trial sector increasing its share, mainly due to increased production and
prices of phosphates and higher manufacturing output, encouraged by higher
domestic and external demand. Although domestic savings were negative in the
recent past, national savings significantly increased from 22 percent of GNP
in 1972 to 30 percent in 1975. In many respects, 1976 turned out to be an
exceptional year, marked by an accelerated pace of economic activity, which
began to slow down in the last months of 1976 and early 1977. In addition
to domestic investments, these developments were due to booming conditions in
the Gulf, which were beginning to reach a plateau in 1976, and to a smaller
extent due to the influx of Lebanese refugees and business and their gradual
return starting late 1976. The major impact of these external developments



was on exports, imports, tourism revenues, workers' remittances and construc-
tion. Despite agricultural stagnation because of drought, GDP grew by 12
percent in real terms in 1976, due to a 27 percent increase in construction,
an 8 percent increase in mining and manufacturing and a 17 percent growth in
transportation. Total investment reached 35 percent of GDP, compared to 22
percent in 1972.
5.        Despite a significant increase in exports in recent years, increased
investment efforts and a liberal trade policy have led to rising imports and
resource gaps. But due to the external transfers, and rising workers' remit-
tances and tourism revenues, the overall balance of payments position has
remained strong. Export earnings increased by over 40 percent in 1976 (mainly
due to an increase in phosphate quantity, manufactured good exports, and
higher prices of fruit and vegetable exports) but were more than offset by
a 35 percent increase in imports, largely due to an increase in foodstuff
and capital good imports. Workers' remittances more than doubled in 1976
to $410 million, tourist revenues almost doubled to $208 million and external
transfers declined slightly to $380 million from $438 million in 1975. Al-
though the current account surplus increased, the level of reserves declined
marginally, mainly due to a large deferred payment of $113 million to Tapline
for oil imports. In early 1977, Jordan successfully borrowed about $200
million from commercial markets against the guarantee of the Central Bank.
6.        In 1977, domestic budgetary revenues were estimated to have increased
by 28 percent, and domestic current expenditures grew by 38 percent. The
increase in domestic revenues was mainly due to a 31 percent increase in
customs duties. Various measures were taken to raise domestic revenues: the
tax rate on corporate profits was raised, charges for port services, buses and
land sales were raised and the prices for oil products, water and electricity
and cigarettes were increased. The overall budget deficit increased to JD 46
million (JD 67 million in 1976), mainly because of the halving of the budget
support payments. There was some increase in the sale of Treasury bills and
Government bonds to finance the deficit. However, the increase in Treasury
bills was wholly due to sales to the Central Bank and the Treasury also con-
tinued to have recourse to Central Bank advances, which increased inflationary
pressures.
7.        Under the impact of high foreign exchange inflows and the growth of
public expenditures, part of which were financed by short term Central Bank
advances, money supply rose by 24 percent during the first nine months of
1977, compared with 21 percent in 1976. However, the consequent impact on
inflationary pressures has been sbmewhat mitigated by the propensity of the
Jordanians to hold cash balances as a precautionary measure and the tendency
of commercial banks to hold liquid reserves at higher than required levels.
Large amounts of credit go to the tertiary sector. Industrial investment
relies largely on retained earnings or direct support from Government; lending
to industry amounted to 13 percent of the outstanding credit during the first
nine months of 1977.



-3-
8.        Prices increased by nearly 15 percent per year during 1973-76.  High
inflationary pressures have resulted from both domestic and external factors.
Although the growth in money supply has been a contributory factor, part of
the reasons for inflation were external, such as the sharp rise in the prices
of imported goods, particularly since 1973, strong demand for Jordanian goods
and services by neighboring countries and the inflows of workers' remittances
and the Lebanese refugees heavily influencing real estate prices through
speculation.
9.        Partly as a result of migration of labor to neighboring countries
and partly as a result of a fast increase in employment in the civil service
and military, unemployment declined from 14 percent in 1970 to 2.1 percent in
1975. About 250,000 Jordanians were estimated to be working abroad and about
180,000 were employed by the Government in 1975, compared to a total domestic
non-farm employment of 270,000. Labor force participation rates are low, par-
ticularly for women, and the Government has been trying to increase female
participation rates by opening up employment opportunities for women and ex-
panding child care facilities. It has also been giving increasing emphasis
to education, particularly to vocational training, and providing a broad
range of social services to attract Jordanian labor. There is an increasing
propensity in both private and public sectors to increase the capital inten-
sivity of projects to economize on labor.
Medium-term Prospects
10.       The primary development objectives of the current Five-Year Plan
(1976-80) are to diversify the productive structure of the economy to increase
overall growth, and to improve tax and export revenues in order to reduce
dependence on external assistance and achieve self-reliance in the long run.
This involves exploiting phosphates and potash resources for export; extending
irrigation in the Jordan Valley to increase agricultural production, partic-
ularly of high value fruits and vegetables for export where Jordan enjoys a
comparative advantage in the region; promoting production of export-oriented
consumer goods industries; and strengthening infrastructure in the transport
and services sector to serve regional development needs and earn additional
foreign exchange. The Plan has been drawn around a comprehensive list of proj-
ects. Since the beginning of Plan implementation in 1976, serious efforts
have been made to follow up and monitor progress. Social issues are being
given increasing attention by the Government, which is currently in the
process of formulating a program of action to assist low income groups and
the rural areas.
11.       The medium-term prospects for growth are good, with a likely GDP
growth rate of 6-8 percent per year in real terms. Overall investment is
likely to stay at a high level but decline as a proportion of GDP from the
exceptionally high 35 percent in 1976. Jordan's development and export
prospects depend on the implementation of major projects (phosphate rock
mining, potash, phosphatic fertilizer, oil refining and the Maqarin dam) and
on the continued vitality of the private sector. Phosphate production may
rise to 5 million tons per year by the early 1980s. If the proposed projects
are implemented and if the marketing is carefully arranged, exports of potash
and phosphatic fertilizer should begin in the early eighties. In industry,



- 4 -
priorities have been well established and the Government encourages industrial
development. With the entrepreneurial skills in Jordan and the market for
medium-scale industrial products available in neighboring countries, the
private sector should continue to show healthy growth. Further improvements
in packaging and marketing abroad are needed for export promotion. In agri-
culture, the focus of the Government is correctly on developing irrigated
agriculture, but increased attention will need to be paid to rainfed agri-
culture to correct the weak institutional and coordinating machinery, reduce
fragmentation of land and improve the research and extension services.
Development Issues
12.       To achieve gradually the Government's self-sufficiency objective,
domestic resource mobilization will need to be increased. Although the Gov-
ernment can restrain current expenditure growth to some extent, given the
impact of high wages and salaries in neighboring countries, greater pos-
sibilities lie in increased revenues rather than controlling expenditures.
Tax collection efforts need to be further increased and consideration should
be given to reducing the high tax holidays and exemptions to business and
individuals. There is also some scope for increasing taxes on fixed proper-
ties and non-essential imported consumer goods. Domestic demand and financial
management need to be improved, both to reduce inflationary pressures and to
improve domestic resource mobilization. Every effort should be made to issue
a variety of debt instruments to cover financing gaps in the public sector
and the Government should encourage a secondary market for these issues.
Financial resources should be channelled increasingly to productive invest-
ments through increases in the capitalization of domestic financial institu-
tions, such as the Industrial Development Bank, or through long-term loans to
them. The planned establishment of the Capital market is a step in the right
direction.
13.       Labor migrations to neighiboring countries are expected to continue
and likely to cause shortages of labor in Jordan, particularly skilled labor.
The Government has correctly decid,ed to focus on the supply side of the prob-
lem rather than restrict the outflow, by consciously building in a 30 percent
outflow of skilled labor in their education and training plans. The low
participation rates, particularly among women, and the underemployed labor
in the rainfed areas represent potential labor supplies. Being aware of
social issues, the Government is also providing low cost housing, and various
subsidies.  However, most of the subsidies are provided with insufficient
selectivity in terms of recipients.
External Assistance
14.       External public debt outstanding and disbursed as of December 1976
was $383 million ($673 million including undisbursed). Loans from various
government sources amounted to $2815 million ($477 million including undis-
bursed) and accounted for 75 percent of the total. The outstanding debt
to IDA was $43.7 million ($69.4 million including undisbursed). An average
loan contracted between 1970 and 11975 carried an interest rate of 2.4 percent
a year with 29 years of maturity, including 6 years of grace. Debt service



- 5 -
payments amounted to $24.7 million in 1976 or 4.5 percent of total export of
goods and non-factor services.
15.       Despite an expected improvement in domestic resource mobilization
(para. 12), Jordan will still need substantial external capital inflows to
finance its development efforts. Judging from past trends and commitments
made by donor countries, Jordan should be able to mobilize annually, apart
from the continued availability of transfers, loan commitments from USA,
Federal Republic of Germany, and UK totalling $75-$90 million at relatively
concessionary terms (2.0-3.0 percent interest rate, 20-40 years maturity,
with 4-10 years grace). It may also get additional loans from Arab multi-
and bilateral sources. Jordan can absorb some borrowings on commercial terms,
mostly in suppliers' credits. The debt service is expected to rise, to over
9 percent in the early eighties, but should remain manageable if the Govern-
ment continues to exercise the restraint it has shown in the past.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.       Jordan has received fourteen IDA credits totalling US$69.8 million
(net of cancellations) of which five have been fully disbursed. War and local
disturbances adversely affected the pace of economic activity after 1967,
and Bank Group lending only resumed in mid-1971. Project implementation is
generally satisfactory. So far IDA credits have concentrated mainly on the
financing of infrastructure projects, such as education, highways, water
supply and sewerage, power and irrigation. IFC has made two investments in
Jordan consisting of a US$244,000 equity participation and a US$1.6 million
loan to Jordan Ceramic Industries Limited (JCI) in 1974, and also a US$3.1
million equity participation in the promotion of a phosphatic fertilizer proj-
ect in 1975. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and IFC
investments as of February 15, 1978, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
17.       With an estimated GNP per capita income of US$560 in 1976 Jordan
has reached the upper limits for IDA financing. Furthermore, Jordan has now
attained a stage in its economic development where it can be considered
creditworthy for Bank lending.  The proposed project would therefore be the
last project to be financed with IDA funds in Jordan.
18.       Unlike previous Bank Group assistance to Jordan, future lending
would be directed toward large export oriented projects with high foreign
exchange earning potential. In addition, the Bank Group would assist the
Government in implementing its social objectives enunciated in the Five-
Year Plan (1976-80) aimed at improving the income and living standards of
the rural and urban poor.
19.       In line with these objectives, the Bank Group has provided techni-
cal assistance for developing and implementing a plan for expanding phosphate
rock production,.in formulating a package of development projects in the



- 6 -
Jordan Valley, as well as reviewing the feasibility study underway to irrigate
most of the remaining irrigable lands there. Following an Engineering Credit
in FY75 to study the feasibility of producing one million tons of potash
per annum from the Dead Sea via solar evaporation, project preparation is
proceeding satisfactorily with Bank assistance and supervision. The project
has been appraised and would be ready for consideration by the Board in FY79.
In addition, the Government is preparing a phosphatic fertilizer project to
produce diammonium phosphate (DAP) and triple superphosphate (TSP) with IFC
assistance. In support of the Government's social objectives, projects cur-
rently under preparation for lending in the next two to three fiscal years,
include proposals for assisting the Municipal and Village Loan Fund (MVLF)
which has primarily a rural clientele, a slum upgrading project in Amman, and
a rural power distribution project.
20.       The Bank was Executing Agent for a two-year UNDP Planning Assistance
Project based in the National Planning Council which was completed in December
1975. It was also Executing Agent for a UNDP-financed study of the manufactur-
ing industry and industrial estates in Jordan. The first phase, consisting of
a study of the industrial sector, was completed in December 1975. The second
phase, consisting of studies of specific industries and proposals for the
establishment of industrial estates during the next Plan period was completed
in December 1976. The establishment of industrial zones and supporting
services for light manufacturing would aim at reducing the concentration of
economic activity in the Amman-Zarqa area which is already suffering from
overtaxing of its industrial infrastructure and severe pollution.
21.       At the end of 1976, the Bank Group's share in Jordan's external
public debt was estimated at 8.3 percent, and its share in debt service was
1.1 percent. By 1980 the Bank Group's shares in debt outstanding and in debt
service are expected to be about 7.0 percent and 0.5 percent respectively.
PART III - THE SECTOR
General
22.       The overall pattern of settlement in Jordan is characterized by a
large metropolitan area (Amman Region), a few medium-sized towns and many
small villages. The annual rate of population growth in the Amman Region
exceeded 11 percent during the period of 1966 to 1976, while the national
growth rate was 3.5 percent per annum.
23.       Rainfall in Jordan averages from 50 mm/year in the desert areas to
600 mm/year in the highland areas. Surface water sources are estimated by the
National Planning Council (NPC) to have an average annual flow of 635 Mm3 in
the North Jordan Valley and 194 Mm3 in the Dead Sea Basin. However, exploita-
tion of such resources has not been significant due to sporadic flow patterns
and long distances to population centers. Any future exploitation of surface
resources for urban water supply will involve high developmental costs for



-7-
transmission and pumping systems. Most of the water supply systems depend
upon groundwater, and even with full development of these sources scarcity of
water is widespread.
24.       Only three cities in Jordan--Amman, Salt and Aqaba--have sewage
collecting and treatment plants. In other communities cesspools are used for
domestic sewage disposal. Presently over 60 percent of the urban population
has house connections to piped water supply systems and about 10 percent has
service connections to sewage collection systems. About half of the 795 vil-
lages have piped water supplies but in most of these villages supply is still
insufficient. In 1973 the Water Supply Corporation (WSC) was established to
provide water to the rural areas with no piped water (para. 28). These
systems are financed with assistance from the Government and the Municipal and
Village Loan Fund (MVLF). However, WSC and MVLF, as presently constituted,
are not organized and staffed to accomplish expeditiously the targets for
implementing rural water supply systems set by the Government. Bank assis-
tance for the MVLF is under active consideration (see para. 19). However,
because of the concentration of population in Amman and the serious threat of
epidemics of waterborne diseases due to unsanitary conditions, the highest
priority at present is given to the provision of water supply and disposal
system in the Amman municipality.
25.       By the end of the current Five-Year Plan (1976-80), it is estimated
that 66 percent of Jordan's total urban population will enjoy water connec-
tions and 25 percent sewerage system connections. Of the current Five-Year
Plan budget of JD 53.12 million for domestic water supplies, approximately JD
26.62 million (over 50 percent) will be invested to serve rural areas with
urgently needed water supplies outside the city of Amman.
26.       The present groundwater resources of Amman are fully developed, and
considerable mining of the aquifers will be necessary to meet the near term
needs. The Amman Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA) engaged consultants
(VBB) to undertake a water resources study to meet the irrigation and potable
water requirements in the area. After an examination of ten potential sources
the study concluded that only the King Talal Dam reservoir is available for
development to meet Amman's future demand. The King Talal Dam was originally
constructed exclusively for irrigation purposes. The King Talal Dam trans-
mission works, now in the final stage of design, include a floating intake,
treatment plant, pumping station, transmission line and two terminal reser-
voirs. Completion of this project is essential to the provision of sufficient
water for Amman's needs by 1982. During negotiations, the Government confirmed
its decision to allocate 17 Mm3/year to AWSA from the King Talal Dam and
agreed on a schedule for preparation of documents and date of contract award
that will enable construction of the transmission works to be completed by
1982 (Section 3.02 of the Development Credit Agreement). The proposed annual
diversion of 17 Mm3 from the King Talal Dam is not expected to affect signif-
icantly, the availability of water for irrigation at the Zarqa Triangle or the
Jordan Valley.



-8-
Sector Organization
27.       The Natural Resources Auithority (NRA) has overall responsibility for
water resources studies and water planning throughout Jordan. In consultation
with IDA, the Government created the Amman Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA)
in 1973, which has the responsibility for water supply, sanitary sewerage and
surface drainage in the Amman municipality. The Ministry of Rural Affairs
(MRA) is responsible for design and construction of sewerage systems outside
Amman. Responsibility for maintenance and operation of the existing rudi-
mentary systems, principally cesspool pumping, rests with the muncipalities.
28.       In 1973 the Water Supply Corporation (WSC) was established, succeed-
ing the NRA Water Supply Department. WSC assists the smaller municipalities
in the design and construction of wqater supply projects. After commissioning,
WSC transfers the system to the municipalities which, in turn, assume main-
tenance and operation responsibilities. WSC also acts as a bulk supplier of
water to a number of towns and vil.Lages. WSC requires substantial strengthen-
ing of its technical, operational and administrative staff in order to effec-
tively develop and execute the Government's water supply program in its area
of responsibility and a reorganization is being undertaken. The Jordan Valley
is under the jurisdiction of the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA), and domestic
water supplies in the valley fall within the JVA purview.
29.       In view of the number of agencies involved in development of water
resources for irrigation and potable water supply as well as wastewater dis-
posal, together with the attendant problems in resource allocation and insti-
tutional development, a sectoral review is urgently required. The Government
has hired consultants (Humphreys of U.K.) to conduct an overall review of the
existing policies and organization of the water supply and sewerage sector.
The recommendations of the consultants' study would be utilized by the
Jordanian Government in developing an overall policy and strategy for the
future planning of operations in the sector.
Performance under Previous Water StLpply and Sewerage Projects
30.       Credit No. 18-JO (US$1.5 million) was extended to Jordan in 1961 in
order to cover the foreign exchange cost of augmenting and improving the Amman
water supply. Subsequent to overcoming initial delays due to political distur-
bances and to lack of local funding, the Credit was fully disbursed by January
1968. The project's primary objective to foster the institutional development
of the Amman Municipal Department was only partially achieved.  In 1963 Credit
No. 43-JO (US$2.5 million) was provided to assist with the financing of water
supply projects in Ramallah-El Bira (Jerusalem), Azraq-Irbid and Zerqa. It
was fully utilized.
31.       Credit No. 385-JO (US$8.7 million), which was the first to support
AWSA's establishment and program, became effective in 1973 and would finance
about 75 percent of the estimated US$11.5 million project cost for extending
the water supply and sewerage services. As of November 1977, all major con-
struction had been completed, and the civil works elements have entered the
guaranteed maintenance phase. A balance of US$300,000 remains in this credit
and should be disbursed within three months. Substantial progress was made in



- 9 -
achieving the project objectives especially in improving AWSA's operational
and management effectiveness and in expanding AWSA's water supply and sewer-
age network. Further work is required to reduce the high percentage of
unaccounted-for water. In 1975, unaccounted-for water was about 47 percent;
this was reduced to 41 percent in 1976 and is projected to have dropped to 38
percent in 1977. The high level in 1975 was attributed to system leakage (10
percent), inaccurate production metering (10 percent) and under-registration
of consumer meters (18 percent). AWSA's leakage detection and repair program
is increasingly reducing this loss. AWSA has now overcome earlier legal
problems in replacing customers' meters, and a meter replacement program is
underway. Even at present levels, the percentage of unaccounted-for water
in Amman is comparable to that of other cities in the area. For instance,
in 1977 the percentage of unaccounted-for water was 44 percent in Istanbul,
Turkey and 40 percent in Hodeida, Yemen Arab Republic. The continuing major
problem will be to increase the amount of water available for community water
supplies. The scarcity of water and its high cost of transportation is
reflected in the low national per capita consumption, estimated at 28 lpcd
in 1975 and expected to rise to 38 lpcd by 1985. In small villages and in
refugee camps consumption figures of 10-15 lpcd are not uncommon.
PART IV - TIE PROJECT
32.       The proposed project, which represents another stage in the imple-
mentation of the master plan for water supply and sewerage in Amman, was first
proposed to IDA during the course of implementing the Second Amman Water
Supply project. The proposed project was prepared by Vattenbyggnadsbyran/
Fawzi (VBB). An IDA preparation mission visited Amman in July 1976 and the
project was appraised in August 1977. The staff report entitled "The Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan - Staff Appraisal Report - Amman Water Supply and Sewerage
Project III" (No. 1817a-JO) dated March 2, 1978 has been distributed sepa-
rately. Negotiations were held in Washington on January 26 and 27, 1978. The
Government was represented by Dr. Hanna Odeh, President of the National Plan-
ning Council, and AWSA by Mr. Tahsin Sabbagh, its General Manager.
Project Objectives and Description
33.       The project aims at continuing the development of AWSA's institu-
tional and operational capability and consists of extending the Amman water
distribution system and the sewage collection system in order to improve the
levels of service in Amman including its low-income residents. Connections to
the water supply system are expected to increase from 41,600 in 1976 to 52,200
in 1980, with a concomitant increase in consumption from 35 lpcd to 48 lpcd.
Water produced will increase from 14.21 Mm3/year in 1976 to 20.00 Mm3/year
in 1980, while the figures for water sold in the same years are 8.33 Mm3 and
13.80 Mm3, respectively. The proportion of unaccounted-for water is expected
to decrease from 41 percent in 1976 to 28 percent in 1981 which is considered
reasonable. AWSA will continue its policy of metering all new connections.
Sewerage connections are expected to increase from 7,900 in 1976 to 28,000 in
1980.  Sewage flow will increase from 2.3 Mm3/year in 1976 to 8.0 Mm3 in 1980.



- 10 -
34.       The Project includes the following main elements:
(a) construction of approximately 207 km of water mains,
laterals and house connections, a 4,000 m3 reservoir and
one booster pumping station;
(b) construction for approximately 225 km of sewerage mains,
laterals and house conrnections and two sewage lift stations;
(c) supply of 15,000 water meters, pipes, fittings, relevant
electrical and mechanical equipment and maintenance equip-
ment;
(d) consulting services for construction supervision; and
(e) staff training.
35.       AWSA's 1978-81 program, of which the proposed IDA project forms a
part, entails water supply and sewerage extensions and improvements to the
Amman Sewage treatment plant. AWSA is presently upgrading the water distri-
bution and sewage collection system in the two main refugee camps. In
addition, the program gives high priority to water and sewerage system con-
struction in low-income areas. Water service to the urban poor through house
connections will increase from 34 percent in 1977 to 84 percent in 1981 and
sewer connections from 18-percent to 74 percent under the program. The
estimated number of urban poor to be provided with improved water service
through this project alone will increase from about 40,000 to 56,000. Sewer-
age service will benefit about 37,000 low-income users as compared with an
initially served 11,000. Approximately 20 percent of the project cost for
water and 19 percent of the project cost for sewerage will have a significant
impact on the urban poor. Per capiita expenditures on urban poor in the proj-
ect will be approximately US$175 for water supplies and US$157 for sewerage.
Project Execution
36.       AWSA, with the assistance of consultants, would be responsible for
project implementation. Final designs and tender documents for all project
components are under preparation by the consulting engineers, VBB, and expected
to be completed by May 1978. Bidding will commence in early 1978. AWSA would
employ qualified engineering consultants to assist in supervising the construc-
tion of some project items (Section 2.02 (a) of the Project Agreement). Con-
struction is expected to be completed by mid-1980, and the Credit to be fully
disbursed by year-end 1980. Although the consultants will be engaged by AWSA
to supervise construction, some of this responsibility would be directly
handled by AWSA. During negotiations, an understanding was reached concerning
which construction contracts can be directly supervised by AWSA   (Section
2.02 (b) and Schedule 2 of the Project Agreement). In addition, AWSA is
planning a program to reduce the proportion of unaccounted for water in its
operations from 38 percent in 1977 to 28 percent in 1981 (see paras. 31 and
33). To aid this effort, agreement was reached during negotiations for



- 11 -
AWSA to begin implementation of a coordinated water loss reduction and meter
replacement program by September 30, 1978, under the direction of a senior
engineer (Sections 3.01(b)(i) and 3.07 of the Project Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing Plan
37.       The estimated total cost of the project, including price and physical
contingencies, is JD 11.2 (US$33.9) million with a foreign exchange component
of JD 6.2 (US$18.8) million. The proposed IDA credit of US$14.0 million would
finance about 75 percent of the project's foreign exchange cost and would be
relent to AWSA by the Government for 25 years including 4 years grace at 6
percent per annum (Section 3.01 (b) of the Development Credit Agreement).
The cost estimates are based on con~struction price levels prevailing in Jordan
in August 1977. Physical contingencies of 10 percent were added to the base
costs. Price contingencies were estimated by Bank Staff at 7.5 percent
between 1977-79 and 7 percent in 1980 for equipment and materials. Civil
works expenditures were escalated at annual rates of 15 percent for 1977, 12
percent for 1978 and 1979, and 10 percent for 1980. These relatively high
escalation rates for civil works are due to expected shortage of skilled and
semi-skilled labor as a result of considerable on-going and planned construc-
tion activity. The cost per man-year of consulting services is estimated at
US$70,000. The cost of AWSA's 1978-81 investment program is estimated at
about JD 37 (US$112.3) million, including about JD 20.5 (US$62) million in
foreign exchange.
38.       The financing plan to meet the estimated US$33.9 million of the
project per se is as follows: IDA would provide US$14 million through the
proposed credit to cover part of the foreign exchange costs; AWSA would pro-
vide US$3.7 million from operations for local costs, and the Government,
US$16.2 million to cover the remaining local and foreign exchange costs to be
refinanced from the foreign loans specified below. Concerning the financing
of AWSA's on-going expansion program, the Government has requested funds from
the Saudi Fund and USAID. The Saudi Fund would provide a loan of US$20.0
million for AWSA's investment program and USAID proposes to provide a loan of
US$28.5 million in FY78. The terms for both loans are still to be arranged.
A condition of effectiveness of the Credit is that the Saudi Fund and the
USAID loan agreements have been signed (Section 5.01(c) of the Development
Credit Agreement). USAID also has included an additional loan of US$12.0
million for AWSA's program in its 1979 budget. Thus, total foreign exchange
funds available will exceed requirements by $12.5 million, and USAID and Saudi
Fund loans are expected to be used for some local currency financing. The
Government will finance the balance of US$26.2 million equivalent (including
US$20 million capital contribution) and, together with US$11.6 million from
AWSA's operations, would cover the remaining local expenditures of the program.
This amount is within the Government's present resources. The loan funds
would be provided to the Government and onlent to AWSA at the current Govern-
ment onlending terms for water authorities; 25 years including four years
grace at an interest rate of 6 percent per annum. Because of the high propor-
tion of loan financing (which springs from the Government's policy to reduce
subsidization of utilities), it was agreed that IDA funds would be onlent at
the same terms as for Government funds.

Management and Staffing of AWSA
39.       Control of AWSA is vested in an eight-member board consisting of
the Lord Mayor of Amman as Chairman, the General Manager of AWSA, twro members
of the Municipal Council, one representative each of the Ministry of Health
and the Natural Resources Authority and two representatives of the private
sector. The General Manager, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recom-
mendation of the Board, is responsible for implementing the board's policy
and for the day-to-day operation of the Authority. Substantial progress has
been made in the last four years in establishing AWSA as an efficient organi-
zation, but further work is needed to continue development and to consolidate
the progress made. AWSA's salary structure is competitive with the private
sector in Jordan; however, staff turnover is high due mainly to the high
salaries offered in neighboring Arab countries. To ensure that adequate staff
is available at all times, AWSA increased its staff by 32 percent to 1,040
during the three-year period ending July 1977. AWSA will undertake, prior
to December 31, 1978, a review of its staffing requirements through 1984
and discuss the findings with the Association before implementing them, and
during the interim AWSA would maintain its staff level under 1,100 (Section
3.01(b) (ii) of the Project Agreement). Under Credit 385-JO, AWSA already
started a training program for iits staff, which particularly in view of
the high staff turnover, it is essential to maintain. Provision has been
included in the proposed Credit for US$180,000 for the foreign exchange cost
of training. AWSA also expects to avail itself of bilateral training assis-
tance. By September 30, 1978, AWSA would prepare and submit to the Associa-
tion a training program by September 30, 1978, which would be implemented
following consultation with the Association (Section 3.08 of the Project
Agreement).
Financial Performance of AWSA
40.       AWSA's financial performance in the water supply sector during the
three years 1974-1976 were unsatisfactory with operating losses each year.
High inflation, overstaffing and the severe drought in 1976 were the major
causes of these losses. However, AWSA adhered to the financial covenants
of Credit 385-JO of charging not less than 75 fils/m3 (US$0.23) for water sold
during this period. AWSA earned a small profit on the sewerage sector in
1974-1976. On January 1, 1977, AWSA increased average water tariff by about
50 percent. However, in 1977 despite this substantial increase due to a
doubling of electricity charges and a 25 percent projected increase in wage
costs in that year, AWSA, during this period, is only expected to break-even
on operating costs, including depreciation, instead of generating 6 percent
rate of return as would have been required under Credit 385-JO (see also
para. 41).
Future Financial Arrangements
41.       On January 1, 1978, AWSA increased the average water tariff by
another 63 percent, but maintained the 60 fils/m3 (US$0.18) rate for the first
block. The average tariff for water sold is presently 196 fils/m3 (US$0.59).
The tariff progressivity (ratio between maximum and minimum) at 4.33 is satis-
factory. The present cost of waler supply and sewerage services to about



- 13 -
20 percent of AWSA's poorest customers represents about 1 percent of their
estimated household income. The sewerage surcharge on water consumed has
remained unchanged for the last four years but was increased by about 65
percent to 50 fils/m3 (US$0.15) on January 1, 1978. At present, AWSA would
derive 31 percent of its sewerage income from the surcharge and the remaining
69 percent, from connection charges (29 percent), sewerage tax (31 percent)
and other income (9 percent). The water surcharge is projected to yield 52
percent of AWSA's sewerage income in 1981 as the present sewerage tax is fixed
by law at 4 percent of the rental value of all property in Amman. AWSA is
presently committed under the Project Agreement for Credit 385-JO to earn a
rate of return on water supply net fixed assets in operation of 7-1/2 percent
in 1978. The new tariff introduced in 1978 is projected to yield 13.1 percent
which is sufficient to meet the current rate of return and to make up the
shortfall for 1977 (see para. 40). The Project Agreement also requires AWSA
to break even on operating costs in the sewerage section, and the current
surcharge is sufficient to meet this requirement.
42.       AWSA's investment program for the four years 1978-81 to extend the
water supply and sewerage systems in the Amman area and to transport water
from King Talal Dam is estimated to cost about JD 37 (US$112.3) million.
This reflects the increasingly high cost of supplying water to Amman. Under
the previous Credit Agreement AWSA would have to set tariffs sufficiently
high to achieve for water supply a 7-1/2 percent rate of return on net fixed
assets in operation. Because of the very large investment program over
the next four years, AWSA's contribution from revenues to finance the invest-
ment program would be considerably below 10 percent. In order to meet a
more reasonable proportion of investment cost from revenues, it was agreed
during negotiations to replace the rate of return covenant applied under the
previous Credit, by a cash generation covenant, and that prior to September 30,
1979 (when all major contracts would have been awarded) AWSA would review
the water supply tariff and would implement rates, not later than January 1,
1980, which are adequate to cover operating expenses (excluding depreciation),
debt service and increased working capital and provide revenue sufficient to
finance, during the period 1978-81, not less than 10 percent of the investment
program. Starting in 1982 and for subsequent years, AWSA would increase the
proportion of investment financing to 20 percent of the average cost of
investment during each consecutive three-year period, combining an actual and
two forecast years (Section 4.03(a) of the Project Agreement). In addition,
rates for sewerage services shall be fixed so as to yield sufficient revenues
to meet operating and maintenance costs, including provision for depreciation
(Section 4.03(b) of the Project Agreement). To meet the 10 percent contribu-
tion AWSA would need to increase tariffs again by about 30 percent in 1980.
Assuming such increase in 1980, this would yield rates of return for water
supply on historically valued net fixed assets of 13.1 percent in 1978, 9.3
percent in 1979, 15.7 percent in 1980 and 14.3 percent in 1981. With such
increase, the top step of the tariff would already approximate the average
long-term incremental cost of water; while the average revenue per cubic meter
will still be about 40 percent below this cost.



- 14 -
43.       AWSA's capital is proJected to increase by about 300 percent during
the four years 1980-81 to JD 46 million and the debt equity ratio is projected
to change from 40:60 in 1977 to 65:35 in 1981 due to the Government's policy
of providing the major part of finance to water authorities in the form of
debt. The water supply sector net fixed assets are projected to increase by
500 percent from JD 5 million to JD 30 million while the sewerage fixed assets
are projected to increase by 175i percent to JD 14 million. AWSA debt service
will increase threefold between 1977 and 1983 while the percentage of gross
revenues required to meet debt service would increase from 30 percent to 38
percent during the same period. Net cash generation from operations is pro-
jected to cover debt service 1.2 times in 1983. Under the Project Agreement
for Credit 385-JO, AWSA is committed not to incur any long-term debt without
the Association's concurrence, unless its net revenues is not less than 1.5
times the maximum debt service. The covenant has been repeated in the new
Project Agreement (Section 4.04 of the Project Agreement).
Disbursements
44.       The proposed Credit would be disbursed against the following:
(a) 100 percent of the C.I.F. cost of directly imported
equipment, pipes and materials; 100 percent of the
ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment pipes
and materials and 85 percent of locally purchased imported
equipment;
(b) 30 percent of the cost of civil works;
(c) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of consultants services;
and
(d) 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of training.
About US$2.1 million would be disbursed in 1978, US$10.5 million in 1979 and
US$1.4 million in 1980. The closing date for the Credit would be December 31,
1981.
Procurement
45.       Civil works contracts for the water and sewerage services in Abdoun,
Shamsani, Smissani, Nazzal and Zuhour areas, although part of the project,
will not be procured under ICB procedures as AWSA expects to utilize USAID
financing for this work. IDA funds will not be used to finance any of these
civil works contracts. All major contracts financed by the Association would
be procured through internationa:L competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement. For bid evaluation purposes, a 15
percent margin of preference or an amount equal to customs duties, whichever
is lower, would be applied in the case of equipment manufactured in Jordan.
Contracts for civil works, mater:ials and equipment of less than JD 66,000



- 15 -
(US$200,000) and aggregating not more than JD 330,000 (US$1,000,000) would be
awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding. The water supply materials
would need to be procured urgently to expedite the water supply civil works by
about three months. AWSA intends to use ICB procedures for this contract and
it is recommended that the purchase of water supply material be eligible for
retroactive financing from the proposed Credit up to a limit of US$1.5 million.
Project Justification
46.       The proposed project aims at improving the water supply and sewerage
facilities in Amman. Design of the proposed systems is in accordance with
sound engineering principles utilizing acceptable design criteria. The proj-
ect represents the least cost solution for expanding and improving the Amman
water supply and sewerage systems.
47.       Benefits associated with the provision of convenient and safe water
supply and sewerage systems in Amman include control of water pollution,
medical cost savings, a general improvement in individual well being, and a
cost savings to, or an increased productivity of, business enterprises. These
benefits, however, cannot be quantified. A large proportion of the additional
services provided by the project will benefit low-income users (para. 35).
48.       The internal economic rate of return on the water supply component
of the project, was calculated using incremental water sales at the 1978
tariff level as a minimum measure of benefits. The internal economic rate of
return on the water supply investment on this basis is estimated at 9 percent.
The internal economic rate for the sewerage component was not calculated,
because connection to the sewerage system is compulsory; hence, the consumers'
willingness to pay, which is usually used as the minimum measure of benefits
is not readily quantifiable.
Environmental Impact
49.       Through implementation of this project the Authority will supply
safe water to a larger number of persons including the urban poor, thereby
reducing possible dependence upon unsafe water. Similarly, the provision
of piped sewage collection systems to a larger segment of the population
of Amman will reduce the use of cesspools and thereby lessen the danger of
contamination of the aquifers which are the main source for Amman's water
supply.
50.       To achieve the objectives of the sewerage investment it is essential
to compel householders to connect to the system and close their cesspools. By
law all premises in sewered areas in Amman should connect within three months
following official notification by AWSA. However, AWSA has been experiencing
difficulties in securing voluntary compliance with the connection policy as
landlords have not been allowed to increase rents during the past five years.
Up to June 1977, about 300 properties were compulsorily connected; and AWSA
has an ongoing contract to connect most of the premises presently in default.
Credit 385-JO provides that in no case should more than nine months elapse



- 16 -
between completion of accessible laterals and installation of service con-
nections. This agreement has been repeated under the proposed Credit, and
agreement was reached that AWSA will levy a sewerage surcharge on unconnected
properties after the three-month statutory period (Section 3.06(a & b) of the
Project Agreement).
Project Risks
51.       AWSA's experience in project supervision, in addition to the assis-
tance to be received from the engineering consultants, will ensure that the
risks in construction of the project will be normal for a water supply and
sewerage project. The willingness of the Amman users to pay for water supply
services is evident at present. The conservative increase projected in per
capita consumption of water will not be difficult to absorb even at the higher
tariff levels in view of the widespread shortages in the recent years. Except
for a recurrence of the severe drought conditions of 1974-75 which severely
limited AWSA's groundwater resources and sales, the risk of not achieving the
technical, financial and organizational objectives of the project is low.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Hashemite Kingdom
of Jordan and the Association and the Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and the Amman Water and Sewerage Authority and the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article 1V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement
are being distributed separately. Special conditions of the project are listed
in Section III of Annex III.  In addition to the features of the Development
Credit and Project Agreements which are referred to in the text and listed in
Section III of Annex III, the proposed IDA Credit would be declared effective
only after signing and authorization of the USAID and Saudi Fund Loan Agree-
ments.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit complies with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

B.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 285:  Education Project; US$5.4 Million Credit of February 11, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: July 27, 1972; Closing Date: April
30, 1978.
The project includes construction and equipping of two comprehen-
sive secondary schools, a polytechnic and trade training center, a teacher's
training college for preparatory and secondary schools, and extension of an
agricultural teacher training college and related technical assistance. All
contracts for civil works were awarded to local firms on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding. Contracts were signed in May 1974, and construc-
tion started in early June 1974. Following initial delays, construction is
progressing toward a satisfactory conclusion. Construction of all items are
now complete and preparations are underway to undertake a project completion
mission. Cost overruns in total project costs are expected to amount to
about 60 percent over appraisal estimates and are being met by the Government.
Cr. No. 385: Amman Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$8.7 Million Credit
of May 24, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1978.
The project aims at alleviating serious water shortages and insuf-
ficiency of sewerage services in Amman, reducing the high percentage of unac-
counted for water, and developing the administrative structure of the Amman
Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA). The project is progressing satisfactorily
and project completion expected by March 31, 1978, the revised closing date.
All civil works as well as the mechanical and electrical installations have
been substantially completed and inspected. Operations of project works were
taken over by AWSA in July 1977, and improvement in well operations and water
distribution have partially alleviated Amman's chronic water shortage. AWSA
increased water tariffs by 50 percent in 1977, and by 63 percent in 1978, to
meet the revenue covenants in the Project Agreement.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 386: Power Project; US$10.2 Million Credit of May 24, 1973; Date of
Effectiveness: August 21, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1978.
The project is to help the conversion from diesel to steam powered
generation by adding two 33 MW steam generating units and one 12 MW gas tur-
bine, all to be installed at a new power station at Zerka, near Amman and by
providing management consultancy services to assist the Jordan Electricity
Authority in organizing and expanding its power generation and transmission
operations. Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily despite initial
delays. The gas turbine unit was commissioned in May 1975 and two steam
units in August 1977.
Cr. No. 498: Northeast Ghor Irrigation and Rural Development Project; US$7.5
Million Credit of July 25, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August
1, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project is part of an overall development scheme for the East
Bank of the Jordan Valley, other parts of which will be financed by the KfW,
USAID, and the Kuwait Fund. The project consists of the agricultural devel-
opment of 7,700 ha net, of which 6,660 ha are already under irrigation, and
the provision of rural facilities for domestic water supply, health, educa-
tion, roads, and community development for a population of about 25,000. Even
though overall project implementation is one year behind schedule, construc-
tion of the irrigation system by the Korean contractor, Cho Suk, is proceed-
ing satisfactorily. All structures have been completed, most equipment and
materials are on site and pipe laying is slightly ahead of schedule. However,
construction of schools and community centers is slightly behind schedule.
In addition, several grants from USAID for training, applied research and
assistance in management of the farmer's association should improve the Jordan
Valley Authority's efforts to accomplish the agricultural development objec-
tives of the project which have so far been neglected. Cost overruns of about
72 percent in total project costs are expected and would be met by the Govern-
ment.
Cr. No. 534:  Second Education Project; US$6.0 Million Credit of March 12,
1975; Date of Effectiveness: June 2, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The project is designed to expand vocational and technical education,
to promote quality improvements in secondary education by replacing uneconomic-
ally small, rented school buildings and providing schools with adequate work-
shops, and to support integrated rural development projects in the Jordan
Valley through a pilot scheme of non-formal basic education. The project
includes construction, furniture and equipment for the following institutions:
a Polytechnic at Irbid; a training complex at Aqaba; a Hotel Training School
at Amman; three comprehensive secondary schools; extension of preparatory and
secondary schools (seven pre-vocational workshops; five science laboratories,
four women's craft centers); and a rural development center. Overall project

implementation is about 18 months behind schedule due to initial delays in
selecting project consultants.  However implementation of major project com-
ponents is now proceeding satisfactorily. Bidding documents for construction
are under preparation, with tender:ing scheduled for early 1978. Technical
assistance being provided by UNDP and ODM is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 570:  Second Power Project; US$5.0 Million Credit of July 7, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: November 18, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979.
The project adds 33 megawatts to total generating capacity. It also
includes reconditioning of the diesel-electric power station at Marqa and a
Power Development Study for Southern Jordan. A cost overrun in total project
cost of about 14 percent is expected and implementation of all project com-
ponents is proceeding satisfactorily. Civil works for the unit are nearly
complete and the unit is scheduled to come on stream in October 1978.
Cr. No. S-19: Potash Engineering Credit; US$1.0 Million of July 7, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: June 22, 1976; Closing Date: June 30,
1978.
The credit will help meet part of the cost of a feasibility study,
estimated at US$10.0 million, for the construction of trial dikes for the
production of potash from Dead Sea brine via solar evaporation. USAID is
providing US$6.0 million and the Arab Potash Company (APC), the executing
agency, is providing US$3.0 million from equity funds. Construction of
the trial dikes and carnallite pans is proceeding satisfactorily. The
consultants prepared a preliminary feasibility report of the full-scale
project in December 1976, which was reviewed in a meeting of prospective
donors in London in June 1977. The final feasibility report was completed
in February 1978.
Cr. No. 639:   Tourism Project; US$6.0 Million Credit of August 12, 1976; Date
of Effectiveness: July 15, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The project includes the construction of tourist accommodation and
related facilities near the Petra Entrance, and the construction of visitor
facilities and archaeological preservation works in the Petra Basin as well
as the resettlement of about 96 Bedouin families currently living in the
Basin. The Project also provides for visitor facilities, infrastructure,
archaeological preservation works at Jerash, and technical assistance.
Schematic plans and cost estimates for the Petra Entance Facilities, includ-
ing staff housing are under preparation. Procurement of the first lot of
equipment is proceeding on schedule and bids for the Bedouin resettlement
housing are being reviewed by the Association.

Cr. No. 646:   First DFC Project; US$4.0 Million Credit of July 19, 1976;
Date of Effectiveness: November 5, 1976; ClosinR Date:
June 30, 1981.
The project is aimed at meeting part of the foreign exchange require-
ments of the Industrial Development Bank of Jordan (IDB) for financing the
import component of medium scale enterprises. The project would also aims at
meeting part of the cost of IDB's recently instituted program to assist small-
scale enterprises and handicrafts, primarily artisan shops employing no more
than five people and provides for a study of the small-scale industrial and
handicraft subsector. IDB's operations have been expanding under favorable
economic conditions. IDA committed 40 percent of the Credit within 10 months
after it became effective. The progress made by IDB in implementing the Small-
Scale Industry and Handicraft Program is impressive. The study of the small-
scale industry sector has been completed, and further surveys are under
consideration.
