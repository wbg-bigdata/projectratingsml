3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Introduction: This Second Emergency Rehabilitation Project (ERP-2) was prepared in early 1996 in
response to a growing employment crisis in the West Bank and Gaza (WBG). The latter resulted from the
near total closure of the borders with Israel. ERP-2 was a part of the Bank's contribution to a wider donor
effort to provide emergency employment relief to WBG. One of its objectives was to create employment



quickly, using the framework of the existing and well established First Emergency Rehabilitation Project
(ERP- 1).  Employment targets were only partially achieved. The reasons are various, but the most
significant are that:
*   The "crisis" abated shortly after project effectiveness;
*   The Bank and donors successfully developed alternative mechanisms for addressing the difficult
employment issue on a more sustained basis.
Combined, these factors undermined the employment generation rational. In response, the focus of ERP-2
was modified. It became, in effect, an extension of the successful ERP- 1. Judged on this basis. ERP-2 was
also a considerable success.
The above highlights some of the problems of policy making in a highly unstable environment -- an issue to
which is discussed later in this review.
Background: Following the signing of the historic September 1993 Declaration of Principles (DOP),
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Bank was asked to take the lead in
developing a program of support. It responded by developing the US$1.2 billion Emergency Assistance
Program for Occupied Territories (EAP: December 1993) and the supporting US$20 million Technical
Assistance Program for the Occupied Territories (TAP). In further support of the EAP, the Bank itself
contributed US$50 million from its net income to establish a special Trust Fund for Gaza and the West
Bank (TFGWB). The Emergency Rehabilitation Project (ERP-1) was the first Bank project to be funded
3/
from TFGWB, and thus was the first in the Bank's own program of assistance to the Palestinian people.
ERP-1 aimed "to help alleviate the current crisis by delivering widespread and tangible benefits to broad
sectors of the Palestinian population as quickly, equitably and effectively as possible" (SAR - p.4, para
12). It planned to do this by:
- removing the most critical infrastructural bottlenecks;
- improving essential facilities and services;
* creating productive employment;
*   building capacity; and
*   providing institutional support in the area of project and program management.
1/ ERP-I was successfully completed in Dec. 1998 (see ICR dated June 25, 1999).
2/ Our earlier projects refer to "the Occupied Territories (OT) ". The territorial designation was later changed to West Bank
and Gaza or "WBG". At the time of appraisal, WBG was not (and still is not) a member country of the Bank and hence the
Bank could not lend to it directly. The TFGWB was established as a vehicle for lending.
3/ The current total stands at 1 Zprojects at an estimated cost of about US$282 million equivalent.
In March 1996, the period during which ERP-2 was being prepared, WBG was in a severe crisis. Tension
was high; borders with Israel were closed; movement of people and goods were severely restricted; food
was becoming scarce in Gaza; unemployment was escalating; and the Palestinian economy was
hemorrhaging. Direct losses in external labor income were running at an estimated $1.5m per work-day.
The following highlights the situation at the time:
-2 -



The Palestinian economy's present state of crisis calls for urgent help from the donor community. In
response to four suicide bombings within Israel, which claimed more than 50 lives in late February
and early March, the Israeli authorities have imposed one of the tightest border closures in recent
history on the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS), with severe consequences for the Territories'
economy. To address the growing crisis, the donor community has already taken steps to accelerate
the flow of assistance to the Palestinians by, inter alia: restructuring their programs to ensure
speedier delivery of tangible benefits to the worst-affected Palestinians, notably through rapid
employment creation projects, and, in some cases, pledging prompt new assistance aimed
specifically at relieving present hardships.
[SAR, ERP-2, April 18, 1996 , p.l]
and:
In short, an economic depression on a scale unseen since the Peace Process began is in the making.
Unemployment (broadly defined to include underemployment), already a record-high 51 percent in
the Gaza Strip and 33 percent in the West Bank in late 1995, has by all accounts soared since the
closure began. The closure's impact on the poor and vulnerable cannot yet be reliably assessed, but
an abundance of UTNRWA and other reports, notably on household conditions in the refugee camps,
point to serious distress for many whose savings have been depleted by the impact of previous
closures. While any estimates of full-year losses in income are still highly tentative at this stage, a
recent IMF mission has projected a 17 percent decline in real GNP in 1996, on the assumption that
the closure on goods is gradually lifted by the summer, but that restrictions on labor remain
significant for the rest of the year. This compares with a pre-closure forecast of 5-6 percent growth
in 1996 real GNP over its 1995 level; in total, therefore, almost a quarter of this year's projected
GNP will have been lost.
[SAR, ERP-2, April 18, 1996, p 2&3]
Of course, crisis was not new in WBG. It had been in a very deep and pervasive crises for a considerable
time. The situation in early 1996 was particularly urgent, however. The peace process, itself, was at risk.
ERP-2's Objectives: ERP-2's objectives were similar to ERP-l's, (see above) but even more urgent. In
addition to its main objective of removing critical infrastructural bottlenecks and improving essential
facilities and services, ERP-2 also aimed to help respond quickly and directly to the crisis. It sought, inter
alia, to relieve the severe unemployment pressure by generating:
*   77,000 person days of employment in the first 3-4 months;
* 225,000 person days of employment in the first 10 months;
*   60% of the above jobs in Gaza.
This was to be accomplished by quickly implementing some $20m  of high priority infrastructure
sub-projects.
3.2 Revised Objective:
ERP's core objectives were not changed. However, as noted above, its employment generation expectations
- 3 -



were altered soon after project effectiveness. The reasons for the change in focus with respect to
employment has already been indicated and will be further discussed in Section 4.
3.3 Original Components:
Rating     Component                       Cost ($m)
S          Works                              18.44
S          Goods                              0.36
S          Consultant Services                0.60
S          Incr. Op. Expenses                 0.60
3.3 Revised Components:
The basic components were not revised though some programmatic shifts did occur. The original Works
component was modified during implementation by the introduction of $3.47m in specifically designed
labor intensive projects, including $2.Om in micro-projects. The latter were included to help extend the
geographic reach of ERP-2, as well as to increase its labor intensiveness.The Works component was also
expanded by $3.49m equivalent as a result of the receipt of the Italian cofinancing midway through project
implementation. These funds went mainly to water and sanitation projects in Gaza.
The revised components and rating are as follows:
Ratin_      Component                  Revised Cost ($m)
S          Works                            21.38
S          Goods                             0.10
S          Consultant Services               1.07
S          Incr. Op. Expenses                0.94
3.4 Quality at Entry:
The project was prepared in a great hurry and the normal appraisal and appraisal documentation were
waived. Only a "Memorandum of the President" was prepared. This procedure was justified at the time by:
(1) the urgency of the situation; and (2) the fact that the project vehicle was the on-going and successful
ERP- 1. The justification seems reasonable in the circumstances. Never-the-less, a number of issues arise as
follows:
*   was the project adequately conceived (i.e., was it an appropriate response to the problem)?
* was the project adequately prepared (e.g., were the employment and implementation targets and
arrangements realistic)?
These issues are also addressed in Section 4.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcoome/achievement of objective:
This report concludes that the project's core objectives were fully achieved. The basis for this conclusion is
set out below. In proceeding, achievement with respect to employment generation is first examined,
together with the context within which the achievement took place. The broader objectives are then
discussed and an overall judgment is given.
Employment Targets and Their Achievement: This is summarized in the table below:
Indicator                    Unit                 Target         Actual       % Achievement
Employment Generation
First 3-4 months             Person days          77,000          27,000            35%
First 10 months              Person days          225,000        103,000            46%
Total                        NA                    NA            188,000            NA
Distribution of Employment
Gaza (First 3-4 month)       %                     60%            24%               40%
Gaza (First 10 month)        %                     60%            48%               80%
Gaza (Total)                 %                     60%            49%               82%
Note: Emnployment figures include on-site employment and employment directly related to local materials supply.
It can be seen from the above that the employment target for the first 3-4 and the first 10 months were only
35% and 46% achieved, respectively. The distributional target with respect to Gaza was largely achieved,
though not during the supposedly crucial first 3-4 months. On the basis of the above it would be
reasonable to conclude that the project had failed to meet the employment generation target. This would be
simplistic however. The issues are examined more closely below.
Closure and Employment:  Closures had been a
fact of life in WBG since the fall of 1994 and
became particularly severe 1995. In this year the      2_-_
border with Gaza was closed for some 102 days, or      18                     --.-
about one third of the year. The severity of closure   14l
varied considerably throughout the year, with peaks    12
occurring in  February and October when  the         c 10.
borders were closed for more than one half of the
month. Only two months, June and December, were
"closure free" (see Fig. 1).2

Closures were reinstated in January 1996, and                          Go%uein 196
continued almost unabated till June 1996 (see Fig.
2). It is this series of closures and the resulting
negative impact on employment which gave rise to       3_0_
ERP-2 as a part of the Bank's contribution to a
wider donor relief effort. It can be seen from Fig.3
that labor flows to Israel drop precipitously from                r
just over 40,000 per day in January 1996 to            15
virtually zero in March. We do not have good data      10
on the impact on employment and earnings during
this period, but we do know that it was severely
negative. Also, we know  from  experience with          0        s     a
ERP-1 that the disruption of economic activity was                                     0  z
considerable, and that even after closure has been                              Fig. 2
lifted it takes sometime before things return to
"normal". Given WVBG dependence on employment             F.Ii..tdL.br Fw.tt.AD 1-H C.0-1kdA .. hr, F.-itH.Id-
in Israel, a crisis quickly arose. The existence of
this crisis is amply documented in the ERP-2
Memorandum  and other Bank papers (see, for             1I
example, "West Bank and Gaza - The World Bank's
Response to the Current Economic Crisis: An
Interim Strategy", dated April 23, 1996).
Fig. 3
The situation does not begin to improve significantly until June 1996 when the flow of workers to Israel
rises to just over 15,000 per day (one third of the January figure), peaks at just over 30,000 in August and
declines again to just over 10,000 in October. From October it again begins to climb, but it is not until
January 1997 that the January 1996 figure is once again attained and slightly exceeded. The labor flow
peaks in January and February 1997 and thereafter begins to decline.
To summarize, the "crisis" which gave rise to ERP-2 began to develop at least as far back as July 1995,
peaked in March 1996 and began to abate by June 1996 -- less than one month after ERP-2's effectiveness.
Bank and Donor Response: The Bank and donors began formulating responses as far back as November
1994. This followed a series of closures in the fall of 1994 which exacerbated an already difficult
employment situation, particularly in Gaza where some 33% of the population already lived in poverty.
The issue of job creation first came up at the Ad Hoc Liaison committee (AHLC) meeting in November
1994. At this meeting the First Emergency Employment Generation Program (EEGP) was created as joint
effort by PECDAR (The main Palestinian Implementing Agency), the UN Agencies and the Bank. It aimed
to finance small-scale infrastructural activities, and was supported by the Bank and donors through the
Holst Fund. This program ran with some success during 1995 though its often "make-work" components
(street sweeping, wall painting, etc.) did not find favor in all quarters.
2/ See "Emergency Employment Program: An overview of on-going activities, " United Nations, Office of the Special Coordinator for the Occupied
Territories, Gaza, May 10, 1996.
-6 -



The closures in the first few months of 1996 placed the employment issue squarely on the agenda once
again. On March 28, 1996, US secretary of State Warren Christopher announced the main elements of an
Emergency Employment Plan. This met with general agreement, and the issue became the main item at the
Brussels AHLC meeting on April 12, 1996. At this meeting the Bank announced in its report that it
intended to begin creating some 50,000 short term jobs by May 1996 at a cost of $73m, of which $23m
would be through the Holst Fund (i.e., through restructuring EEGP). The original allocation of $4m to the
Holst Fund for the clean up of Gaza was to be expanded to $10m. It is in this context the ERP-2 was
conceived, as part of the Bank's contribution. Not only would ERP-2 contribute to relieving the
employment situation, it would continue the important work of ERP-1 and help maintain buoyancy in the
construction industry at a time of economic downturn. The revived EEGP was strongly supported by the
Bank and donors, and was successfully implemented. Its expansion and consolidation ran parallel to the
development of ERP-2. In this context it should be noted that in early 1996 the Bank was also preparing a
new generation of urban projects, beginning with the Municipal Infrastructure Development Project One
(MIDP- 1, FY '96). This project continued the work began under ERP- 1, but also aimed to begin addressing
some of the more deeply entrenched institutional and financial issues in the local government sector.
MIDP-1 was presented to the Board in May 1996 and became effective in July 1996.
Beneficiary Response to Small Scale Rural Sub-projects: Quite early during implementation of the new
EEGP and of ERP-2, Bank staff in WBG realized that the small scale rural infrastructure component of
both projects filled a very important void. Not only did it help relieve employment in many towns and
villages in WBG, it also met with considerable enthusiasm, particularly from the villages. Many of these
villages, which are a core feature of social and economic life on the West Bank, were receiving attention
and investment literally for the first time in decades. So much did they appreciate this un-accustomed
attention that they began volunteering contributions in money and kind to expanding the scope of the
projects serving their communities. It was further realized that the small scale interventions in the villages
were paying disproportionate dividends in opening up access, reducing social hardship, improving the
quality of life and sparking economic activity -- from increasing private transportation activity to fostering
new business ventures.
Drawing on the above lessons, in October 1996 Bank staff in WBG began developing the very successful
first Community Development Project (CDP-1). This was presented to the Board in March 1997 and
became effective in May 1997. Thus, by the fall of 1996 the Bank had four separate vehicles through
which to address the employment issue in WBG -- three operational (EEGP, ERP-2 and MIDP- 1) and one
or the drawing board (CDP-1). This was so at a time when the "crisis" had eased considerably, although
closures and unemployment had by no means ceased to exist (see Figs. 2 & 3). It is in the above context
that changes in ERP-2's employment generation targets begin to occur.
Other Contributory Factors: Three other factors are important in explaining the early change in trajectory
of ERP-2 with respect to employment generation. First, the ERP-1 type sub-projects which formed the
original basis for developing ERP-2 were not particularly labor intensive, but none of the professionals
(Bank, Govemment or Consultants) wanted to engage in "make-work" sub-projects or to build up a large
cadre of public sector workers. Private contractors were also reluctant to adopt specifically labor intensive
techniques while keeping their expensive equipment idle. Some time was thus lost in sub-project redesign
and dialogue with consultants and contractors in an attempt to raise the labor content of conventional
infrastructure projects. The second factor is that in March through August 1996 PECDAR was undergoing
significant internal change involving the departure of many of the senior managers, and the appointment of
a new managing director and a new director for projects in Gaza.  These changes reduced the
responsiveness of the organization, though not for very long. Even a short hiatus, however, can have a
- 7 -



large impact on a crisis response program. The third factor is that while closure had been lifted and the
employment crisis had eased, things did not return to "normal" in Gaza. In particular, significant
restrictions were placed by Israeli Authorities on the transport of critical building materials (cement, steel,
aggregate, asphalt, etc.) from Israel, and through Israel into Gaza. This naturally had a negative impact on
the ability of the construction industry to respond quickly to the challenge of employment generation.
The main outputs and achievements of ERP-2 are discussed below.
4.2 Outputs by components:
These are presented in the table below, based mainly on the ERP-1 objectives.

v) Projects Implemented          *  Projects (Total no): 40                   * 68 Projects
It will be seen from the table that 89km of water networks were improved or rehabilitated, 83 in Gaza and
6km  in the West Bank. Also, 2 reservoirs were constructed, one in each region. With respect to sewage
- 8 -



networks, 16.5km were constructed in Gaza and 6km in the West Bank. With respect to storm drainage,
some 3km were constructed, most of it in Gaza. With respect to roads, 121.5km were constructed, of
which 113km were in the West Bank. With respect to micro-projects, several km of water, roads and
sewage networks and sidewalks were constructed, mostly in Gaza; and 65 classrooms and 3 clinics were
constructed in the West Bank. In all, some 800,000 persons in some 86 communities benefited. It is worth
noting here that micro-projects (costing between $50 - $100,000) were not part of the original project
design. They were introduced to increase the job creation potential of ERP-2 as well as to respond to the
"demand" noted above with respect to villages and poor communities. This component proved highly
effective, generating 25% of the jobs and enabling ERP-2 to considerably extend its reach. Finally, it
should be noted that 68 sub-projects were successfully implemented compared to the 40 targeted at project
preparation.
3/ Apart from employment generation, few quantitative targets were set.
4/ The employrnent data have already been discussed above.
Other Outputs and Benefits: But, like ERP- 1, the numbers do not tell the full story. As noted above, it is
though the implementation of the village access road sub-projects in ERP-2 that it was first realized that
villagers on the West Bank were willing to volunteer to contribute money and time to expanding the scope
of projects which served their long neglected needs. This, plus the EEGP experience, led directly to the
creation of CDP-1. The other impacts, also already noted, were the increase in private economic activities
in the villages; improvements in the quality of life due to the development of higher quality and more
frequent transportation services and increased accessibility; and the reduction in social hardship. For
example, reviews with beneficiaries revealed that the incidence of lost pregnancies among women decreased
as a result of better roads and transport services as well as improved access to health care facilities in the
towns and cities. Also, the improvements facilitated school attendance by girls who previously had to stay
close to home. Further, increased accessibility facilitated the travel of women teachers to the outlying
villages, strengthening the education system for girls in those villages. The above should be added the fact
that about 60% of the classrooms constructed through the micro-projects on the West Bank were for girls.
Thus, the gender and children benefits were considerable, and were certainly appreciated by the women in
the villages.5' The economic benefits referred to above were also considerable and are not adequately
reflected in the data. Apart from the expansion of transport activity, the increased accessibility facilitated
the development of many new small business activities in the villages, creating employment and increasing
6/
wealth.
5/ Evidence of the above has been clearly captured on the film which accompanies this ICR
6/ These increased activities are also documented in the video which accompanies this document.
A Balance Sheet: To summarize, then, ERP-2's objectives were achieved but its initial employment
generation focus was altered very early in its life. The change in focus is explained by a number of factors:
1. An abatement of the crisis which undermined the original project rational;
2. The parallel development by the Bank of alternative, competing and seemingly more appropriate
mechanisms to respond to the employment issue;
3. The "discovery" of the potential of the small scale rural infrastructure sub-projects;
4. The fact that the original set of ERP-2 sub-projects were not particularly labor intensive, and
required some adaptation to make them more so -- resulting in loss of time and relevance;
-9-



5. Organizational changes in PECDAR which slowed initial responsiveness; and
6. Changes in the responsiveness of the construction industry occasioned by changes in the building
material supply regime following the lifting of closure.
As a result of the above, within six months of its effectiveness ERP-2 became, in effect, simply an
extension of ERP- 1-- a very successful extension.
Was the change in focus wise? It could be argued that the situational changes described above could, and
should have been foreseen by the project preparation team. To some extent this is true, but in early 1996
only a very bold person would claim to have been able to anticipate the future course of events in WBG. It
could also be argued that the original project design could not have achieved the ambitious employment
generation goals. To some extent this is also true. But it should be borne in mind that March 1996 was a
time of crisis, the very nature of which requires action but precludes prior detailed analysis. Finally, few
would argue that the Bank should have stuck with the original employment targets when the situation had
in fact changed.
The Positive Side: It should not be forgotten that the operating environment in WBG is very unstable. This
instability was at a peak in 1996. In such an environment it is critical that the Bank be able to respond
quickly. It cannot afford exhaustive prior analysis and deliberations. It must be prepared to act quickly,
"learn" quickly, and to make corrective changes as it learns. Also, it must implement effectively despite
instability. On the basis of these criteria and other implementation factors mentioned below and
discussed in Section 5.1, the Bank's performance in WBG, and on ERP-2, must be adjudged a significant
success.
Now to return to the questions posed in Section 3.4, Quality At Entry:
1. Was the Project Adequately Conceived? The answer must be "yes"! Given the urgency of the
situation the project preparation team responded using the "tools" and "structures" that were at hand.
These turned out to be inadequate for the job so new tools and structures were devised (CDP- 1). The
team learned quickly from experience and the problem was addressed -- though through different
channels;
2. Was the Project Adequately Prepared? The answer is a "qualified yes"! It seems unlikely that the
employment targets could have been achieved without significantly modifying the original sub-projects
set to make it more labor intensive. There is also no way the targets could have been met within the
originally stated time frame given the turbulence during the period. Never-the-less, as will be shown in
Section 5, ERP-2's performance in the first year one half far outstripped that of ERP-1. The project
was 80% disbursed in one and one quarter years, a considerable achievement.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not Assessed. This was an emergency project and calculations of NPV and ERR are not required.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.

4.5 Inistitutional development impact:
The project did not include institutional objectives save for effective project management. It was relatively well
managed by PECDAR so thus the objective was fully achieved. While not an important objective of ERP-2, the
capacity building impact of ERP-2 was considerable. The achievements with respect to the institutionalization of
PECDAR and the strengthening of the consulting and contracting industry are well documented in the ERP- 1 ICR
7/
and are thus not repeated-here.  In almost every respect ERP-2 continued and deepened the achievement of
ERP-1.
7/ See ERP-1 ICR dated June 25, 1999, pp. 5 & 7.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Most of the issues affecting implementation and outcomes have already been discussed above. The only
significant remaining issue is that of implementation delay. The most critical factor outside of Government
and implementing agency control was, of course, closure. Here the implementing agency and the PA had
no leverage whatsoever.
During the originally planned implementation period (June '96 - December '97) there were 129 days of
closure. At the end of calendar 1997, the originally scheduled closing date, the project was 90% committed
and 80% disbursed. The project was thus about 20% behind schedule. The contribution of closure to the
delay during this period is difficult to determine but was probably about 20%. This can be compared with
ERP-1 which experienced 13 closures totaling some 150 days over a 4 year period, and which contributed
some 30-40% to ERP-l's time delay. Fig. 4 indicates the pattern of disbursements for ERP-2, and Fig. 5
compares these patterns for ERP-1 & ERP-2. In reviewing the above it should be borne in mind that
Italian cofinancing became effective in July 1997, two thirds of the way through the planned
implementation period. The additional time needed to prepare and implement the new Italian sub-projects
made it necessary to extend ERP-2's closing date twice, first from December 1997 to December 1998, and
then to June 30, 1999 -- doubling the implementation period.

Despite the fact that ERP-2 only achieved 80% of its disbursement target at the end of December 1997, this
performance is highly commendable -- even spectacular -- in the circumstances. Few Bank projects can
claim to have disbursed 80%  of their funds in 1.5 years  the planned ERP-2 disbursement period. This
performance is also much better than the very successful ERsP-e (see Fig. 5) and demonstrates that, despite
all the turbulence, implementation during the planned period was well handled. The IDA component was
almost fully disbursed by June 1998, i.e., in 2 years -- a creditable performance by any standard, and very
favorable when compared to ERP-1. After June 1997, the disbursement curve begins to flatten
considerably. The reasons are twofold. First is the normal "S" curve behavior of construction projects in
which disbursements always tends to flatten out towards the end of the project life. Second, is the inception
of the new Italian component noted above.
1/ It may not be entirely fair to compare ERP-2 with ERP-1 in this way, however. The latter took the brunt of the closure as well as experienced
most of the "learning" that occurred with initial project implementation in WBG. ERP-2 obviously benefited considerably from this experience.
2/ The Italian component is still not closed due to a number of institutional problems encountered towards the end of the planned June '99 completion
period. It is proposed to keep this component open until March 2000 in order to resolve these problems. This issue is discussed in Section 5.3.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
This is a very difficult call to make in such an unstable environment. Perhaps the one area that may have
been subject to PA control was the delay due to the management transition period at PECDAR in mid-1996
(see discussion in Section 4). This may have contributed 10% or so to the overall project delay, but this is
very difficult to assess.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The build up of PECDAR's capacity (discussed at some length in the ERP-1 ICR and hence not repeated
here) had a positive impact on project implementation. Project preparation, bidding and financial
management and monitoring were generally very well handled. On the other hand, PECDAR's inability to
anticipate some of the issues related to the implementation of the Italian component (admittedly
complicated non-technical -- see discussion below) contributed somewhat to delays after December 1998.
Cost changes during the construction period were relatively insignificant.   Most sub-projects were
completed within or relatively close to budget, and the overall project was completed within budget. Fig. 6
tells a somewhat different story with respect to time, however. While 70% of the projects were completed
on time -- a creditable achievement -- the time delay was still significant. The average delay relative to
- 12 -



planned construction time was 23%. It was much higher in Gaza (60%), and relatively negligible on the
West Bank (5%). The water and sanitation sector experienced the greatest average time delay of 67% (87%
West Bank and 64% Gaza). The roads sector was next, experiencing an average time delay of 26% (68%
Gaza and 10% West Bank). The micro-projects in the West Bank experienced the least delay (almost zero).
About 23% of sub-projects (mainly in Gaza) experienced extreme delay (greater than 50%), and 7% of
sub-projects (again mainly in Gaza) experienced moderate delays (20-50%).

Delay Factors: A review of the delay factors in Gaza, where (on average) most of the delay occurred, leads to the
following broad conclusions:
Delay Factors                                                                 °/ of Delay
1.   Building permits & land acquisition                                        65%
2.   Building materials shortages due to closure                                20%
3.  Inadequate design                                                            10%
4.   Contractor inexperience (mainly micro-projects)                             5%
Total                                                                           100%
It can be seen from the above that problems with land acquisition and building permits accounted far about
two thirds of the delay on the Gaza projects. This may be compared with closures which contributed only
about one fifth.
To summarize, cost management was very effective and time management was relatively good. The main
problem area in terms of time delay was in Gaza. Here issues related to land acquisition and building
permits were most important three times as important as closures in contributing to time delay. This is
clearly an area within PECDAR's control which needs improvement. In sectoral terms, the water and
sanitation sector was the most problematic in terms of time delay -- with the West Bank being more
problematic than Gaza. Again, this is an area for PECDAR's attention. With respect to quality, the
standard of design and implementation was reasonably good though there is significant room for
improvement. However, as the ERP-1 ICR notes, significant quality improvements have already been
experienced and it is expected that this will continue. Taken overall, PECDAR's performance has been
good -- very good in some areas.

Italian Cofinancing, The Jabalia Water Project Issue: It has been noted above that the Italian
Cofinancing component has not been closed. Closing has been extended to March 2000 to facilitate the
resolution of a number of non-technical but none-the-less important issues. The issues arise out of the fact
that despite the successful completion of the water network in Jabalia many beneficiaries are reluctant to
make household connections. Thus the new network is not being effectively utilized. The reasons are many
but the following appear to be the most significant:
1. Households used to receive free water from the former supplier -- UNRWA. They are now being
asked to pay for these services;
2. Reluctance of UTNRWA to continue to be involved in service delivery because of declining
availability of funds;
3. Householders fear that if UNRWA, the current supplier of services, begins to withdraw from the
area they will lose other significant related benefits;
4. Water sourcing problems which are not fully resolved between the municipality, UNRWA and the
Palestine Water Authority (PWA).
Most of these issues were, on the face of it, predictable, and should have been anticipated by PECDAR and
the Bank at the sub-project identification and appraisal stage. Prior beneficiary and institutional analysis
should have revealed them. This points to the need for a more sophisticated approach to projected
preparation by PECDAR and the Bank, particularly as the development program shifts from "!emergency"
approaches to begin to tackle the more complex institutional and financial problems. The other side of the
coin is whether this sub-project should have been included in ERP-2 in the first place, given the obvious
complexities involved. Several lessons should be learned here.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
There are no significant issues. As noted above, the project was completed within budget. The original
project cost total was increased from US$20m to US$23.49m due to the receipt of Italian cofinancing. The
additional funds went to water and sanitation projects in Gaza. There was some internal reallocation of the
IDA funding for works (see para 3.3) and minor reallocations in other categories (see Annex 2).
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
ERP-2 is adjudged to be sustainable. This is evidenced by four factors: i) ERP-2 has been followed by
five Bank (IDA) projects which have built on the foundations established under ERP-1 and enhanced under
ERP-2;" ii) it has been followed by several donor infrastructure projects with an estimated value of more
than US$0.5 billion equivalent; iii) the latest set of IDA projects (MIIDP-1, CDP-1 and 2, B2000, and the
upcoming MIDP-2), building on ERP- I and ERP-2 foundation, have moved from emergency approaches
into longer-term policy reform and capacity building; and iv) the institutional capacity built up at PECDAR
under ERP-1 and ERP-2 has been considerable, and has served as the basis for further Palestinian project
and program development.
1/ As has been noted repeatedly above, ERP-2 was in effect a continuation of ERP-1. It is thus realistic to treat them together.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
As noted above, ERP-2 was followed by MIDP- 1, CDP- I & 2, B2000 and the upcoming MIDP-2 (FY
- 14 -



'00). Thus the transition to regular operations is well underway, though by no means complete. WVBG is
not yet a "regular" place.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Performance here must be judged satisfactory (S). The Bank moved quickly to respond to an urgent
problem in a difficult situation.
7.2 Supervision:
Performance here is judged satisfactory (S). The Bank supervision team learned quickly and reacted
quickly and effectively to changing circumstances. But the difficulties arising late in the project with time
overruns and close out of the Italian financed component.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
This is judged satisfactory (S), see Sections above.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
This must be judged satisfactory (S). All agencies and ministries cooperated well in expediting project
preparation, with PECDAR taking the lead.
7.5 Government imiplementation performance:
(See "7.6" below).
7.6 linplementingAgency:
PECDAR took the lead and bore the main responsibilities for preparation and implementation. As noted in
Section 5.3, their performance has been good in most areas and very good in some. Overall, PECDAR's
performance was satisfactory (S). As is the case with Bank supervision performance, some of the close-out
difficulties experienced late in the project somewhat was an otherwise very good perfonnance.
7. 7 Overall Borrower performance:
Satisfactory (S), see conclusions at Section 7.6 above.
8. Lessons Learned
During the course of implementing ERP-2, many lessons were learned. Some were also learned on ERP- 1
and are repeated here. Others are unique to ERP-2.
ERP-2 Lessons:
1. Planning and implementing in a highly unstable environment such as WBG requires an unconventional
- 15 -



approach. Often decisions have to be made without adequate information or analysis. To do otherwise
is to risk being irrelevant. In this context misjudgments will be made. In these circumstances the
challenge is not that of meeting some rigidly predefined set of objectives. It is to act quickly on the
basis of the best existing information, but to learn, leam quickly, and modify behavior based on
learning. This may require continual redefinition of objectives and even project redesign during
implernentation.
2. Productive emergency job creation is not an easy task and requires special planning if resources are to
be effectively deployed. Simple adaptation of conventional sub-projects and institutional structures is
not likely to produce desired results. New types of sub-projects and specially designed implementation
structures are required.
3. It is critical that beneficiaries be adequately consulted during project preparation in order that their
needs and priorities are properly reflected in project design.
4. Communities are willing to participate in program formulation and contribute directly (up to 20% of
project costs) for projects which directly benefit their communities.
5. As the development program shifts from "emergency" operations and begins to tackle more complex
issues, the Bank and implementing agencies must develop the capacity to undertake more sophisticated
project appraisal.
6. Greater attention needs to be paid by the borrower to the timely acquisition of land and building
permits if significant implementation delays are to be avoided.
ERP-1 and ERP-2 Lessons:
1. There must be strong ownership by, and good dialogue with the borrower and its constituent
organizations if necessary implementation decisions are to be taken on a timely basis.
2.. Adequate "slack" time must be provided for if the vicissitudes of border closures (political risks) are to
be weathered.
3. The provision of operating support to implementing units is critical to establishing managerial and
technical capacity.
4. Close on-the-ground supervision and willingness to be flexible in adapting the project to local realities
is essential. It can also contribute significantly to mitigating risks.
5. Without the authority that has been delegated to the WBG staff in the field, the responsiveness to crisis
and change described in this document would have been almost impossible.

Subject: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR).
WEST BANK AND GAZA
SECOND EMERGENCY REHABILITATION PROJECT (ERP-2)
(Trust Fund Credit # 26058 and 26053)
Dear Mr. Robotham
Please find attached to this letter the final draft copy of PMO and finance department FMS
report detailing the status of the civil and technical assistance components.
Following the workshop conducted on the 3rd of November 1999, with participation of the
beneficiaries in the world Bank premises, myself and colleague worked in the project would like to
thank you and your team for the support and commended work throughout the implementation phase.
Moreover, and after going through the draft copy of the ICR report prepared by your team there is not
much to comment but to congratulate.
The main objectives of the fund was fully and successfully utilized and provided the tool to
remove bottlenecks and created direct and indirect, immediate and long term, employment for over
120,000 person over the implementation period. With the fund available it was possible to execute 7
projects in for the water services (88Km of water and pipes and fittings and 5000m3 water reservoirs,
16 water and wastewater pumps) in 6 major cities in Gaza. In addition to 1 project to supply the
necessary equipment for the maintenance and successful operation of the implemented projects. Also
it was possible to implement wastewater drainage networks (15Km) and the re-pavement and
asphalting of 12Km. At the same time in the West Bank and through the micro-projects component it
was possible to construct 180 classrooms accommodating 7200 pupils. Three primary health care
clinics and 132Km of new roads connecting villages with the main cities. This in addition to the water
networks (20Km) and reservoirs.

The job opportunities were for the direct and indirect laborers associated to the construction
industry and several related economic and financial services. Immediate and long term social benefits
were also achieved through the implementation of the multi-sector micro-projects that enforced the
community participation, both in kind and in money, and paved the way, from within, for real spirit of
rehabilitation and reconstruction of the devastated infrastructure. The civil works component was
implemented under the strict compliance with the World Bank procurement guidelines. This ensured
fair competition and reasonable construction cost. The tangible indicators that shaped the
implantation phase of ERP2 could be summarized as follows:
1-    The main overall objectives and merits of implementing the fund:
ERP2 created the atmosphere for the development of the construction industry, which
absorbed skilled and semi-skilled laborer. Moreover, the technical consultancy services was
evolved and matured throughout the project implementation.
The projects aimed at the rehabilitation of multi-sectors that was vital to support the social
and peace initiatives targeted by all the region parties.
*     Many support services were also developed such as banking and insurance services.
*     The rehabilitation of water networks relieved the suffering and the public health hazard that
normally associated with water contamination.
*     The rehabilitation of road networks paved the way to more investment and preservation of the
rural areas and the agriculture sector. In addition it encourages small business to be allocated
in the villages and minimized the repositioning of people to towns.
*     The rehabilitation of the storm and waste water networks delivered both health and
environmental benefits.
2-    Weakness factors affected the rapid implementation:
*     Although the ERP2 fund paved the way for co-financing, the needs for rehabilitation of the
devastated sectors is enormous. This put stress upon the decisions makers and planners to
mobilize the fund and to achieve the targets in a short time.
The capacity building of many LGU's institutions including PECDAR was under
development which slowed down the implementation in the first period as anticipated by the
SAR.
The weak and modest capacity and mobility either financial or technical of the private sector
(contractors and suppliers) to mobilize fund was main factor in slow disbursement of the
committed allocation.
The technical team had to work with very limited historical technical records.
*     The repetitive complete and semi complete closures of the Palestinian areas hampered and
discouraged the flow of goods and investment in a local construction industry.
3-    Difficulties faced during the implementation with the assigned time horizon:
*     Implementation of the physical projects was initiated at the time when the LGU's changed
management, therefore, many of the technical issues took longer time to resolve.
There was no designed documents nor definite or clear planning or operational strategies of
many of the listed projects.
It was important to re-specify many of the construction methodology to fit with the
employment target and to the encouragement of local investment.

ERP2 complemented the many projects that were initiated after the successful launching of ERP 1.
Although the project execution period were extended twice it was to accommodate the new
co-financing from the Italian government and to ensure proper quality and management of the works
and good deliveries, see chart below. The budget of the sub-components were kept in line and without
any major changes, this is a good indicator of proper design and quality control of the project.
The sustainability of the projects needs enforcement with allocation of proper operation and
maintenance resources. This is an important issue to PECDAR and confirmation from the
beneficiaries regarding this issue must be vigorously followed as it hampered the long-term benefits of
the implemented project.
Again I thank you and your team for the successful implementation of the ERP2 and the trust and
encouragement to PECDAR to carry on its objectives to create healthy sustainable investment
environment.
Best regards
Dr. K. A. Nigim
