                     CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY



Borrower:           The Republic o f Cape Verde

ImplementingAgency: Ministryo fFinance and Public Administration

Amount:             SDR 6.2 million(US$lO million equivalent)

Terms:              StandardIDAterms: 40-year maturitywith a 10-year grace period

Description:        The Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-4) supports the
                    last year o f implementation o f Cape Verde's first Growth and Poverty
                   Reduction Strategy (GPRSP-I). This one-tranche operation i s a
                   transitory one between the first and the second PRSC series, which
                   will be based on the GPRSP-I1 finalized by the Government at end o f
                   May 2008. The policy dialogue and the results-based framework
                   under PRSC-4 focus on the following pillars o f the GPRSP-I: (i)
                   promote good governance; (ii)develop human capital; and (iii)
                   improve the effectiveness and sustainability of the social protection
                   system. Specifically, PRSC-4 supports selected measures that aim to:
                   (a) improve public expenditure management, reform and modernize
                   the public administration, strengthen decentralization and municipal
                   management capacity, and strengthen monitoring and evaluation
                   systems; (b) improve quality and efficiency o f basic health; and (c)
                   modernize and rationalize social protection services, with a focus on
                   improving the normative and operational framework for social
                   protection services at the municipal level.

Benefits:          The measures supported by the proposedPRSC-4 are expected to have
                   a significant positive impact on poverty reduction. Specifically,
                   expected benefits include: (i)the strengthening o f public finance
                   management, which would enhance efficiency, transparency and
                   accountability in public resources use; (ii)the expansion o f health
                   infrastructure, particularly in remote areas, that would increase access
                   to quality health services for the poor; and (iii) the strengthening and
                   extension o f basic social protection to the poor. Due to the nature o f
                   the instrument, the PRSC i s also expected to reduce transaction costs
                   anddistortions associated to project financing.

Risks:             The main risks associated with PRSC-4 are: (i)       limited capacity in
                   some ministries to pursue the reform agenda; (ii) in external
                                                                        decline

                 (includingaccumulation o f contingent liabilities and non-discretionary
                 expenditure programs that could cause fiscal slippages and stall
                 implementation o f the more sensitive policy reforms); and (iv)
                 continued increase in fuel and food prices could delay firther poverty
                 reduction, especially inrural areas, given that most o f the food and all
                 oil has to be imported.

                                           A PROPOSED
                    FOURTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                        1. INTRODUCTION

1.1     The proposed PRSC-4 is a stand-alone operation that supports the last year o f
implementation o f the Government's First Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(GPRSP-I), and contributes to Cape Verde's effort to attain the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). The proposed PRSC-4 builds on results achieved under the first series and continues to
support the Government's efforts inthree o f the five pillars o fthe GPRSP, based on the division of
labor with other IDA anddonor projects. The three pillars to be supportedare:

    (a) promote good governance -especially effectiveness and equity- through reforms in public
        expenditure management, civil service anddecentralization;
    (b) develop humancapital, with a focus onhealth; and
    (c) strengthen the effectiveness and sustainability o fthe social protectionsystem.

1.2     The second GPRSP (GPRSP-11), which was finalized in end May 2008, puts greater
emphasis on infrastructure and private sector development to support growth and reduce poverty.
The World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY08-12, to be discussed at the Board in
September 2008, will be articulated around these objectives. Consistent with the GPRSP-I1 and the
CAS, after this transitory operation the second series o f PRSCs i s expected to shift the focus to
infrastructure andprivate sector development reforms.

1.3     Continuing the approach of the three previous PRSCs, this fourth operation i s prepared in
close coordinationwith other budget support partners, following a Memorandum o fUnderstanding
signed with the Government. The design o f the proposed PRSC-4, embedded in a three year
matrix agreed with the authorities and donors, was prepared under extensive consultation with
various stakeholders under the Government's leadership. This consultative and harmonized
approach minimizes the burden on the limited Government capacity and ensures Government
ownership o fthe supportedreforms.

                                    A.      COUNTRYOVERVIEW

2.1     Cape Verde i s an archipelago o f ten islands located on the West coast o f Africa. The
country has a 472,000 resident population and almost as twice population living abroad, mostly in
Europe and the U.S. This diaspora keeps close ties with the motherland, providing a substantial
flow o fremittances, which accounted for slightly more than 12 percent o f the GDP in2005 and 10
percent o f GDP in 2006.      Services represent approximately 70 percent o f GDP and industry,
mainly light manufacturing, around 23 percent of GDP. Industrial growth is constrained by high
factor costs and the absence o f economies of scale, but i s encouraged by the availability o f

qualified labor and a steadily improving investment climate.                   Agriculture, which represented
around7 percent of GDP in2006, is severely constrained by the scarcity o fwater, lack o frainfall,
the soil type, and problems with inter-island means o f reliable transport to unify the domestic
market. There are no knownmajor mineral resources.

2.2        Cape Verde's performance in social indicators outpaces most African countries. The
country's good economic performance (GDP per capita o f US$2,100 in 2005) and successful
public programs increased access to education and health care and paved the way to Cape Verde's
graduation from least developed status in January 2O0fL2Cape Verde is considered to be on track
to meet the MDGs by 2015 due to its high growth and strong performance on several social
 indicator^.^ Poverty has declined from 37 to 29 percent between 2001 and 2006,4 and the human
development index has increased from 0.63 in 1990to 0.72 in2003. The adult literacy rate is high
at 79 percent, while among the youth it reaches 97 percent. Inall cases, however, overall national
progress conceals important geographic variations, with the rural areas generally lagging behind
global averages. The most rural islands, like Santo Antgo, Fog0 and Brava, have significantly
higherpoverty rates. They are also the most isolatedislands, with especially hightransport costs
and, for Brava, no regular air or sea links. Limited access to quality education and health care,
isolation due to badroads, and low agricultural productivity contribute to the entrenched nature o f
ruralpoverty

2.3         Political openness has accompanied this economic and social progress.                       Since the
adoption o f a multi-partysystem in 1991, there have been three national elections and two orderly
changes in government. A free press and media further support the building o f an open society.
The last presidential and legislative elections took place in early 2006. Cape Verde's strong
economic performance and good governance has attracted sizable inflows o f external finance for
investment and development. Cape Verde has signed a compact with the US Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC) in 2005, which will provide grant financing o f around US$110
million spread over five years.

2.4      Cape Verde's maineconomic vulnerability stems from the structure o f the current account,
with a large and growing merchandise trade deficit. Tourism receipts, emigrant remittances and
transfers from donors provide the foreign exchange earnings. Current transfers (official and
private) are over three times the value o f merchandise exports, with emigrant remittances alone
being about one-and-a-half times the value o f exports o f goods. Merchandise exports include
shoes, clothing and fish and crustaceans. The small scale o f production in Cape Verde,
comparatively high labor costs, low quality and the inability to meet sanitary regulations has
limitedthe volume o f exports.

2.5      The economy o f Cape Verde is dominated by the tourism sector. The growth o f large scale
tourism is relatively recent in Cape Verde. In 2006, tourism receipts amounted to around 19
percent o f GDP, whereas in 2002 they only reached 10 percent. However, the tourism sector has

  3 MDG education targets have already largely been met, and health indicators are on track, with the exception o f
  immunization rates where more efforts are needed.       Meeting the provision o f water and sanitation will entail
  significant investment, but urbanization will ease meeting this goal.
    These estimates are based on changes over time between 2001 and 2006 in an asset index o f well-being, with
  corrections for changes ininequality over time.

had little spillover effects on the rest of the economy. According to a study conducted in 20075
local producers and manufacturers can not meet hotels' requirements in terms o f quality or
quantity. Cape Verde is a net importer o f most goods and can not meet the food needs o f its own
population (only 10 percent o f the land i s suitable for farming). Large hotels require large
quantities o f high quality products and consistent reliable supplies. The resorts which are already
up and runninghave developed their own infrastructure and/or secured long-term contracts for the
provision o f products and services, limiting the opportunity for local small and medium-sized
enterprises to become suppliers to these hotels. The absence o f a clear national tourism strategy
causes lack o f communication and involvement with the other sectors inplanning and improving
newtourism developments, resultinginlittle impact on the other sectors o fthe economy.

2.6      Looking ahead, the country faces a number o f challenges. Remittances may decline over
time, as the income gap andthe ties with the diaspora decrease. Furthermore, the country is highly
dependent on oil imports (including for water desalination, which accounts for about 75 percent of
water production). Inaddition, income inequalityhas risen and as rural populations flee entrenched
poverty, urbanization i s puttingpressure on basic services. Finally, the capacity o f the environment
to support large-scale expansion in tourism, industry and construction may be at risk if not
adequatelymanaged.

                                     B. RECENT      ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

2.7        Macroeconomic policies inCape Verde have strengthened significantly over recent years,
enabling the country to correct the macroeconomic imbalances o f the beginning o f the decade.
Cape Verde has experienced robust growth with real GDP growth averaging 5.1 percent duringthe
period 2002-05.          Estimates o f GDP growth for 2006 indicate that, despite difficulties with
electricity supply, the economy i s growing more rapidly than anticipated with the GDP growth rate
at 10.8 percent. This rate o f growth, well beyond the original projections, reflects strong public
and private investment (drivenby significant foreign direct investment), directed largely towards
infrastructure development and tourism, and the telecommunication industry. Prospects for 2007
are good with the growth rate projected at 7 percent, reflecting among other factors the carry-over
effect o f foreign direct investment inflows during 2006. Unemployment fell to 18.3 percent in
2006, down 6.1 percentage points from 2005.

2.8        Bolstered by a firm monetary policy and an exchange rate peg to the Euro, consumer
inflation has been subdued in the past years (-1.9 and 0.4 percent respectively in 2004 and 2005).
However, in 2006 inflation reached approximately 5.4 percent, largely reflecting supply shocks
(poor rainfall drove up domestically produced food prices). In2007, inflation stood at around 4.4
percent, once again driven by food prices (domestically produced).6 Inflation over the medium
term is expected to stabilize at around 2 percent consistent with the currency peg.

2.9        Monetary policy has focused on strengthening the sustainability o f the exchange rate peg
to the Euro by building up reserves and ensuring price stability, hence helping to foster an

    International cereal prices have not impacted yet in the CPI because importers have absorbed the impact by
  reducing their margins. However, importers have reported that they will not be able to continue absorbing the shock.
  Authorities have indicated that import duties and VAT will not be applied on some cereal products to mitigate the
  international price effect.

environment conducive to increased private investment, inflows of remittances and accumulation
of emigrant deposits. These factors, coupled with a strong performance of exports (estimated to
have grown by 35 percent in 2006), have led to a steady increase o f international reserves at the
Bank o f Cape Verde (BCV). These reached 3 months of prospective imports by end December
2006 compared to 2.8 months at the end o f December 2005 and are expected to reach 3.6 months
by the end o f 2007. Since 2006, the BCV has intervened more actively (started selling bank
securities) to prevent capital inflows leading to inflationary pressures and the deterioration o f
foreign reserves. Furthermore, the Central Bank is closely monitoring interest rate differentials
with the Euro area.

2.10        The external current account deficit has narrowed in the recent years, falling from over
14.4 percent o f GDP in 2004 to approximately 5 percent o f GDP in 2006. The improvements in
the external position reflect primarily increasing revenues from tourism, an effective demand
management and a more diversified import source base. Exports are estimated to have grown by
35 percent in2006, compared to 24 percent in2005, whereas imports grew by 23.4 percent in2006
and 0.5 percent in2005.

2.11        Fiscal policy has been consistent with macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. In
2005, despite strong revenues and prudent spending, the fiscal deficit (including grants) reached
6.3 percent o f GDP, mainly reflecting delays in the disbursement o f budget grants. In 2006, the
fiscal deficit stood at 5 percent o f GDP reflecting strong revenue performance from both income
and value added (VAT) taxes as well as greater control of expenditures. Estimations for 2007
indicate that the fiscal deficit will stand at around 0.7 percent. Quarterly accounts for 2007 show
that tax revenues grew faster than projected. Expenditure commitments were closely monitored
and controlled, with expenditures evolving in line with budget ceilings. In addition, the 2008
Budget Law suggests that the fiscal policy stance will remain firm with recurrent spending
declining as a share o f GDP as a result o f a reduction (as percentage o f GDP) o f wages and
~alaries,~ goods and services.
            and

2.12       Nevertheless fiscal risks persist. The major source o f fiscal risks is Electra, the para-statal
Water and Electricity Company. There are several reasons that underpin its critical financial
situation: lack o f investments, difficulties with billing collection especially from municipalities,
and tariff setting below costs. Its under-pricing structure was exacerbated when direct subsidies to
Electra were eliminated (April 27, 2006) and the tariffs increase for water and electricity which
took place inJune 2006, were insufficient to compensate for the increase inthe price o f fuel. As a
result, in September 2007, Electra's treasury difficulties filed a request for an urgent payment o f
the tariff deficit for the period May 2006-February 2007, amounting to 550 CVE million (US$6.3
million).* Inearly April 2008, ARE published a regulation that sets a new tariff base (a long time
request from Electra) that will take into consideration efficiency levels, investment costs, and
operational costs, among others. However, the publication o f the new regulation has produced no
results as tariffs (water and electricity) have not been revised. Furthermore, petroleum products'
prices were adjusted inMarch 2008, producing immediate implications for the utility tariffs (water
and electricity) as its tariff formula is indexed to petroleum products' prices. Nevertheless, no

  'Hiring andpromotions have beenfrozen untilthe revision o fthe Career and Salary SystemPlan(with the exception
  o f the Health, Education, Social Protection and Security sectors).
  8This amount does not appear in the budget because, as o f April 2006, oil subsidies were eliminated and therefore
  no provision inthe budget was included.

adjustment took place and thus tariff deficit is accruing again. Therefore, even though there i s a
clear policy o f not subsidizing oil-related products (the budget does not provide for those) since
April 2006, subsidies do exist, but are not recorded in the budget. As a result, the current fiscal
position i s understated, and the budget does not provide adequate support for planningcurrent year
spendingagainst current year resources. Fiscal risks that emerge from the energy sector have been
at the center o fthe IMFprogram (PSI). Underthe Letter o f Intent and Memorandum o f Economic
andFinancialPolicies for the thirdPSIreview(dated November 29,2007) the authorities made the
commitment to implement three measures (two structural assessment criteria and one benchmark)
related to the energy sector: (i)   finalize and publish the mechanism for setting base utility tariffs;
(ii) applythemechanismforsettingandadjustingelectricity, water,andfuelprices,and(iii)
     fully
finalize and publish a revised mechanism for adjusting petroleum price^.^              Up to now only
assessment criteria (i)  has beenmet.

2.13       The Government has implementeda number o fmeasures to reduce fiscal risks ingeneral.
These measures include: (i) o f a macroeconomic policy unit to strengthen the formulation
                               creation
o f fiscal policy in the context o f the overall macroeconomic policy objectives; (ii)      creation of a
sub-unit (under the Treasury unit) to follow-up on state participations in companies; (iii)
introduction of a formal mid-year review o f fiscal developments in order to assess revenue,
expenditure and financing developments against projections, and if necessary take timely
corrective actions; and (iv) monitoring of budget executions through SIGOF o f Autonomous
Institutes and municipalities."     With regard to the energy sector and Electra specifically, the
Government recognizes the urgency o f improving the technical and financial position o f the
company and to that end is: (i)seeking financing for the most needed investments; (ii)
strengthening regulation; and (iii) solutions to reduce Electra's commercial losses. More
                                       seeking
specifically, the authorities are taking the following measures: (a) purchasingequipments that will
allow cheaper petroleum products as input; (b) creating a logistics company that will handle
importation, storage and inter-islanddistribution o f oil products, thus increasing efficiency and
reducingtransaction costs; and (c) improving billpayments.

2.14       The recent increase in international food prices has not yet had an impact on domestic
prices, owing to the large stocks of cereals. As these stocks are reduced, prices may increase, but
this i s not likely to threaten fiscal or external stability in the short term given the fiscal space and
comfortable level o f international reserves. The price increase could however affect vulnerable
groups. The Council o f Ministers has recently approved a package of measures to mitigate the
impact o f possible future increases, which includes the elimination of international trade taxes and
VAT on cereals, improvements inimportation efficiency, andincrease inthe amount and coverage
o f the non-contributory pension (from CVE 3150 to CVE 3500). Authorities anddonors, including
the World Bank and IMF, will continue monitoring closely the developments in this area. In
addition, the Bank will help the authorities to simulate the poverty impact o f this shock across
different groups, so as to identify furthermitigationmeasures.

2.15      In July 2006, the IMF approved the request of the government for a three-year Policy
Support Instrument (PSI). The PSI is designed to support the government's economic objectives
and policy framework for 2006-2009. This program focuses on measures to reduce

macroeconomic risks, provide a margin o f safety against exogenous shocks and address the
prospects o f a longer-term decline in highly concessional external support. The third PSI review
was successfully completed inDecember 2007.

MacroeconomicOutlook andDebtSustainability

2.16      The medium term outlook (2008-2010) is optimistic (see Table 2.1.). According to the
most recent projections, the GDP growth i s expected to stand at 7.5 percent on average over the
period 2008-2010. Growth i s projected to be led by private investment in tourism, public
investment ininfrastructure, and private consumption. Inflationis expected to stabilize at around 2
percent consistent with the currency peg.

2.17      The current account deficit is expected to widen, as a result o f the increase inimports for
capital formation and tourism. Projections indicate that current account deficit, as a percent o f
GDP, may reach 15 percent in2010. The increase inimports of investment goods will be largely
driven by the FDIinflows, which are expectedto remain above 10 percent o f GDP inthe coming
years andto gradually decline afterwards as the investmentboom weakens. Onthe other hand, it is
expected that remittances will decline as a percentage o f GDP as income inCape Verde grows and
ties with the diaspora becomes looser. Furthermore, it i s expected that external aid will decrease
over time as the economy grows and social indicators improve.

2.18     It is expected that fiscal policy will continue to be dominated by fiscal prudence.
Preliminaryprojections indicate that the fiscal deficit (including grants) will continue to decline as
percentage o f GDP, reaching 2.4 in 2010. Revenues are expected to continue growing fuelled by
the strong economic growth and improvements in tax administration. The expenditures are
expected to be constrained. Improvements inpublic expenditure management will also contribute
for further control inexpenditures.

2.19      Significant progress has been achieved with debt sustainability management. The share o f
total central government net debt and guarantees to GDP started to decline in 2005, and has been
declining sharply since then. It fell to 77 percent o f GDP in2006, down from 87 in2005, owing to
the rapid GDP growth and prudent fiscal stance. The domestic debt-to-GDP ratio was reduced
from 33 in2005 to 19.7 percent in2007, two years ahead o f the PSI schedule. An analysis of the
sustainability o f Cape Verde's public debt carried out in December 2007 concluded that, despite
the likely gradual reduction in access to concessional loans, all external debt indicators would
remain below the relevant thresholds under the baseline and alternative scenarios. The most
extreme scenario is a hypothetical 30 percent devaluation o f the exchange rate in2008. It causes a
one-off increase o f 7 percent o f GDP inthe NPV o f the debt to GDP ratio. Eveninthis scenario,
the external debt ratios remain below the threshold. In sum, the debt sustainability analysis
concluded that the risk o f debt distress i s low.

                                         POVERTY        REDUCTION   STRATEGY (2005-07)

Government's ProgramObjectivesandProposedMeasures

2.20       Cape Verde's GPRSP-I (2005-2007) built on a well-articulated set of strategies and
priorities that address Cape Verde's main development challenges. The priorities o f the
Government were along five "pillars": (i)                 promoting good governance, reinforcing effectiveness
and guaranteeing equity; (ii)promoting competitiveness to foster economic growth and
employment creation; (iii)developing and upgrading human capital; (iv) developing the
infrastructures, promoting land use planning and protecting the environment; and (v) improving
the effectiveness and sustainability of the social security systems.

2.21       The first PRSC series and the proposed PRSC-4 support three o f the five pillars: Pillar I,
promoting good governance, reinforcing effectiveness and guaranteeing equity; Pillar III,
developing and upgrading human capital; and Pillar V, improving the effectiveness and
sustainability o f the social security systems. The next paragraphs present an overview o f the
Government's objectives andplannedmeasures inthe areas supported by the proposed PRSC-4.

PillarI PromotingGoodGovernance,ReinforcingEffectivenessandGuaranteeingEquity
         -

2.22       Under this first pillar, the Government aimed to improve governance by modernizing
Government procedures and institutions and by increasing its interface with citizens.
Accountability and equity were expected to be enhanced through more direct participation o f
citizens, better management practices for public finance and human resources, improvements in
tax policies, a firmer regulatory role in the economy, legal and judicial reform, simplified
administrative procedures, expanded use o f information technology (IT), and increased
decentralization o fresponsibilities andresources.

2.23       The main areas o f focus targeted by the Government to pursue this first pillar included
the reform o f public administration, the reform o f the financial management system and
decentralization. In the area o f public administration, the Government intended to implement



                                                             - 7 -

measures and reforms including: (i) modern technologies to improve efficiency, outreach
                                          using
and transparency o f public services, particularly important given the discontinuous geographical
setting; (ii)decentralization o f human resource management and implementation o f a merit-based
recruitment system; (iii)training public servants, in particular in the areas o f information and
communication technologies; and (iv) rationalizing public administration structures. Furthermore,
the Government intended to reform the State's financial system by implementing the Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR) action plans. More specifically, the CFAA action plan focused on: (i)controlling
contingent expenditure by completing a cross-debt analysis and elaborating a plan for the
settlement o f arrears; (ii)improving budget planning andpreparing the MediumTerm Expenditure
Framework (MTEF); (iii)      expanding the tax base by identifying the tax payers and improving tax
administration; (iv) improving budget execution and reportingby de-concentrating the expenditure
commitments and liquidation process through IT to line Ministries and by instituting the quarterly
preparation o f accounts; and (v) improving the impact o f external and internal controls by
submittingthe executedbudgetto Parliamentintime andbyredefining andstrengthening the court
o f auditors (TdC) and the General Inspectorate for Finances (IGF). The CPAR action plan
recommended the adoption o f a National Procurement Code and the launch o f a regulatory
function. With regardto decentralization, the GPRSP-I plannedthe approval o f a new law defining
the attributions and competencies o f the municipalities and the revision o f the law that established
the criteria for the distribution o fthe financial equilibrium fund (FEF).

PillarI11 DevelopingandUpgradingHumanCapital
           -

2.24      Underthis pillar, the Government intended to improve the healthstatus o fthe population.
Mindfulo fincreasing costs, the Government's sectoral reform strategy focused on an expansion of
the network o f health facilities, limiting treatment overseas by improving local alternatives,
improving human resource management through decentralization, strengthening the health
information system, and reinforcing citizen participation in health promotion and disease
prevention.

2.25      The GPRSP-I identified the following measures for the health sector as the drivers for
poverty reduction: (i)expansion o f the network o f health facilities particularly in the rural areas;
(ii)limitation inthe number ofthe treatment overseasby training specialists andimproving
infrastructure; (iii)increase in the capacity o f planningby improving health information systems;
(iv) preparation o f a strategy for non-communicable diseases, and (v) reinforcement o f the
population's participation inthe health promotion and disease prevention.

Pillar V Improvingthe Effectivenessand Sustainabilityof the Social ProtectionSystems
         -

2.26      Under this pillar, the Government planned to focus on curbing the increasing income
inequality as well as reforming the existing social protection schemes to ensure sustainability and
broaden coverage. Specifically, the Government's reform strategy sought to: (i) from a focus
                                                                                   move
on ex-post assistance to increased attention to risk mitigation and prevention measures; and (ii)
decentralize and contract out service delivery inline with the broader reform underway.

2.27      The GPRSP-I identified five mainmeasuresto achieve the goals set up for the fifthpillar:
(i)develop institutionalcapacity insocial protection; (ii)strengthen andextendprograms that

security.

ResultsAchievedsince the Inceptionofthe FirstPRSCSeries

2.28       The outcome matrix for the first PRSC series was drawn from government strategies
identified inthe GPRSP-I. The Annual Progress Report for the GPRSP-I (July 2006) provided an
update on the implementation o f the GPRSP-I. Overall, implementation i s progressing well.
Amongthe most important achievements so far, it is worth mentioningthe following:

2.29       Support for Priority Sectors: Budget execution i s in line with the benchmarks for social
sectors (health and education) stated in the GPRSP-I(see Table 2.2) and amounts even surpassed
the benchmarks for both sectors inthe four years of its implementation.

2.30       Control Contingent liabilities: A cross-debt study" that took place in 2004 identified 5.9
billions o f net debt o f the central government. This study was revised in 2005 (with regard to the
central government debt) and a plan was prepared, whereby the government agreed to settle CVE
4.8 billion (approximately 5.5 percent of the GDP) through a four-year plan, beginning in 2006.
Furthermore, to prevent accumulation o f arrears (usually related to contingent liabilities) several
actions have been undertaken: (i)publication of the adjustment mechanism for water and
electricity;12 (ii) creation of a sub-unit under the Treasury unit to follow-up state participations in
companies; and (iii)     inter-connection between autonomous institutes and ministries (and some
municipalities) through the Integrated Financial Management System (SIGOF) enabling the
Budget and Treasury units to follow their budget execution and take measure if necessary inorder
to prevent liabilities from autonomous institutes from being passed on to the central government.

2.31       Medium term planning and budget preparation: Two draft laws have been sent to
Parliament: (i)   the budget framework law; and (ii)the budget planning law (which was latter


  11It analyzedthe debt between CentralGovernment, municipalities, autonomous institutes, andpara-statals.

withdrawn from the Parliament). Capacity in preparing global and sectoral MTEFs has slowly
beenbuilt across ministries (with international technical assistance). Following the preparation o f
global MTEFs in 2004, sectoral MTEFs were initiated, even though at different paces because o f
uneven capacity levels within the ministries. The authorities are currently preparing the second
global MTEF.

2.32       Budget execution and reporting: The IT-based Financial Management System (FMS) is
now connecting all the Ministries, allowing them to monitor their accounts in real-time - a very
impressive achievement. Furthermore, the deconcentration of the budget execution started in2007.
Line ministries can commit and liquidate through SIGOF. In 2008 the deconcentration was
extended to Institutes. The Government finalized the 1998-2005 state general accounts, thus
clearing the backlog. The 2006 accounts, which by law should have been submittedto Parliament
by end 2007, were submitted to Parliament in March 2008.13 Quarterly accounts are prepared
timely andhavebeensubmittedto Parliamenton aregularbasis since 2004.

2.33       Management and Control of Tax Proceeds: The identification o f the income tax payers i s
completed. Reforms intax administration also include the end of the agreement with B C A as the
sole tax c~llector.'~     This has provided tax payers with more payment options and is expected to
reduce revenue foregone.

2.34       Cash management: Goodprogress has beenachieved regarding cash management. A new
cash management plan has been developed in coordination with the Operational Nucleus for
Information Systems (NOSI). Cash flow forecasts will be prepared for the fiscal year and will be
updated monthly on the basis o f actual cash inflows and outflows.

2.35       DebtManagement: Since 1996the Treasury department (DGT) has hadspecific software
to register public debt, but only started usingit effectively after 2004. The software already allows
the estimation o f the service debt payments, generating quarterly information. In addition, it
contributes to the budgetpreparationprocess givenits integration with SIGOF. The Authorities are
not yet conducting debt sustainability analysis, for which they have received training, because the
software is not operational yet. At present, only DGT has access to the software and the debt is not
registered interms o f accounting.

2.36       Internal and External Audits: A new organic Law for the IGFwas approved in2005 and
a draft law that strengthens that mandate o fthe TdC i s inthe Parliamentfor discussion.

Decentralization

2.37       Legal Framework: The revision o fthe Local Finances Law has substantially increased the
amount o f resources transferred to local governments on the basis o f a formula - increase of 60
percent from 2005 to 2006 - which i s positive as formula-based transfers are the least prone to

  l3 Difficulties in closing the 2006 accounts emerged from the fact that the 2006 Budget was approved in August
  2006 (because it was an election year), and therefore until that date, the budget was executed on the basis o f the
  2005 budget.
  l4Until2006 BCA was the only tax collector andretained 1percent ofthe taxes collected. During the first semester
  o f 2006 agreements were signed with other institutions whereby a flat rate o f 200 to 300 ECV per collection was
  defined as the remuneration for their services. Since May 2007, BCA also receives a flat rate, with retroactive
  effects dated July 2006.

political interference and ensure some predictability of the proceeds. Furthermore, following
extensive discussions on the strategic approach to decentralization, the Council o f Ministers
approved inNovember 2007 the Framework Law on Decentralization, which has been submitted
to parliament and i s expected to be approved after the local elections, scheduled for May 18,2008.

2.38      Introducing IT systems at the Municipality level: NOSI developed a modern tool -
"Municipal Information System" (SIM) - to strengthen municipal management capacity (including
tax collection) and communication between the central level and the municipalities, and between
municipalities.

PublicAdministration

2.39      Civil Service Reform: Cape Verde's administration has now completed the integration o f
the recently updated personnel database with the payroll, an important achievement that will
ensure data consistency and monthly reconciliation o f processes. The easily accessible updated
data was used as the basis to elaborate civil service reform options. The new Basic law on civil
service (Lei de Buses du FunqCo Pziblicu) was approved by the Council o f Ministers in January
2008. However, its submission to the parliamenthas been delayed to ensure that the accompanying
secondary legislation and fiscal impact assessment o f wage reform implementation i s first
completed. The Government i s experiencing problems with the design o f secondary legislation on
the Career and Salary System (PCCS), due to resistance from interest groups inthe administration,
as well as o f limited capacity for conducting fiscal impact assessment, which has resulted in an
incomplete and so far inadequate impact assessment document. The Government has undertaken
the task to hire an international expert to support the local team in improving the impact
assessment document.

2.40      State Reform: The State Reform Coordination Unit (UCRE), created under the Ministry
for the Chairmanship o f the Council o f Ministers, State Reform and Defense, has finalized its
report on the rationalization o f the State, which has been validated by the Commission for the
Rationalization o f the State (CRE). Following its adoption, the Prime Minister has adopted a
resolution for the first phase o f its implementation, focusing on rationalizing the central structures
o f line ministries (includingthe creation o f a mandatory structure, the integrated office o f Budget,
Organization and Management), the re-definition of the institutional status o f four research
institutions, strengthening the inspection system and de-concentrating budget and humanresources
management to the line ministries.

2.41      E-Government: One o f the main successes o f public sector reform in Cape Verde lies
with the embrace o f ITby the country's public administration. The e-government initiative, under
the auspices o f the NOSI, launched many activities with a direct impact on citizens and business.
Achievements under this initiative include (i)functioning integrated financial management and
                                                 a
information system; (ii)an integrated human resources database and payroll; (iii)financial
management systems installed inthe largest municipalities; (iv) revamping o f the tax registry; and
(v) reengineeringo f various administrative processes to create a single-window for the most used
services.

Pillar I11 Developing and Upgrading Human Capital
           -

2.42      Improve health information systems: The Ministry o f Health completed a situation
analysis o f the Health Information System in April 2005. Since 2004, reliable health statistics
reports are publishedon a yearly basis, providing accurate data upon which to build the specific
technical reforms needed in the sector, as well as to facilitate monitoring o f GPRSP-I
implementation.

2.43      Health financing: The INPS i s implementing its medium-term strategy with success,
incorporating 14,000 civil servants under its health insurance scheme, expanding its coverage
through the creation o f special coverage systems (regimes especiais), controlling pharmaceutical
costs, reducing reimbursement for certain medical specialties, and monitoring membership o f
beneficiaries. As a result, the health debt has been cleared with an ECV 36 million and 26 million
positive balance respectively in2005 and2006.

Pillar V Improving the Effectiveness and Sustainability of the Social Security Systems
          -

2.44      Improve coverage and management o f non-contributory systems: The harmonization,
modernization and unification o f the two non-contributory pension systems have been completed.
A unifiedManagement Information System (MIS) database is active, new digital ID cards have
been issued, the revisedpoverty map was used to allocate additional pensions by municipality, and
a National Pension Center i s operational. The rationalization o f the system has made it possible to
increase the numbero fbeneficiaries from 14,446 in2005 to 18,343 in2007.

2.45      Improve planning and management instruments: A Social Services Map (Carta Social)
was elaborated and i s accessible through the web. The Map contains information on coverage and
utilization o f all social service centers and represents a critical first step toward the development o f
service norms.

2.46      Protection o f children's rights: Laws and regulations concerning minors have been
revised and an overarching Statute for Children and Adolescents has been drafted. At the same
time, committees for the defense o f children rights have been set up in all municipalities, and
collaborationwith NGOs strengthened.

2.47      Food Security: A food security survey was carried out in 2005 and will provide the
baseline for monitoring at the municipal level, as envisaged in the Food Security Strategy
approved in 2004. This survey identified food insecure households and could therefore be used to
help targeting interventions to address the impact o f rising food prices. Also, a National Council
for Food Security was created in August 2005, representing an important step towards a more
coordinated approach to cope with food insecurity. Inaddition, a National Food Security Program
for 2007-11was approved, but its operationalization i s facing some challenges.

2.48      Buildingon the lessons learnt andthe results achieved inthe first PRSC series, the policy
dialogue and the results-based framework o f the PRSC-4 focus on: (i)public expenditure
management reforms; (ii)        civil service reform and decentralization; (iii) monitoring and
                                                                                     the
evaluation system; (iv) capacity to deal with non-communicable diseases; (v) management o f
health human resources and financial sustainability o f health services; (vi) decentralization and



                                                   -12-

rationalization o f service delivery; and (vii) social protections schemes, particularly for disabled
people. As indicated in paragraph 1.2, the PRSC-4 i s a transitory operation between the first and
the second PRSC series. The latter will support the implementation o f the GPRSP-11. The GPRSP-
I1isbasedbroadly onthe same five pillars as the GPRSP-Iwith a stronger emphasis on the role o f
infrastructure and private sector development as the main drivers for growth and poverty
reduction. As a result, the second PRSC series i s expected to shift the focus towards infrastructure
andprivate sector development.

                                         TO                              STRATEGY

3.1       The thrust o f the Bank's FY05-08 assistance strategy for Cape Verde is to: (i) the         assist
country in implementing its poverty reduction strategy; and (ii) improve aid effectiveness by
                                                                          to
shiftingthe form o fassistancetowardsprogrammatic support and sharpeningfocus onresults. The
first PRSC series (PRSCs 1-3) and this stand alone PRSC are central to the CAS, accounting for
about 60 percent o f proposed IDA lending over four years. This emphasis on programmatic
lendingis consistent with Cape Verde's performance in implementing the activities supported by
the previous CAS, its level o f institutional, economic and political development, its strong and
sustained performance in recent years, and the recommendations o f core diagnostic work (PER,
CFAA and CPAR). The CAS deems the PRSC to be a strategic lending instrument to: (i)                     provide
predictable resource flows, particularly important given Cape Verde's reliance on donor financing;
(ii) strengthen public administration and public expenditure management systems, with spillover
benefits to non-IDA resources; and (iii) harmonize donors and reduce the potential distortions
                                           help
and transaction costs o f external assistance. Furthermore, this operation (as well as the first PRSC
series) will contribute to the following outcomes o f the current CAS: (i)       improved transparency o f
public expenditure, and empowerment o f oversight institutions; (ii)clarified framework for
municipalities; (iii)improved ability to manage public sector reform across institutions; and (iv)
improved sustainability, access andquality o fhealth services.

                    B.       COORDINATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHERDONORS

3.2       Budget support in Cape Verde has been catalytic for donor harmonization around key
policy measures and results. Six donors15 are now part o f the Budget Support Group. They have
signed with the Government a Memorandum o f Understandingentitled "Partnership Framework
between Budget Support Partners and the Government of Cape Verde for the provision o f Budget
Support". The Group consists o f IDA, the European Union (EU), the Africa Development Bank,
andthe Austrian, the Dutchand Spanish Cooperations. These donors conductjoint reviews twice a
year, which allow for consensus-building and the reduction o f transaction costs for the
Government. To facilitate and strengthen coordination, the Government and the donors have
recently developed a joint, streamlined matrix, which i s used as a basis for discussions and
disbursement in the donors' respective operations. All Bank prior actions are part o f the joint
matrix document (see Annex 1).

3.3       The PRSC has been prepared in close coordination with IMF staff and the IMF PSI
reviews. The PSI focus, inter alia, on supporting the exchange rate peg, creating fiscal space,
strengthening public sector management, and addressing fiscal risks. Ina number of areas where
the PSI and this operation overlap, the work is beingclosely coordinated to ensure that consistent
advice is provided to the authorities.

                         c.      RELATIONSHIPTOOTHERBANKOPERATIONS

3.4       The use o f the PRSC instrument has allowed the Bank to consolidate its lending
operations and engage in policy and technical dialogue in three o f the five GPRSP-I pillars, on
governance, human development, and social protection.         This focus complements the support
provided by the Bank through ongoing investment operations, notably projects in energy,
transports (roads), private sector development and HIV/AIDS.

                                       D.      LESSONSLEARNED

3.5       The following lessons are drawn from the experience o f the three previous PRSCs and
have been taken into account inpreparingthe proposed operation:

     (a) EnhanceGovernmentownershipand donor coordinationthrough the use of budget
          support. As a small country with many donors, Cape Verde's public sector can be
          overwhelmed with aid coordination demands and its staffing patterns disrupted through
          the creation o f multiple project units. PRSCs have been instrumental in improving
          Government ownership and donor harmonization and coordination,                 sharpening
          Government's ownership for reforms and focus on setting priorities and strengthening
          intra-government coordination and reducing the burden o f multiple monitoring systems.
          The M o U signed between the six donors providing budget support, the scheduling o f
         joint missions, andthe use o f ajoint matrix have resulted inreduced transaction costs and
          distortions o f internationalassistance.

     (b) Better link sectoral and cross-cutting issues. In shifting from a sectoral investment
         project focus to the PRSC, the ability to embed sector policy within cross-cutting issues -
         including decentralization, improved expenditure management, and civil service reform-
         can increase the sustainability and impact o f service delivery.

     (c) Findways to providetechnical assistance at short noticefor capacity building. The
         shift to budget support has meant that there i s limited access to short-term consultancies
         or technical assistance fkom the Bank side during credit preparation, because
         administrative procedures for the traditional Bank preparation trust hnd (PHRD) are too
         slow in light o f the short span o f a PRSC preparation cycle. Yet, achieving the results
         targeted by the PRSCs requires strengthening counterpart capacity. The World Bank, at
         the request o f the Government, will remain closely involved incapacity buildingthrough
         three main channels: (a) technical advice from members o f the core PRSC team; (b)
         financial support through relevant TA components o f existing projects; and (c) a PRSP
         Trust Fund.Another positive outcome o fthe creationo fthe Budget Support Group is that
         it allows for coordinated technical assistance from donors; for instance, the European
         Union i s financing long-term technical assistance requested during the missions. Hence,

          complementary analytical work or financial support from other donors i s also being
          coordinated with the Bank activities.


                                E.      ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

3.6       The analytical foundations o f the PRSC have focused on the adequacy: (i)f government
                                                                                          o
policies and institutions for adequately targeting poverty reduction; and (ii)o f systems and
procedures for effectively channeling resources to support these strategies. The PRSC design has
been informed by the conclusions and recommendations o f core ESW, including two PERs, a
CFAA, a CPAR, a DPR and a PovertyAssessment. The mainconclusions o f this analytical work
were the basis for the design o f the reform program supported by the proposed PRSC.              For
example, the public expenditures agenda was designed on the basis of the high priority actions
identified in the 2003 and 2006 PER and CFAA action plan. Besides the core assessment that
informed the design o f the PRSC series, other analytical pieces - prepared by IDA, the
Government or other donors - continue to inform the program, such as the study on fuel subsidies
conducted as part o f the 2006 PER, or the analysis o f the likelihood o f achieving the MDGs
prepared by the Government with assistance from the UNDP. Table 3.1 presents the current status
ofthese key analyticalunderpinnings.

                                     A. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES

4.1       The proposed Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-4) supports the last year
o f implementation of Cape Verde's first Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRSP-I). This
one-tranche operation will be a transitory one between the first andthe second series. The policy
dialogue and a results-based framework under PRSC-4 focus on the following pillars o f the
GPRSP-I: (i) promote good governance; (ii) develop human capital; and (iii) improve the
              to                                  to                                     to

effectiveness and sustainability o f the social protection system. Like the first PRSC series (PRSCs
1-3), the proposedPRSC-4 supports a small and strategic subset o f the GPRSP-Ipolicy andreform
agenda. The proposed operation builds up on the first PRSC series and aims at addressing the
reforms proposed under the GPRSP-I that were still to be completed at the inception o f the
operation or that had emergedas priorities for the Government.

4.2        The PRSC-4 is embedded in the three year Joint Matrix covering the period 2007-2009
andagreeduponinMay 2007 by Government anddonors. Basedon experience over the past three
years, the matrix i s prepared along two principles: (i)simplification (fewer triggers, fewer
activities); and (ii) harmonization (common matrix shared by donors). The next sections discuss
the rationale for the selection o f the PRSC-4 prior actions and identify possible actions that the
Government intendsto undertake in2008 as they result from the Joint Matrix.

4.3        The development policy objectives of the PRSC-4 are summarized below (details are
presented inthe following sections):

      (d) Promote good governance: throughpublic expendituremanagement reforms, civil service
          reform and decentralization, andimprovement inthe monitoring and evaluation system.
      (e) Develop human capital, with a focus on health: strengthen capacity to deal with non-

Public Expenditure Management Reforms

4.4       The government reform agenda i s based on the assessments o f the 2003 CFAA, 2003
PER, 2006 PER and CPAR. Together, these analytical pieces provide a comprehensive overview
o f the critical weaknesses in the public expenditure management system. Following the 2003
CFAA, an action plan focusing on comprehensiveness and transparency o f budget and financial
accountability i s being implemented by a CFAA Unit with the support o f the Netherlands, the EU
and the Bank. The key issues o f the Government reform agenda affecting public expenditure
management, on which this operation focuses, are the following:

4.5       Clearance o f the stock o f arrears: Of the stock o f arrears recognized in 2005 (CVE 4.8
billion, approximately 5.5 percent o f the GDP) approximately 60 percent have been cleared (as o f
December 2007). The 2008 budget includes a provision o f CVE 1,289 million, which if hlly
executed will reduce the outstanding stock to 16 percent. According to the plan for the settlement,
all arrears will be cleared by 2009 and no new arrears will be created. Several actions are being
undertaken to prevent the accumulation o f new arrears: (i)      the treasury will seek to clear arrears
more rapidly if extraordinary revenues materialize; (ii)      adequate budgetary allocation are being
made for goods and services; (iv) as o f 2007, November 30 has been instituted as the deadline for
committing expenditure; and (v) measures have been taken to control contingent liabilities - as

discussed in the macro section - (in the past accumulation o f arrears emerged largely from
materialization o f contingentliabilities).l6


4.6        Budget execution and reporting: A new public accounting system has been designed and
approved but not yet implemented. The new chart o f accounts (PNCP) i s expected to start being
implemented in 2009. The PNCP will be used not only for the State budget, but also for the
autonomous institutes and the municipalities. This new system will allow the Ministry o f Finance
and Public Administration to produce consolidated annual Government statements, including
information on revenues, expenditures and financial assetsAiabilities. It will establish a double-
entry accountancy system and enable the publication o fperiodical accountancy reports, which can
include the State position in all its dimensions - patrimonial and extra-patrimonial, operational,
financial and budgetary. Delays with the implementation o f the PNCP are caused by difficulties
with the assets' assessment methodology (to allow for the full implementation o f the PNCP, the
definitiono f the assets assessment is required). The manual for asset evaluationwill be completed
by end-2008.

4.7        Internal controls: The publication o f the new organic diplomaof IGFin2005 empowered
General Inspectorate o f Finance (IGF). However, even though resources allocation has increased
since then, it has not addressedfully the larger financing needs that resulted from the enlargement
o f its scope o f work. The CFAA Implementation Unit has provided to IGF modem IT equipment
and connection to SIGOF to follow budget execution on real time. Training is required for the
efficient use o f these new instruments. Additional challenges in the internal control area include
the slow response o fthejudicial system, and the still recent and limited use o fperformance audits.

4.8        External controls: The draft o f the new Organic Law for the TdC has been discussed in
Parliament and is expected to be approved by July 2008. Once the law is approved and the
implementing decrees published, the mandate o f TdC will be strengthened improving significantly
the transparency and accountability o f public resources. The audits o f the 2001-2005 accounts
were completed in 2007, thus clearing the backlog. This impressive achievement was possible
thanks to external technical support financed by the EUand the World Bank (PRSP TF). The TdC
i s therefore current on auditing of the state accounts. It i s critical that in the future auditing will
take place intime, to ensure that the outcome o f the auditing can produce legal effects.

4.9        Procurement: The National Procurement Code was approved by the Parliament in July
2007, along with implementing decrees, and in March 2008 a decree-law established the
Procurement Regulatory Authority. According to the new procurement code, transactions will be
handled by a Procurement unit (UGA) within each key ministry and controlled by the Court of
Auditors for contracts above US$50,000. Below this threshold, there i s no clear and efficient
mechanism to ensure internal control ofcontracts awarded byUGA.

  PublicSector ReformandDecentralization

  4.11 Cape Verde's public administration has been able to deliver quality services for several
  decades. Still, in a country setting where insularity adds specific challenges to responsive
  service delivery, citizens continue to perceive the public administration as inefficient. Moreover,
  sustainability i s at stake ina context where the overall wage bill represents around 12 percent of
  GDP, and more importantly, more than 30 percent of public expenditure." The keys issues on
  civil service and decentralization are:

  Public Sector Reform

  4.12     Law on civil service: The revised law on civil service (Lei de Bases da Funq6o Publica)
  was approved by the Council of Ministers inJanuary 2008. The law introduces major changes:
  (a) the creation o f a consultative commission; (b) the restriction o f a career-based civil service
  for top management positions, all other positions being governed by the labor law; (c) stricter
  conditions for entry into the civil service (with a minimum degree o f "licenciatura'8", longer
  probationperiod, etc.) and for promotions; (d) the introduction o f an evaluation system based on
  clear work programs; and (e) introduction of "mission letters", and a system to manage
  redundant personnel. For the difficult issue o f redundant personnel, a decree and program
  encouraging mobility and other ways to deal with this staff i s being designed."

  4.13    Revision o f the PCCS: While progress i s beingmade on the definition o f a new pay and
  grading structure, concerns remain over the lack of clarity on key aspects and on the fiscal

 both through positive (subsidies) and negative (reduction inwage after 6 months o fbeing inthe `reserve') incentives

impact o f the reform. The current fiscal impact assessment is partial and does not provide the a
cost analysis for the broad reform package. It has been limited to the assessment o f impact o f
 establishing a core professional group o f civil servants (approximately 570 staff), without
calculating the impact on the wages o f the other public servants, whose wage development
would be linked to this core group. Furthermore, the last version o f the draft o f the PCCS
indicates that the number o f wage supplements and the number o f "quadros privativos" will
 increase. The overall reform package might not be fiscally viable, as the wage reform package
 for the 570 core civil servants would require an approximately 35 percent increase intheir wage
 level. Whereas the number i s likely to be smaller for the public service as a whole, due to the
 skewed design o f the reform,20 the fact that the core group i s used as a reference group for other
professional cadres might still generate a large wage bill increase. Finally, the current approach
 entails serious risks in that the impact on the budget o f municipalities (which employ
 approximately 25 percent o f all civil servants) has not been assessed. Inview o f the impending
 local elections, and the installation o f new local governments, this could have negative
 implications on the ability o f local governments to function effectively. The government has
 expressed its commitment to widen the scope o fthe fiscal impact assessment (which thus far had
been limited to the assessment o f impact o f the upgrading o f wages o f a small core group o f
professionals) and to reconsider the number o f wage supplements as well as to attempt to keep
the number o f"quadros privativos2'" to a minimum.

4.14      Payroll Management: The civil servants database was hlly validated and integrated with
payroll. The database i s currently functioning at the central level (the State Secretariat for Public
Administration manages the humanresource components and the General Directorate for Public
Accounting the salary component) and i s gradually being de-concentrated to the line ministries.
Thus far data entry and base wage calculation have been de-concentrated, but other human
resources processes remain centralized. Meanwhile, the government has published for the first
time a "Profile o f Public Employees" (in print and on the Government website) which is an
important step inincreasing transparency and strengthening monitoring.

4.15      State Reform and state restructuring: With the creation o f a Ministry for the
Chairmanship o f the Council o f Ministers, State Reform and Defense (following the 2006
legislative elections), the Government sent a strong signal in favor o f reform coordination. The
State Reform Coordination Unit, created under this Ministry, has finalized its report on the
Rationalization o fthe State, which has been validatedby the Commission for the Rationalization
o f the State (CRE). Following its adoption, the Prime Minister has adopted a resolution for the
first phase o f its implementation, which has been initiated and is progressing in a satisfactory
manner. The key elements include the rationalization o f central administrative structures,
including: (i)   the creation o f integrated management and budget offices ineach ministry; (ii)                the
reorganization o f four research institutes including the integration o f INAG (administration and
management), INIDA (agriculture) and INDP (fisheries) in the National University o f Cape
Verde and the transformation o f INERF (rural engineering and forestry) in a joint stock
company; (iii)    the reform and strengthening o f inspectorates (including the creation o f a central


2oWages for the non-core grades inthe civil andpublic service would increase by inflation levels only, which means
that the impact on administrative level officials would be much smaller. However, the wages o f professional groups
inhealth, education and local government would still be linked to the core group, thus requiring similar levels o f
increases for these officials.

methodology and capacity buildingunit); and (iv) the de-concentration o f human resources and
budget management functions. Inaddition, island-level coordination structures will be created to
rationalize and improve public service delivery systems.

Decentralization

4.16   Decentralization: Decentralization o f responsibilities and resources to the municipalities
i s one o f the key vehicles chosen by the Government to improve service delivery.          Local
governance in Cape Verde has proven dynamic, with hotly contested municipal elections and
numerous local development initiatives - many o f them through decentralized cooperation
arrangements. However, discrepancies in size and revenue potential o f municipalities are very
high. The Local Finances Law, adoptedin2005, ledto anincrease inthe formula-based transfer
for recurrent expenditures. Some municipalities are also using the new possibility o f accessing
credit from private banks. However, the absence o f an overall legal and regulatory
decentralization framework cause limitations on the coordination between municipal, central and
deconcentrated government activities.

4.17   Basic framework law on decentralization: Following broad based discussions with
political parties, municipalities, civil society and decentralization experts, the Government has
developed a national vision o f decentralization which will not include political regionalization
but will strengthenthe regions as well as inter-municipal cooperation. This ledto a revision o f
the draft o f the framework Law on Decentralization, which was approved in the Council o f
Ministers in November 2007. This text i s an important milestone in further implementing the
decentralization agenda. Main innovations o f this law are the following: the framework law sets
out the principles o f the architecture o f the state, which will be based on bottom up inter-
municipal cooperation and a strengthening o f the regions, without, however, leading to political
regionalization. The vision on strengthening the regions calls for further de-concentration, while
the municipal level will remain the main decentralized level o f government. The modalities o f
managing the de-concentrated level o f government are inthe process o f being defined. Together
with the revision o f the Local Finances Law, the Framework Law constitutes the basis for a new
management system for intergovernmental administrative and fiscal relations.

4.18   Municipal management capacity:           NOS1 developed a modem tool to strengthen
municipal management capacity (the Municipal Information System) which will enhance
communication between the central level and the municipalities, and between municipalities.
Financing has been secured for installing it in twelve municipalities.          Implementation i s
continuing, with the aim to complete the extension o fthe system to the remaining municipalities.

PRSC-4 prior actions

4.19   The proposed prior actions for PRSC-4 are:

       (a) Ministero f State Reform approves the diagnostic report on State restructuring; and
       (b) Council o f Ministers approves the draft Law on Civil Service (Lei de Bases da

4.20      The implementation of the GPRSP-I as well as the PRSC i s overseen by a Steering
Committee. Under the umbrella o f the Ministry o f Finance and Public Administration, all
ministries involved in the three GPRSP-I pillars supported by the PRSC (i.e. Finance, Public
Administration and Civil Service, Health, Labor and Solidarity) were involved in the
PRSC design, implementation andmonitoring.

4.21      The monitoring and evaluation program (M&E) o f the GPRSP-I built on the proposals
for an integrated national monitoring and evaluation system, the structure o f which i s shown in
Figure 4.1. Like the first PRSC series, the proposed PRSC aims at supporting a results-based M&E
system with the objective o f ensuringtimely access to relevant data in order to monitor progress,
evaluate the impact o f the poverty reduction strategy, and help define new orientations or make
changes based on analysis o f current data. Overall PRSC monitoring i s the responsibility o f the
STAD underthe General Directoratefor Planning.

4.22        Since the inception of the GPRSP-I, progress in the M&E system lagged behind, not
fulfilling   the expectations o f its original design. The slower than expected development and
implementation o f the M&E system can be largely explained by the improperly structured units,
inadequate management system, and de-motivated human resources. To signal the importance
given to M&E, Government and donors decided to include actions on this component in the
donors' joint matrix to elevate the importance o f this work as a Government priority (inthe case o f
the World Bank, these actions were included for the PRSC-2 and PRSC-3). As a result, M&E
started to receive increased attention. A household survey was carried out, a training program
started being implemented, active search for staffing o f STAD started, and the extension o f NOSI
was initiated.

4.23        This increased commitment led to progress on several fronts: the Government made
progress by launching the recruitment process to hire more STAD staff; providing continued
support for the completion o f the BDEO; and creating a Working Group for the Harmonization of
the M&E System (GHMES). The QUIBBsurvey was also completed in2006 and the results were
used to prepare the 2005 MDGs Report. Nonetheless, M&E implementation was still lagging in
mid-2007 at the time o f the design of the PRSC-4. The completion o f the platform with NOSI for
integrating M&E was behind schedule, andthe Government hadnot signed a protocol with NOSI,
thereby preventingNOSI from carrying out a number o f activities.22 In addition, the staffing o f
STAD remained in flux.             Delays in hiring three specialists (economist, statistician, and
programmer) were eventually overcome, but the recruitment of the coordinator was stalled. As a
result, Government and donors considered that monitoring and evaluation continued to be an
important component o f the policy dialogue under the Pillar I- Promote Good Governance.
Therefore, the PRSC-4 proposes to continue supporting actions in this area. The authorities have
identified two main priorities to advance inthis area: (i)       staffing STAD adequately so that this unit
can fulfill its mandate; and (ii) access to SIGOF to sectors, autonomous institutes and
                                       extend
STAD. Project informationhas been inserted inSIGOF thus allowing monitoring budget execution
andperformance. STAD's staff as well as sectoral staffthat deals with M&Ehas receivedtraining.

4.25      Compared to other countries in Africa, Cape Verde's coverage rate of health services at
73 percent i s good and the country is on track to achieve the MDGs. However, these good
indicators mask significant regional disparities that are based on an unsustainable financial
framework. The key issues o fthe Government reform agenda affectinghealth are the following:

4.26      Health outcomes and access to health services: Reliance on medical evacuations, both
within and outside o f the country, is necessary because o f the lack o f specialists and diagnostic
equipment inremote areas. Medical evacuation^^^ to Portugal have increased recently due to the
growing cases o f non-communicable diseases, with the consequent increase in evacuation costs
(4.8 percent o f the budget for health in 2007). There are inequities inhealth outcomes by island,
but access to health services does not account for all o f the disparities in such outcome.
Differencesinaccess to water, sanitation, and childnutrition are also important factors

4.27      Human resources: The problems with human resources limit the effectiveness of the
health system. These include: (i)        an insufficient number o f doctors, particularly specialists; (ii)
poor distribution o f staff, with about 75 percent o f doctors practicing inthe two central hospitals;
(iii)lackofincentivestomaximizepersonneldeployment, focusonthepoor,prioritizecertain
     a
services; and (iv) a growing number o f public sector doctors working in an unregulated private
sector, which could raise additional problems for access to health care particularly for the poor,
and contribute to the increase o f health care expenditures. A nationalhuman resource strategy for
the health sector was prepared in 2005 in collaboration with WHO to address these challenges.
Annual action plans should now be prepared in order to translate the strategy into effective
interventions, such as increasing the rate o f doctors andnurses per 10,000 inhabitants.

4.28      Increase innon-communicable diseases. Today the burdeno fnon-communicable diseases
significantly hinders economic growth. On average, men lose 13.6 years o f productive life and
women 11.3 years, due to chronic illnesses within an aging population. Health prevention and
promotion programs have to be introduced to impact on health expenditures in the future,
particularly for the poor who are less able to afford treatment. Participation o f the population in
health promotion and chronic diseases prevention remains a priority, to be achieved in part by
strengthening cooperation across sectors and with civil society organizations. To address the
increase innon-communicable diseases, the authorities prepared a situation analysis and a national
strategy, which was approved bythe Council o f Ministers inDecember 2007. Several interventions
are expected for 2008, including production o f clinical protocols for care o f high blood pressure,
diabetes, and rheumatic fever.

4.29      Health financing: Total Government health spendingis high, around US$70 per capita, o f
which about US$10 is provided by donors. This i s largely explained by (i)                   a weak allocative
efficiency o f the national health budget; and (ii)a very high and rapidly increasing rate o f
expenditures with the introduction o f new pharmaceuticals (because o f increases in demand, as
incomes improve, population ages and non-communicablediseases augment). A PERconducted in
2006 shed light on expenditures issues. One o f the main findings o f the PERi s that it is difficult to
undertake an efficiency analysis, because there is insufficient knowledge about all the resources

channeled to health (aid and other resources that are not included in the budget) and o f the
distribution o f human resources. Furthermore, significant disparities among islands were found
because the larger share o f expenditures is channeled to the central hospitals leaving the poorest
regions without enough funds. As a result, cost-effective interventions, such as neonatal care and
immunization, are lacking.

  PRSC-4prior action

  4.30    The proposedprior action for PRSC-4 is:

          (a) Strategy for non-communicable diseases is approved by the Council o fMinisters.

Other actionsplanned by the Governmentfor 2008 in the context of the agreedJoint Matrk

          (a) National Institute for Social Protection (INPS) transfers, recovery costs and revenues
              and international aid support are included in the Ministry o f Health and central
              hospitals budgets(2009 budget); and
          (b) The 2005-2010 immunization strategy is translated into key interventions aiming at
              increasing immunization coverage o f the whole population.

           E.      POLICY AREA 3: IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESSSUSTAINABILITY
                                                                      AND
                                OF THE SOCIAL PROTECTIONSYSTEM

4.31      Cape Verde has a relatively well developed social protection system for Africa, so the
pressing issues have mostly to do with reforms o f existing programs to increase efficiency, equity
and coverage, as well as to fill in specific gaps. Since the beginning o f the PRSC series,
considerable progress has been made, particularly concerning social security. A series o f reforms
has managed to harmonize and unify the non-contributory pension system, and a National Pension
Center now manages all non-contributory pensions using state-of-the-art tools. At the same time,
reforms to rationalize contributory social security have been undertaken, increasing long-term
financial sustainability and expanding coverage (see the health section). The reform o f the non-
contributory pension system constituted the main goal pursued under the previous PRSC series.
With that successfully achieved, the authorities are now focusing on decentralization of social
services, the continued modernization and rationalization o f social protection services, and the
provision o f appropriate services to disabled people in view o f their productive integration into
society. In addition, the policy dialogue has been expanded to include labor, as it is under the
mandate of the same Ministry and is linked to social protection. The main issues to be addressed
are summarized below.

4.32      Legal framework for decentralization o f social protection services: Social protection
services have been enjoying a certain level o f deconcentration for some time, but a clear legal
framework i s needed to improve efficiency and, especially, to clarify accountability at the
municipal level. A draft Decree Law regulating the legal and operational framework for social
protection services at the municipal level has been prepared, and updated framework agreements
(protocols) between the Ministry o f Labor Family and Solidarity (MLFS) and municipalities for
the provision o f decentralized social protection services have been prepared. Finalization,
however, i s contingent upon the adoption o f the Framework Law on Decentralization, a process



                                                 - 24 -

that has taken some time because of the political debate surrounding it. With the law approved by
the Council o f Ministers inNovember 2007, its final adoption by Parliament i s expected for 2008.
Approvalo ftheDecree Law bythe Council ofMinisters is expected shortlythereafter.

4.33      Planning, monitoring and evaluation of social protection services: As the volume and
variety o f services offered have increased, the targeting, monitoring and evaluation systems have
failed to keep up and are now largelyinappropriate, making adequate planning more difficult. For
example, central and municipalgovernments often contract with local associations and NGOs for
the day-to-day management and operation o f various social protection services, but no modem
system has been set up to monitor the performance and impact of these sub-contracted services.
Similarly, a system to update regularly the geo-referenced map o f social services (Carta Social)
preparedin2004 needs to be established, a task that should be made easier by the redefinition o f
central versus municipal level responsibilities envisaged above. Inaddition, the work o f the MLFS
appears to be significantly hampered by insufficient human resources. For example, two cadres
retiredfrom the GeneralDirection o f Social Solidarityandcannot be replaced, and there are only 7
labor inspectors, which far below the needs. Thus, while the Decree Law will facilitate strategic
and cost-effective partnerships for the delivery o f social protection services throughout the
country, the instruments for effective delivery are not always available.

4.34      Child Protection: The legal and institutional framework for child protection needs
updating and strengthening, and a participatory process toward this goal has been underway for
some time. The adoption by the Council o f Ministers of a new Code or Statute for Children and
Adolescents i s now expected in the second quarter o f 2008, accompanied by a preliminary
proposition (ante-projecto) for a new statute for the Cape Verdean Institute for Children and
Adolescents (ICCA). In the meantime, efforts to deconcentrate service delivery have resulted in
the establishment o f Municipal Committees for the Protection o f Children's Rights in all
municipalities. The Committees comprise representatives o f concerned stakeholders (e.g., police,
tribunal, health, municipal government), and their members have been trained by ICCA. The
challenge i s now to go beyond ad hoc committees and to establish a hlltime outreach service in
all islands.

4.35      Disability: Within the context o f the African decade o f the disabled, Cape Verde has
adopted a National Action Plan for Disabled People in November 2007. This plan constitutes a
significant departure from the old approach that treated the disabled mostly as passive recipients of
assistance, as it stresses the rights o f the disabled to be productive citizens. A Steering Committee
comprising public and private sector representatives has been set up and trained, and a smaller
ManagingCommittee has beencreated. These entities, however, are only consultativeand concrete
implementation will depend on the recruitment o f a hll-time Coordinator and successhl fund-
raising. It i s also noted that the government has not yet ratified International Labor Office (ILO)
Convention no. 159, an action that would trigger provision o f technical assistance by ILO. Among
the first concrete steps for the implementation o f the Plan will be teacher training on special
education issues which in turn should result in higher enrollment and retention rates for
handicapped children.

4.36      Labor: A new Labor Code was approved in October 2007, with a more comprehensive
approach covering additional groups (e.g., the whole maritime sector, domestic employees and
immigrants). Unfortunately, no corresponding implementation law (regulaqio) has been issued


                                                    -25 -

and therefore the new Code has not yet been applied. The Labor Inspectorate remains grossly
under-resourced, interms of staff (see above), means (e.g., no transport, no instruments to measure
risks) and information (no solid data, no electronic database). Given the steady economic growth,
it is o f concern that workers' protection appears to have been somewhat neglected. The full
application o f the Labor Code and a performing Labor Inspectorate are not only a matter of social
justice but also important instrumentsto prevent poverty and filfill the responsibilities o f a middle
income country such as Cape Verde.

  PRSC-4prior action

  4.37    The proposed prior action for PRSC-4 is:

          (a) National Action Plan for Disabled People is approved by Council o f Ministers and
              steering committee has beenestablished.

  Other actionsplanned by the Governmentfor 2008 in the context of the agreed Joint Matrix

          (a) Issue Decree Law regulating a normative and operational framework for social
              protection services at the municipal level; and
          (b) Continue the implementation o f the National Action Plan for Disabled according to
              schedule.
                            F. PRIORACTIONSFORTHEPROPOSEDPRSC-4

4.38      The matrix attached below lists the prior actions for the proposed PRSC-4 as detailed in
the sections above andtheir current status o fimplementation. These actions represent a sub-set o f
the Government program o f reforms detailed in the harmonized donors' joint matrix and in its
Letter of Development Policy (LDP, Annex 2). The rationale for their selection i s based on the
following considerations: (i)  they are deemed essential to the successhl implementation o f the
Government's reform program; (ii)the Bank has a comparative advantage in supporting the
Government in thee areas and/or support is not being provided by other donors; and (iii)          they
exclude areas where the dialogue with the government has matured, progress i s satisfactory or
Bank support is being provided through other instruments (such as for education and justice).
Compliance with these prior actions as defined inthe Financial Agreement forms the basis for IDA
to proceed with the proposedoperation.

4.39      The outcome indicators to which the operation will contribute are detailed in the joint
donors' matrix presented in Annex 1. These are identified in italics in this matrix, together with
baseline and target indicators. All outcome indicators for the proposed operationrefer to 2008.

                            5.      OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

                                A.       POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACT

5.1       The share of the population with consumption under the poverty line has fallen by one-
fourth inthe 1990s from 49 to 37 percent, with the populationinextreme poverty now estimated at
about 21 percent. The share o f total household consumption devoted to food was reduced from 50
to 35 percent, reflecting a reduction in the number o f poor people vulnerable to basic food
insecurity. However, while poverty was reduced, inequality has increased. The Gini index for per
capita expenditure rose from to 0.50 in 1988 to 0.53 in 2002, exacerbating the already high
concentration o f consumption among the richest. Inaddition, as indicated above food insecurity i s
a persistent problem, with malnutrition rates for children under five at 22 percent, compared to 21
percent in 1994.

5.2       The measures supported by the proposed PRSC-4 are expected to have a significant
positive impact on poverty reduction. Specifically, expectedbenefits include the:

          (i)strengtheningofpublicexpendituremanagement,whichwouldenhanceefficiency,
                transparency and accountability inpublic resources use;

          (ii)expansionofhealthinfrastructure,particularlyinremoteareas,thatwouldincrease
                access to qualityhealth services for the poor; and

          (iii)strengtheningandextensionofbasicsocialprotectiontothepoor.

5.3       Due to the nature o fthe instrument, the PRSC i s also expected to contribute to increasing
the Government's absorption capacity for external resources and reducing transaction costs and
distortions due to internationalassistance.

5.4       While the PRSC-4 does not have a special focus on rural poverty, it supports measures
that will be particularly beneficial to the rural poor. For example, bybringinggovernment services
closer to citizens, the decentralization process will especially benefit those who would ordinarily
have difficult access to such services, notably rural dwellers. Similarly, efforts to improve the
delivery o f social services will focus on traditionally under-servedareas, which tend to be rural-
and in the case o f food security, the vast majority o f beneficiaries will be rural. The activities
supported by the proposed PRSC-4 also complement other interventions to reduce rural poverty,
such as the US-financed MCC (US$110 million) and the Bank-financed transport project, both of
which finance rural infrastructure.

5.5       Given the overall thrust o f the PRSC-4, no negative impacts on vulnerable groups are
envisaged. To the contrary, all the measures considered will result either inimproved overall well-
being because o f better governance and more efficient and equitable government services or in
specific gains for the poorest and most vulnerable members o f society because o f efforts to reach
those with difficult access to basic services, including social protection and safety nets.

5.6       The Government has gone to considerable lengths to ensure that its actions are the true
expression o f the collective will, and has consistently and actively involved specific stakeholders
and citizens at large throughout the process leading to and accompanying the first PRSC series and
PRSC-4.

                                     B.      IMPLEMENTATION

5.7      The PRSC-4 is overseen by the country GPRSP Steering Committee. Underthe umbrella
ofthe Ministryo f Finance and Public Administration, all ministries involved inthe three GPRSP-I
pillars supported by the PRSC are involvedinPRSC design, implementation and monitoring (i.e.,
State Secretariat for Public Administration, Health, Labor and Solidarity).

5.8       Since the preparation o f the first PRSC series, the Bank team has worked in close
collaborationwith Government and budget support partners to ensure a highlevel o f accountability
for the success of the PRSCs. The Box below illustrates how the operation has incorporated the
good practice principles of applicationo f conditionality.

                                     C.     FIDUCIARYASPECTS

5.9       Fiduciary aspects and strengtheningo f the Government's own systems are at the core o f
this operation. The 2003 CFAA and 2006 PER have addressed the main challenges o f Cape
Verde's public expenditure management and financial accountability systems. An action plan
focusing on comprehensiveness and transparency o f budget and financial accountability i s being
implemented with the support o f the Netherlands, the EU and the Bank. A follow-up o f the
implementation o f the CFAA's action planhas been part o f the 2006 PER, PRSC supervision and
preparation. Public financial management has been improving steadily. The public financial
management system is reasonably adequateto support the PRSC.

5.10      IMF's most recent assessment o f the Central Bank was carried out in December 2002.
The assessment identified certain vulnerabilities in the reporting, internal control, and audit areas,
andmade appropriate recommendations, as reportedinIMF Country ReportNo. 03/152. The BCV
has fully implemented all but one o f the safeguard assessment recommendations which regard a
clear separation between the front and back office functions in the Operations division. The later
has been only partially implemented. Furthermore, BCV has improved liquidity and reserve
management, and strengthened bankingand financial sector supervision.

                                D.     DISBURSEMENT AUDITING
                                                        AND

5.11      A single tranche credit o f SDR 6.2 million (US$10 million equivalent) would be made
available to the Republic o f Cape Verde upon credit effectiveness, anticipated for August 2008.
The closing date o fthe operation would be December 31,2008.

5.12      The credit will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
lending. Once the credit becomes effective, the Government o f Cape Verde will submit a
withdrawal applicationto IDA requestingthat the proceeds o fthe credit be deposited inthe Central
Bank (BCV) into an account that forms part o f the country's official foreign exchange reserves.
The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of the credit into said account, an equivalent
amount i s credited in the Borrower's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the
Bank and to finance management expenditures. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the
amounts deposited inthe foreign currency account and credited to the budget management system.
Disbursement would not be linked to specific purchases. Ifthe proceeds o f the credit are used for
the ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Credit Agreement, IDA will require the
Borrower to refund an amount equal to the amount o f said payment to IDA promptly upon notice
from IDA. Amounts refundedto the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

5.13      Through the Ministryo f Finance, the borrower will (a) report the exact sum received into
the deposit account; (b) ensure that all withdrawals from the deposit account are for budgeted
public expenditures, except for purposes such as militaryexpenditures or for other items on IDA'S
negative list; and (c) provide to IDA evidence that the ECV equivalent ofthe Credit proceeds were
credited to the Consolidated Fundaccount and disbursements from that account were for budgeted
public expenditures. It i s expected that the TdC (Court o f Auditors) will provide IDA with its
annual report on the public accounts to Parliament by the end o f the year following the execution
o fthe budget.

5.14       Climatic vulnerability, erratic rainfall, limited fresh water supplies, and reliance on
tourism as an engine o f development put sustainable use of resources and protection o f the
environment as central to poverty reduction. The Government, with support from the Netherlands
cooperation and UNDP, has developed a National Environmental Plan (PANA, 2004-14) that
identifies policies, investments and result indicators to promote the rational use o f natural
resources and the sustainable management of economic activities. The Plan identifies three main
environmental issues that match the MDGs inthe areas o fwater supply, sanitation, and marine and
terrestrial biodiversity.

5.15       Within the fourth GPRSP-I pillar, "Develop basic infrastructure, promote rational land
use and safeguard the environment", the Government reiterated its commitment to PANA
implementation. The Spanish andAustrian Cooperations are currently providing budget support to
the environmental sector and have produced an environmental policy matrix that addresses main
issues. Critical prior actions and a set o f monitorable result indicators have been identified and are
beingmonitored.

5.16       IDA has determinedthat the specific actions supported under the proposed PRSC-4 are
not expected to have a significant effect on Cape Verde's environment and natural resources due to
the nature o f the areas o f focus o f the operation: public finance management, civil service and
decentralization, monitoring and evaluation, health care and financing, and social protection. More
specifically, none o fthe prior actions (Table 4.1) i s expected to impact negatively on Cape Verde's
environment andnaturalresources.

                                           F.       CAPACITYBUILDING

5.17       As discussed in the Lessons Learned section, achieving the results expected from the
PRSC-4 requires strengthening the capacity o f several o f the Government agencies and ministries
involved in its implementation. The Government itself financed a number o f technical assistance
and capacity building efforts in the preparation o f the first PRSC series, including strategy and
development o f instruments in the social protection system, implementation o f critical CFAA
recommendations and studies, and institutionalization and analysis of the civil service database, all
o f which strengthened the capacity of government agencies to carry out the PRSCs. Besides this
very welcome development, the World Bank, at the request o f the Government, has remained
closely involved in capacity building through three main channels: (a) technical advice from
members o f the core PRSC team, through the policy dialogue in the context o f the PRSC or
through background analytical work; (b) financial support through relevant TA components of
existing projects, and (c) a PRSP Trust Fund o f up to US$500,000.25 Complementary analytical
work or financial support from other donors has also beenprovided to support capacitybuilding.




  25Activities financed by the PSRP TF include: (a) assisting the Government in designing and implementing
  appropriate M&E tools; (b) strengthening capacity building for strategic planning in health financing, education
  testing and social protection; (c) improving governance through a more strategic use of human resources in civil
  service and targeted assistance to the Court of Auditors.

                                      G. RISKSANDRISKMITIGATION

5.18      The following risks and riskmitigation strategies have been identified:

  (a) Capacity. Implicit in the shift to budget support and reliance on national systems and civil
      servants for implementation i s the issue o f capacity. The limitednumber o f technical staff and
      the highturnover o f senior staff inseveral core ministriespose a problem. To address this risk
      inthe short term, the PRSC budget support partners have made available over US$3.5 million
      to finance a combination o f capacity building and technical support, and close coordination,
      including joint missions, will minimize the risk o f an inefficient use o f funds. The Bank has
      provided a PRSP TFs. For a mediumandlong term resolution, the ongoing civil service reform
      should help to build a better trained and stable cadre o f staff. The PRSC-4 (as well as the first
      PRSC series) includes a component on civil service aiming at supporting the ongoing reform.
      More specifically, PRSC-4 includes the prior action "Council o f Ministers approves the draft
      Law on Civil Service", which expected outcome i s to create a professional and merit based
      civil service.
  (b) Decline inexternal concessional support at a faster pace than expected: Cape Verde graduated
      to the UnitedNations' category o f medium-developed country (MDC) in January 2008. As a
      result, a decline inforeign concessional support i s expected. A task force, under the Ministryo f
      Foreign Affairs, is leading discussions with the main partners to assure a smooth transition.
      However, if the donors withdraw from the country before the expected date or if the terms o f
      concessional lendingworsen more than previously foreseen, reforms can slow down, stall or
      move aheadwith domestic resources. Iffinanced by domestic resources, there i s a risk o f fiscal
      slippages or a rise in borrowing levels. Through the PRSCs instrument the Bank has played a
      catalytic role towards helpinginthe harmonization and security o fresources.
  (c) Fiscal Risks: Accumulation o f contingent liabilities could emerge if public or semi-public
      companies (especially Electra) are not run efficiently, if the continued increase in oil prices is
      not passed-through to domestic prices, and if municipalities continue accumulating arrears
      towards Electra. The PRSC has been one o f the bases that supported dialogue on fiscal risks.
      Several actions were taken since the inceptiono fthe program, as referred above. To summarize
      a few: a study on contingent liabilities; a plan for the settlement o f arrears and prevention o f
      contingent liabilities; a revision o f the automatic mechanism for petroleum products - revision
      o f prices are made on the basis o f Platts market quotes and not on reported fob costs by the oil
      companies.
  (d) Food prices: Cape Verde imports most of its cereal consumption. Owing to the existence o f
      large stocks, the recent increase in international food prices has not yet had an impact on
      domestic prices. However, it i s expected that with the new shipments domestic prices will
      increase. To mitigate the effect o f food prices' increase, especially for vulnerable groups, the
      Council o f Ministers has recently approved a package o f measures, which include the
      elimination o f international trade taxes and VAT on cereals, improvements in importation
      efficiency, and increase in the amount and coverage o f the non-contributory pension. In the
     short term it i s not expected that the increase in food prices and the approved measures will
     threaten fiscal or external stability, given the relative fiscal space and comfortable level o f
     international reserves. Authorities and donors, including the World Bank, will continue
     monitoring closely the developments in this area. In addition, in the context o f the upcoming
     poverty assessment the Bank will simulate the poverty impact o f this shock across different
     groups, so as to identify further mitigation measures. Furthermore, the Bank stands ready to
     continue supporting Cape Verde as the situation evolves.

SUBJECT: Letter of Development Policv for Pover-n           Sumort Credit.
L.aGx!u

Purpose

!., On behalf of the Government of Cape Verde Iam requesting a credlt in
   the amount of US$ 10 million from the International Development
   Association, to continue supporting the Government of Cape Verde's
   structural reform program.

2. 'This Letter of Development Policy (UP)      provides a summary of our
   Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP).       At the same
   time, it reinforces the commitment of the Government of Cape Verde with
   the program of objectives, policies and measures spelled out in Its
   structural reform program.

3. The aforementioned credit will help to meet financing requirements that
   Cape Verde faces to implement Its GPRS.

4. The GPRSP initiative is expected to run from 2008-2010 and will be a
   continuation of the earlier programs documented In GPRSP 2005-2007,
   These are the Grand Options Plan (GOP) which emphasized growth, and
   poverty and income inequlty reduction among the households. The GOCV
   aiins  to the    maintenance of rhe macroeconomic balances; the
   strengthening and consolidation of the structural reforms; developing

    competitive advantages For the economy; and the promotion of economic
    growth and employment.

5, The Government's medium-term objectives and strategy are set out in
    the GPRSP and other national planning documents such as Economic
    Transformation Strategy Paper, and have been reiterated and elaborated
    in the Government Program for 2006-11. This strategy is directed at
    boosting growth and reducing poverty through private sector-led
    development and diversification of economic activities. In support of these
    goals, the Government's policy prlorities include (I) building human
    capacities through improving access to education, training, and health
    care; (li) strengthening infrastructure and institutions, including to
    support service sector growth In areas such as tourism, financial services,
    and communications; and (Ill) improving governance and the capacity of
    the public sector to Implement policy reforms and program mandates.


Recent developments

6. Cape Verde's economic performance has improved substantially over the
    past few years. Real GDP per capita (in current US$) Is estlmated at US$
    2,100 (2005), which shows a significant improvement since independence
    (1975), at which time it was US$ 190, or even as compared to 1990,
   when it was US$ 902. Real GDP average growth rates in the years 2000
   to 2006 was 6.3%, Estimates indicate that in 2006 the economy grew
   more rapidly than anticipated with the GDP Qrowthrat@at 10.8 percent.
   This rate of growth reflects strong public and private investment (driven
   by significant forelgn direct investment), directed largely towards
   infrastructure development, tourism, and the telecommunication industry.
   Prospects for 2007 are good with the growth rate projected at 7 percent,
   reflecting among other factors the carry-over effect of foreign direct
   investment inflows during 2007.

7. Monetary policy has focused on strengthening the sustainabllity of the
   exchange rate peg to the Euro by buildlng up reserves and ensuring price
   stability. That, coupled with other factors (FDI, exports), led to an
   increase of international reserves to 3 months of prospective Imports by
   end December 2006.

8. According to new data from the National Statistical Institute (INE), growth
   in 2006 appears to have been much stronger than earlier estlmated-
   reaching 10 % percent, Growth was particularly strong in tourlsm,
  telecomrnunicatlans, financial services, construction, and fishing. In line
  with this, growth for 2007 is projected to be around 7 percent. "Headline"
  consumer price inflation has largely come down as expected since 2006,
  but is now being pushed up temporarily due to poor rainfall and recent
  adjustments in petroleum prices. The twelve-month lnflatlon rate reached
  4,5 percent by December 2007.

 9. The tertiary sector became dominant in the productlve structure,
     supported by strong growth in tourism, as well as transports, banking and
     trade. The priman/ sector moved slowly, With the growing rural
     populatlon, and constdering that agricultural incomes play a key role in
     the survival of one quarter of the labor force, the weak performance of
     the primary sector had a crucial negative impact on the income and
     poverty risks facing rural workers.
 10.This gain In the growth of the real GDP per capita is manifested by
     improvements of the Human Development Index (HDI). HDI rose from
     0.587 to 0.736 in the years 1990 and 2006, mpectlvely. A t present, life
     expectancy is 73,8 years and 67,5 years for women and men accordingly
     (2005). In addition,     Human Poverty Rate (HPR),           which reflects
    deficlencies in terms of llfe expectancy, Income, education, literacy and
    other area5 improved from 28.8% in 1990 to 18.7% in 2005.

11.Cape Verde's economic growth of the last decade resulted In an increase
    in the inequality of income dlstributlon as shown by the Glni coefficient,
    which rose to 0.57 (2002), compared to 0.51 in the late 1980s. The
    excesslve concentration of wealth is illustrated by the fact that 10% of the
    very poor population has only 1%of total Income. The first seven deciles
    (70h of the households) represent only 28Oh of per capita expenditure,
    while the last decile (the wealthiest 1Oo/o)     account for 47% of total
    expenditures.
12.The island of S%oVicente has the highest concentration of wealth, with a
    0.60 Gini coefficient, whereas the national average Is 0.57. Next on the
    list are the islands of Santo AntBo, S%oNicolau, and Santiago, wlth 0.56.
13.The economic acceleration was accompanled by deep structural change in
    the economy, with services coming out on top. This situation had an
    important impact in terms of resource allocation among the sectors and
   on factor output, and, thus, on income and wealth dlstribution, on a
   national level, as well as within each island. On the other hand, the strong
   expansion in income in sectors such as tourism and other servlces
   worsened the imbalances in income distribution. Increasing demographlc
   pressure, combined wlth erosion of agricultural soils, led to a negative
   impact on rural per capita Incomes, thus also contributing to increase
   inequalities In income dtstributlon.
14.Causes of poverty relate essentially to living conditions in rural areas and
   to the low employability of the poor. The comblnation of the nature of
   Cape Verdean agriculture, the high population growth rate, and the
   random nature of the climate, explefin the rural stagnation and low
   incomes. In fact, this process may aggravate soil eroslon, which reduces
   their productivity and availability.
15.TO overcome the lack of resources in Cape Verde, the poor turn to
   migration and to the informal sector. At first, migration led Cape Verdeans
   abroad, but later, facing increasing difficulties in the host countrles, they
                                                                      `I ...-.,

   also started moving to the urbm areas within the country. A clear
   evidence of thls is the Increase In populatlon recorded in the ctty of Praia,
   with resulting pressure on sanltatlon, houslng, education, and health
   facilities.
16,The Micro-Projects Program and the National Rural Poverty Alleviation
   Program implemented by Clvll Soclety Organization (CSO) and Non-
   Government Organlzation have become the main safety net in rural areas.
   Subsistence anlmal husbandry also plays a key role In rural areas, as it
   represents a security factor against the crises that follow drought perlods.
   In urban areas, informal activities are the main way out for many
   families, as indicated by the surge in the informal economy, Women play
   a key role in thls area, leading to a reduction In female poverty since the
   f990s.
17.Fiscal policy has been conslstent with macroeconomic stabillty and debt
   sustainability. In 2006, the flscal deflctt stood at 5 percent of GDP
   reflecting strong revenue performance from both income and value added
   (VAT) taxes as well as greater control of expenditures. Projectlons for
   2007 Indicate that the flscal deficit will stand at around 3.7 percent of
   GDP.

18. Meanwhile, domestic debt increased in early 2000s reflectlng the
   government's assumptlon of the debt of some large publlc enterprlses as
   part of their privatization, fiscal sllppages, and, more recently, increased
   reccqnltion of domestic arrears. The peak was reached in 2004 with net
   domestic debt at 35 percent of GDP, To provide more flexibllity in
   managing debt, the budget's celllng for domestic borrowing will be on a
   net basis (rather than on a gross basis as in the past), and the Treasury
   will seek to clear arrears more rapidly If extraordinary revenues
   materialize. There will be no additional net domestic borrowlng by the
   budget in 2008. Consequently, the net domestic debt-to-GDP ratlo is
   projected to decline to below 20 percent by end-2008.
19.External debt service (in percent of exports of goods and nonfactor
  services) has remained stable, around 10.6 of GDP and around 15% of
  domestic revenues from 2003-2005. Moreover, external Financing support
  to GOCV has steadily decreased from 16.5% of the GDP in 2001 to 10.3%
  in 2003.


2O.Consumer Inflation in 2006 reached approximately 5.4 percent, reflecting
  a rapid increase in prices due to the impact of high International oil prices
  on dornestic energy and water prices and the effect of temporary
  shortages for some food items. In 2007, inflation Is projected at around 5
  percent, once again driven by food and energy prices.

 Program overview

 21,Cape Verde is a small country geographically as well as economkally.
    Findings from Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES)/
    Household Uving Conditions Survey (HLCS) conducted in 2001-2002
    reveals that 37% of the population is considered poor, with 62% living in
    rural areas. Further, about 54% of the total poor population is considered
    to be extremely poor, while in terms of gender, about 51h of the poor
    are women.
22.The Government is preparing its second Poverty Reduction Strategy
    Document (PRSP) 2008-2010, with the support from the World Bank. Its
    main objective is a substantial reduction In the levels of absolute poverty
    in Cape Verde through the adoption of an all-around poverty reductlon
    policy, covering macro-economic policies, public management policies, as
    well as sectoral and mlcroeconomic policies targeting the poor.


23. The GPRS is part of a broader strategic planning exercise that has been
   under way in Cape Verde and has as main components the Grand Options
   of the Plan 2002-2005 (COP) and the Transformation Strategy. The link
   between the Transformation Strategy and the GPRS will be guaranteed to
   ensures globat coherence of the planning instruments, thus facilitating
   management and monitoring of the various programs, and avoiding
   dupllcatton of efforts and procedures.

24.The GOCV realizes that the success of GPRS initiative will depend on
   good governance that focuses on the effectiveness of the economic
   policies especially the pro-poor pollcies, Under this program the GOCV
   aims to reform the public administration at first place by introducing
   capacity building programs for the civil servants and enhancing manpower
   management skills. Particular emphasize wlll be in the area of informatlon
   systems, comrnunlcations technologies and human development planning,
   The government will continue to consolidate the gains reached within the
   framework of implementatios of the GPRSS.

25 Secondly, the objective is to integrated payroll and human resources
   database is managed by the DGAP from the State Secretariat for Public
  Administration (human resource components) and the DGTCP in the
  Ministry of Finances (salary components). Deconccntratlon of some of the
  elements related to salary calculation has already started in the Ministries
  of Finance, Health and Agriculture (hours worked and days of leave,
  bonuses), and should be completed for other ministries by the end of
  December. Deconcentration of human resources processes will start in
  January.    The establishment of responsibilities and requirements for
  processing various types of human resources management actions in the
  database, however, is delayed and needs to be resumed.

20. Thirdly, the GOCV       plans to continue the implementation of the
    Procurement Law, A harmonized procurement framework (law and
    implementation decree) were prepared with technical assistance financed
    by Growth and Competitiveness Project (World Bank funding), and
    regulations have been approved by the CPAR Steering Committee
    together with the appeals regulation. These regulations Authorlty was
    created by the Councllof Ministersat end of December2007


27,Fourthly, the GOCV plans to enhance decentralization program that seeks
    to shift the declsion making power to the local structures, speciflcally the
    poor. Thls will ensure a more equltable distrlbutlon of resource by
   establishing the Financial Equilibrium Fund. Proceeds generated by the
   Fund has increased. The plan also seeks to coordinate smoothly the
   operation of Civil Society Organlzatlons (CSO) and that of Non-
   Governmental Organizations (NGO) In lmprovlng the municipalities'
   capabilities in the provision of health, education, environment, land use
   planning and service delivery.


28.The GOCV continues with Its efforts of advancing market economy by
   encouraging the establishment of domestic large, medium and micro
   enterprises, as well as promotion of partnerships with foreign investors.
   Public / private partnerships have been introduced. In view of this, the
   government has launched a competltlon poky that advocates the
   creation and enhancement of lnstltutlonal conditions for the entrance of
   new businesses and firms in all the sectors of the economy,
29Jn order to ensure efficiency in the provislon of goods and services the
   GOCV      will continue implementlng the privatization program. Thls is
   expected to reduce the government deficlts by ellrnlnatlng subsidies,
   increases the government resources in the form of tax revenues and sale
   proceeds of the privatized structures. Moreover, the process will fulfill the
   government's ambition of providing the poor with more varieties of goods
   and servlces at affordable prjces.


 Develop and upgrade human capital


3O.Despite the fact that Cape Verde will graduate to middle income country
  in 2008, unemployment still poses a threat especially to the poor, In the
  year 2005 unemployment rate stood at 24Yo for the whole nation, but in
  the year 2006 unemployment rate droped from 24% in 2005 to 18         O/O  for
  the whole nation.

31.To look into the situation the GOCV has successfully inltlated an
    employment policy that is expected to create more jobs and generate
    incomes to the poor. Attention has been directed towards programs such
    as Micro-Projects Program that offers temporary employments at a lower
    pay in infrastructure projects: such as road construction, soil and water
    conservation structures and reforestation programs.
32,At the same time the GOCV under the Ministries of Labor (MOL) and
    Education (MOE) is coordinating various skills development programs to
    assist the poor in securing more jobs and increase their pays. This has led
    to the initiation of the employment and the professional trainlng policies
    under the two ministries respectively.


33.Aside, the GOCV is supporting the reform of the land tenure and
    ownership system to encourage agricultural sector employment that
    provides a livelihood for the largest part of the population. Furthermore,
    the Government is commttted to provlde technical assistance through the
    Ministry of agriculture to such scheme. Moreover, strategic expanslon of
   the tourlst industry is expected to increase employment and incomes of
   the poor especially in the islands of Sal, Boa Vista and Malo.
34.The development of human capital depends on two important ingredients
   namely: education and health. The track record is Impressive but much
   remains to be done, particularly with regards to gender disparitles
   between rural and urban areas. For instance, Cape Verde has attained the
   goal of universal primary education. However, It is necessary to Improve
   the quality of the education system. Teacher training priorltles Is
   indentifled and action plan developed. In addition, students are to be
   encouraged to complete secondary or professional education in order to
   improve thetr chances of successfully entering the labor market. In this
   regard, a white paper diagnosing professional training was prepared and
   will be implemented from 2008 to 2011, Literacy rates Improved
   signMcantly during the past ten years and more will be done over the
   coming years in thls regard,
35.Another aspect of good health is the reduction of child mortality as well as
   infant mortality. However, the country's high heaith risk vulnerabllity calls
   for constant preventive and curative measures including routine
   vaccination and improvement of birth condltions in maternitles. The goal
   of reducing chtld mortality by two thirds by the year 2015 may be
  achieved if past policles that led to the current results are strengthened,
  In this regard, the GOCV has already completed the analysis of health
  human resources and drafted and approved a strategy to increase the
  ratio of heaith professionals per inhabitant (this is already happenlng at
  the rural areas following infrastructure development). The challenges still
  ahead are: The @specializationof health professionals as the country
  undergoes epidemiological transition. Furthermore, the Government is
  commltted to strengthen the reforms In order to convey sustainability to
  the services renderred.
                                                                   /-  '\

 36.The Non-Cornmuntcabie Diseases (NCD) was approved by yhe Councll of
    Ministers bin December 2007 The anatysis of NCD is comlng to an end
    with the field survey to be concluded by February 2008 thanks to
    collaboratlon between INE and the WHO local team. The conclusion of
    such work is essential for a country facing an epidemiological transition,
    where chronic diseases are significantly increasing the burden of
    evacuations towards Portugal.

37 .The GOCV recognizes the Importance of basic infrustructure development
    that includes sanitatton, water provision, and road construction and
    maintenance. In terms of sanltatlon, the government plan Is to enhance
    the collection and treatment of residual water In the cltles of Praia and
    Mindelo and extend this to the other cities pendlng fund availability, There
    is a serious problem on drainage system that threats the hygienic
    condltions of the poor and forms a major source of pofiution especlally of
    the domestic water.
38.Given the current outdated land use policies the government Is underway
    to implement a comprehensive modern Municipal Urban Plans that will
    replece the obsolete Land Use Plans, Thus the GOCV plans to reform the
   current basic cartography and cadastral systems to allow for property
    rlghts enforcement     and    municipal boundaries useful for other
   infrastructure development and property tax collections.
39.The most common environmental calamities such as soil eroslon, coastline
   degradation, water and air pollutions, landslides, loss of biodiversity,
   waste accumulation and disperslon are ubiquitous to the GOCV. To correct
   for the situation the GOCV        has commissioned the second Natlonal
   Environmental Action Pian that outlines the policy implications and
   management framework to mitigate the situation.
40.0ther infrastructure development policies include road services, maritime
   transportation facilities and airport infrastructures. Inter-urban road
   transportation has been totally liberalized; the open policy for the
   maritime transportatlon policy led to the ltquidatlon of the state-owned
   maritime company "Arca Verde"; and the alr code stipulates the
   regufations pertafnlng to the principles, rules and procedures to
   participate in international civll aviation industry and has led to the
   signing of some international air freight cooperatlon agreements.
4l.This shows that the GOCV is highly committed to introduce reforms and
   restructure the transportation industry that is key to cost reduction and
   ensures effective delivery of goods and services to the poor.

    Improve the effectiveness and sustainability of the social protection
   system

42.The Social protection and the GPRSP. The social protection objectives
    under the GPRSP-1 have been achieved, with the exception of the
    institutional and juridical framework for service delivery at the municipal
    level. It is envisaged that the accent in the next GPRSP, and the
    accompanying budgetary support, will be on deconcentrated service
    delivery, improved planning and management, and interventlans in favor
    of the disabled, while also broadening the policy dialogue to Include labor
    issues.
43.Social protection at the municipal level. Wlth the Decentralization
    Framework b w      approved by the Council of Minlsters and soon to be
    submitted to Parltament, objective wlll be met for the decentralization of
    social pratectlon services, This is a most welcome development, as the
    operationalization of the Social Protection Strategy has been held hostage
    of the Framework Decentralizatlon taw for two years.


44.T0 counter this, efforts are already underway to implement a financially
   sustainable pension scheme and reform the social security system.
    Nevertheless, there is a need to ensure that social protection transfers
    need to be well targeted to the pooreststrata of the population ifthey are
   to have their deslred Impact on reducing poverty. Definitive data tables
   has been submitted to Bank Data.

45.More specifically, the GOCV has unified the existlng systems that provides
   employment such as the redefinitlon of the Ex     -FAIMO workers' benefits
   system and the reinforcement of the capacity of the National Social
   Security Institute (INPS).

46.Alternatively, the government provides credit to support the poor and
   allow them to contribute into the production process, However, the
   Government acknowledge that there Is a need to broad and better focus
   the targeted population. The aim Is to promote self-employment via
   access to micro-credit that forms Important sources of financlal capital,
   which empowers the poor as an tncorne generating actlvltles. This has
   been extended to the establishment of the financial intermediation so as
   to guarantee greater coverage of the poorest zones and the neediest
   families.

47.With the same spirit the GOCV encourages sustalnable agriculturai
   deveiopment where the core of the initlatlve rests on the integrated
   enhancement of the agrarian resources and in the generalization of the
   micro-Irrigation schemes.

 48.In the area of food security, the GOCV          provides guarantee of food
    availability and stabillty in the supply of the central and periphery
    markets, assuring the normal operation of the food markets and a
    management that involves the private commercial management In
    supplying the market.


 49.TO support the process, the Government has introduced in its budgetary
    System preparation a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and
    a number of Medium Term Sectoral Expenditure Frameworks (MTSEF)
    within key line Mlnistries (Educatton, and Social Protection). It is expected
    that such a set-up will improve: i) prioritizing programs and projects that
    directly contribute towards the GPRS objectives and the sectoral
    objectives; 11)budgeting of programs and projects according to resources
    that can be mobiilzed; iii) medlum term (three years) budget allocation
    according to priorities Ln order to reach the established development
    targets.
5O.To Implement these guidellnes, the Government has begun a number of
    reforms to make the public management system more ePnclent, more
    reliable and more transparent. In this regard, a number of measures are
    being implemented the recommendationsfrom the PER, CFAA and CPAR
    exercises.
S1.The Institutional framework for implementing the GPRS will consist of the
   exlsting administratlve apparatus, after the necessary functional changes
   in structure are introduced, The National Poverty Reduction Board is an
   advisory body that includes the main stakeholders, drawn from publlc
   administration, the private sector, and civll society. At the central level,
   the General Directorate of Planning, supported by a Technical Secretariat,
   will be responsible for coordination and technical support. At the sectoral
   level, the Studies and Planning Offices within each line Minlstry will
   prepare, rnonltor and evaluate priority programs and projects included in
   the strategy. At the local level, there will be Regional Poverty Reductlon
   Boards, advisory bodies that will secure the input from local stakeholders.
Program monttoring and evaluation

52,The GOCV has set up a monitoring and evaluation system for the GPRS to
  guide the actions of the various actors involved In promotlng growth and
   poverty reduction, In addltion to governmental departments, the system
  include organizations from clvil society, as well as the development
  partners.
53.The Government intends to ensure and reinforces the following functions
  In the context of the monitoring and evaluation system: (i)monitoring
  and analysis of trends In growth, poverty, vulnerability and Inequality; (li)
  monitoring the execution of programs and projects that contribute to
  improved growth and poverty reduction; (iit) evaluation of the impact of
  policies and programs related to growth and poverty reduction.

 54.This system will be based on a network that is currently constructed by
    NOS1 (Information Technology Operational Unit) through the SIGOF. The
    system will include three core components and two support Components.
    The core components will be (1)         a monltorlng and trend analysis
    component, (11)    an execution component, and (iti) an impact evaluation
    component. The support components Involve (1) creation of a physical,
    technical Institutional and human envlronment that Is conducive to better
    circulation of data, information and outputs between producers and users,
    and (il) improving information dissemination, aiming at a participated
    policy dialogue among the varlous stakeholders and, eventually, better
    design and execution of public policy.
 55.To guarantee smooth and efficient functioning of this monitoring and
    evaluation system, the Government has decided to set up the following
    three-tiered instltutlonal framework for monltoring and evaluation of the
    GPRS:

          (a) National Pov@mRe$lualon Boar9 (NPRB): a broad-based entity
              responsible for monitorlng and supporting political declslons in
              the areas of growth and poverty reduction. NPRB will be chaired
              by the cabinet member In charge of Planning and wlll include 17
              member      Institutions from     line ministries,  clvll society
              institutlons, NGOs, private sector representatives, and labor
              unions.

          (b) Q k w a t o and Analvtirnl Svseem (OAS): made up of two sub-
                            ~
              systems (The National Statlstlcal System and the National
              Plannlng System), the OAS will guarantee the necessary
              observation and analysis, and supply the National Poverty
              Reduction Board the inputs (namely studies) for monitoring and
              drafting growth and poverty reduction policies.

          (c) Reaional povertv Rductlon m4LL-k (RPRBS): The RPRBS play
              an advisory role that essentlally covers, at first, approvlng
              activity proposals for the GPRS and valldatlon of the annual
              GPRS progress report. They will include, In each case, the
              Municipality and the municipal offices of relevant Ilne ministries
              as well as the reglonal or local stakeholders board

Conclusion

The Government remains committed to its overall objective of poverty
reduction through sustainable economic growth, as set forth in Its GPRSP, To
this end, the Government intends to energize the reform process, in a
manner that Is technicaIly and administratively feaslble and consistent with
the proposed overall objective. In thls matter, a swltch from project aid to
budget aid is desirable, at both the global and sactoral levels. It is therefore
the Government's hope that IDA wlll grant the requested credlt to assist In

                            Chairman's Statement, December 27,2007


"The Cape Verde authorities' well-crafted program under the PSI i s guided by the need to
support macroeconomic stability and the exchange rate peg, reduce domestic debt, increase
foreign reserves, and create fiscal space to accommodate the expected decline in concessional
external financing as the country graduates from L D C status.

Cape Verde continues to demonstrate a strong economic performance, and the authorities are to
be commended for their prudent macroeconomic management inrecent years. Growth i s being
sustained, bolstered by significant increases in foreign direct investment, especially in the
tourism sector. Reflecting this, unemployment and poverty rates are falling. Although inflation
has increased in recent months, this largely reflects poor rainfall, which temporarily drove up
food prices. Underlyinginflation pressures remain moderate.

Fiscal consolidation and the build-up o f official reserves have proceeded faster than program
expectations. The targets for both domestic debt and official reserves initially set for 2009 are
likely to be reached in 2008.While the authorities have made progress in preventing an
accumulation o f central government arrears, challenges remain in the areas o f financial sector
regulation and supervision, public financial management, and energy sector reform.

It is important to strengthen financial sector regulation and supervision. In that regard, the
authorities' plans to establish a financial intelligence unit and strengthen the framework to
combat money-laundering and the financing o f terrorism in2008 are welcome.

Progress i s being made in strengthening public sector financial management. Weaknesses in
data reporting understated the deviation with respect to the extent o f net domestic borrowing.
Since the excess borrowing had little effect on the economic outturn, and has now been
unwound, and as measures have been taken to improve budget execution and monitoring, the
Board decided to maintain a positive assessment of Cape Verde's past program performance
under the PSI.

Strengtheningthe energy sector will be critical for enhancing growth andpoverty reduction and
limiting fiscal risk. In that regard, it is important that the authorities implement rapidly their
plans for a comprehensive overhaul of the energy sector, including establishing a new base
utility tariff structure and continuously applying the fuel and utility price adjustment
mechanisms. This would depoliticize price setting, safeguard the budget, and give companies in
the energy sector incentives for investment and efficiency gains."
