MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A FISHERIES SUB-SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
I.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 6.2 million (US$9 million equivalent). The
credit would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, and would finance a Fisheries
Sub-Sector Capacity Building Project.
2.    Country Background. After a devastating economic performance throughout the 1970s and
early 1980s, the Government introduced an Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in 1983 to: (a)
restore and sustain macroeconomic stability, (b) improve the efficiency of public sector resource
management, and (c) create an incentive framework to enhance efficiency, encourage savings and
investment, and provide an enabling environment for the private sector.
3.    The Government has been implementing a program of wide-ranging financial reforms. It has
abolished interest rate controls and sectoral credit ceilings, improved the legal framework governing
banking activities, and introduced uniform accounting and auditing standards for all banks. The
central bank is strengthening improved supervision of banks. A program to restructure the finances
and management of distressed banks has been completed. The country has established a small stock
exchange, and the exchange is anticipated to be a vehicle for floating shares of public enterprises that
are to be divested.
4.    Ghana now has a market-determined exchange rate system and a low-tariff trade regime free
of quantitative restrictions. In April 1990, the Government introduced an interbank market supported
by a weekly wholesale auction of foreign exchange, with a view to encouraging such transactions
among banks. More than half the foreign exchange in the interbank market is supplied by the Central
Bank. Foreign exchange transactions at the bureau de change were legalized in 1990 also. The
spread between the interbank foreign exchange market and the bureau has continued to fall, and is
currently less than 10 percent. The Government abolished the import licensing system in 1989.
Tariffs on imports have been reduced substantially, and excise taxes on imports have been set at par
with locally produced goods. Export taxes, except on cocoa, have been abolished.
5.    The Government has succeeded in mobilizing greater public revenues through tax reform,
improved tax collections, and rationalization of consumption taxes and user charges. Public
investment has grown from negligible level at the beginning of the ERP to about 9 percent of GDP
in 1993, and the focus has changed from direct investment in productive activities to rehabilitation of
economic and social infrastructure, especially roads and human resources development. Tariff and
pricing policy in the power and energy sectors have also been improved. To better rationalize the
public investment program, the Ministry of Finance has established a committee, with representatives
from sector ministries, which coordinates investments and policies across sectors.
6.    Despite the successful impact of the ERP in restoring a healthy growth in the economy, the
poverty level has not improved significantly enough to raise the standard of living of the population,
generate robust demand for goods and services to trigger supply response, and lead to robust and
sustained rise in private savings and investment. The large civil service, which account for 70
percent of the national budget, and its consequences on macroeconomic stability continue to be of
concern. However, the Govermnent is committed to continue the economic reform program,
maintain macroeconomic stability, restructure public service with a view to improving capacity to



-2-
manage public expenditure and investment, promote private sector development, invest in the
development of human resources and infrastructure, and accelerate the rate of economic growth as
means of also alleviating poverty quickly. Ghana is expected to reach a growth rate of 5.6 percent by
the turn of the century. More rapid growth can be achieved earlier if the Government can restore and
maintain macroeconomic balance more quicldy, proceed expeditiously with privatization, improve
capacity in the public and private sectors, and accelerate investments in infrastructure and human
resources development. In the early years, most of the expected growth is likely to come from
agriculture, mining, financial services and transport. Higher manufacturing growth will follow with a
lag.
7.    Though the Government has been making progress in restoring macroeconomic stability since
the election-related fiscal shock of 1992, the macroeconomic situation remains an issue. For more
than a decade, Ghana has undertaken sustained fiscal adjustment. However, in the run-up to the 1992
elections, public service wage increases and revenue slippage led to the re-emergence of large fiscal
deficits and increases in money supply. Although the fiscal situation improved significantly in 1993-
albeit not as much as planned--and the economy grew by 5 percent, inflation rose to 27 percent by
December 1993. Lower GDP growth in 1994-due to poor rains and civil conflict in the north-and
continued monetary expansion have preventecl a decline in inflation by the end of 1994. Thus,
stabilization will be a key feature of the 1995 budget.
8.    Tbe Agricultural Sector. Agriculture remains the dominant sector of the Ghanaian economy,
contributing nearly half of the GDP and about three quarters of export earnings. It provides
livelihood for about 70 percent of the population. Agriculture is the key source of public revenues
and has an important impact on both public and private savings. Food expenditures account for a
significant component of household budgets, and hence agriculture has significant influence on real
wages, rate of inflation, private savings and investment, and overall macroeconomic perfbrmance.
The fisheries sub-sector accounts ror about 5 percent of the agricultural GDP. Fish is a preferred
source of animal protein in Ghana, and about 75 percent of the total production of fish is consumed
domestically. Fish is the country's most important non-traditional export, with an annual volume of
about 30,000 tons earning about US$17 million.
9.    The resource base for sustained growth of agriculture is good, provided it is managed
properly: large untapped agricultural land, good forest and fisheries resources, low population
density, good climate that allows diverse agricultural activities year-round, and fairly literate and
market oriented farming population. The key to change lies in continued improvement in the
competitiveness of the sector, improvement of the incentive framework for expanding exports and
import substitutes, accelerating growth elsewhere in the economy to generate robust demand for
agricultural products, and strengthening the capacity of public institutions for policy formulation and
implementation and for managing properly the natural resources.
10.   In the fisheries sub-sector, Government objectives are to increase fish production for local
consumption and export, consistent with the long-term sustainability of the resource; develop resource
management plans for the entire fisheries sector; integrate fishing activities in the farming system
through the promotion of aquaculture; privatize assets and operations of public bodies engaged in
direct fishing or in the supply of fishing gear; and strengthen the Department of Fisheries (DOF) of
the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) so that it can effect /ely carry out its mandate,
particularly relating to the above tasks.



- 3 -
11.   PrTject Objhctive. Ile key objective of the project is to establish the long-term sustainability
of the fisheries resource and thereby maximize its contribution to the economy. To achieve this
objective, the project would build the capacity of the DOF for managing the sub-sector focusing on
capacity for: formulating policy and management plans and their implementation; monitoring,
control, surveillance, and enforcement; and promoting the development of inland fisheries.
12.   Project Description. In the context of the project, the DOF would be re-organized to give
prominence to resource management functions, avoid ambiguities among units, improve efficiency in
the utilization of human and material resources, more clearly define authority and accountability, and
improve professional job satisfaction. The project would also strengthen the capacity of the DOF in
financial management, including the collection and management of fisheries levies, improved
accounting and control of development funds, and proper budget planning and management. This
component would account fbr 47 percent of the total project cost.
13.   The project would support improved management of marine fisheries through stock
assessment, and preparation of management plans and their periodic updating. The management plans
are expected to focus on promotion of community-based management through the traditional
leadership structure with enforcement of laws and regulations to be used for support and
reinforcement of traditional authority. This component would account for 21 percent of the total
project cost.
14.   The project would also support improved management of inland fisheries through stock
assessment and promotion of community-based management of fisheries resources in lakes, initially
focusing on Lake Volta; and the expansion of aquaculture through strengthened extension in
aquaculture. The extension program would be closely linked with the unified agricultural extension
service. Support would also be provided to Non-Govermnental Organizations (NGOs) which are
already active in the promotion of integrated agriculture-aquaculture development. This component
would account for 15 percent of the total project cost.
15.   The project would create active monitoring, control, and surveillance (MSC) systems in both
marine and lake fisheries. The at-sea MCS function would be implemented by the Ghanaian Navy for
about 60 ship-days per year; the full cost of naval MCS would be financed by the Government as part
of its counterpart financial contribution to the project. The naval MCS activities would be
supplemented by land-based activities which would be undertaken by the DOF. This component
would account for about 17 percent of the total project cost.
16.   Proiect Implementation. The project would be managed by the DOF. The Fisheries
Commission (composed of representatives of the fishing industry associations; MOFA; Ministries of
Transport and Communications, Defense, and Enviromment; Institute of Aquatic Biology; the Ghana
Irrigation Development Authority; and four representatives of financial institutions and traders) would
serve as an advisory board, providing broad policy guidelines, ensuring the incorporation of the
various interest groups in the preparation of fisheries management plans, advising on enforcement of
fisheries laws and regulations, and overseeing project progress. All procurement would be assigned
to an existing Project Coordination Unit of MOFA, which has had sufficient experience under
previous IDA-funded agricultural projects. All project-related training would be prepared and
implemented in collaboration with the Manpower and Training Department of the MOFA, and the
Policy, Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation Department (PPMED) of the ministry would monitor
and evaluate the project's implementation performance, and would assist the DOF in undertaking
special socio-economic studies, if needed. The front-line fisheries extension activities would be



-4 -
assigned to the ministry's Department of Extension, with the DOF providing the subject matter
specialists. The implementation period would be five years (starting in 1996). Detailed
implementation arrangements and timetables for each project component, as well as terms of reference
for consultants, are set out in a Project Implementation Manual.
17.   Pro3ect Sustainability. The project is sustainable. It would strengthen the institutional,
policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks in order to establish the long-term sustainability of the
fisheries resource and thereby maximize the sub-sector's contribution to the economy. Fisheries
management plans would be prepared and implemented, there would be provisions in the revised
fisheries law and regulations to enforce compliance with the management plans, communities would
be encouraged to participate in the management of the resources through their traditional leadership
and associations of fishers, and a strong monitoring, control, and surveillance system would be put in
place to enforce compliance with the law.
18.   The project would be the first comprehensive public investment in the sub-sector, although the
investment is quite modest when compared with investments in recent projects in other sub-sectors.
Nevertheless, it would increase the public expenditures in the sub-sector by about US$ 0.7 million per
year, while also generating additional fiscal revenues which would be more than sufficient to sustain
it. The institutional and policy reforms would form the foundation for private and public investment
in the sub-sector for many years to come.
19.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The 1994 Annual Portfolio
Performance Review indicated the following main difficulties in Ghana: weak management and
project implementation capacity, procurement delays, inadequate and/or untimely release of
counterpart funding, and insufficient donor coordination. The main focus of the proposed project
would be to prioritize the role of the public sector institutions in fisheries development taking account
of the limited human and financial resources, improve the capacity of the public sector institutions for
planning and implementing the priority activities, and improve the data base and regulatory
framework for monitoring developments in the sub-sector. The design would, therefore, be simple
with sharply defined objectives. Use of standard bidding documents would be mandatory under the
proposed project, and that would avoid delays in procurement; detailed procurement schedules would
be prepared for all items to be financed under the project and have been agreed during negotiations.
Unlike other operations, there are not too many donors involved in the fisheries sub-sector, and hence
the problems of poor donor coordination in the sub-sector are not pronounced.
20.   IDA's only experience in the fisheries sub-sector in Ghana was through a FY70 Fisheries
Project. The project was poorly designed; it had no institutional development objective; appraisal was
done without sufficient basic information on fish resources; the studies were not useful since they
were beset with disagreements among the Borrower, the consultant and IDA; and it was not
supervised properly. Elsewhere in the world, the Bank Group had provided US$600 million of
financing for 35 free-standing fisheries projects and a further 60 fisheries components of agricultural
projects in 40 countries, including 13 countries in Sub-Sahara Africa. The programs included
improvement of fishing port and harbor facilities, boat-yards, workshops, access roads, fuel depots,
and water supply facilities; construction of processing, storage, and other marketing facilities and of
fish ponds and hatcheries; purchases of fishing vessels and gear for use by private fishermen; and
technical assistance and training. About half of the projects completed achieved their intended
objectives. The rest had suffered severe cost over-runs, delays in completion, did not result in
strengthened fisheries institutions, and had poor records of credit repayment. The problems stemmed
from technical and administrative weaknesses in the implementing agencies, and from the Bank



- 5 -
Group's limited fisheries expertise and technical input di'ring the process of design, appraisal, and
supervision. Similar problems continue to plague the existing portfolio. The lessons learned have
been incorporated in the design of the proposed project.
21.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project is fully consistent with the Bank
Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and is specifically mentioned in the CAS that was
discussed by the Board on April 14, 1994. The CAS emphasized capacity building, private sector
led development, improved management of natural resources and the environment, and support to
programs that have short life spans and that are locally generated and owned. The focus of the
proposed project would be institutional strengthening and policy reform to improve management of a
key natural resource, and to enhance private sector investment in the fisheries sub-sector. In line with
the CAS, the project would have a short life span of five years. The project was developed by the
Government with active participation of implementing agencies, and taking account of lessons learned
from previous operations (para. 25); that process ensured high quality at entry.
22.   The proposed project would complement IDA's previous support for complementary activities
in livestock and agricultural support services. Despite the good potential for development of both
marine and inland fisheries, the sub-sector had not received previously adequate funding under the
public investment program. The government is now committed to realize that potential by
encouraging private investment, improving the policy and regulatory framework, and strengthening
the institutional framework for public support services. In order to maintain the predominantly
private sector nature of the fisheries sub-sector, government interventions would be confined to the
provision of support services such as extension, research, surveillance of both foreign and domestic
fishers, improved legal and regulatory framework, and infrastructure. This way, the foundation
would be built for attaining the long-term potential of the sub-sector, improving the productivity and
incomes of the large number of fishers and women traders and processors, and diversifying the export
base.
23.   Aereed Actions. Conditions of effectiveness would be: (a) recruitment by the Borrower of
key professional staff of the DOF on terms and conditions which shall be acceptable to IDA at all
times; (b) establishment by the Borrower in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA of a Project
Account with an initial deposit of US$100,000 in local currency to cover counterpart expenditures; (c)
finalization of tender documents for the procurement of vehicles and equipment under ICB, and of
arrangement for the rehabilitation of a research vessel; and (d) adoption by the Borrower of a Project
Implementation Plan acceptable to IDA. Other special conditions: the Borrower to: (a) not later
than September 30 of each year, prepare and submit to IDA, for its review and comment, an annual
training program covering the period twelve months commencing on the following January 1, make
such revisions to such training program as may be appropriate, and except as IDA shall otherwise
agree, carry out the training programs on the basis of such annual training programs; (b) submit to
Parliament a revised fisheries legislation that shall be acceptaUle to IDA not later than June 30, 1996;
(c) remove from inside the 30 meter depth line all trawlers in excess of 50 gross registered tonnage
not later than June 30, 1996; (d) complete the registration of the canoe fleet not later than December
31, 1996; (e) (i) ensure that levies on all vessels other than the canoe fleet have been increased to the
equivalent of one percent of the gross landed value of catch by not later than June 30, 1997, (ii) by
June 30, 1998 review the experience with the initial increase including, tr alia, the adequacy of the
levies and their impact on the industry, (iii) furnish the recommendations of said review to IDA for
review and comments, and (iv) implement said recommendations taking into account IDA's
comments; and (f) submit to IDA not later than December 31, 1996 a strategy for implementing
appropriate fisheries management plans.



-6-
24.   Environmental Aspcts. The environmental category is "B". The overall impact of the
project would be positive. The stock assessment, management plan, improved legal and regulatory
frameworks, and the strengthened capacity of Government institutions to enforce fishing laws and
regulations would all be designed to promote sustainability of the fisheries resources. The project
would promote environmentally sound management of the fisheries resources by communities. Use of
explosives and poisons in fishing would be prohibited, and severe penalties would be imposed on
those who violate the law. The extension program would include training on the harmful effects of
using explosives and poisons, the potential dangers of discarding fishing gear in the waters, the
impact on fishing of oil spills and the need to avoid spilling lubricants and gasoline while fishing, the
importance of timely reporting to the appropriate authorities of accidental oil spills, the importance of
avoiding the dumping in the ocean of human waste in the fishing villages, and other environmentally
sensitive matters. Care would be taken not to introduce exotic fish and pathogens that could be
carriers of communicable diseases, and to avoid the proliferation of aquatic weeds.
25.   Participatory Apnroach. The project was identified and prepared by the Govermnent. First,
the Government organized a national workshop on the fisheries sub-sector to review the development
potential and constraints, and to reach a consensus on a broad development strategy. iollowing the
workshop, a Fisheries Sub-Sector Development Strategy through the turn of this century was
prepared, which was used as a basis for preparing the proposed project. The Government appointed a
team of local consultants to prepare the project, which consulted extensively with farmers,
associations of fishers, traders, professionals from various agriculture-related institutions, NGOs, and
donors in the course of formulating the project. Lessons learned from previous operations have been
incorporated in designing the project.
26.   Proiect Benefits. The main benefit of the project is a major improvement in the management
of the fisheries resources, which would lead to recovery of the fish stock. This, in turn, would allow
for a sustainable increase of between 15,000 and 33,000 tons per year in the production of fish from
the marine and inland fisheries (the lower figure, which is used for computing the Net Present Value
(NPV) and Economic Rate of Return (ERR), is an estimate based on a recovery of only the demersal
fishery, and the higher figure includes estimates of recovery for all fisheries); the long term biological
conservation, protection and sustainability of the resource (alternatively expressed as the prevention of
declines or collapses in fisheries production that would occur in the absence of an appropriate and
effective fisheries managernent regime); the improvement of the economic efficiency, performance
and profitability of the participants in the fishery; improvement of the institutional and policy
frarneworks for sustainable development of the sub-sector; and increased contribution of the sub-
sector to public revenues. The NPV, based on only the recovery of the demersal fishery and using a
discount rate of 12 percent, is estimated at US$28 million. The NPV would be US$80 million if the
benefits include the recovery from all fisheries. The ERR, based on only the recovery of the
demersal stock, is computed at 44.8 percent.
27.   Risks. The main risks are financial (shortage of counterpart funds, a general public finance
problem that affects all the agricultural portfolio), institutional (the DOF is weak relative to the task at
hand and although the project directly addresses this issue, changes in management and administrative
processes and culture may not occur at the pace assumed), and biological (the actual recovery of the
fishery resources could be adversely affected by unforeseen environmental factors such as upwelling).
28.   On project finance, Government has indicated that the shortage of counterpart funds is a
short-term problem, that it in no way implies the sector's low priority in the public investment
program, that it does not expect the problem to continue, and that it intends to allocate the necessary



- 7 -
counterpart resources in the coming budgets. Moreover, the project would generate additional public
revenue, depending on the level and timing of the recovery of the fisheries, some of which could be
used to finance the public expenditures in the sub-sector. Rectification of the institutional capacity
weaknesses is a major component of the project and many of the actions needed to strengthen capacity
of the DOF will be implemented up-front. Most of the training and technical assistance and other
institution building activities are also front-loaded. During implementation, IDA and the Borrower
would conduct detailed annual reviews of implementation, where the focus would be advance
identification of problems and solutions, including institutional capacity and counterpart funding. The
biological risks would be minimized through the environmental quality enhancement aspects of the
project's design. The protection of spawning grounds from fishing, enforcement of mesh and gear
standards and banning the use of traps and explosives in fishing, are designed to protect juveniles, and
to enhance recruitment in the various fisheries and recovery of the fish biomass.
29.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.
