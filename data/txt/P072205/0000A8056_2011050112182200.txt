                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project performance ratings after this ISR are Moderately Satisfactory (MS), both in terms of Project Development Objectives and Implementation Progress (IP). There has been
                         significant progress towards the achievement of targets set for the key performance indicators. At the moment, the project has achieved the targets set for 10 out of the 11
                         intermediate outcome indicators.
                         Overall, there has been some progress since the last ISM review in June 2010:

                         Finally, it is important to say that we are down rating the Project Management and Procurement Management categories due to lack of key personnel during last 6 months of the
                         Project life.
