APPRAISAL OF THE GITARU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Gitaru Hydroelectric Project
on the River Tana in Kenya. The Project is to be built by the Tana River
Development Company Limited (TRDC) and its estimated cost is US$123.6 million
equivalent excluding interest during construction. The Government of Kenya
has asked the Bank to assist in financing the Project and a Bank Loan of
US$63 million, which includes interest during construction of US$8 million
is proposed. The Borrower has obtained Supplier/Export Credit commitments
to finance about 80% of the offshore costs of the main plant contracts. The
remaining costs including interest during construction on the Supplier/Export
Credits and local bank loans are being financed by the Borrower. The loan
would be the Bank's second to the power sector in Kenya.
ii.       The first Loan (745-KE) together with a credit from the Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA), jointly financed the offshore cost
of the Kamburu hydroelectric project. Construction of this project proceeded
satisfactorily, although there was some delay in completion due to slow progress
in the construction of the tailrace tunnel, and the plant went into commercial
operation in July/August 1974, some five months behind schedule. Project costs
increased by about 7% over the appraisal estimate principally because of cur-
rency revaluations, a sales tax, and increased consultants costs. The cost
overrun was financed by the Government.
iii.      The Project consists of an underground power station containing
two 67 MW generating sets (rated at 72 MW for individual operation), and pro-
vision for a third set later; a transmission line about 8 kms in length link-
ing Gitaru with Kamburu and a line about 111 kms in length from Kamburu to
Nairobi.
iv.       Demand for electrical energy in Kenya was growing at a rate of
about 10% per year during the period 1968-1972, falling slightly in 1973 and
1974.  In the three years 1975-1977 the increase of non-industrial demand for
power is expected to fall below its long-term trend due to a projected slow-
down in Kenya's economic growth. However power consumption in the industrial
sector, where some major projects are coming on stream, will increase more
rapidly than in the past, compensating for the reduction in other sectors.
It is, therefore, expected that total power demand in the period .1975-1977
will grow at more than 10%, falling thereafter to an average annual growth
rate of 9%.



v.        The Project is necessary to meet the growth in demand and is the
least cost method of doing so.  It has been compared with the next best alter-
native program which would involve the prior installation of 66 MW of gas
turbine capacity located at Nairobi. The analysis gave an equalizing dis-
count rate of 11% and a sensitivity analysis showed that a 10% increase in
the capital cost of Gitaru reduces this to 10.5% and a 10% reduction in demand
growth reduces it to 9.5%. A combination of the two reduces the equalizing
discount rate to 8%. In these cases, the equalizing discount rate falls below
the range of the opportunity cost of capital, which is estimated at 11% to 13%.
The internal economic return on the project is 14%, which is satisfactory.
It is sensitive to variations in costs and revenues; a 10% increase in costs
reduces the rate to 12% and a reduction in the growth of electricity demand
by 10% leads to a rate of 13.5%. When both coincide it is just under 12%.
vi.       Kenya presently takes a bulk supply of 30 MW from Uganda under a
long-term agreement and hopes to negotiate a further 5 MW under a separate
agreement. There is also potential for a bulk transfer of power from Tanzania
by the early 1980's and the advantages of cooperation between neighbouring
territories in the interchange of power should, together with the development
of geothermal power, be considered in future development planning.
vii.      Three companies are responsible for public electricity supply in
Kenya. The East African Power and Lighting Company Limited (EAP&L), a cor-
poration with widespread private ownership of its stock, was the only one
for many years. EAP&L formed two subsidiaries, the Kenya Power Company
Limited (KPC) and TRDC, with Government participation, in 1955 and 1964,
respectively, to be responsible for specific new projects. TRDC, the second
of these two companies, was charged with development of the Tana River. The
Government has a controlling interest in EAP&L and has acquired all the shares
of TRDC and KPC. EAP&L is responsible for distribution of electricity, and
it supplements its own output by buying in bulk at actual operating cost plus
debt service from the two subsidiaries, which have the main responsibility
for generation. EAP&L staffs and manages the two subsidiaries. EAP&L is a
reasonably well-managed utility and it will be capable of managing TRDC
efficiently when that company has to carry out the Project.
viii.     The financing plan includes provision for a 10% increase in EAP&L's
tariffs from July 1, 1975 together with a fuel surcharge of 4 Kenyan cents
per kWh and the investment of the Government's revenues from EAP&L in TRDC's
equity by the issue of shares of a per value of KL 6 million. This together
with a long-term loan from the Government in the amount of Kb 3.86 million
will enable EAP&L and TRDC to finance the balance of costs not covered by the
Bank loan and Supplier/Export Credits.
ix.       The bulk sales agreement between EAP&L and TRDC requires EAP6L to
purchase from TRDC a minimum amount of power so as to provide sufficient
revenues to meet TRDC's ascertained costs. Additionally a development sur-
charge has been paid by EAP&L to TRDC since 1971, principally to provide the
latter with part of the funds to meet the local costs of the Kamburu project.
It is proposed as part of the costs payable by EAP&L to continue the develop-
ment surcharge which together with a loan from EAP&L to TRDC, will cover part
of the local currency costs of the Project.



- iii -
x.        The financing method described is satisfactory.  The surcharge will
be fixed so as to produce about the same average return on average net fixed
assets including work in progress, for KPC and TRDC combined, as for EAP&L.
This return would be 8-1/2% per year.
xi.       Procurement for works and materials which are to be financed from
the proposed Bank Loan will be on the basis of international competitive bid-
ding. Procurement of equipment and materials to be financed by Supplier
Credits would be on a competitive basis.
xii.      As in the case of Kamburu there are not expected to be any undesir-
able side effects on the ecology of the area, but SIDA who is financing an
ecological study, which is being carried out to determine the effects of
Kamburu on land usage, disease vectors, etc., has agreed to include the area
of the Project in this study.
xiii.     There are conflicting claims on the Upper Tana waters for irrigation
and other purposes and the Tana River Development Authority (TRDA) has been
established to carry out studies to determine the most efficient usage of the
Upper Tana waters. Their consultant's report, which has recently been pub-
lished and is presently being examined by the Government, recommends the
establishment of an Upper Reservoir to regulate the flow of the river. TRDA
had previously recommended to the Government that no further abstraction of
water for irrigation or other purposes which would adversely affect hydroelectric
capacity should be permitted before the Upper Reservoir is constructed. The
Government has no long-term plans for irrigation or other major development in
the Upper Tana but with the construction of the Upper Reservoir by the early
1980's as presently foreseen, such plans would not be adversely affected by
the Project.
xiv.      With the assurances proposed in Chapter 7 the Project would be
suitable for a Bank Loan of US$63 million for a term of 25 years including
5 years grace.

APPRAISAL OF THE GITARU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the Tana River Development Company Limited's
(TRDC) hydroelectric power station at Gitaru in Kenya with an initial capacity
of 134 MW and associated transmission lines. The estimated cost of the Project
is KE 44.1 million (US$123.6 million) excluding interest during construction
on the various loans and credits, aggregating about US$12.4 million. The
Government of Kenya has asked the Bank to assist in financing the Project.
The proposed Bank Loan would be US$63 million which would be used to finance
part of the costs of the civil works, the foreign costs of miscellaneous
electrical and mechanical works and engineering and administration, a manage-
ment review and interest during construction. The Government has obtained
Supplier/Export Credit commitments estimated at Ki 7.79 million (US$21.8
million) to finance about 80% of the foreign exchange costs of the main plant
contracts. TRDC will finance the balance of the project costs, including
interest during construction on the local loans and credits, aggregating about
Kh 18.3 million (US$51.2 million) from (i) surpluses accruing to it, (ii) a
contribution to equity from the Government, and (iii) a long term Government
or local bank loan. The proposed Bank Loan of US$63 million would represent
about 46% of the total cost of the Project.
1.02      This will be the second Bank loan for power in Kenya, Loan No. 745-
KE having been made in 1970 for US$23 million to finance part of the foreign
exchange costs of the Kamburu hydroelectric project. This project was joint-
ly financed, with a SIDA Credit of US$6 million financing the balance of the
foreign exchange. The loan was made to TRDC which is a "paper company" estab-
lished in 1964, for political purposes, to develop the hydroelectric potential
of the Upper Tana River. EAP&L staffs and manages TRDC and buys its entire
output. Since EAP&L is the sole revenue earning company it had to provide
all the assurances normally required of the borrower, and the same requirement
will apply in the case of the loan for the proposed Project.
1.03      Construction of the Kamburu project has proceeded satisfactorily,
although project costs have increased by about 7% over the appraisal estimate.
The cost overrun of about US$2.8 million which has been financed by the Govern-
ment is due principally to currency revaluations, the imposition of a sales
tax during the construction period and to escalation in the costs of super-
vision and other consulting services. Work proceeded broadly in line with
the construction schedule, although time was lost due to slow progress of
construction of the tailrace tunnel through fault sections, and the plant
was commissioned during July/August 1974, some five months behind the target
for completion set at the time the major contracts were awarded.



-2-
Background
1.04      EAP&L commissioned Mlessrs. Merz & McLellan (UK consultants) in
September 1972 to examine and recoirmend a plan of development for the period
1973 through 1992, and to determine the form and location of the power gene-
ration source which would be required by 1978. The report concltuded that
there would be a slight economic advantage in favor of the Gitaru flydroelec-
tric Project but, for a number of reasons including dry year risks and un-
certainties of irrigation abstraction, it would be prudent to construct first
a 120 MW thermal power station at M-lombasa for commissioning in 1978 to be
followed by the Gitaru lhydroelectric project in 1981. This recommendation was
subsequently overtaken by events; following the substantial increases in the
cost of fuel oil during late 1973 and early 1974 the position was re-examined
and it was demonstrated that Gitaru is now the preferred project, that deferment
could no longer be justified for the reasons previously stated and construc-
tion should proceed with a minimum of delay to ensure completion of the Proj-
ect by early 1978.
1.05      EAP&L's consultants for the Kamburu project, Engineering Power
Development Consultants (EPDC) of the UK, had submitted a geology report on
Gitaru in 1970 and, in view of the extent of their previous involvement, EAP&L
decided to engage them for the Gitaru engineering, design and supervision of
the Project. The appraisal originally scheduled for March/April 1974 was post-
poned to allow completion of geological survey work and preparation of an en-
gineering report which was subsequently published in May 1974.
1.06      This report is based.on information provided by (i) EPDC's Draft
Engineering Report of May 1974, and the Supplement to the Draft Engineering
Report of August 1974, (ii) EAP&L, and (iii) an appraisal by Messrs. A.E.
Bailey, E. Bolte, J. Shaukat and P. Owusu in August/September 1974.
2. GENERAL ECONOMY AND THE POWER SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01      Kenya, a country covering an area of 583,000 sq. kms, has a
population of 12.9 million growing at a rate of 3.3% per year. About 90%
(1970) of the total population are living in rural areas, but urban popu-
lation is increasing fast. The main urban centers, the capital Nairobi and
Mombasa, are growing at 9% and 5% per year respectively.
2.02      During the eleven years since Independence in late 1963, GDP at
constant prices has grown at an average rate of 6.7% per year. GDP per capita
reached about US$180 in 1973 ard is the highest in East Africa. Agriculture
dominates Kenya's economy; it produces a livelihood for nearly 90% of the
population and constitutes about one third of GDP. Monetized agriculture has
grown by 6% per year; 45% of the country's foreign exchange earnings are agri-
cultural exports (mainly coffee, tea, and meat products). Industry has grown
at about 8% per year during the last decade; its output is now about 12% of



- 3 -
GDP. Services, including tourism, had a high growth rate and account for 28%
of GDP. In response to the serious impact of world inflation, including the
oil prices, on Kenya's economy, the Government has adopted an action program
to restructure the economy. While this will hopeful]y bring about a high
growth rate in the long run, growth in the next few years will be below pre-
vious performance as a result of the serious balance of payments constraint.
Energy Resources
2.03      The known main indigenous energy resource is hydroelectric power.
Its physical potential is estimated at over 30,000 GWh half scattered over
small rivers mostly uneconomic to exploit. The Tana River accounts for the
other 15,000 GWh of which about 2,700 GWh is economically exploitable. Sur-
veys have shown no coal seams of economic value 1/ and the geological structure
of most of Kenya seems to preclude the occurrence of oil except in a strip
bordering Somalia in the northeast. Imported oil is processed in the refinery
in Mombasa, which was enlarged in 1974 to a capacity of 3.3 million tons per
year. Furnace oil for electricity generation at EAP&L's main thermal power
station in Mombasa is supplied from the refinery at a price of KSh500 per
ton, compared to KSh90-120 before October 1973. Kenya imports over 30 MW of
electric power at 95% load factor from the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB)
which is also prepared to supply a smaller amount of non-firm power ("spill.
units"), as permitted by plant and energy availability. When the second
stage of Tanzania's Kidatu Power Station is completed (about 1979/80), Kenya
could import for some years, limited amounts (up to 20 MW) of electricity from
Tanzania. There is also the possibility of developing geothermal power by
the early 1980's (see paragraph 2.22 to 2.25).
The Power Sector
2.04      The electricity supply industry in Kenya consists of three companies;
The East African Power and Lighting Company Ltd. (EAP&L), The Kenya Power
Company (KPC) and The Tana River Development Company Ltd. (TRDC). EAP&L
is the sole distributor and it coordinates all sources of power and staffs
and manages the other two companies. The background and description of the
three companies are explained in detail in Chapter 5.
2.05      EAP&L's sales increased at an average of 8% per year during the
period 1964 to 1974 with a tendency towards higher growth rates in recent
years; sales increased by about 10% per year during the period 1968-1972,
falling to just over 8% during 1973 and 1974, compared to 5.5% per year during
the period 1964-1968. The Kenyan economy is expected to have a substantially
lower growth rate during the period 1975-1977 than in the past, which will lead
to a sharp drop in the growth rate of non-industrial power demand. On the other
hand, several new power consuming industries will go into operatirn during this
period, which are largely independent of a temporary reduction of economic
growth in Kenya and the average annual growth rate of industrial power demand

during 1975-1977 is expected to be about 16.5%. Total power consumption will
increase by about 10% per year during this period. In the long term, with an
improvement in the growth rate of Kenya's economy, and with expansion of
industry back to a normal level, electricity demand in Kenya is expected to
return to a growth rate of 9% per year. Detailed statistics for the Inter-
connected System for the period 1970 through 1980 and actual and forecast
sales of GWh during the same period are shown in Annexes 1 and 2.
2.06      With 75 kWh per capita, electricity consumption in Kenya is still
at a low level. Nearly 100,000 household connections give 600,000 to 700,000
people access to electricity, which is 5-6% of the total and about half of
the urban population. 350,000 to 400,000 of the population supplied with
electricity are Kenyans with low incomes, living mostly in high density
housing built by the Government or city councils. This group is presently
growing at an annual rate of about 35,000.
2.07      Domestic electricity consumption increased about 6% per annum
during the last six years but its part in total sales dropped from 19% in
1968 to 15*% in 1974. Low income domestic consumers had a higher rate of
growth of 10% per year, but due to the low consumption per connection (20
kWh per month), such small domestic consumers account for only 1% of EAP&L's
total electricity sales. Depending on the rate of government and city council
construction of low cost housing, annual growth of small domestic electricity
consumption is expected to average 10% until 1980. The growth rate of the
larger domestic consumer will continue at a lower annual rate of between 3%
and 4% improving to 6% by 1980.
2.08      Electricity consumption in the commercial sector increased at 13%
per year between 1968 and 1974, mainly due to the high rate of development
of Nairobi which is the administrative and commercial center of Kenya, and
by 1974 accounted for 26% of total sales. In future, the growth rate in this
sector is expected to be lower, at about 8% per annum.
2.09      Industry is the largest consumer of electricity in Kenya with an
average annual rate of increase of 12% between 1968 and 1974. Industry
presently accounts for 43% of total sales but with substantial new loads
coming up and the demand forecast to increase at a rate of about 13% per
annum, more than half of all electricity supplied in Kenya will be consumed
by the industrial sector by 1980.
Existing Facilities
2.10      Electricity is distributed by EAP&L in four areas of Kenya, namely
the Nairobi district and the Rift, Coast and Western areas (see map).  Gen-
erating plant operated by the three companies (shown in detail in Annex 3)
consists of:



Interconnected Sjstein    Isolated Stations
Hydro                       130 MW
Steam                       65 NW
Diesel                      29 MW                       3.9 MW
Gas Turbine                 30 MW                      _
Total                 254 MW                       3.9 MW
2.11      In addition to the above plant availability, EAP&L takes a 30 MW
bulk supply from the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) under a long-term agree-
ment, extending to year 2005 (see para 2.03), giving a total installed
capacity of 284 MW on the interconnected system. The effective capacity is
268 MW due to the need to derate some of the older diesel and gas turbine
plant.
2.12      The two largest hydroelectric power stations, Kindaruma (44 MW)
and Kamburu (60 MW) located on the Tana River some 70 miles from Nairobi
are owned by TRDC and the 65 MW Kipevu steam.station located at Mombasa
is owned by EAP&L. These three power stations are interconnected with the
Nairobi area by means of 132 kV single circuit transmission lines. One of
the transmission lines between Kamburu and Nairobi is constructed for 275 kV
but there are no plans for operating the line at this voltage before the early
1980's.
2.13      Other installations include seven small hydroelectric developments,
the largest of which are Tana (15.2 MW) and Wainjii (7.4 MW), both run of
river schemes on the Tana River, owned by KPC. The remaining five hydro-
electric installations together with eight diesel-electric power stations
including Nairobi South and the gas turbine generating plant are owned by
EAP&L. All of this plant including the larger power stations described in
paragraph 2.12 above are interconnected by means of 132 kV and 33 kV trans-
mission and subtransmission lines. This system is linked to Uganda by
a 132 KV double-circuit transmission line for the transfer of the 30 MW bulk
power (see paragraph 2.11).  UEB has also supplied  'spill units" under a
supplementary agreement with EAP&L, in accordance with availability of plant,
and EAP&L was hoping to negotiate a further firm bulk supply of 5 MW under
a separate agreement, but with seemingly inadequate plant maintenance in
Uganda and UEB's recent inability, at times, to supply even the 30 MW on a
firm basis, EAP&L is not very hopeful that a further 5 MW will be possible.
EAP&L also operates four isolated diesel electric power stations aggregating
3.9 14W.
2.14      Distribution voltages are 11 KV and 415/240 v.  The supply is
reliable and losses at 15% of units sent out are reasonable.



-6-
Future Development
2.15      The construction of the third Kamburu 30 MW hydroelectric generat-
ing unit (24 MW firm) and the Kipevu No. 7 steam turbine generating unit
(30 MW) are currently in progress with commissioning in each case scheduled
for 1976. The Project (134 MW) is scheduled for commissioning in 1978 and
it is expected that the third generating unit will be required by 1982.
Further thermal back-up plant will be required by 1981 and EAP&L is provision-
ally planning for the first 60 MW steam generating unit at a new Mombasa
power station to be commissioned by 1980/81 but firm proposals must await
the outcome of the current geothermal exploration program (see paragraphs
2.22-2.25). The capacity of the existing 132 KV line between Mombasa and
Nairobi is 58 MW and a second line constructed for 275 KV will be required
by the early 1980's.
2.16      The advantages of cooperation between neighboring territories in
the interchange of power must also be considered in future development
planning. It is doubtful if much more than the present 30 MW bulk transfer
will be available from Uganda in the medium term due to a slow down in
planning the development of its own hydro resources during recent years,
but a bulk transfer of power from Tanzania after Kidatu II is commissioned -
by about 1980 - has distinct possibilities. Full cooperation between the
two countries and utilities could defer the next large thermal project and
possibly provide much needed time to get a major geothermal installation
into operation. The possibility of cooperation with Tanzania in the inter-
change of power by 1980 was discussed with EAP&L and the Government during
negotiations but EAP&L were of'the opinion, following talks with the Tanzania
Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) that little spare power could be
made available after 1980 and, since long-term availability could not be
guaranteed they were disinclined at this point in time to consider imported
power from Tanzania in their future development plans.
Rural Electrification
2.17      EAP&L normally apportions 1% of its net operating income to the
development of supplies in the rural areas. Schemes likely to become
financially remunerative in time have been selected from a list of townships
nominated by the Government. This program has been proceeding slowly during
recent years due to financial constraints.
2.18      Additionally, the Government requires that the surplus created
by the difference between the soft terms of the SIDA Credit for the Kamburu
project and the harder on-lending terms to TRDC should be used to finance
an expanded rural electrification program.  SIDA provided consultants to
examine the proposal and put up a program of development.  Despite some
delay, this rural development program is now going ahead; SIDA has made a
bridging grant of Kn423,000 equivalent pending receipt of revenues under
the SIDA Credit on-lending agreement and Swedish staff, comprising a planning
engineer and two construction foremen, has been seconded to EAP&L to take
charge of the program.



- 7 -
2.19      The arrangements provide for all revenues to be paid into a Govern-
ment fund; EAP&L will manage the schemes as these are commissioned, on a
management fee basis and all operating costs will be paid from the fund,
which will thus carry operating losses. Provision is made for EAP&L to
"buy out" schemes as these become viable, and absorb them in their own
organization.
2.20      SIDA is also carrying out a socio/economic study on the effect of
rural electrification in Kenya and the report should be available by mid-
1975. A copy will be made available to the Bank as soon as this is published.
2.21      Rural electrification in Kenya, the market, costs and potential
for development are discussed in Annex 4.
Geothermal Exploration Program
2.22      Geothermal survey and exploration have been in progress, with UNDP
assistance, for the past three years and the first successful exploration/
working well has been drilled in the Lake Naivasha area (two wells had been
drilled at the time of appraisal, one of which was dry). The successful well
is running steam (and a little water) at 240'C in the ground at 31 bars. The
area under test is approximately 7 sq km and the field should, in the opinion
of the UNDP geologist, be capable of supporting a power demand of 400 MN: (80
wells at 20 acres spacing, allowing 5 MW per well).
2.23      This matter was discussed during negotiations and the EAP&L repre-
sentatives advised that two fdrther wells have since been drilled at 200 m
spacing from the successful well. Both wells are running some steam but
insufficient, together with the one successful well, to support a pilot
installation. If the steam flow cannot be improved by other means, it is
proposed to deepen the wells from 1,200 m to 1,700 m. If successful, EAP&L
proposes to drill a further two wells and, contingent upon the recommendations
of a feasibility study (see paragraph 2.24), proceed with a pilot installation.
of at least 10 MW.
2.24      Consultants (SWECO of Sweden) have been appointed to carry out the
feasibility study of exploiting the reservoir and to recommend a program of
development and costs. The study, which was scheduled to start in December
1974 for completion by mid 1975 has been delayed, but EAP&L is hopeful that a
start will be made by mid 1975. Both the Government and EAP&L confirmed their
commitments to the development of Kenya's geothermal potential and, dependent
upon the recommendations made in this study, EAP&L will consider, in addition
to the pilot installation, a large scale drilling program with a view to
establishing a large geothermal power station. The reservoir is located some
12 km from the existing 132 kV double circuit transmission line from Tororo
to Nairobi. and feeding the power into the system should present no problem.



- 8 -
2.25      It is.unlikely that EAP&L would wish to place firm orders for
geothermal plant until working experience has been gained with a pilot
installation and adequate results have been obtained from the drilling.
program. Assuming therefore the program proceeds as envisaged, the pilot
plant could be in operation by 1977, with the main plant ordered by the
late 1970's for commissioning by the early 1980's.
3. THE PROJECT
Description
3.01      The Project is described in detail in Annex 5; it consists of:
(a)  a rock and earth-fill diversion dam, with integral spillway
and vertical intake shafts with short headrace tunnels to the
underground power station;
(b)  an underground power station designed for three 67 MW generating
sets (rated at 72 MW for individual operation) driven by Francis
turbines, with two sets installed under the Project;
(c)  a partially lined tailrace tunnel about 4700 m long emptying
into the Kindaruma reservoir;
(d)  a 132 kV double circuit transmission line from Gitaru to Kamburu
(8 KMf) and a single circuit 275 kV transmission line from
Kamburu to just outside Nairobi (111 KM). This line will
operate initially at 132 kV; and
(e) a management review and a study of EAP&L's tariff structure.
3.02      Gitaru is located between the existing Kamburu and Kindaruma hydro-
electric power stations. The three power stations operate in cascade i.e.,
they all use the same water, one following the other, to generate power, and
Gitaru completes the development of the hydro resources of the Upper Tana
River referred to as the "Seven Forks" development. Gitaru will produce
energy at varying weekly load factors depending not only upon the river flow
but also on the ability of the power system to absorb the energy produced.
The estimated annual output in an average year would be about 750 GWh rising
to 900 GWh when the third unit is installed.
Estimated Cost
3.03      The estimated cost of the Project is Kh44.1 million (US$123.6
million) with a foreign currency component of KL31.1 million (US$87.1 million)
excluding interest during construction. The estimated costs of the principal
features of the Project are shown in the following table and in more detail
in Annex 6.

- 10 -
3.04      Preliminary works comprising, principally, access roads and associated
consultants costs have been completed and have not therefore been included in
the cost estimates. The costs of these works amounting to KE1.286 million were
financed by TRDC by means of a local bank loan of K-1.5 million.
Financing
3.05      The proposed Bank Loan of US$63 million would be used to finance
part of the civil works, the foreign exchange costs of the miscellaneous
electrical and mechanical works and engineering and administration, the
management review 1/ and interest during construction on the Loan. 80% of
the foreign exchange costs of Part B estimated at KE 9.7 million (US$27.2
million), comprising all the major plant, the transmission line, transformers
and substations would be financed through Supplier/Export Credits. Local costs
and the balance of foreign costs of Part B, and the costs of Part A which are
not financed from the Bank Loan, together with import duties, sales tax and
interest during construction on the Supplier Credits and the local loan (para.
3.04) estimated at KL 18.3 million (US$51.2 million) are being financed by the
Borrower.
Basis for Estimates
3.06      The estimates are based on actual lowest tenders received for the
main civil works and plant contracts which were being evaluated at the time
of negotiations. The consultants' knowledge of local conditions and of mate-
rials and labor costs and also their experience with Kamburu has facilitated
a reasonably reliable assessment of additional costs due to risk conditions
and other physical factors. Nevertheless a physical contingency of 20% has
been allowed on civil works to provide for unforeseeable bad rock conditions
and possible delay in project completion. This, together with a 10% physical
contingency for E&M works and an additional 10% on local costs to provide for
delay in project completion is considered reasonable. The price contingency
of 27% is based on an estimated general rate of inflation during the period
of construction. The way in which this contingency is calculated is demon-
strated on page 2 of Annex 6.
3.07      The area to be inundated by the Project is relatively small; there
are no permanent human habitations and cultivations in the area and conse-
quently no provision for resettlement costs has been included in the estimates.
Status of Engineering and Construction
3.08      The Project is being designed by Engineering and Power Development
Consultants of England. This firm or its affiliate, Balfour Beatty and
Company Limited, has been responsible for designing all EAP&L's major devel-
opment projects and for TRDC's Kindaruma and Kamburu hydroelectric power proj-
ects. They are responsible fcr the preparation of all documents and evaluation
of tenders and will superviae construction of the Project.
1/   The study of EAP&L's tariffs is being carried out by the Bank in coopera-
tion with EAP&L's staff.



3.09      The construction program is tight, principally because EAP&L was
obliged to reassess the development program following the large increase in
fuel oil costs during late 1973 and early 1974.  This led to a decision to
defer the proposal for a thermal development at Mombasa and to proceed in-
stead with the Gitaru Project. Fortunately a great deal of the engineering,
geological survey and the associated work had already been carried out. The
present position is that specifications for the civil works and all major plant
contracts have been completed; tenders which were invited at the end of 1974
have been received and evaluated and it is planned to award contracts immedi-
ately after approval by the Board of the Bank Loan. The construction schedule
is shown in Annex 7. As already mentioned, the program is tight but, bearing
in mind the consultants' recent experience with Kamburu and familiarity with
the local conditions, it is achievable providing no unforeseen risk area or
other problem arises. Nevertheless, the cost estimates provide for the possi-
bility of a six-month delay in completion of construction. EAP&L has no plans
to purchase interim gas turbine plant and if it becomes apparent that commis-
sioning is likely to be substantially delayed the possibility of selective load
shedding will be accepted by EAP&L. The consequences would not be serious.
Procurement
3.10      Procurement for works and materials under Part A of the cost esti-
mates, part of which are to be financed from the proposed Bank Loan, will be
on the basis of international competitive bidding. Procurement of equipment
and materials covered by Part B of the cost estimates will be through Supplier/
Export Credits on as wide a competitive basis as possible. It was confirmed
during negotiations that firm commitments have been obtained for 80% of the
foreign costs of plant and equipment to be financed by Supplier/Export Credits.
Completion of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of these credits,
will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Loan.
3.11      In the case of minor items of ecuipment not exceeding USS5O,000
equivalent, contracts will be awgarded, where appropriate, on the basis of
competitive bidding advertized locally, and in accordance with local proce-
dures, satisfactory to the Bank.
Disbursements
3.12      Preliminary works, which have been financed by a local bank loan,
have been completed, but no other work on the Project has commenced other
than the engineering design and preparation of bidding documents, and com-
pletion of geological field works. Because of the late change in develop-
ment plans (see para 3.09) and the consequent need to expedite work on the
project if the expected demand in 1978 is to be met, consultants' expenditures
of US$2 million enuivalent (foreign component USq1.5 million equ.ivalent) will
be incurred prior to loan presentation. These costs have been included in
the cost estimates and the foreign component (USS1.5 million) should be
eligible for disbursement under the Bank Loan.



- 12 -
3.13      With the sole exception of the main civil works, disbursement of
the Bank Loan will be made for the actual foreign exchange cost of equipment,
material and services procured under the Loan and for interest during con-
struction on the Loan. In the case of the civil works, 60% of the payment
under each certified pay certificate will be disbursed from the Bank Loan.
A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 8.
Ecological Aspects
3.14      An ecological study, financed by the Swedish International Develop-
ment Agency (SIDA), is being carried out to determine if ecological changes
are likely to result from the Kamburu project, and to determine what steps,
if any, need be taken to avoid or mitigate any undesirable side effects.
This study is being carried out by Nairobi University staff.
3.15      The cost of the study is estimated at 240,000 Swedish Kroner and
the team carrying out the work comprises 7 groups all qualified in their par-
ticular field, plus 16 field assistants. The University of Nairobi is used
as a base with the team also drawing on the resources of the Government
Research Laboratories.
3.16      SIDA were asked if there would be any objection to the inclusion
of Gitaru within the scope of the study and ho objection was raised providing
this can be carried out within the financial provision of 240,000 Swedish
Kroner. The inclusion of Gitaru in the study has since been confirmed.
I rigation Aspects
3.17      There are conflicting claims on the Upper Tana waters for irrig-
ation and other purposes and, dependent upon the degree of abstraction for
these purposes, the output from Gitaru and the other two hydro power stations
(Kamburu and Kindaruma) would be adversely affected. The effect of abstrac-
tion on Kamburu's output was recognized during negotiations for the Kamburu
loan and the Government agreed, at that time, that Kenya would not commit
itself to a development program which involved abstraction of water from the
Upper Tana and its tributaries upstream of Seven Forks to an extent which
would interfere substantially with the ability of the Borrower to generate
power at Kamburu power station, pending completion of studies to determine
the most efficient usage of the Upper Tana waters. The Tana River Develop-
ment Authority (TRDA) was formed in 1972 to carry out these studies.
3.18      An integral part of the studies is the need to exanine the pro-
posal for an Upper Reservoir which will impound flood waters and permit
regulation of the river to ensure the most efficient usage of its waters
for hydro power and other purposes. TRDA's consultants 1/ started the
1/   TRDA's consultants are:

Studies;
Peat, Marwick and Mitchell (UK) - Management Consultants.



- 13 -
prefeasibility study of the Upper Reservoir on May 1, 1974, and their final
report has been published and is currently being examined by the Government.
3.19      Copies of the report will be made available to the Bank as soon as
this is released by the Government.  In the meantime discussion of this matter
during negotiations elicited the information that the report outlines the cost
of developing storage at the different potential dam sites and makes specific
recommendations for the establishment of the Upper Reservoir.
3.20      The benefits of an Upper Reservoir will include availability of
water for irrigation, public water and rural supplies in the Upper Tana, and
the provision of firm hydro power of about 80 lclq in the average year. It will
not significantly change the amount of energy which can be generated by the
Project (and the other hydroelectric installations) because it only impounds
the flood flow and there are losses due to evaporation. Also there are no sig-
nificant savings in the capacity of standby thermal plant, as total thermal
plant installed by 1985 would be about 250 MW.  However, analysis shows that
the firm energy availability after the Upper Reservoir is constructed will
restult in a reduction of thermal energy output, rising to a maximum of 112
GWh per annum by 1985. On present fuel cost this would represent a saving
of about US$2.5 million equivalent per annum.
3.21      The view of TRDA is that with the population in the Upper Tana
Basin rising to a forecast of 4.5 million (3 million can be supported on rain
fed waters), pressure will mount for the establishment of an Upper Reservoir.
Without it, it is doubtful if any further hydro development after Gitaru will
be possible; further irrigation in the Lower Tana will be limited and there
will be little or no irrigation in the Upper Tana without depletion of hydro
potential. Bearing these facts in mind and also the Importance of fuel savings
which can be made by substituting thermal power with hydro-power, the Board of
TRDA has recommended that no irrigation development in the Upper Tana Basin
should be permitted prior to the development of the Upper Reservoir.
3.22      These matters were also discussed with the Government and EAP&I.
during negotiations; EAP&L intimated that present thinking indicates construc-
tion of the dam during the early 1980's and Government agreed that all neces-
sary measures will be taken to ensure that abstraction of water from the
Upper Tana Basin for large scale irrigation and other major schemes will not
be authorized prior to development of the Upper Reservoir. The Government
has no long-term plans for irrigation or other major development in the Upper
Tana but any such plans maturing after the early 1980's would not be adversely
affected by the Project.

4.  JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
The Power Market
4.01       Past and future trends in EAP&L's sales of KWh have been discussed
in paragraphs 2.05 through 2.09. The latest (1975) EAP&L forecast assumes
an annual increase of sales of 9% in 1975 increasing to 11% in 1976 then falling
to the longer term growth rate of 9% by 1979. This latest forecast, which is
broadly in line with the forecast made at the time of the appraisal, was care-
fully checked by the appraisal mission by making independent surveys and pro-
jections. Taking into consideration all known major developments which are
detailed in Annex 9 and ignoring the possible establishment of a large fertilizer
industry by the late 1970's, the independent survey indicated that EAP&L's fore-
cast was if anything, a little conservative. Their forecasts were therefore
accepted for determining the timing for the next major generation development
program.
Need for Additional Capacity
4.02       The existing generating facilities (see paragraphs 2.10 through
2.13) comprise a blend of thermal and hydro generating plant and since the
hydroelectric power stations are all virtually "run of river" developments
with the storage afforded by the Kamburu dam insufficient to control the river,
the flow available for power generation is not constant throughout the year,
or from year to year. The capacity is lowest during the dry months of the
year (February/March and September/October). Records which have been
maintained since 1947, include 'several dry years with a recurrence period
of 10 years and the generation development program is based on this factor.
4.03      With the commissioning of the Kamburu No. 3 generating unit and
the Kipevu 30 MW steam generating unit in 1976, the Interconnected System
is capable of meeting capacity requirements until 1978 and energy require-
ments until 1979. This is demonstrated by Annex 10 which shows the pro-
jected maximum demand together with the installed and firm capacity and
Annex 11 which shows the energy demand and the dry year productive capability.
Annex 12 shows the energy demand and the average year productive capability.
Difficulty could be experienced in meeting energy requirements during the
September-October dry months of 1978 if it is an exceptionally dry year and
this together with shortage of capacity in that year, indicates that EAP&L
will require additional generating capacity to meet the growing power demand
of the Interconnected System by 1978.
Comparison of Alternatives
4.04      The proposed project represents the first development of the most
economic generation development program in Kenya until 1983. The first step
of the next best alternative development program would be 66 MW of gas turbine
capacity, to be installed in three stages in the Nairobi area. These and
other development strategies have been analyzed, including construction of



- 15 -
a second thermal power plant in Mombasa based on fuel oil or coal, and
import of power from Tanzania. The comparison of the different development
strategies is described in detail in Annex 13.
4.05      The installation of three gas turbines of 22 MW each and the third
unit of Kindaruma power station would postpone the heavy capital expenditure
for Gitaru by three years at the cost of spending more on imported fuel. The
comparison between the proposed strategy with Gitaru as the first stage and
the strategy of postponing Gitaru by three years shows an equalizing discount
rate of 11%, applying shadow prices for the cost of both alternatives and
assuming a slow drop of 2% per year until 1980 in "real" fuel prices. This
is at the lower end of the range of the opportunity cost of capital in Kenya
(estimated at 11% to 13%) and the decision in favor of Gitaru is therefore
close. However, the Government and EAP&L have expressed a strong preference
for Gitaru and this has been accepted as the preferred alternative. The
equalizing discount rate would be reduced to 10% if Kenya would import 20 MW
of relatively cheap hydro power from Tanzania, where excess capacity is
expected to be available from 1980 onward. Kenya already imports a substantial
amount of energy from Uganda (more than 25% of its total consumption in 1974)
which EAP&L feels is no longer entirely dependable (see paragraph 2.13).
Because of this and the Government's reluctance to rely too heavily on imported
power from Tanzania (see paragraph 2.16) and the probability of this not being
available by 1980 when planned, the alternatives which include importing pJwer
from Tanzania have been excluded from further analysis and 11% is the best
estimate of the equalizing discount rate. The rate is sensitive to variations
in the most uncertain factors of the two alternatives. A 10% increase in the
capital cost of Gitaru and the gas turbines reduces the equalizing discount rate
to 10.5% and a rise of 10% in Gltaru's capital cost only, reduces the rate to
10%. A sharp reduction of the fuel costs from their end 1974 level by about
40% until 1980 would reduce the equalizing discount rate to 10%; unchanged
fuel prices during the period of comparison (1975-1983) increase the rate to
12%. If demand growth is 10% lower than projected, the equalizing discount
rate would fall to 9.5%. If two of the three changes from the basic estimates--
an increase in Gitaru's capital cost, a substantial fall in fuel prices, a drop
in projected demand growth--occur simultaneously the equalizing discount rate
would be reduced to about 9% and if all three occurred simultaneously the rate
would drop below 8%. These rates are lower than the opportunity cost of capital
in Kenya. However, such a combined development of prices and demand growth is
improbable and the comparison of different development strategies demonstrates
that Gitaru is the most economic project to meet the increase of power demand
between 1978 and 1981.
Economic Rate of Return
4.06      The economic rate of return, which relates economic pro,ect capital
and operating costs to the revenue attributable to it, is 14%. Economic
project costs used in the calculation differ from financial costs due to the
use of a 75% shadow price ratio for unskilled labor and of a shadow rate
which is 33Z above the official exchange rate. The economic rate of return
was subjected to sensitivity tests. A reduction in revenues due to a 10%



- 16 -
lower demand growth reduced the rate of return to about 13.5% and a 10% increase
in capital and operating costs reduces it to about 12%. If the cost increase
and the reduction in demand growth coincides, the economic rate of return would
be a little below 12%, which is still satisfactory. The assumptions and metho-
dology underlying these calculations are described in Annex 14.
5.  THE BORROWER - TANA RIVER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED
Structure of the Electricity Supply Industry
5.01      Of the three companies which comprise the electricity supply in-
dustry in Kenya (see paragraph 2.04) EAP&L, which is the sole distributor,
was founded in 1922 by the amalgamation of two private companies which had
supplied Nairobi and Mombasa since 1907 and 1909. Both KPC and TRDC were
created by EAP&L, the former in 1955 principally to finance the intercon-
nection with Uganda and sell to EAP&L power imported, and the latter in
1964 to develop the potential of the Tana River. At the time these companies
were formed, the stock of EAP&L was privately owned by a large number of
shareholders. Almost all of the capital raised for KPC and TRDC was loan
capital. EAP&L shared the ownership of the nominal equity with the Govern-
ment which became the owner of one third of KPC's equity capital and one
quarter of TRDC's. A brief description of the history of the power companies
is in Annex 15.
5.02      The Government in 1969 decided to obtain control of EAP&L by
purchasing its shares. As a result of market purchases and a bid made early
in 1970 for all the Company's shares on the London stock register, the
Government became, in July 1970, the majority shareholder in the company
and consequently of KPC. The Government acquired all the shares of TRDC and
KPC in February 1971.
5.03      Government has accepted that rationalization of the structure of
the power industry could best be achieved by integrating all three companies.
However, this cannot be achieved immediately; about 6Stg. 3.2 million of debenture
stock in KPC is held by outside shareholders - chiefly the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) with a IStg. 3.17 million holding. Government,
which holds the rest, intends to gradually buy up the miscellaneous share-
holders and when this is completed it intends to negotiate with CDC for the
purchase of CDC's hStg. 3.17 million holding on completion of which, the merger
of TRDC and KPC can proceed. In the case of EAP&L, Government and its
associated institutions, which together hold about 60% of the equity, are
continuing to buy up shares on the Nairobi register as and when these become
available. When a sufficiently large holding is acquired and TRDC and KPC
are merged, the merger of all three companies can proceed. The target for
completion is difficult to forecast, but the present arrangement, whilst
complicated, is operating efficiently and it is not of significant importance
if this cannot be achieved in the short term.



- 17 -
5.04      EAP&L purchases the entire output of KPC and TRDC at ascertained cost
(see para. 6.02 for definition) and is the only company with surplus revenue
earning capacity. The funds required to enable the proposed borrower to cover
its operating expenses, pay its debt service and meet the local currency costs
of the Project must therefore come from EAP&L, and appropriate arrangements
are necessary to assure TRDC's revenues. Discussions were held with the
Government and EAP&L during negotiations concerning these matters and agree-
ment was reached on the continuation of the development surcharge, agreed
during the Kamburu negotiations, to meet the needs of TRDC's development pro-
gram. It was also agreed during negotiations that since the Bulk Supply Agree-
ment refers to all the Seven Forks hydro developments, including Gitaru, the
amendment agreed at the time of the Kamburu negotiations concerning the pur-
chase of a minimum amount of power to provide sufficient revenues to meet
TRDC's ascertained costs, applies equally to Gitaru and no further amendment
is necessary.
5.05      It was also confirmed during-negotiations that a generating station
licence, which is required under the Electric Power Act, would be issued in
respect of the Project. The issue of the licence will be a condition of effec-
tiveness of the proposed loan.
Organization and Management
5.06      EAP&L is a reasonably well managed utility and is operated in
accordance with sound commercial principles. The Chairman, a Kenyan, is
a competent administrator and many of the senior management staff are ex-
patriates with wide experience in public utilities. The Board of Directors
consists of nine members including the Chairman and General Manager of the
company and two government representatives; the remaining five members are
leading Kenyan businessmen.
5.07      The staff of EAP&L at December 31, 1974 inclusive of staff attached
to KPC and TRDC, numbered 2914 which includes 120 expatriate professional
staff, (includes 38 Asian non-citizens) and 369 senior local staff. The
number of connected consumers was just over 112,000 and consumers per
employee about 38. This suggests the company is rather top heavy in staff
but this is acceptable bearing in mind the number of installations (some 21
power stations spread over Kenya), the distances involved and the amount of
construction work carried out by the company.
5.08      The number of expatriate professional staff has fallen from 189
in 1970; maintaining the establishment at full strength and at the same time
avoiding a deterioration in the quality of staff are continuing problems.
The expatriate staff have generally been replaced with qualified local staff,
but there are a number of vacancies which EAP&L is having difficulty in filling
and there is a high turnover of remaining expatriate staff with the new ex-
patriate staff recruited usually of a lower calibre than the staff they have
replaced. For these reasons the standard of management of the companies has
deteriorated since the Kamburu project was appraised in 1970.



- 18 -
5.09      There is no quick solution to this problem and the situation can
only be relieved as the establishment becomes progressively more Kenyanized.
In the meantime EAP&L will have to rely on expatriates for some years ahead
but to a decreasing extent as qualified Kenyans can be trained to replace them.
5.10      Although EAP&L is still well managed there are weaknesses in its
internal reporting system and there are aspects of its top managerent structure
which merit investigation. For instance, the need for a General Manager in
addition to the full-tine executive Chairman is questioned. Also, since the
Assistant General Mtanager (Engineering) retired, the post appears to have
been abolished and, as a consequence, there are four Chief Engineers at
EAP&L's headquarters all operating independently with no coordinating manager
(EAP&L has since created a post for a Chief Coordinating Engineer.) The same
applies to the Districts where there are three District Engineers and a
District Accountant, but no District Manager. A brief investigation raises
doubts that (a) EAP&L's internal reporting system is producing the informa-
tion required for efficient management and (b) the computer is being used in
the most efficient manner possible. These matters were discussed during
negotiations and agreement was reached with EAP&L to appoint consultants
satisfactory to the Bank to carry out a review of the management structure of
EAP&L, the recommendations arising therefrom to be jointly examined by the
Bank and EAP&L and all such recommendations as are mutually acceptable to be
implemented by EAP&L.
5.11      The present staff are competent to operate the companies, to
carry out the Project with the assistance of consultants, and to carry out
other works covered by EAP&L's development program. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that TRDC will continue to employ consultants satisfactory
to the Bank in carrying out the Project.
5.12      The additional responsibilities to be incurred by TRDC if it is
to carry out and successfully operate the Project will necessitate a revision
of the agreement by which EAP&L manages TRDC. The amendment should provide
that EAP&L will make available to TRDC comprehensive management services
relevant to Gitaru which are not provided under the present agreement. It is
important also to ensure that EAP&L is under sound management at all times
and is capable of continued efficient operation. These matters were discussed
during negotiations and agreement was reached with EAP&L on the following points:
(a) the need for consultation with the Bank about changes
in the appointments of Chief Coordinating Engineer and
Chief Accountant;
(b) the need for revision to the Management Agreement, to include
the operation and management of the Gitaru hydroelectric
development within the scope of the Agreement.
The revision of the management agreement in a form satisfactory to the Bank
will be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank Loan.



- 19 -
5.13      EAP&L will also be required to enter into the covenants usually
made by the beneficiary of a Bank Loan with respect to operating in accord-
ance with sound business, public utility and financial practices, insurance
and exchange of information with the Bank.
Training
5.14      It is EAP&L's intention to fill all senior posts with Kenyan nationals
as quickly as suitably qualified staff can be brought forward. To achieve
this EAP&L has a training program which is tailored to meet its foreseeable
requirements. The scheme depends mainly upon the local university. EAP&L
sponsors 6 entrants annually and, given a three year course, there are 18 in
the stream at any given time. On completion of the university course the
student does 2 years post graduate work training, usually overseas, before
being absorbed into the workforce for on the job training. The output from
the local university is frequently augmented with direct appointments of
government sponsored students from overseas universities. The program will
be reviewed from time to time and the number of sponsored students will
gradually be reduced to a level commensurate with the normal expansion and
turnover requirements. At the time of the appraisal 21 electrical and 3
mechanical engineers were in the program (including engineers on post grad-
uate training).
5.15      EAP&L also operates a well staffed and equipped residential train-
ing school for all grades of staff up to technician level. Recruits are taken
straight from school (after a minimum of 7 to 11 years of education) for
training as craftsmen and technicians. The two categories go into separate
induction courses but the basic.training is the same for both groups. This
consists of the school classroom and simple workshop training for the first
9 months, followed by a 3 month course at the local polytechnic, then alternate
3 months at the training school and the polytechnic for the next 12 months.
At the end of two years they are trade tested and starting from the third
year the courses differ; the craftsmen continue for a further year at the end
sf which they qualify for a Grade II trade test certificate but the technicians
go on for a further three years, alternating 3 months at the polytechnic with
3 months in the field, and at the end of 5 years qualify for a full technology
certificate.
5.16      This is probably one of the most efficient utility operated
training schools in East Africa; the courses are well organized and being
residential, the students are well fed and housed and the "turn out" is
of a high standard; the intake is 30 per year; 20 for technician training
and 10 for craftsman training.
5.17      There is no sponsored training program for accountants as, usually,
requirements can be met from local university students who pass oat with
appropriate accounting qualifications. Because of the wide demand for such
qualified Kenyans, it is not easy to maintain the establisment (12) at
strength (there were 2 vacancies as of September 1974). Clerical staff
present no problem as they receive adequate on-the-job training.

6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction
6.01      The activities of the three companies comprising the power sector
in Kenya are closely connected through common management. The financial
position of the borrower, TRDC, should not therefore be evaluated in isola-
tion, but jointly with that of KPC and EAP&L. The published financial state-
ments of KPC and TRDC are prepared on the basis of cash accounting, consistent
with the definition of ascertained cost on which their revenues are determined.
It has therefore been necessary, in their case, to prepare pro forma statements
which assume the use of conventional depreciation accounting so that their
earnings and financial position can be compared with those of EAP&L in accor-
dance with the key factors customarily used by the Bank to appraise public
utility projects. These statements are presented in Annexes 16 to 20 covering
the period 1972-1974 (actual) and 1975-1980 (estimated). Assumptions made in
these statements are given in Annex 21 together with explanatory notes.
6.02      The revenues of KPC and TRDC are determined on the basis of "ascer-
tained cost" as defined in their respective bulk-supply agreements. Ascertained
cost is described in greater detail in Annex 21 and, stated briefly, comprises
operating and administration costs, interest,and redemption payments for debt,
income and other taxes and an amount to meet abnormal expenses and a part of
the development expenses.
Past Operations and Present Financial Position
6.03      As will be seen from Annex 16 (a), TRDC had net assets (fixed assets,
investments and working capital) of over Kh 20 million at the end of 1974.
While virtually all of these assets had been financed by borrowing, about 23%
of the foreign debt was payable in sterling, and the net gain from the deval-
uation of the pound from time to time since 1967 is reflected as a part of
equity.  The debt equity ratio at the end of 1974 was 84/16.  By the end of
1978 after completion of the project, net assets are expected to be about KL 69
million and the debt equity ratio 73/27, which is higher than normally would be
considered desirable, but it is more significant to consider the financial posi-
tion of TRDC on a combined basis with the other two companies (paragraph 6.06).
6.04      During the period 1972-1974, the earnings of EAP&L were satisfactory.
The rate of return for the period 1972-1974 was 9% and was lower than for the
bulk supply companies in 1972 and 1973 and higher in 1974 as a result of pay-
ment of the Development Surcharge (see Annex 21) to TRDC during the years 1972
and 1973 which was more than required to equalize the rate and less than the
required amount in 1974. If the correct amount of Development Surcharge was
paid during this period, the rate of return would have been almost 10%. The
financial covenants of the IBRD loan 745-KE require that the minimum rate of
return in 1972 through 1974 should be 9.5% and 8% thereafter.
6.05      EAP&L uses depreciation accounting and, as will be seen from Annex
19 (a) it is conservatively capitalized. At the end of 1973 its total net
assets were about K6 25.6 million and its debt equity ratio was 29/71. By



- 21 -
the end of 1978 EAP&L's net assets are expected to be about KL 32 million,
and its debt equity ratio 27/73.
6.06      The combined balance sheet contained in Annex 20 (a) shows that,
at the end of 1974, the total net assets of the three companies were K647
million and the debt equity ratio was 51/49. By the end of 1978, the total
net assets are estimated to be about KE 100 million and the debt equity ratio
56/44. It is apparent, therefore, that on a combined basis, the three companies
are conservatively capitalized.
6.07      The effect of currency rate fluctuations in the past has had no
adverse effect on the foreign currency debt of the company as the official
rate of exchange of the Kenya shilling has remained quite stable. It was
agreed during negotiations that the rate of return covenant would make provision
for the revaluation of assets, annually, on a price index to be agreed between
EAP&L and the Bank to take into account the increases in the replacement cost
of fixed assets as well as the fluctuations of the exchange rate of Kenya
currency.
6.08      Annex 20(a) indicates that the three companies have adequate
working capital and satisfactory cash positions. The cash forecasts have
been made on a conservative basis and internal generation of funds may be
higher than estimated. There has been a good control of debtors, accounts
receivable amounted to only a little more than six weeks' billing at the end
of 1974. Net income of the three companies for the years 1972, 1973 and 1974
(Annex 20(b)), expressed in million K& was 3.19, 2.34 and 2.09 as against the
estimates of 2.00, 2.07 and 2.38, respectively, and show a satisfactory posi-
tion, except for 1974 when there was a decline, caused principally by higher
fuel prices.
EAP&L's Tariffs
6.09      On the basis of a consultant's study, new uniform tariffs were in-
troduced throughout the country in May 1968, and present rates brought in an
average revenue of 23 Kenya cents or 3.2 US cents per kWh in 1973. In 1974
a fuel oil surcharge was added to the tariff which allows EAP&L to recover
from its consumers the bulk of the increase in the cost of fuel used in
power generation. The tariff structure in its differentiation between class-
es of consumers, which is discussed in detail in Annex 22, now requires further
review. Such a review is being carried out jointly by the Bank and EAP&L.
Recommendations arising from the review will be discussed and agreed with the
Government before implementation.
Proposed Financing Plan
6.10      The financing plan agreed during negotiations includes an increase
i. EAP&L's tariffs by an average of 10% and a new fuel oil surcharge at 4
Kenya cents per kWh to replace the present surcharge, both from July 1, 1975,
continuation of the development surcharge payable by EAP&L to TRDC, issue to
the Government of Kenya of TRDC shares of par value of KE 6 million and a
local loan of KE 3.86 million. The development surcharge serves to provide



- 22 -
the two bulk supply companies TRDC and KPC, with a rate of return which is
similar to that of EAP&L. EAP&L has suggested that, as TRDC's cash requirements
during the construction period of Gitaru project will be considerable, the rate
base should be inclusive of work in progress in order to provide a larger amount
of development surcharge to TRDC than would be provided if the rate base used
was exclusive of work in progress. This will also reduce the income tax burden
of the power sector during the construction period of the Project by increasing
TRDC's income which is exempt from income tax and by reducing EAP&L's taxable
income. This suggestion which is reasonable has been used for calculation of
the development surcharge from 1975 in the financial statements. On this basis,
the surcharge is estimated to make available about K67 million from 1975
through 1978 (compared with less than KM million if the rate base excluded
work in progress). Thus the balance of the project costs other than those costs
financed through the proposed Bank Loan and Supplier/Export Credits will be pro-
vided by the continuation of the development surcharge, a loan of KL 2 million
from EAP&L to TRDC, and the balance under a Government commitment of an equity
subscription of KE 6 million and a loan of not less than Kn 3.5 million (assumed
to be KE 3.86 million in the financing plan). Completion of arrangements to
provide the financing under the Government commitment will be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Bank Loan.
6.11      A forecast of TRDC's sources and application of funds for the period
1975-1980 is presented in Annex 16(c). The financing plan of TRDC for the
project construction period 1975-1978 along with that of the three companies
combined is given below:

6.12      It is more significant to consider the financing plan on the basis of
the combined sources and requirements of the three companies, eliminating inter--
company payments, as though they were merged into one company. The forecast
of the combined requirements and sources of funds on this basis, of TRDC, KPC
and EAP&L for the period 1975-1980 is presented in Annex 20(c). The financing
plan summary of the three companies given in the table in the preceeding para-
graph shows that, of the total construction and working capital requirements
of the three companies for 1975-1978, 27% would be financed by net internal
cash generation after providing for debt service and dividends, 10% from in-
crease in share capital and the balance by borrowings: 36% by the proposed
IBRD loan, 11% by Suppliers' Credits and 16% by other loans. As indicated in
Annex 20(c), the internal cash generation covers the annual debt service
requirements by an ample margin ranging from an estimated 2.6 times in 1978
to about 1.9 times in 1979 which is adequate.
6.13      It was agreed during negotiations that if additional funds are re-
quired to complete the project because of cost overruns, or due to outside
loans and credits being insufficient, the Government would make satisfactory
arrangements to provide additional financing requirements.
Future Earnings
6.14      Forecasts of revenues and expenses are attached for TRDC (Annex 16
(b)), for TRDC and KPC combined (Annex 18(b)) for EAP&L (Annex 19(b)), and for
the three companies combined (Annex 20(b)).
6.15      The development surcharge has been calculated to provide the same
rate of return for KPC/TRDC combined and for EAP&L, measured in terms of net
operating income as a percentage of average net assets including work in
progress. The rate of return is estimated to average 8.7% during 1976-1978
and 9.1% during 1979-1980.
6.16      It was agreed during negotiations that EAP&L would take all necess-
ary steps to ensure that its net operating income for any year is not less
than 8-1/2% of its average net fixed assets including work in progress. The
Government agreed that it would take or cause to be taken all action necessary
to permit EAP&L to obtain revenues sufficient to yield this rate of return.
Accounts and Audit
6.17      It was agreed during negotiations that the financial statements of
TRDC and KPC, individually and combined, will be prepared on depreciation
accounting basis and that the financial statements of TRDC/KPC as so prepared
will be combined with those of EAP&L. It was also agreed that the annual
accounts of TRDC, KPC and EAP&L, including the accounts on depreciation basis
for TRDC and KPC, would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank, and that copies of the certified financial statements and of the auditor's
reports would be submitted to the Bank.



- 25 -
Debt Limitation
6.18      Debt service coverage is relevant only in relation to the combined
position of the three companies particularly because of the equated rate of
return requirement for KPC/TRDC and EAP&L (paragraph 6.10), and the debt
service of the bulk supply companies KPC/TRDC being payable by EAP&L as a
part of ascertained cost (Annex 21). It was agreed during negotiations that
no long term-debt would be incurred without prior Bank approval, unless cash
earnings before provision for depreciation are at least 1.5 times the maximum
debt service for any succeeding fiscal year, on all debt including the debt
to be incurred. This test is made on the basis of combined revenue accounts
and debt service, eliminating inter-company payments and assuming conventional
depreciation accounting.
Security Arrangements
6.19      Annex 23 describes the security arrangements for the loan capital
of EAP&L, KPC and TRDC. The outstanding foreign debt of TRDC, estimated to
be about US$38 million equivalent in 1974 is secured, except for the SIDA
loan of about US$7 million, by a floating charge or lien on all present and
future assets. The Bank has a pari passu charge on these assets for Loan
745-KE and consent of the-existing creditors of TRDC will be required for
securing the proposed Bank loan also on a pari passu basis. Completion of
the legal formalities finalizing the arrangements will be a condition of
effectiveness of the loan.
Project Monitoring System
6.20      Proposed guidelines for a project monitoring system which are
presented in Annex 24 were discussed and agreed with EAP&L.
7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations the following issues were raised with the
Government and satisfactory agreement or assurances obtained with regard to:
(a) abstraction of water from the Upper Tana Basin for large
scale irrigation development and other purposes, which
should not be authorized prior to development of the Upper
Reservoir (para. 3.22);
(b) the Government commitment in the financing plan for the
Project (para. 6.10); and
(c) provision of any additional financing which might be required
to complete the Project in accordance with arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.13).

7.02      During negotiations the following issues were raised with EAP&L
and satisfactory agreement or assurances obtained with regard to:
(a)  the availability of credit financing (para. 3.10);
(b) the engagement of consultants satisfactory to the Bank
to carry out a management study, the recommendations
arising therefrom to be jointly examined by the Bank
and EAP&L (para. 5.10);
(c) the employment of consultants satisfactory to the Bank
in carrying out the Project (para. 5.11);
(d) consultation with the Bank about any changes in the appoint-
ments of Chief Coordinating Engineer and Chief Accountant
(para. 5.12(a));
(e) revision to the Management Agreement to include the operation
and management of the Project (para. 5.12(b));
(f) operation in accordance with sound business, public utility
and financial practices, insurance and exchange of information
with the Bank (para. 5.13);
(g) the continued employment of auditors satisfactory to the
Bank and the submission to the Bank of copies of annual
auditors reports and certified financial statements for
EAP&L, TRDC and KPC Cpara. 6.17);
(h) a limitation on the amount of long-term debt which may be
incurred by EAP&L, TRDC and KPC (para. 6.18); and
(i) obtaining consent of the existing creditors of TRDC for
securing the proposed Bank Loan on a pari passu basis
(para. 6.19).
7.03      During negotiations the following issues were raised with the
Government and EAP&L and satisfactory agreement or assurances obtained with
regard to:
(a) continuation of the development surcharge (para. 5.04);
(b) the issue of a generating station licence in respect to the
Project (para. 5.05); and
(c) the minimum rate of return on net fixed assets in operation
and under construction which should be not less than 8-1/2%
per year and revaluation of assets annually which will be
on a price index to be agreed between EAP&L and the Bank
to take into account the increases in the replacement value
of fixed assets (paras. 6.16 and 6.07).



- 27 -
7,04      The following events will be conditions of effectiveness of the
proposed loan:
(a) completion of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness
of the credit financing (para. 7.02(a));
(b) completion of arrangements evidencing the Government Commit-
ment (para. 7.01(b));
(c) issue of a generating station licence for the Project
(para. 7.03(b));
(d) revision to the Management Agreement (para. 7.02(e)); and
(e) completion of the legal formalities finalizing the security
arrangements (para. 7.02(i)).
7.05      Subject to the foregoing assurances the Project will be suitable
for a Bank Loan of US$63 million for 25 years including a grace period of
5 years.

Rural Electrification in Kenya; the Market, Costs, and Potential for Development
Population Centers
1.        The total population of Kenya is about 12.9 million of which about
1.5 million live in the larger towns, about 9 million live in the fertile
agricultural areas, which comprise about 10% of the land area of 583,000 sq
kms and the balance of about 2.million are settled over the remaining 90%
of the land area of the country. The classification of population centers
are described below.
Urban Center
Population of more than 5,000 and containing a full range of
services associated with a town. Serves a hinterland of some 120,000 people
and houses the main district administrative offices of the area. Contains
health, education, postal, shopping, banking and hotel facilities and an
airstrip. Included under this heading are all the major towns excluding
Nairobi.
Rural Center
Serves a hinterland of some 40,000 people and is a focus of local
trade and commerce. Contains local divisional administrative offices and
police, health, social, education, market, postal and banking facilities to
a lower level than an Urban Center.  Will have a resident population of
between 1,000 and 5,000.
Market Center
Serves an area of at least 150 sq kilometers with a minimum
hinterland population of 15,000. Contains education, health, social, market,
postal and police facilities to a lower level than a Rural Center. Will not
have a large residential population.
Local Center
Serves populace within walking distance of that center. In well
populated areas will have a hinterland of some 50-70 square kilometers
containing a minimum of 5,000 people. Will have a primary school, medical
dispensary, postal agency, shops and an open market. Not intended as an
administrative center.

2.        All the centers in Kenya are defined in one or other of the above
classifications and although not all the facilities described exist in
every case, they are gradually being introduced. No firm figures are
available but the 1974-1978 Development Plan forecasts the number of
centers showing those which it is hoped will be receiving a public supply
of electricity by the end of 1974 and 1978 respectively.

Basic Cost of Rural Electrification
Tne cost of electrifying rural areas in Kenya can be based on the following
approximate 1974 costs:
33,000 volt lines - Kb 1,200 per km
Medium voltage distribution - KX 700-1,000 per km
Transformers - KL 10-50 per KVA depending upon size and whether
single or three phase
Service Lines - Kb 15-35 per service
W'here the center is remote from the existing network (of the remaining
centers in the country, these are now probably in the majority) diesel
generating plant has to be installed. The cost per KVA of such plant is
of the order of Kb 250-300.
Principal Usage and Revenues
The principal use of electricity by consumers in rural areas is for lighting
and with an estimated per capita income of KE 40 per annum in the rural areas,
potential revenues are limited. Annual consumption for lighting for houses
and shops is 80-90 kWh with an after diversity maximum demand of about
0.05 kW per consumer. Other types of load in rural areas are:
(i) The maize mill, situated in all rural and most market centers.
This has a loading of between 10 and 30 HP and a consumption
of between 6,000 and 12,000 kWh per year;



ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 3 pages
(ii) Irrigation and water pumping, generally located outside the
centers; load and consumption is difficult to define as it varies
considerably from center to center.
What little industry there is in the rural areas tends to be associated
with tea, coffee, rice and cotton production.
Revenues and of course, costs of supply, vary considerably, dependent upon
the remoteness of the center and its population and type of supply.
Typical average annual revenues in 1974 are:
Domestic Consumer   -   KL 6-12
Shop                 -   Kb 12
Maize Mill           -   Kb 200
General
It is generally accepted that the electrification of rural areas will have
an ultimate impact on the social, commercial and industrial activities of
the community and will tend to check the migration to the larger towns.
The rural electrification program in Kenya has not been in existence for a
sufficient period for any definite trend to become apparent in this respect.

GITARU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
TANA RIVER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED
Detailed Description of the Project
1.        That stretch of the River Tana which lies between existing
hydroelectric installations at Low Tana, (upstream) and Kindaruma
(downstream) falls about 270 m over a distance of 94 km. The steepest
gradients are however, concentrated in the downstream region of the
stretch, and it is here that most of the power potential lies. A study
of this potential and of future demands for power, indicated that it
would be advantageous to develop the river in two stages, stage 1 between
km 64 and 80 (measured down the river), and stage 2 between km 80 and 94t9
and to consider the upstream region as a site for a major reservoir, wfith
limited power output, possibly for development later on. Stage 1 of this
arrangement, the Kamburu development designed for three 30 14HW generating
units but initially comprising 2 units was commissioned in July 1974.
Stage 2, the Gitaru development which is located between Kamburu and
Ki-ndarama at approximately km 83, constitutes the Project.
2.        The Project comprises a low diversion dam with an integral
spillway, vertical intake shafts with short headrace tunnels to the under-
ground power station and a along tailrace tunnel to the Kindaruma reservoir.
The power station would be designed for 3 units each of 67 Mi output when
operating together and rated at 72 MW to take advantage of the increased
head available when operating individually. The Project includes only
the first two units but the constructional works include provision for
the third unit. Principal data for the Project are listed in the table at
the end of this Annex.
Geology
3.        The geology of the area was initially investigated between March
and June 1969, at the same time as the geological investigations for the
Kamburu development were carried out and copies of the consultants report
were sent to the Bank. There were some areas where further investigations
remained to be done and the program of work to complete these investigations
which was started in March 1974 comprised principally a drilling program
along the tailrace tunnel and in the area of the underground power house.
The predominant rocks in the area are gneisses, forming part of a geolog-
ical structure known as the Basement Complex System.
4.        In the bed of the river, hard rock exists over most of the area
to be covered by the dam except in the main channel some 20-25 m wide where
rock is decomposed and has been eroded to a depth of about 5 m and where
sealing would have to be carried out against percolation of water under
pressure. The dam would be 30 m high and would have a crest length of 580 mn;



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 4 pages
soil overlaying weathered rock would have to be removed (approximately 3 m on
the right bank and averaging 6 m on the left bank) to obtain suitable founda-
tions.
5.        The site of the power station was considered proven at the time of
the appraisal b-ut its final alignment was to be selected after consideration
of the latest-geological data which was not at that time available. There
would seem to be no likely problems with the tailrace tunnel; in the main, the
rock appears competent enough but there are likely to be short lengths which
will require support and from the geophysical traverse, it would seem that
part of the last 1,000 m could also require lining.
Hydrol6gy
6.        The River Tana is a typical tropical river having two flood seasons
and two dry seasons per year. The largest flows generally occur in April-June
as a consequence of the "long rains"; high flows occur again in November -
December from the "short rains". Low flow periods are February-March when the
flow has dropped occasionally to 17 cumecs and during the period September-
October when the minimum flow is usually above 30 cumecs. The Gitaru reservoir
is quite small (16 million m3t and the Kamburu reservoir, with its live stor-
age capacity of 123 million mi  and minimum discharge of 40 cumecs provides
seasonal storage also for the Kindaruma and Gitarupower developments.
Installed Capacity and Energy Output
7.        The storage afforded by Kamburu dam is insufficient to control the
river, so the flow available for power generation from GLtsru would not be con-
stant throughout the year. During the dry season the reservoir would be drawn
down, but it would normally be kept full at other times. The station would
therefore generate energy at varying weekly load factors, depending not only
upon the river flow but also on the ability of the power system to absorb the
energy generated. In the wet season the average weekly power output is expect-
ed to be about 80 MW (with two sets) rising to 100 MW after the commissioning
of the third set. In the dry season of the one in ten dry years, the average
weekly output will drop to 145 MW.
Description of Principal Works
8.        The access road to open up the Gitaru site is approximately 9 km long
starting from the junction of the Kindaruma and Embu-Kangondi roads and finish-
ing at the dam site. This road together with an access road to the tailrace
tunnel portal has been constructed as part of the preliminary works.
9.        The dam will be a rock and earth fill structure with a broad core of
low permeability material and it will have a spillway similar in design to
Kamburu but with three gates which will discharge a total of 3,500 cumecs with
the water in the reservoir at its full supply level of 924 m and, with an addi-
tional rise of 1.5 m will pass a flood of 4,500.



ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 4 pages
10.       Each of the three turbines will have separate intake, shaft and
headrace tunnel, each designed to pass 62 cumecs.  The three intakes will
be combined into one reinforced concrete structure located on the left
bank some 120 m from the concrete abutment block.
11.       The turbines would be vertical shaft Francis machines, main
vehicular access to the power station will be via an access tunnel some
900 m long, and, at the end of the power station, where this tunnel enters,
a floor at generation level will be provided for unloading, erection and
maintenance purposes. An area between units 1 and 2 will contain service
equipment, cooling water pumps and air compressors. Generated power will
be transmitted to the surface by paper insulated cables placed in a vertical
shaft, to a small surface building. This shaft will also house a duct for
provision of ventilation air to the cavern and a small elevator for access
of personnel from the surface to the power station.
Trtansmission Lines and Substation
12.       The transmission system associated with the Project would include
a 132 kV double circuit line from the Gitaru substation to Kamburu (approxi-
mately 8 km) and a 275 kV single circuit transmission line from Kamburu to
the existing Juja Road substation (approximately 111 km) which is located
just outside Nairobi. The 275 kV line.which will operate initially at 132 kV,
will be routed via suitably located terminal'1towers at the site of a future
275/132 kV Dandora substation and a final 1.3 km between Dandora and Juja Road
will be single circuit 132 kV construction.
13.       Gitaru substation will be very simple with, basically, generator
transformers, auxiliary transformers and carrier coupling equipment. All
switching will be carried out at Kamburu where the substation will be ex-
tended by three 132 kV bays with three 132 kV circuit breakers installed
in the existing generator circuits to improve bus-bar security. Two 275 kV
single circuit substation bays will be installed. The mesh at Juja Road
substation will be extended to take the incoming transmission line.

GITARU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
TANA RIVER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED
Comparison of the Project with Thermal Alternatives
Selection of the Most Economic Alternative
1.        Selection of the next step of expanding EAP&L's generating capacity
involves the cost analysis of different possible development strategies which
would satisfy the increasing demand in the interconnected grid over the plan-
ning period. The cost streams of these different strategies have been compared,
and the development program which includes Gitaru power station as the first
step proves to be the most economic alternative. This program provides for
the commissioning of Gitaru in 1978, with three gas turbines of 22 MW each
for operation during hours of peak demand during the dry season and for
stand-by in case of forced outages of other generating units, commissioned
respectively in 1980, 1981 and 1982. A third generator would be installed
in the existing Kindaruma hydroelectric power station in 1983 to reduce
the need for thermal generation. In 1980 a 275 kV line between Nairobi and
Mombasa would be installed to transfer cheap hydro power to the coastal area
as by that time the capacity of the existing line would be fully "taken up".
The total cost of the progratn includes operation and maintenance, and fuel
costs. This program is characterized by high expenditures during the first
years of the planning period, due to the construction costs of the Gitaru
power project and low expenditures after 1978, because investment is modest
and fuel costs for thermal power generation are low.
2.        The main alternative program for the development of the inter-
connected system would commence with three gas turbine units of 22 MW each,
to be installed in 1978, 1979 and 1980 with the commissioning of Citaru post-
poned until 1981. To reduce fuel consumption, it is economical under this
program to install the third set at Kindaruma power station as early as 1977.
In this case the 275 kV line would be commissioned at the same time as Gitaru
so that thermal generation in Mombasa can be substituted for hydro power.
This program would have low expenditures during the first years of the plan-
ning period, but high expenditures in the period 1978 to 1980, when the con-
struction of the Gitaru project would coincide with high fuel costs. A
comparison between this alternative and the program with Gitaru as the first
project, based on discounted cash flow costs, showed an equalifiing discount
rate of 11.3;.  The cost streams are shown on page 5 of this Annex.
3.        A third alternative which was analyzed is the replacement of Gitaru
by a new 2 x 60 MW coal or oil fired thermal power station in Mombasa (which-
ever would be the most economic). An oil-fired plant of this size was the
choice of the consultants before the oil price increases after September 1973.



ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 7 pages
The equalizing discount rate is 15.5%, when Gitaru followed by a coal-fired
plant is compared with a coal-fired thermal station followed by Gitaru, assum-
ing a low coal price of US$30 per ton CIF Mombasa. The equalizing discount
rate increases to 19% if the coal price is US$40 per ton and to 20% if the
thermal plant is fired by oil.
4.        The possibilities of geothermal power and imported power from
Tanzania were also considered; since the geothermal exploration program is
incomplete and, on the best assumptions, a large geothermal power station
could not be commissioned before 1983, this was excluded from the develop-
ment alternatives.
5.        With regard to the possibility of imported energy, surplus power
should be available from Tanzania after commissioning Kidatu II power station
(presently scheduled early 1980). A-transmission line would have to be built
between the town of Tanga in Tanzania and Mombasa to interconnect the two
national grids. Tanzania could supply excess power which, because of losses
and stability problems would be limited to about 20 MW and the input of 20 MW
from Tanzania has therefore been analyzed and introduced into the strategies.
The assumed annual load factor of the imported power is 85% and the sale price
is Ki 10 per KWH (in 1975 prices).  Import of power from Tanzania would of course
have the greater impact on the gas turbine followed by the Gitaru program. On
the above assumption the equalizing discount rate between the two strategies
would fall to 10% if 20 MW of power is imported from Tanzania each year.
Because of Kenya's reluctance to import more power than at present, the possi-
bility of delay in commissioning Kidatu II and the lack of long-term availa-
bility, EAP&L would prefer not to include imported power from Tanzania in its
development planning. This was therefore excluded from the further analysis
of EAP&L's most economic development strategy as the economic advantage was
minimal.
Shadow Pricing
6.        The comparison of alternatives in the previous paragraphs of this
Annex are based on shadow pricing. All local costs have been turned into
foreign cost equivalents using shadow price ratios as listed on page 7 of
this Annex. The most important shadow price ratios used are 0.75 for un-
skilled labor and 1.33 for all local costs. The shadow price ratio for local
costs is implictly used in all shadow prices listed and corresponds to an
exchange rate, which is 33% above the official rates. These shadow prices
were estimated by a study group from Oxford University headed by M.F.G.
Scott 1/ in 1970, 1972 and 1973. Some shadow prices may have changed in the
meantime, especially due to the effect of the fuel price increase on relative
prices in Kenya. However, they represent the best estimate of shadow prices
available at the present time.
1/   The most important study prepared by the group is "Estimates of Shadow
Wages in Kenya" by M.F.G. Scott, February 1973.



ANNEX 13
Page 3 of 7 pages
Sensitivity Analysis
7.        The sensitivity of the equalizing discount rate between the cost
streams of the two basic strategies--Gitaru followed by gas turbines and gas
turbines followed by Gitaru--was analyzed by changing the main variables,
capital costs, fuel costs and load forecast.
8.        Gitaru cost estimates are based on experience with Kamburu power
station and bid prices for major contracts and ample provision has been in-
cluded for physical contingency (20% for civil works, 10% for equipment) to
provide for unforeseen construction problems. However, considering the amount
of rock excavation involved, cost increases above the amounts included in the
estimates for physical contingencies are possible, which would change the
structure in the cost streams of the alternatives compared. A relative cost
increase of Gitaru (over the other costs included in the comparison) of 10%
would reduce the equalizing discount rate to 10%. A simultaneous increase in
the cost of the gas turbines, which is less probable, since unforeseen con-
struction problems are not expected, would result in an equalizing discount
rate of 10.5%.
9.        The comparison of the two basic alternatives includes a slow drop
of 2% per year until 1980 in "real" fuel prices from its end 1974 level of
Ksh 500 per ton of furnace oil in Mombasa; i.e., current fuel prices are
expected to rise until 1980 at a somewhat lower rate than the capital and
operating costs of the two alternatives. A fall in "real" fuel prices of 7%
per year until 1980 from their present level would reduce the equalizing
discount rate to 10%, and unchanged "real" fuel prices, i.e. fuel prices
which rise at the same rate as the other commodities included in the compar-
ison would result in an equalizing discount rate of 12%.
10.       The growth of demand has been projected on the basis of a detailed
analysis of future electricity consumption of large industrial consumers and
on the correlation between demand of the remaining consumers and the expected
development of Kenya's economy. If the expectation of economic growth in
Kenya--a slow-down in 1975 and 1976, and a recovery with a return to the
previous economic trend in 1977--are too optimistic, then the load growth
could be lower than projected. A lower load growth would lead to a reduction
in fuel consumption if gas turbines are installed first, and to a longer
period of under-utilization of generating capacity if Gitaru is commissioned
in 1978. A reduction in load growth by 10% would reduce the equalizing
discount rate to 9%.
11.       A simultaneous occurrence of two of the three events analyzed above
--an increase of Gitaru capital cost, a sharp drop in "real" fuel prices, a
reduction in demand growth by 10%--would reduce the equalizing discount rate
to 8%. Under conditions most unfavorable to the strategy of building Gtaru
first with all three events occurring simultaneously, the equalizing discount
rate would fall below 7%. However, the likelihood of a simultaneous occurrence
is small. The mission estimates that the likelihood of a drop in load growth



ANNEX 13
Page 4 of 7 pages
by 10% is 25%; of 10% higher capital cost of Gitaru 33%, and of a sharp drop
in "real" fuel prices 25%. The joint probability of simultaneous occurrence
of two or three of the events, therefore, would be less than 10%.

Method and Assumptions Made to Determine the
Rate of Return on Investment
1.        The rate of return on the investment is defined as the equalizing
discount rate between all project related capital and operating costs and
the revenues (over 50 years) attributable to the project.
2.        The capital costs of Gitaru, which include the costs of the third
unit to be installed in 1982, are estimated at April 1975 constant prices. The
investments in distribution and secondary transmission, necessary to supply
the power generated by Gitaru to the consumers are part of EAP&L's development
program for the period 1977 to 1982. The economic life of Gitaru was assumed
to be 50 years and of transmission and distribution equipment 25 years.
Operating costs have been estimated by the Consultants.
3.        Shadow pricing was applied to foreign cost and unskilled labor.
The shadow exchange rate was assumed to be 33% above the official exchange
rate and local unskilled labor was shadow priced at 75% of actual cost.
4.        The revenues attributable to the project, are Gitaru's estimated
output reduced by losses in transmission and distribution (about 15% of units
sent out) and multiplied by EAP&L's average sales price per kWh as of April
1975. Sales of Gitaru power will start in 1978 with 334 GWh, rising to a
maximum of 761 GWh in 1986; thereafter they remain constant. The applied
average sales price, based on EAP&L's present tariff system, has three
components:
(i) A base price of Ki 25.3 in 1978, K4 25.1 in 1979 and Ki 24.8
in 1980 and thereafter;
(ii) A Government tax of K4 1 per kWh; and
(iii) The fuel oil price surcharge, which will vary depending
on the amount of energy generated by thermal power.
EAP&L forecasts a fuel oil price surcharge per kWh of
KE 0.1 in 1978, El 0.3 in 1979 and El 0.8 in 1980.
Mission estimates of the fuel oil price surcharge in the
following years are: KE 1.1 in 1981, K4 1.4 in 1982 and
KE 1.6 in 1983 and thereafter.



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 3 pages
5.        The streams of costs and revenues are presented in the table on
page three of this annex. The rate of return on investment is 14.3%.,
6.        The rate of return on the investment is sensitive to changes in costs
and revenues. A 10% increase in total costs would reduce the rate from 14.3%
to 12.2%, and a drop in growth of demand by 10% results in a rate of 13.6%
A joint cost increase of 10% and reduction in the demand growth of 10% would
result in a rate of return of 11.8%.

KENYA
GITARU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
TANA RIVER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED
History of the Power Companies
1.        The Kenya Electricity Supply Industry is presently comprised of
three companies:
(a) The East African Power & Lighting Company Limited (EAP&L)
(b)  The Kenya Power Company Limited                     (KPC)
(c)  Tana River Development Company Limited              (TRDC)
The East African Power & Lighting Company Limited
2.        EAP&L, which is the sole distribution company, was incorporated
in 1922 by the amalgamation of two undertakings which had supplied Nairobi
and Mombasa since 1907 and 1909, respectively. It is a local private enter-
prise company with authorized share capital of KL 10,000,000 of which
KL 9,741,504 is issued. In addition, loan capital amounting to KE 4,165,653
was outstanding as at the end of 1973. Although formerly operating through-
out Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, its activities have been confined to Kenya
since 1964 due to purchase of the Uganda and Tanzania undertakings by the
respective Governments. The Company is primarily concerned with the com-
mercial distribution of electricity throughout Kenya, but presently it also
generates the entire power requirements of the Coast System, provides the
necessary thermal back-up for the main grid system and operates generating
stations in centres not connected to the grid. It also co-ordinates all
sources of power, and staffs and manages the other two Companies (KPC and
TRDC).
3         In 1970, the Government acquired a controlling interest in EAP&L
when it made a successful bid for all the shares on the London Register.
Since then, the Government has been purchasing shares as they come in the
East African Market and its total holding together with. that of Government-
controlled agencies is now probably in the neighborhood of 60%.
The Kenya Power Company Limited (KPC)
4         In 1955 EAP&L was faced with the problem of financing the con-
struction of a 132 kV transmission line to interconnect the power systems of
Uganda and Kenya as well as other expansion requirements. The Company did
not consider it practicable to raise the required finances through new
equity issues because of conservative dividend policies due to political
pressures and the need for increased self financing. There was also revived



ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 2 pages
political pressure for nationalization, and the company concluded it was
inevitable and desirable to increase public ownership and direct Government
participation in the power industry. Accordingly, it was decided to form
a new company, KPC, in 1955, with an issued nominal capital of Kb 100 held
equally by EAP&L, the Government and Power Securities Corporation Limited
(PSC). 1/ KPC's function was to construct the transmission line and to take
over two hydroelectric stations belonging to EAP&L on the Tana River. KPC
financed its requirements through issuance of LStg. 7.5 million of debenture
stock, the payment of the debt service on which was guaranteed by EAP&L's
undertaking to purchase KPC's bulk supply at ascertained cost.
5.        In accordance with its policy of increasing its participation in
the electricity supply industry, the Government acquired 100% of KPC's issued
share capital by buying out Power Securities Corporation Limited in 1971.
Tana River Development Company Limited (TRDC)
6.        A forecast of load growth after Kenya's achievement of independence
in December 1963, indicated that it would be necessary to commission further
major generating capacity by 1967-68 and a re-appraisal of the Seven Forks
Scheme (the harnessing of the hydro potential of the Upper Tana) established
Kindaruma as the most economical first stage development. TRDC was formed
in 1964 to finance the Kindaruma hydroelectric development for much the same
reasons as led to the formation of KPC. The share capital of TRDC is a
nominal Kb 100 which was held equally by EAP&L, the Government, Power
Securities Corporation and Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) until
February, 1971 when the Kenya Government acquired the entire stock. CDC
supplied LStg. 3.5 million of a total of about LStg. 6 million of loan capital
which was arranged for the Kindaruma Project.. It is Government's intention
that TRDC should complete the construction of the Seven Forks development.
Kamburu Stage 1, comprising the first two generating units, was commissioned
in July, 1974 and the third unit is scheduled for commissioning in 1976.
Gitaru, the last of the Seven Forks Hydroelectric Projects, is scheduled for
commissioning in 1978. Like KPC, TRDC sells its entire output to EAP&L at
ascertained cost.
May 1975
1/   PSC is a UK finance house which arranged the financing of most of
EAP&L's development in the past. It is also the parent company of
EAP&L's engineering consultants.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Statements
Revenues
1.        EAP&L's revenues are based on the present tariffs to June 1975
and, thereafter, an increase of 10% over the present rates has been assumed.
In addition, a fuel surcharge is included in revenues which, in accordance
with the present Government regulations,-allows EAP&L to recover the bulk of
the increase in fuel cost over a fixed level of fuel price. This will be
replaced by a new surcharge at 4 cents per KWh after June 1975.  Sales
volume is assumed to increase by about 11% in 1976 reducing gradually to
about 9% annually from 1979.
2.        Changes in EAP&L's tariffs require Government approval.  Under the
Electric Power Act of Kenya, tariffs must be reduced when operating in-
come before income tax for any year exceeds 12-1/2% of the capital expended
on the undertaking. The base for measuring the rate of return for this
statutory standard is equivalent to the gross fixed assets, including work
in progress, plus inventories. EAP&L's earnings have never exceeded the
statutory limit and, in recent years, the highest statutory return achieved
was about 9.8% in 1970.
3.        TRDC's revenues include a Development Surcharge, described in
para 6 below, as part of ascertained costs, the amount payable by EAP&L
for electricity purchased by it from TRDC.
4.        KPC's revenues are estimated in accordance with the definition of
Ascertained Cost in its bulk supply licence described in the next para.
Ascertained Cost
5.        The bulk supply licences of KPC and TRDC define ascertained cost
(on the basis of which their revenues are determined) as the actual audited
cost each year for the following items:
(a) Operations and administration. For KPC this also
includes the cost of purchasing power from Uganda;
(b) interest and redemption payments for debt;
(c) income or other taxes. TRDC's income is exempt from
payment of income tax and KPC has had no taxable in-
come because of large depreciation allowance deduct-
able for tax purposes (see footnote 2 to Annex 18 (b);
and



ANNEX 21
Page 2 of 5 pages
(d) such other charges as the Government shall consider
proper to be allowed. Under this authority a Develop-
ment Surchage (described later in this Annex) is added
as a part of ascertained cost of TRDC.
In addition, ascertained cost includes small annual appropriations to a Re-
serve and Equalization Fund which, with the interest on the securities in
which it is invested is available for future capital expenditure or to
cover deficiencies in income and to pay for abnormal expenses.
Development Surcharge
6.        Development Surcharge being paid by EAP&L to TRDC was principally
designed to provide the latter with a part of the funds required to pay
the local currency costs of its Kamburu Project (IBRD Loan 745-KE). The
surcharge has been paid by EAP&L, since 1971, as part of the cost of elec-
tricity it purchases from TRDC and is determined each year so that the rate
of return on average net fixed assets in service of TRDC and KPC combined is
the same as that earned by EAP&L. The payment of surcharge will continue to
provide to TRDC funds for part of the local currency requirements of the
Gitaru project. The surcharge payment is intended to result each year in
similar rates of return for TRDC/KPC combined and EAP&L, measured in terms of
net operating income as a percentage of average net fixed assets in service
for the years 1971-1974, and average net fixed assets including work in
progress, thereafter.  The latter method will provide larger amounts to TRDC
during the construction period when the requirement of funds for the project
will be substantial. This will also reduce the income tax burden of the
power sector during the construction period of the project by increasing
TRDC's income which is exempt from income tax and by reducing EAP&L's taxable
income. Provision for the surcharge has been made in the financial state-
ments beyond the construction period of the project to provide for major
capital expenditure in the future.
Operating Expenses
7.        An escalation in operating expenses, excluding fuel cost, of 9%
per year has been assumed after 1974. Fuel cost is based on the existing
prices, and fuel quantitites as shown in the development program. Operating
expenses of Gitaru station, estimated in the light of experience on the
present hydroelectric stations of TRDC, have been escalated at 9% per year.
Fixed Assets
8.        Fixed assets are recorded at cost, except for EAP&L's assets before
December 31, 1947 which were at net book value. Depreciation rates used to
1973 are those prescribed under the Electric Power Act. These range from
1% of the cost for permanent hydraulic civil engineering works to 20% for
tools, implements and loose plant and 22.5% for motor vehicles, and are
generally in line with the rates customarily applied in the power industry.



ANNEX 21
Page 3 of 5 pages
The average combined depreciation rate for the three companies for the
years 1972 to 1974 works out to 3.4%. Depreciation rate used for TRDC
after 1974 is 2.09% of cost of fixed assets at the beginning of each
year.
Current Assets and Liabilities
9.        Inventories, trade debtors, trade creditors and consumers' depo-
sits of EAP&L are estimated to increase every year by about (KL thousands)
50, 150, 25 and 25, respectively.
Financing of the Gitaru Project
10.       The project cost, including interest during construction, will
be financed by TRDC as follows:
Equivalent
KL Millions          US$ Millions
Issue of Share Capital to
the Government                   6.00                16.80
IBRD Loan                            22.50               63.00
Suppliers/Export Credits              7.79               21.81
Loan From EAP&L                       2.00                5.60
Other Local Loans ,                   3.86               10.81
Internal Cash Generation              6.40               17.92
Estimated Project Cost          48.55               135.94
11.       In addition, preliminary works estimated to cost KL 1.29 million
are to be financed out of a local bank loan of KL 1.5 million
12.       Local and foreign loans required for the Gitaru project are
assumed to be on the following terms:
Period
Amount in   Rate of  of      Grace
KL Millions Interest Loan   Period
IBRD                                22.5       8.5%       25      5
Suppliers/Export Credits             7.79     10  %       13      3
Local Loans                          3.86     10  %       25      5
EAP&L Loan                           2.00      Nil         6      3



ANNEX 21
Page 4 of 5 pages
Interest during construction on the suppliers'/export credits and the local
loans is assumed to be payable by TRDC; but on IBRD loan it will be provided
out of the loan amount. Loan from EAP&L to TRDC is assumed to be free of
interest since any interest payable to EAP&L will have to be reimbursed to
TRDC by EAP&L as part of the ascertained cost. In addition a local bank loan
of K1.5 million for preliminary works has been arranged at annual interest
rate of 9% and repayable in 4 years.
Provision for Deferred Income Tax
13.        Depreciation on fixed assets of EAP&L expected to be allowed for
determining the income tax payable during the period to 1980 is considerably
more than the amount provided for in the financial ststements. A provision
for deferred tax liability has, therefore, been made each year in EAP&L's
accounts to reflect the tax saving due to difference in the two depreciation
amounts. This provision relating to the 1971-1980 period will decrease in
future years when the tax depreciation on those fixed assets will be less
than the accounting depreciation and, consequently, the tax payable on the
higher taxable income will include an amount relating to the income of past
years. The present tax rate of 45% has been applied to income of future
years.
Share Capital
14.        Additional share capital of K6 million will be issued by TRDC to
the Government of Kenya. The payment will be made by the Government to TRDC
during the period 1975-1977 and will be used by TRDC for the expenditure on
the project.
Long-Term Debt - TRDC
15.        Loan capital of TRDC outstanding on December 31, 1974 consisted of
the following:
Kg Thousands

16.        The 'A', 'B' and 'C' debenture stock are at annual interest rates
ranging from 7.75% to 9.625% and repayable in eciuated annual installments of
principal and interest over the period 1971-1987. The 'D' stock is repayable
in 19 semi-annual installments ending December 1976. The 'E' stock is at 9%
annual interest and repayable in 21 installments over the period 1975-1995.



ANNEX 21
Page 5 of 5 pages
SIDA credit to the Government for Kamburn project has been relent to TRDC
by the latter on the same terms as the IBRD loan 745-KE which are 7,5Z .
interest and repayment in 43 semi-annual installments commencing July 1, 1975.
Government's loan to finance the Kamburu project cost overrun is on the same
terms as the IBRD loand 745-KE.
Dividends
17.        EAP&L has been paying dividends on its ordinary shares at the rate
of 10% of the par value since 1972, when it was raised from 9%.  It is assumed
that the 10% rate will be maintained unchanged through 1980.
General
18.        The figures for the years 1972 and 1973 in the financial statements
are based on the audited accounts for those years, and for 1974 on provisional
accounts.

Economic Analysis of EAP&L's Tariffs
1.        EAP&L's tariff system differentiates between the following eight con-
sumer groups:
(1)  Large Domestic          (5)  Industrial
(2)  Small Domestic          (6)  Off-Peak
(3)  Small Commercial        (7)  Street Lighting
(4)  Large Commercial        (8)  EAP&L's Employees
A special feature of this grouping is the off-peak tariff for water heating and
irrigation pumping.  A load of about 20 MW (of a total peak demand of 170 MW)
for these two purposes is connected to a central "ripple control" installation
and switched on only during times of low demand (during the night and the day
off-peak hours). The creation of this off-peak tariff group has enabled
EAP&L to keep its annual system load factor as high as 70%.
2.        Another special feature of EAP&L's tariff is the fuel oil price sur-
charge clause, which was applied for the first time in 1974. This clause
goes into effect, if the price for the fuel used in Kipevu power station in
Mombasa differs from the "basic price" of KSh 110/ton of furnace oil prevail-
ing prior to the large increases at the end of 1973. With the fuel oil price
surcharge, EAP&L is able to recover part of its additional fuel cost from the
electricity consumers. The surcharge is calculated on the basis of the dif-
ference between the "basic fuel price" and the prevailing price (KSh 500/ton
in September 1974) and an "economic factor" which is determined monthly by the
Ministry of Power. The equation for the calculation of the fuel oil price
surcharge has the following form:
Surcharge in Ki _ f x Fuel Price less "Basic Price" x 0:21 Thermal kWh
per kWh sold                          5                          Total kWh
During the first seven months of application of the surcharge, the "economic
factor", f, and the resulting surcharge were fixed at the following levels:
Economic Factor f   Surcharge Kd/kWh
April                                    0.5                  4.7
May                                      0.5                  4.8
June                                      1.3                 4.5
July                                      1.3                 5.2
August                                   1.2                  5.6
September                                1.9                  3.9
October                                  1.4                  2.1



ANNEX 22
Page 2 of 4 pages
From July 1, 1975, the fuel price surcharge will be absorbed into the
tariff by the addition of Kg 4 per kWh to all tariffs. The basic fuel price in
the clause will then simultaneously be increased to the then prevailing fuel
price.
3.         Following a cursory examination of EAP&L's tariff structure it is
apparent that improvements can be made. Some of the possible improvements are
discussed in the following paragraphs.
4.        The present structure does not reflect the cost of power generation,
since basically, it does not differentiate between electricity supplied during
different times of the day and different times of the year. During the two
rainy seasons of the year (April to June and November to December) large
amounts of cheap hydro power are available, while during the two dry seasons
(February to March and September to October) generation is more expensive
with a larger component of thermal power. Similarly, there is a difference in
costs of generation for power supply during the night, when demand is low, and
the hours of peak demand during the day. Therefore, charges should be higher
during the dry season and during peak hours and lower during the rainy season
and during off-peak. A season and a time-of-day tariff, reflecting these
cost differences could appropriately be applied to industrial and larger com-
mercial consumers, where additional metering costs would not matter. This
would encourage these consumer groups to adjust their pattern of electricity
consumption to the cost of supply, which,. in turn, would improve EAP&L's sys-
tem load factor, which now has a tendency to drop.
5.        The difference between the average price per kWh for the different
consumer groups in EAP&L's tariffs (see attached table) would appear to be
larger than can be justified by the difference in the cost of supply. Dif-
ferences in the average price per kWh are only justified in so far as consum-
er groups use electricity during different times of the day and of the year
or because of lower related costs. To quote an example, the cost to small
commercial consumers is on average KO 41.1 per kWh whilst the cost to large
commercial consumers, generally connected at the same voltage level is much
lower at Kg 23.6 per kWh.  On the other hand, only a 2% discount is granted to
large commercial and industrial consumers who have a high voltage supply.
EAP&L's tariffs should be restructured to reflect more correctly the differences
in distribution costs.
6.        Declining block tariffs applied to all tariff groups with the ex-
ception of large domestic consumers, give a reduction to the large consumer,
which is, in most cases, not justified by the lower cost of supply. The last
blocks in the industrial tariff - KO 6 per kWh and KSh 18 per KVA of peak de-
mand - probably do not cover the cost of supply, which means that other con-
sumer groups are probably subsidizing large industrial consumers. Declining
blocks should be abolished in favor of a uniform tariff, perhaps even intro-
ducing an increasing block tariff for households with a cheap first block for
small consumers.

7.        The application of the fuel oil price surcharge has rad-cally
changed EAP&L's tariff structure. The surcharge is applied to all kWh consumed,
not only to consumption during times of thermal generation - and it is added
as an absolute amount-. This has had a different impact on different consumer
groups: Large industrial consumers are now paying between 15% and 43% more for
electricity, while the cost to small domestic consumers has been increased by
2% to 5% only. The surcharge has its main adverse effect on the off-peak ta-
riff, which applies to consumption of hydrogenerated power, but has been in-
creased by the highest rate of all tariff groups (up to 45%). The attractive-
ness of off-peak consumption has been reduced, and if implemented for a long
time the surcharge will have a reverse effect on EAP&L's system load factor.
A revision of EAP&L's tariff structure should provide for the present fuel oil
price surcharge to be integrated into the tariff system. The surcharge clause
could remain part of EAP&L's tariff bylaws  to protect EAP&L financially, if
fuel prices should increase further. The clause should, however, be changed in
the following two respects:
(i)  The surcharge should only be levied on kWh generated
by thermal power, not on all kWh supplied.  Thus, the
tariff would remain cost reflecting;
(ii)  the surcharge should be calculated so as to relate to
future consumption.  At present, the amount to be sur-
charged during the followirg month is based on fuel
consumed during the past month.  Since fuel consump-
tion changes according to season, this time-lag of two
months often leads to a high surcharge in a month of
low thermal generation and vice versa.
8.        The large difference in average revenues for different consumer groups
indicates that the present tariff is not equitable. For example, in 1974 re-
venue per kWh was K4 25 for large domestic consumers but Kg 119 for small do-
mestic consumers. Large industrial consumers on special agreement paid only
K4 13 on average. The tariff for small domestic consumers could be lowered
substantially by cross-subsidization from other consumer groups. Since this
group consumes only 1% of total electricity sold, the subsidy would be small.

Loan Capital and Security Arrangements of EAP&L, KPC and TRDC
1.        This annex describes the loan capital of power companies of
Kenya and the arrangements securing this loan capital. The amounts stated
represent the total amount of the loans contracted and not the amounts
outstanding, which are given in Annexes 15 (a), 16 and 18 (a). All refer-
ences to L are references to TStg.
EAP&L
2         EAP&L's loan capital amounting to i 10,862,240 comprises loans
from Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) (L 350,000, h 2,944,000
and b 1,500,000), and from Glyn, Mills and Company syndicate (E 2,887,520,
L 216,400, L 2,724,320 and E 240,000). The CDC loan of L 350,000 was
secured by (i) EAP&L's 8-1/2% Debentures 1971-85; and (ii) a Trust Deed
dated November 1, 1968, which provided for a first legal charge on specified
leasehold properties of EAP&L. The L 2,944,000 CDC loan and the L 2,887,520
loan from the Glyn, Mills and Company syndicate were respectively secured
by Debenture Stock 1975-91 and 1971-80 respectively, as well as a Trust
Deed dated May 16, 1969. This' Trust Deed created mortgages and charges
on certain of EAP&L's properties and assets and also stipulated that EAP&L
was not to create any mortgage or charge ranking in priority to or pari passu
with that mortgage or charge. The h 216,400 loan from the Glyn, Mills and
Company syndicate represents the portion of the loan to TRDC referred to
in item (iv) under TRDC below, which was used to purchase equipment for EAP&L
and the debt service for which EAP&L has undertaken to reimburse TRDC. The
i 1,500,000 CDC loan and Glyn syndicate loans of L 2,724,320 and L 240,000
were secured by Debenture Stock 1979-88, and 1978-80 respectively, as well
as a supplemental Trust Deed dated August 29, 1974 which made these loans
to rank pari passu with the loans secured by the Trust Deed dated May 16,
1969.
KPC
3.        In 1955 KPC floated a i 7,500,000 loan by the issue of a i 7,500,000
5-1/2% Debenture Stock 1975/85. b 3,500,000 of this loan was subscribed by
CDC, and the balance was underwritten for public sale. The Debenture Stock
was secure by a Trust Deed dated June 27, 1956, which, among other things,
created a first legal charge and a floating charge in respect of KPC's
property and assets and stipulated that KPC was not to create any further



ANNEX 23
Page 2 of 2 pages
charges or incumbtances upon its undertakings and assets ranking in priority
to or pari passu with the charges created under the Trust Deed except in
special stated circumstances. The Trust Deed also provided that any scheme
for the reconstruction should require an extraordinary resolution of the
stockholders which means in effect the consent of three-fourths of the
stockholders.
TRDC
4.        TRDC's loan capital amounting to about KS 21 million came from
CDC, the Glyn, Mills and Company syndicate, EAP&L, IBRD, Government of
Kenya and out of a SIDA credit to the Government of Kenya. Security for the
loans consists of (i) b 3,742,911 A Debenture Stock 1971-87, (ii) Shs
9,240,500 and Shs. 5,380,000 B Debenture Stock 1971-87, (iii) Shs. 6,040,000
C Debenture Stock 1971-87, (iv) b 1,844,661 D Debenture Stock 1967-77
(of which b 216,400 is underwritten by EAP&L), (v) Shs 81,300,000 E Debenture
Stock 1975-96, (vi) US$23,000,000 Bonds 1975-96 to be issued to IBRD, and
(vii) a Trust Deed dated May 26, 1966 as modified and extended by two Supple-
mental Trust Deeds dated December 5, 1968 and December 16, 1971. The Trust
Deed provided for the creation of a floating charge of TRDC's undertakings,
property and assets and also required TRDC (i) not to (A) create without
the Trustee's consent any mortgage or charge ranking in priority to or pari
passu with the floating charge or (B) create any specific mortgage or charge
over any of its immovable property or other assets without the prior written
consent of the Trustee; or (ii) not to borrow money without the written
consent of the Trustee or have any subsidiary, except with the prior written
consent of the Trustee. The Trust Deed also provides for the creation and
issue in specified circumstances of additional stock to rank pari passu in
point of security with the original stock created under the Trust Deed. These
circumstances include the need to secure any loan TRDC would need to finance
later stages of the Seven Forks Hydroelectric Project.

Project Monitoring
There are a number of areas described in this annex which are
key factors in the efficient operation of the utility and the success of
the Project. These have been discussed with the Borrower.
EAP&I is a sophisticated and reasonably well staffed utility
with well developed commercial, statistical and engineering departments
where up-to-date records on system technical perfoxmance, load and con-
sumer statistics are maintained. -There is therefore no need to establish
a monitoring system for these aspects.
Main areas for establishing a monitoring system are described
below:
1.   Construction of Project
Performance achievements for construction should be measured
monthly in terms of percentage completion at the end of each
month against the target completion date for each phase of
bonus earning construction shown in the bidding documents for
main civil and plant contracts.
2.   Staffing
Staffing levels should be monitored bi-annually under the following
headings, referring to target esta bLishments in each category.
Targets for 1975-1977
(a) Management                                            26
(b) Professional Staff (including Accountants)           150
(c) Technicians and other Supervisory Staff
(including Computer Personnel)                     250
(d) Clerical (including Secretaries & Typists)           450
(e) Unskilled Workers (including Auxilliary Staff)   1,600
(f) Staff in Training                                    160



ANNEX 24
Page 2 of 2 pages
Overall, the number of employees should not normally exceed about
25 per 1,000 consumers. Where staffing levels are excessive,
efforts should be made to reduce staff through limitation on
recruitment, early retirement, etc.
3.   Training
Personnel under training, totalling 160 in 1975, should be monitored
on an annual basis under the following headings, and the numbers
in training under each heading should be reviewed annually to
ensure that these are commensurate with normal growth and with
replaceaent and turnover requirements:
(a) Graduate Engineers in University (by classification)
(b) Graduate Engineers on works or field training (by
classification)
(c) Technicians in training (by classification)
(d) Craftsmen in training (by classification).
4.   Rural Electrification
Annual records should be maintained, showing against the targets
which have been set:
(a) Number of townships connected, under EAJPL and Government
financing respectively;
(b) Number of connections in each area; and
(c) KWh sales in each area.
5.  Financial Indicators
(a) Cost of fuel used in power generation should be compared
quarterly with estimates, as follows:
i) total fuel cost
ii) quantity of fuel used
iii)  fuel cost per unit of thermal generation
iv) fuel cost per unit of total power sales
v) fuel cost recovered from customers as surcharge
(b) Average revenue per unit sold.
