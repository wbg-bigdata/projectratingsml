REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE TANA RIVER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR GITARU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Tana River Development Company Limited (TRDC) with the guarantee
of the Republic of Kenya for the equivalent of US$63.0 million to help fi-
nance construction of a hydroelectric power station on the Upper Tana River.
The proposed loan is for a term of 25 years including four years of grace
with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum. In addition, TRDC has obtained
other external financing commitments up to about US$21.0 million from
various supplier countries. Interest ranges from 7 to 8-1/2 percent per annum
and repayment from seven to twelve years after commissioning.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Second Decade:    Basic Economic Report on
Kenya" (Report No. 201-KE, dated January 15, 1974) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on February 20, 1974. It was followed by an agricul-
tural sector survey on Kenya (Report No. 254a-KE, dated December 20, 1973)
distributed on March 13, 1974. A special mission visited Kenya in February
1974 to review the economy's prospects and aid requirements in the light of
the changes in international prices. The mission reported to the Consultative
Group meeting held in Paris in April, 1974. The dialogue on economic and
social development strategy has been further intensified since. The ac-
celerated world inflation, including the oil crisis, had a serious impact
on the Kenyan economy. In response, the Government formulated an action
program to restructure the economy. We have had extensive discussions with
the Government about this action program in the context of our program loan
negotiations and in coordination with the IMF staff.
3.        Kenya's remarkable economic performance during the first decade of
independence was fully acknowledged in the Bank's 1974 Basic Economic Report.
Between 1964 and 1972, GDP grew by about 7 percent in real terms, which
allowed significant gains in per capita income despite a 3.5 percent popula-
tion growth rate.   Less satisfactory aspects of development in this period
were lack of progress in distributing the benefits of development more
equitably and, in particular, growing unemployment and persistent poverty
at the lower end of the income scale. The dualistic nature of the economy
at Independence in 1963, with its concentration of wealth in the European
and Asian communities and serious poverty in the rural areas where 90 per-
cent of the population lived, was at the root of this unequal development.



-2-
4.         In looking ahead into the second decade of Independence, the Basic
Economic Report concluded that Kenya did not really have the option to con-
tinue the past pattern of growth and that in order to maintain the momentum
of growth an essential restructuring of the growth process would be necessary.
The past growth rate has been supported by a high and growing investment rate
both in the public and the private sectors (with fixed capital formation
reaching as much as 25 percent of monetary GDP in the early 70s). Kenya's
domestic savings rate, about 20 percent, is also one of the highest in the
developing world. There were some signs, however, that savings were level-
ling off, which raised doubts whether resource mobilization would be able
to keep up with the pace of investment. Moreover, there were some indications
of a falling efficiency of resource use (in terms of rising capital output
ratios as well as the disappointing growth of employment).
5.        The most critical constraint, however, is the external resource
gap. Although Kenya's export performance, including the growth of tourism,
has been very satisfactory, the pattern of past development has made the
economy heavily dependent on imported raw materials and capital goods. With
increasing production and investments, imports have grown rapidly. Rising
import prices exacerbated the problem and a resource gap emerged which
could not be filled by available capital inflows from abroad.
6.        Thus even before the upsurge in world inflation experienced
during 1974, it had become clear that the Kenya economy would eventually
run into an unmanageable balance of payments problem, unless growth were
to be based on greater use of domestic factors of production, and more
efficient use of available resources. The Basic Economic Report advocated
first a restructured pattern of growth in favor of the directly productive
sectors, most immediately to agriculture but also to resource-based industry.
Second, it recommended factor price adjustments to move market prices closer
to real scarcity values and thus increase the efficiency of resource use
throughout the economy. This would hopefully permit to continue rapid
growth in the long run, a first prerequisite for an effective attack on
unemployment and rural poverty. At the same time, it would directly
promote growth of income in the rural areas.
7.        The Third Development Plan, 1974-1978, published in early 1974,
contains a development strategy which is broadly consistent with the Bank
recommendations; the Plan also reflects the findings of the major UNDP/ILO
mission which visited Kenya at the Government's request in 1972 and pub-
lished at innovative report on employment, incomes and equality. By re-
structuring the economic growth pattern, the Government hoped to achieve a
7.4 percent growth rate, which would exceed previous performance; employment,
rural development and more equitable distribution of income were to receive
more attention than in previous years. Employment would grow by 3.2 percent
per year. However, in 1974 the Kenyan economy was hit by unprecedented up-
surge in world inflation and a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade,
which precipitated a balance of payments crisis.



-3-
8.        The terms of trade deteriorated by about 9 percent in 1974
(preliminary figures) as a result of soaring import prices which were
only partly offset by higher export prices especially during the earlier
months of the year. The volume of imports rose owing to stock buildup
while the volume of agricultural exports was depressed by drought. An
extraordinary trade deficit of nearly $450 million and current account
deficit of about $325 million (1973: $75 million) resulted.
9.        Although Kenya was one of the most seriously affected countries,
it managed to absorb the balance of payments effects of world price changes
without too much disruption during 1974. This was in part due to the
facts that initial foreign exchange reserves were at a comfortable level
and there was no shortage of the major staple food, maize. Net capital
inflows increased considerably and, moreover, the country got a favorable
response to its application for special financial assistance, especially
from the IMF, which provided $38 million under its oil facility. The
drawdown of reserves could thus be limited to $84 million. However,
the world inflation strongly affected the domestic price level through
the upsurge of prices of imported products. Serious domestic inflation
had occurred for the first time in 1973 when the cost of living went
up by 13 percent after a long period of average annual increases of
just over 2 percent. In 1974, the imported inflation reinforced the
internal pressure on the price level which resulted from reductions
in Kenya's crop and livestock production following prolonged drought;
the overall price increase may well reach 15 percent in 1975. GDP
growth in real terms slowed down to about 5 percent. The country's
external position is expected to worsen considerably during 1975, owing
to a steeper decline in the terms of trade than in 1974, which would
result from a levelling off or a fall of export prices and a continued
increase of import prices. Under these assumptions, the current account
deficit in 1975 will exceed that of 1974, probably by about $40 million.
10.       The basic objective of the Government's action program is to
restructure the economy as fast as possible, so as to achieve maximum
economic development in the future under much more stringent balance of
payments conditions. The aim is to restrain imports in a way that has
a minimum impact on production in the next few years and to direct more
production into exports. It will therefore be necessary to compress
public and private consumption and to channel investments into the most
productive and quickly yielding uses, in particular into appropriate
import substitution and export promotion. In both activities the agr-
icultural sector will have a major role to play; by further improve-
ments to its already good performance in previous years it will also
have to absorb more labor and maintain incomes in a period of possible
slowdown of urban employment. Manufacturing, which will possibly become
the most dynamic sector in the long run, faces a difficult adjustment
process in the next few years. It will have to improve its resource
utilization and reduce its heavy import dependence in favor of a more
domestic resource based production.



- 4 -
11.       A crucial component of the Government's strategy is the attempt
to hold down the domestic rate of inflation to well below world inflation
so as to help bring about import substitution and export promotion by
price differentials. This decision implies that real incomes have to
fall; this hardship will be distributed between income groups in such
a way that the lowest income groups receive full compensation for cost
of living increases, while better-off members of society are made to
bear a proportionately larger share of the burden by partial compensa-
tion or no compensation at all.
12.       In addition to the income policy, the action program relies
mainly on global monetary and fiscal policies reinforced by agricultural
pricing policies and some specific administrative measures. Not only is
the overall money supply limited by increases in interest rates and
direct restrictions on credit expansion, but the Government is also
directing credit into agriculture, manufacturing, export business and
tourism. On the fiscal policy side,jKenya's already good tax perform-
ance as well as the measures introduced in 1973 and 1974 to make the
system more progressive does not leave much room for substantial tax
increases. The Government nevertheless intends to raise some taxes
on non-essential domestic and imported products and to further improve
tax administration and revenue collection.    Some other envisaged tax
measures (capital gains tax, improved inheritance tax and increased
urban property tax) seek to promote equity as well as revenue increases.
The discussion continues with the other Partner States in the East African
Community about a modification of the common external tariff towards more
uniform rates for consumer goods and capital goods.
13.       A revised three-year budget for FY76 to FY78 has been adopted,
which aims at reducing the growth of government consumption, promoting
exports, increasing production of agricultural commodities for import
substitution and use of more labor-intensive techniques. Recurrent
expenditure growth in real terms has been reduced to 6 percent from
11 percent projected in the 1974-1978 Development Plan, and expenditure
growth included in the Development Budget is set at 7.8 percent (as
against 12 percent). This required the politically difficult decision
to bring the rapidly accelerating recurrent expenditure for education
under control; the Government has now decided to allow only a 6 percent
annual increase, freezing education's share of recurrent expenditure at
32 percent. In the Development Budget, the share of agricultural and
water development was increased from 22 to 35 percent while that of
road and building construction was brought down from 22 percent to 18
percent; moreover, a significant shift away from trunk roads to second-
ary and rural access roads was incorporated within the road construction
program.
14.       In addition to these domestic measures, the Government is seek-
ing to accelerate disbursements under existing foreign financing commit-
ments and to obtain additional commitments, including quickly disbursing
assistance, in order to maintain some momentum of growth while the restruc-
turing policy is taking effect. Thanks to generally positive reactions



-5-
from donors, the external financing plan for 1975 is anticipating that
the larger part of the overall deficit can be covered through higher
inflows of conventional financing plus additional special inflows from
several bilateral sources as well as the IBRD; Kenya will also use sub-
stantial drawings on various IMF facilities. A similar effort would
have to be made for 1976 and following years to close the residual
balance of payments gap.
15.       In the past the Kenya Government has followed a conservative
policy with regard to external borrowing. Since Independence, Kenya has
accumulated new commitments at a rate of about 8.5 percent per year, or
somewhat less than the rate of growth of the economy as a whole in current
prices. As a result, Kenya's debt service burden is still comparatively
light (4 percent of exports in 1974, excluding Kenya's share of East
African Community debt), and the country could if necessary resort to
moderate borrowing on commercial ternis during the next few difficult
years, without impairing long-term creditworthiness.     At the end of 1974
total debt outstanding amounted to $722 million, of which $455 million had
been disbursed. About 36 percent of total external debt is now held by
the Bank Group (IBRD:    18.4 percent, IDA 17.7 percent), but because Bank
Group lending has only recently become a significant proportion of Kenya's
debt, debt service to the Bank Group in 1974 was still only about 13 per-
cent of all debt service payments (IBRD: 11.7 percent, IDA: 1.4 percent).
In addition to its own external public debt, Kenya is also jointly respon-
sible together with the other two Partner States for debts incurred by
the East African Community and its institutions, which amounted to some
$300 million (including undisbursed) at the end of 1974. Allowing for
a nominal one third of service payments on these debts, Kenya's total
debt service ratio is about 6 percent.
16.       In spite of the much greater need for external capital now
facing the country, Kenya is still following a cautious policy in her
external debt management, although the Government is making greater
use of suppliers' or export credits on favorable terms to finance some
of the larger projects now ready for implementation. Under the assump-
tions made by the Bank staff about balance of payments developments,
Kenya's external debt will have to increase considerably over the next
decade if the expected balance of payments gap is to be filled. While
Kenya's economic performance certainly justifies substantial amounts
of concessionary financing, including IDA credits, these are available
in limited amounts only.. It can therefore be expected that the terms of
borrowing would be on.the average less favorable than Kenya has enjoyed
in the past. However, since export earnings will increase during the
period as well, barring major unforeseen developments in Kenya's terms
of trade, the debt service ratio would probably not exceed 11 percent
by the end of the 1970s. By that time it is estimated that the Bank
Group might hold about 35-40 percent of total disbursed debt and receive
over 20 percent of debt service payments. Beyond 1980, creditworthiness
will depend on Government ability to take action in the near future to
increase the productivity of investments, to reduce the import propensity
and to increase exports. The revised public investment program of Kenya



-6 -
for the next few years represents a major step in this direction. Tem-
porary higher debt service payments in the early 1980's may be followed
by a fall in debt service ratio in the latter part of the decade if the
Government's action program is successful. However, in spite of the
considerable efforts of the Government to improve domestic resource
mobilization, limitations on domestic resources are such that a sub-
stantial part of the costs of the program, including limited amounts
of local costs in the case of projects with a low foreign exchange com-
ponent may have to be financed from external sources.
17.       Kenya is one of the three Partner States belonging to the East
African Community. The 1967 Treaty for East African Cooperation is one
of the most far-reaching and comprehensive economic cooperation agreements
in existence among sovereign states in the developing world. However, in
practice the degree of economic integration and cooperation among the
Partner States is much less than what was envisaged in the Treaty. Poli-
tical developments in the Partner States have created tension within the
Community and impaired the growth of interstate trade.     These difficul-
ties have been compounded by the balance of payments crisis which currently
faces all three Partner States.
PART II - BANK GROUP LENDING TO KENYA
18.       Kenya has to date received thirteen Bank loans and seventeen
IDA credits amounting to $184.9 million and $144.7 million, respectively.
In addition, Kenya has been one of the beneficiaries of nine loans total-
ling $229.8 million which have been extended for the development of common
services (railways, ports, telecommunications and finance for industry)
operated regionally for the three Partner States of the East African
Community -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Annex II contains summary
statements of Bank loans and IDA credits to Kenya and the East African
Community Corporations, a summary of IFC investments in Kenya, and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
19.       Ongoing projects in Kenya are on the whole progressing satis-
factorily, but manpower constraints in engineering and other technical
fields continue to present problems and have slowed down progress on
some projects. Because of the difficulties in attracting qualified
expertise, no immediate remedy can be expected. However, the gradual
increase in suitably trained Kenyans to fill such positions should
eventually alleviate these problems.
20.       While our past lending Lo Kenya has been dominated by support
for infrastructure, our lending in recent years marks a departure. Last
year Kenya was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to obtain Bank Group
support for a population project. Recently, as a first step in providing
low-income dwellers in Nairobi with suitable housing, a site and service
project was presented to the Executive Directors. In support of the action
program adopted by the Government to restructure the economy and maintain



-7 -
the momentum of growth in a period of serious balance of payments con-
straints, a Program Loan was recently presented to the Executive Direc-
tors. Our agricultural lending has been stepped up mainly as a result
of an expanded program of technical assistance both through our Regional
Mission in Eastern Africa and direct technical assistance to the Ministry
of Agriculture. The Governmert has now launched with assistance from
the Association, Canada, United Kingdom and United States, a five year
beef development program utilizing the grasslands in the Northeast of
Kenya. This project is expected to benefit some 170,000 people many
of whom are nomads. A tea factories project to ensure adequate process-
ing facilities for Kenya's high quality tea is under construction and a
project aimed at rehabilitation of some 130 group-owned farms is about to
start. A broadly conceived integrated crop production project, designed
to benefit a large number of small farmers, is now being appraised and
preparation is under way for an irrigation project in the Lower Tana
River Basin and for expansion of sugar production.
21.       Concurrently with efforts to support agricultural production,
we foresee a need for complementary development of rural infrastructure
and hope to assist rural access roads and rural water supply schemes in
the near future. We shall also shortly appraise a wildlife and tourism
project which will help provide infrastructure for new tourist circuits
and help spread benefits to rural communities and a third education
project aimed at improving primary school education is under considera-
tion.
22.       While the major emphasis will continue to be on agriculture and
the development of the rural economy, there is also a need for continued
support to infrastructure and services necessary for continued growth
of the economy. Apart from the proposed Project, a highly economic oil
products pipeline project is being presented to the Executive Directors.
A loan for a water supply scheme to provide Mombasa and surrounding rural
areas with safe water has been negotiated.
23.       The difficulties facing the East African Community Corpora-
tions referred to in paragraph 17 have affected the Bank's lending pro-
gram for the Community. The East African Railways Corporation (EARC)
has been the most severely affected. As a result of long delays by
the Partner States in approving increases in tariffs and restrictions
placed on the interstate transfer of corporate funds, the Corporation
has been unable to order essential spare parts and supplies with the
result that its operational capacity has deteriorated drastically. In
July 1974 the Partner States agreed on a package of financial measures
designed to rehabilitate the EARC including transfers of funds and in-
jection of additional capital. However, this agreement has been only
partially implemented. Restrictions have continued to be placed on the
interstate transfer of EARC and other Community Corporations funds, and
EARC's position has deteriorated further. Since EARC corporate funds are
not being transferred in accordance with the formula agreed, and Sh 60
million out of a total of Sh 150 million the Partner States agreed to
inject into EARC have not been paid, the EARC's right to make withdraw-
als from the Loan Account (from Loan No. 674-EA) has been suspended pend-
ing action on both these issues. Furthermore, in the current state of



-8-
uncertainty regarding the future structure of the Community Corporations,
appraisal of further proposed community projects for Corporations which
may have structural changes has been postponed until the issues mentioned
above have been clarified.
24.        IFC has committed a total of $25.9 million for three companies
in Kenya (Pan African Paper Mills, Ltd.; Kenya Hotel Properties, Ltd.;
and Tourism Promotion Services (Kenya Ltd.).As of April 30, 1975, IFC
held for its own account $17.9 million    comprising $13.3 million of loans
and $4.6 million of equity. IFC is discussing with the technical partner,
SEDITEX, and the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation a pro-
posal to set up a new textile mill and is also considering support for
a sugar processing plant.
PART III - TiE POWER SECTOR
Organization and Management of the Power Industry
25.       The generation and supply of electricity are undertaken by three
companies: the East African Power and Lighting Company (EAP&L), the Kenya
Power Company (KPC), and the Tana River Development Company (TRDC). Of
the three companies which comprise the electricity supply industry in
Kenya, EAP&L was founded in 1922 by the amalgamation of two private com-
panies then in existence and is the sole public distributor of electric-
ity. KPC was set up in 1955 primarily to finance the interconnection
with Uganda and to sell imported power to EAP&L. TRDC was instituted
in 1964 mainly to develop the potential of the Upper Tana River. In
July 1970, the Government became the majority shareholder in the EAP&L
and in February 1971 acquired all the shares of TRDC and KPC.
26.        The Government is in the process of rationalizing the structure
of the power industry by integrating all three companies. Nevertheless,
the present arrangement, though complicated, is operating efficiently and
it is not of significant importance if a reorganization cannot be achieved
in the short term. Under the current arrangement, EAP&L purchases the en-
tire output of KPC and TRDC at ascertained cost, and manages and operates
both KPC and TRDC. It also provides funds, including a development sur-
charge, to enable TRDC to cover its operating expenses, debt service. and
future development programs. The surcharge is determined each year so
that the rate of return on average net fixed assets in service of TRDC
and KPC combined is the same as that earned by EAP&L.
27.        EAP&L is a well managed utility.    It is headed by an Executive
Chairman, a Kenyan, who is a competent administrator. The number of expa-
triate professional staff has fallen rapidly from about 190 in 1970 to
about 120 by the end of 1974. EAP&L has been replacing these vacancies
as far as possible with qualified local staff, but is having some diffi-
culty in filling them all. It appears that EAP&L will have to rely par-
tially on expatriates for some years to come until qualified Kenyans can
be trained to replace them.



-9-
Electricity Consumption
28.       While overall electricity consumption in Kenya increased at an
average of 8 percent per year during the period 1964 to 1974, the growth
rate in recent years was higher, averaging 10 percent per year during
the period 1968-1972 and 8 percent in 1973 and 1974, compared to 5.5
percent per year during the period 1964-1968. Between 1968 and 1974,
domestic consumption increased by about 6 percent per annum but its
share in total sales dropped from 34 percent to 29 percent. Commercial
consumption increased at an annual average of 13 percent and industry,
the largest consumer of electricity in Kenya, registered an annual growth
rate of 12 percent. Industrial demand is expected to grow by about 14
percent in 1975 increasing more than 16 percent in 1976 and 1977; by
1980 more than half of all electricity supplied in Kenya will be con-
sumed by the industrial sector.
29.       Because of the momentum in-Kenya's development, built up over
the past few years, the rate of growth in total consumption of electric-
ity is expected to remain between 10 and 11 percent annually for the
period 1976-1978, but is then expected to decline to about 9 percent.
The estimates have taken into account all known major developments, in-
cluding a possible slowdown in the economy. To meet the growing demand
for power, additional generating capacity will be required.
Existing Facilities and Future Development
30.       The existing generating capacity consists of hydroelectric power
stations (130 MW), a steam station (65 MW), diesel-electric power stations
(33 MW) and a gas turbine generating plant (30 MW), for a total capacity
of 258 MW. Because of Kenya's heavy reliance on thermal plants (62 per-
cent of installed generating capacity) and hence imported fuel, the cost
of generating electricity in Kenya has increased substantially with
higher oil prices.
31.       In addition to the domestically generated electricity, Kenya
takes a 30 MW bulk supply from the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) under
a long-term agreement, extending to year 2005, giving a total available
capacity of 288 MW. This includes 4 MW of diesel plant supplying isolated
areas.
32.       Under construction is the third Kamburu hydroelectric gener-
ating unit (30 MW) and the Kipevu No. 7 steam turbine generating unit
(30 MW). They are expected to be commissioned next year. However,
these developments will not be able to meet the growing demand by 1978
and, therefore, a major further expansion of capacity is required.
33.       Kenya has only two potential natural sources of energy that
can be developed for electrical power generation: the hydroelectric
potential of the Tana River and the geothermal reserves in the Rift
Valley. The hydroelectric potential is estimated at over 30,000
Gigawatt hours, but half of it is scattered over small rivers. The



- 10 -
Tana River,whose source is in the Aberdare Mountains with important
tributaries joining in from the slopes of Mount Kenya, accounts for
the other 15,000 GWh of which about 2,700 GWh is economically exploitable.
34.       Geothermal survey and exploration with UNDP assistance have been
in progress since 1970. The first successful well has been drilled in the
Lake Naivasha area and is running dry steam with a little water. Two addi-
tional wells are being drilled in the same area under the current program.
In the opinion of the UNDP geologist, the field could be capable of gener-
ating power of up to 300-400 MW in the future. Consultants have been
appointed to carry out a feasibility study of the reservoir and to rec-
ommend a program of development. Depending upon the recommendations made
in this study, the Government would consider proceeding with the pilot
installation and a large-scale drilling program with a view to establish-
ing a large-scale geothermal power plant in the future. However, even
assuming the program proceeds as envisaged with the pilot plant installed
by 1977, and the main plant ordered by the late 1970s, a major geothermal
plant could not be in operation before the early 1980s.
35.       The Government has also considered importing additional power
from neighboring countries. However, because of seemingly inadequate
plant maintenance and slowdown in development of hydro resources in
recent years in Uganda, it is doubtful that Uganda will be able to
supply sufficient power in excess of the 30 MW under the present con-
tract. Tanzania exports up to 20 MW may be possible after the commis-
sioning of the second stage of Kidatu power station in 1980. However,
because of the small amount of power which might be available and the
possibility that it might not be available when required, EAP&L feels
it would be imprudent to consider this in its development plans at this
time.
36.       In September 1972 EAP&L commissioned a study to examine and
recommend a development plan for the period 1973 through 1992, and to
determine the form and location of the power generation source which
would be required by 1978. The study recommended the construction of
a 120 MW thermal power station at Mombasa for commissioning in 1978 to
be followed by Gitaru hydroelectric project in 1981. However, this
recommendation was re-examined after the substantial increases in the
cost of fuel oil during late 1973 and early 1974 and it was demonstrated
that the'Gitaru hydroelectric project, preceding gas turbines, is now
the preferred course of action. The Government therefore decided to
go ahead with the Gitaru Project with a minimum of delay to ensure that
the growing demand for power in the major commercial and industrial
sectors can be met by 1978.
Rural Electrification
37.       Recognizing that electricity forms an important impetus
for development, the Government has maintained a policy of extending
a public electricity supply to small urban and rural centers in Kenya.
For this reason EAP&L has been allocating about 1 percent of its net



operating income to the development of supplies in the rural areas.
Schemes likely to become financially renumerative in time have been
selected from a list of townships nominated by the Government. In
addition, the Government requires that the surplus created by the
difference between the soft terms of the Swedish credit for the
Kamburu project and the harder onlending terms to TRDC should be
used to finance an expanded rural electrification program. The
1974-78 Development Plan provides for an expansion of electricity
to an additional 28 rural centers, including 13 district headquarters.
Thus by the end of the Plan Period all district headquarters should
have electricity. This program, however, has been proceeding slowly
due to financial and manpower constraints. With additional assistance
from Sweden and possibly other countries these bottlenecks should be
overcome.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       A report entitled "Kenya - Appraisal of the Gitaru Hydroelectric
Project" (No. 627-KE dated May 22, 1975) is being circulated to the Execu-
tive Directors separately. The project was designed by the Engineering
Power Development Consultants (EPDC) of the UK and was appraised in
August/September 1974. A brief project summary is given in Annex III.
Negotiations were held in Washington in April, 1975. The Kenya delega-
tion was led by Mr. S. Ogembo, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Power and
Communications.
39.       The proposed loan to TRDC for the Gitaru hydroelectric power
project would be the Bank's second for the development of the power sector
in Kenya. The first loan (745-KE) was made to TRDC in 1971 to finance the
first two generating units (30 MW each) of the Kamburu hydroelectric
installation, which was commissioned in August 1974.
Project Description
40.       The proposed Gitaru hydroelectric project would be located
between the existing Kamburu and Kindaruma hydroelectric power stations.
The three power stations would operate in cascade in that they would all
use the same water, one following the other. Gitaru would complete the
development of the hydro potential of the UJpper Tana River referred to
as the "Seven Forks" development.
41.       Specifically, the Project comprises (i) a low diversion dam
with an integral spillway; (ii) vertical intake shafts with short headrace
tunnels to the underground power station designed for three 67 MW gener-
ating sets (rated at 72 MW for individual operation), with two sets
installed under the project; (iii) a long tailrace tunnel (4.7 km) to
the Kindaruma reservoir; (iv) transformers, substations and associated
transmission lines; and (v) a management review and a study of EAP&L's
tariff structure.

Estimated Cost and Financing
42.       The estimated cost of the project is US$135.9 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$97.5 million including interest during
construction. The estimated project cost includes a physical contin-
gency of 20 percent for civil works and 10 percent for electrical and
mechanical works; these contingencies contain provision for a possible
delay of 6 months in project completion. It also includes a price
contingency of 27 percent based on an estimate of the general rate of
inflation during the period of construction.
43.       The project would be financed by the proposed Bank loan,
export/suppliers credits, EAP&L and the Government of Kenya. The pro-
posed Bank Loan of $63.0 million, which would finance about 46 percent
of total project cost, would be used to finance part of the civil works
contract, miscellaneous electrical and mechanical works, engineering and
administration, the management review and interest during construction
on the proposed loan. The Borrower has also obtained firm commitments
of about $21.0 million to help finance the two main supply contracts.
The balance of the cost, estimated at $51.2 million or 38 percent of
total cost, would be financed locally by: a 10 percent increase in
tariffs starting July 1, 1975; the inclusion in the tariff of a fuel
surcharge and continuation of the development surcharge estimated to
yield about $18.0 million; a loan of $5.6 million from EAP&L to TRDC;
and the balance under a Government commitment of an equity subscription
of $16.8 million and a loan of not less than $11.6 million.
Status of Export/Suppliers Credits
44.       The major items of equipment, namely, the turbines, generators,
gates, screens, transmission lines, substations and transformers, have
been selected by TRDC for export credit/suppliers financing at an esti-
mated foreign exchange cost of US$27.2 million. For this equipment, TRDC
issued tender documents requesting both cash and financing offers. Thir-
teen suppliers from seven countries submitted cash and financing offers
for these contracts. Interest ranges from 7 to 8-1/2 percent per
annum   and repayment over ten to fifteen years.    The financing commitments
obtained cover on average about 80-85% of the foreign exchange costs of
these contracts. Conclusion of agreements with suppliers or export credit
institutions of about $21.0 million will be a condition of effectiveness
of the Bank loan (Section 7.01d of Loan Agreement). In the evaluation
of tenders both the financing offer and the cash offer will be taken into
account. No contract will be awarded prior to presentation of the proposed
project to the Executive Directors.
Financial Aspects of EAP&L, KPC and TRDC
45.       The activities of the three companies comprising the power
sector in Kenya are closely connected through common management. The



- 13 -
financial position of the Borrower, TRDC, should, therefore, be eval-
uated jointly with that of KPC and EAP&L. The consolidated balance
sheet shows that, at the end of 1974, the total net assets of the
three companies were KL 47.0 million (US$131.6 million) and the debt
equity ratio was 51/49. The forecast total net assets for the three
companies are estimated to be KL 100 million (US$280 million) and the
debt equity ratio 56/44 by the end of 1978.
46.        The forecast of the consolidated requirements and sources of
funds, after eliminating inter-company payments of TRDC, KPC, and EAP&L,
for the period 1975-1978 shows that, of the total construction and working
capital requirements of the three companies estimated at about $170 mil-
lion: 27 percent would be financed by net internal cash generation after
providing for debt service and dividends, 10 percent from increase in
share capital by the Government, and the balance by borrowings (36 per-
cent by the proposed Bank loan, 11 p~ercent by export/suppliers' credits
and 16 percent by other loans). The Government has agreed that if addi-
tional funds are required to complete the project because of cost over-
runs, it will provide the additional financing requirement in accordance
with arrangements satisfactory to the Bank. (Section 2.02 of Guarantee
Agreement.)
47.        The rate of return will be measured in terms of net operat-
ing income as a percentage of average net fixed assets including work
in progress. The forecast rate of return is estimated to average 8.7
percent during 1976-1978 and 9.1 percent during 1979-1980. The Govern-
ment has also agreed that it would take measures necessary to permit
EAP&L, as well as TRDC/KPC, to obtain revenues sufficient to yield
a rate of return of not less than 8-1/2 percent of their average net
fixed assets including work in progress. Net fixed assets are to be
revalued annually on the basis of a price index system satisfactory
to the Bank, which will take into account the replacement values of
these assets as well as fluctuations in the value of the Kenyan cur-
rency. (Section 4.01 and 4.02 of Project Agreement; Section 3.02 of
Guarantee Agreement.)
Management. Review
48.       While EAP&L is a well-managed utility and is operated in
accordance with sound commercial principles, there is still room for
further improvement in its management structure and its internal re-
porting system. EAP&L recognizes these weaknesses and has agreed to
appoint consultants satisfactory to the Bank to carry out a management
study. The recommendations would be jointly examined and their imple-
mentation agreed by the Bank and EAP&L. (Section 2.02 of Project Agree-
ment.)

Tariff Review
49.       An analysis of existing tariffs by the Appraisal Mission
suggested a need for tariff restructuring to reflect the costs of sup-
plies to different consumer categories. Any new tariff system recom-
mended should reflect the long-term marginal cost of supplying electric
power at different times to different consumer groups; it should meet
the financial needs of the power sector and accord with the Government's
fiscal and social policies. It has been recognized that the tariff for
low-income households would be adjusted to the Government's goals of
income distribution. The Bank staff is assisting EAP&L in carrying
out this study.
Project Execution
50.       The Borrower will carry out, under the supervision of a com-
petenL consultant firm, the Engineering Power Development Consultants,
the construction program, which is tight but achievable provided no
unforeseen major problems arise. A great deal of the engineering, geo-
logical survey and the associated work has already been carried out.
Specifications for the civil works and all the major plant contracts
have been completed and tenders have been received for the major plant
and civil works contracts.
Procurement and Disbursement
51.       Procurement for goods and services to be financed from the
proposed Bank loan will be on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. A margin of prefer-
ence of 15 percent or the level of customs duties and other import
taxes to be paid by non-exempt importers, whichever is lower, will
be granted to domestic manufacturers for goods manufactured in Kenya.
In the case of minor items of equipment not exceeding US$50,000 equiv-
alent, contracts will be awarded, where appropriate, on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally, and in accordance with local
procedures satisfactory to the Bank (Schedule 4 of Loan Agreement).
Bids for the procurement of equipment and materials to be financed
by export/suppliers' credits have been advertised internationally,
but confined to those countries or suppliers offering financing.
52.       Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan would be made for 60
percent of civil works expenditures and 100 percent of foreign expendi-
tures of the equipment, materials and engineering and consultant's
services procured under the loan, and for interest during construction.
Because of the change in development plans from thermal to hydroelectric
(see para. 36), the preliminary work had to be initiated without delay,
if the expected demand in 1978 is to be met. Estimated consultants'
expenditures incurred after April 1, 1974 of up to US$2.0 million have
therefore been included in the project cost estimates; it is proposed
that the foreign exchange cost of US$1.5 million should be financed
retroactively from the proposed Bank loan.

Ecological Aspects
53.       In the case of Kamburu Project (Loan No. 745-KE), the
Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) is financing an
ecological study to determine the effects of Kamburu on land usage,
disease vectors, etc. SIDA has agreed to include the Project area
in this study as well.
Tana River Water Allocation
54.       The proposed Gitaru project would complete the hydro devel-
opment of the Seven Forks in the Upper Tana River. Because the Upper
Tana waters could also be used for irrigation and other purposes, the
Government, in 1972, formed the Tana River Development Authority (TRDA)
to carry out studies to determine the most efficient use of the Upper
Tana waters. The study is now complete and, according to the Govern-
ment, recommends the establishment of an Upper Reservoir of some
1000 million m3. The benefits of such a reservoir will include
availability of water for irrigation of the Upper Tana, rural water
supplies, provision of firm hydro power of about 80 MW in the average
year and expansion of irrigation potential in the Lower Tana River
Basin. The Government has agreed that, until the completion of such
a Reservoir, it will not undertake a development program which would
substantially reduce the output from the Gitaru power station (Section
3.02 of Guarantee Agreement). A similar agreement was obtained for
the Kamburu power project.
Justification of the Project
55.        Selection of the next step of expanding Kenya's generating
capacity involves the cost analysis of several possible power development
strategies. The EAPL consultants conducted a detailed analysis (see para.
36) and recommended that Gitaru power station be constructed for commis-
sioning in 1978, to be followed up by three gas turbines of 22 MW each for
commissioning respectively in 1980, 1981 and 1982. The next best alternative
would be the installation of three gas turbine units of 22 MW each in 1978,
1979, and 1980, respectively, with the commissioning of Gitaru postponed
until 1981. A comparison between these two alternatives showed that the
proposed.strategy is preferable for all discount rates below 11.5 percent.
The proposed project would ensure that the demand for power in Kenya would
be met by 1978 at the minimum cost.
56.       Since the equalizing discount rate of 11.5 percent is at the
lower end of the opportunity cost of capital in Kenya (estimated at
11-13 percent) the choice of the Gitaru project is a close one. It
has been discussed extensively with the Government and the EAP&L, who
strongly favor the Gitaru alternative because of uncertainties in
obtaining dependable power from neighboring countries and in the cost
of oil for thermal power, and because bilateral financing tied to this
project is now available at reasonable terms. In view of the fact that



- 16 -
this project is by a slight margin the preferred alternative and the
estimated costs have been based on actual bids, the Gitaru project is the
recommended alternative.
57.       The economic rate of return of the project is about 14 percent.
This rate is satisfactory.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Tana River
Development Company Limited, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Republic of Kenya and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the
Bank and EAP&L, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (Iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text
of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
59.       Special features of the draft Loan, Guarantee and Project
Agreements are referred to in paragraphs 44, 47 and 54 above. Conditions
of Effectiveness include satisfactory arrangements for export credit/
supplier credit financing, and the execution and delivery of a Tnird
Supplemental Trust Deed to cause the security constituted by previous
trust deeds executed by the Borrower to be extended to cover the principal,
interest and other payments under the proposed loan. Except as noted
above, the draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern for public
utility project loans.
60.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
61.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Loan 639 - Highways: $23.5 million Loan of October 10, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975. Construction is substantially completed.
There has been a 45 percent increase above original cost estimates due
mainly to design changes.
Loan 641 - Forest Plantation: $2.6 million Loan of
November 7, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1975. Progress is
satisfactory and disbursements proceeded faster than envisaged, and
the Loan was almost fully drawn down a year before Closing Date.
Planting and technical aspects are satisfactory.
Credit 185 - Education: $6.1 million Credit of May 20, 1970;
Closing Date:   December 31, 1975.   Construction is proceeding at a
slower rate than anticipated. As remedial action has been taken, it
is expected that all project institutions, except two, will be com-
pleted prior to the Closing Date. An extension of the Closing Date
of about 12 months is likely to be required in order to complete the
two project items lagging behind.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced eval-
uation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page  3
Loan 714 - Water Supply: $8.4 million Loan of November 7,
1969; Closing Date: March 31, 1976. Good progress has been made
on the main project items, and water was delivered to Nairobi on
schedule in March 1974. A twelve-month postponement of the Closing
Date, however, was required to enable completion of ancillary items.
The Water and Sewerage Department is still experiencing staffing
shortages in its engineering and commercial sections due to inability
to attract and retain staff. The financial results of water operations
are generally satisfactory and water tariffs have now been increased.
Cost overruns, which are mainly due to local cost increases, are
about 31 percent over the appraisal estimates.
Credit 224 - Road Maintenance: $12.6 million Credit of
December 28 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975. This project is
progressing well, although its final completion is now expected to
be delayed till December, 1976 - eighteen months behind the original
schedule. The delay is due to some unforeseen difficulties experienced
in acquisition of land and procurement of steel required for construc-
tion of the workshops. Most of the equipment has been received and
installed, and the Highway Training Center is in operation. While the
majority of the senior posts in the Roads Branch have been filled,
a few are still vacant due to difficulties in finding suitably qual-
ified specialists.
Loan 745 - Kamburu Hydroelectric: $23.0 million Loan of
June 7, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1975. The project was com-
missioned in August 1974 and there are only a few minor details
outstanding. Cost escalation was 7 percent, principally the result
of currency fluctuations, the imposition of a sales tax in 1973 and
an increase in engineering costs. The closing date has been post-
poned from June 30, 1975 to December 31, 1975 because some retention
moves are not due till then.
Credit 276 - Highways: $22.0 million Credit of June 5, 1972;
Closing Date: March 31, 1976. This project, which is jointly financed
by a Swedish Credit of $6.0 million, made a slow start due to a review
of paving standards undertaken by Government and consequent delays in
obtaining governmental approvals to issue tenders. Because of high
bid prices and specification changes, total estimated cost of the proj-
ect may exceed the appraisal estimates by over 25 percent.
Loan 826 - Nairobi Airport: $29 million Loan of June 2, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975. The major contracts have been awarded,
and work has commenced. Inadequate supervision by the key contractor
and administrative delays by the Government have led to delays in the
physical execution of the project. Financial and organizational prob-
lems persist. There is likely to be a cost overrun of about $10.5
million. Some key positions, including that of the Airport Manager,
still remain unfilled. The project is now expected to be completed
by December 31, 1976 rather than by December, 1975 as originally anti-
cipated. The Closing Date of this Loan may have to be extended to
December 31, 1977.

Credit 344 - Agricultural Credit:    $6.0 million Credit of
November 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. The Agricultural
Finance Corporation has started a second phase of lending operations,
following the completion of the first under Credit 105. Progress is
satisfactory, and disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Loan 932 - Highways: $29.0 million Loan of September 6,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977. This Loan was made effective
on November 9, 1973. Owing to a review of paving standards, bids
have yet to be invited for about 30 percent of the works. Cost
overruns are likely to be substantial.
Loan 946 - Industrial Development Bank: $5.0 million Loan
of November 29, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1976. The Loan has been
fully committed and negotiatlons for a second tranche have been sub-
stantially completed. So far about $1.5 million has been disbursed.
Credit 468 - Population: $12.0 million Credit of April 1,
1974; Closing Date:   June 30, 1980.   This Credit became effective on
July 31, 1974. The construction for this project is estimated to be
about 6-8 months behind schedule. There have also been some delays in
the employment of technical experts.
Credit 477 - Livestock: $21.5 million Credit of June 5,
1974; Closing Date: December 21, 1980. This credit was declared
effective on December 2, 1974. Work on the ranching component is now
proceeding, but the project is behind schedule.
Loan 993 - Tea Factories: $10.4 million Loan of June 5, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980. This Loan became effective September 23,
1974. Contracts for the first four tea factories have been let but the
tendering for remaining tea factories is behind schedule.
Credit 537/Loan 1093 - Group Farms Rehabilitation Credit and
Loan of March 27, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1981. This Credit
and Loan is not yet effective.
,Credit 543/Loan 1105 - Site and Service Project of May 6, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980. This Credit and Loan is not yet effective.

Loan No. 674 EA - Third Railways Project: $42.4 million Loan of
May 25, 1970; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
This Loan was suspended on February 13, 1975. The reasons
for suspension and conditions for lifting the suspension are discussed
in para. 23 of this President's Report.
Loan No. 638 EA - Second Harbours Project: $35.0 million Loan of
August 25, 1969; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
The Harbours Corporation is in a healthy cash position
although there have been problems in transferring funds from regional
offices to headquarters. Damage to a partially completed pier has
delayed project implementation. It is now expected that the construc-
tion will finish in mid-1975. Legal questions resulting from the dam-
age are under study by the Government.
Loan No. 865 EA - Third Harbours Project: $26.5 million Loan of
December 18, 1972; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
A delay of six months is expected in completing civil works
under this project. Cost overruns have been experienced in some project
items. The situation is under study by the Corporation, which will
shortly issue a plan for speeding implementation.
Loan No. 843 EA - East African Development Bank Project: $8.0 million
Loan of June 28,1972; Closing Date - May 31, 1976
Operations of the Bank have been decentralized with a resulting
strengthening of the Bank's supervisory capability. Management problems
associated with decentralization have largely been rectified so that the
pace of bank operations is expected to quicken in FY76. Nearly $6.5 mil-
lion of the Loan has been committed.
Loan No. 675 EA - Second Telecommunications Project: $10.4 million Loan
of May 25, 1970; Closing Date - June 30, 1975
Problems within the EAC have only marginally affected the Posts
and Telecommunications. Corporation due to the considerable existing decen-
tralization of operation authority. Deterioration of the corporate cash
position and rate of return has been slight in comparison to other Com-
munity Corporations; the situation will be improved by a pending rate
increase.

Loan No. 914 EA - Third Telecommunications Project: $32. 5 million

Procurement is generally on schedule with $20 million committed
and the balance near tender stage. All major items are expected to be
completed by mid-1975, except two microwave links which, due to long
lead time for delivery, will be delayed by 18 months.

duties and other import taxes to be paid by non-
exempt importers, whichever is lower, will be
granted to domestic manufacturers for goods man-
ufactured in Kenya. In the case of minor items
of equipment not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent,
contracts will be awarded, where appropriate, on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised lo-
cally, and in accordance with local procedures
satisfactory to the Bank (Schedule 4 of Loan
Agreement). Bids for the procurement of equip-
ment and materials to be financed by export/
suppliers' credits have been advertised inter-
nationally but are confined to those countries
or suppliers offering financing. Retroactive
financing in an amount up to $1.5 million would
be allowed for consultant services incurred after
April 1, 1975.
Consultant
Services:              The Engineering Power Development Consultants (EPDC)
of the UK have been selected for the supervision of
the construction.
