PROJECT COMPLETION PEPORT
MADAGASCAR
SECOND VILLAGE LIVESTOCK AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ICREDIT 1211-MAGI
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report for the Second Village Livestock
Project for which Credit 1211-MAG, in the amount of US$15.0 million, was
approved on February 23, 1982.
The Credit was closed on December 31, 1988, one year behind schedule.
The last disbursement was on August 29, 1989, at which time the non-disbursed
amount of US$7.5 million (50% of the original credit) was cancelled.
The report was prepared by the Agricultural Operations Division of the
South-Central and Indian Ocean Department in collaboration with the FAO
Investment Center (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). The
Borrower's comments on the Project Completion Report are reflected in Part II.
This repV_t is based, inter alia, on the findings of a mission to Madagascar
in January, 1991, the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit
Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence, and the mid-term evaluation
report.

PROECT COMPLETION REPORT
MADAGASCAR
SECOND VILLAGE LIVESTOCK AND RURL  DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1211-MAGl
EVALUATION SUMMARY
LBackaround
1.          At the beginning of the 1980s, agriculture accounted for 40% of
GNP and 80% of exports; it provided a livelihood for 80% of the population.
The livestockl subsector played a special part, given the size of the country's
herds and flocks (10 million head of cattle, 1.8 million sheep and goats, and
1.1 million pigs) and its high potential for production (420,000 km2 of
rangeland and comparatively favorable animal health conditions, since
Madagascar is free of many of the livestock diseases frequently seen in
Africa). In addition, livestock breeding has an important function in village
economies subsisting on small-scale farming: cattle, for instance, are widely
used for field work and transportation; and consumption of beef, the cheapest
meat on the market, is relatively high, although it has been declining in the
last decade due to falling incomes.
2.          The Second Village Livestock Project was the third livestock
operation in Madagascar. The first livestock project, the Beef Cattl2
Development Project (Ln. 585-MAG), called for the introduction of new
techniques through state owned ranching and importation of animals (Brahman
cattle, which hal not been tested in the Malagasy environment), major
investments in infrastzucture, and intensive technical assistance. The
project failed primarily due to poor project design, which was never seriously
reconsidered during implementation, and a neglect of land tenure issues. The
design of the second livestock project, the First Village Livestock and Rural
Development Project (Cr. 506-MAG), incorporated many of the lessons learned
from the first project. Government and IDA opted for a model of village
development based first and foremost on building up animal health and
extension services targeted on traditional livestock breeders. In order to
implement the project, a special development agency, FAFIFAMA was set up in
1974. In general, implementation of this project proceeded satisfactorily.
Objectives and Design
3.          The main purpose of the Second Village Livestock Project was to
build upon and expand the achievements of the first project. It was to expand
animal health coverage in Mahajanga Province, test different animal husbandry
intensification methods and complete construction of rural infrastructure
facilities, but also to strengthen the livestock subsector nationally by



- v -
upgrading its organization, importing and distributing veterinary products,
and supplying eluipment.  FAPIPFAA would again be the implementing agency.
Xm2lementation Experience and Results
4.          The project achieved its goals as far as animal health coverage in
Mahajanga Province was concerned. The animal husbandry pilot program had to
be abandoned, however, and the rural infrastructure program gave mixed
results. Strengthening of the national livestock subsector ran into numerous
administrative difficulties which slowed it down and limited its achievements.
The curtailment or abandonment of programs, and devaluations of the Malagasy
franc (which greatly reduced doll.ar costs) were the main factors behind the
sizeable reduction in total project cost (US$12.3 million instead of the
anticipated US$25.8 million), which caused the cancellation of roughly 50% of
the financing granted by IDA and the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD). The main reasons why the project achieved its goals only
partially were: insufficient preparation of certain project components, a
very high turnover rate among project managerial staff, bureaucratic delays
(particularly the slow pace of procurement) and cash flow problems.
Nevertheless, the economic benefits accruing from vaccination campaigns are
substantial enough to give the project a rate of return in excess of 50%,
primarily because (i) benefits associated with vaccinations became apparent
more rapidly than had been expected at appraisal and despite delays and
partial achievements; and (ii) the investment program was much smaller than
expected.'
S.          During the mid-term review of the project, in September 1987, it
was decided that the credit would be extended by one year to carry out a
number of studies focussing on necessary reforms in the livestock sub-sector.
These studies laid the ground work for fundamental changes in the strategy of
the Ministry of Livestock vis-&-vis the private sector and a shift in emphasis
from beef towards dairy production.
Sustainability
6.          While the project has proven that in terms of expertise and
organization, a satisfactory vaccination coverage to improve animal health can
be achieved, the question how this effort can be sustained once project
funding comes to an end, has yet to be addressed.
7.          The creation of a specific project authority (FAFIFAMA) next to
the Provincial Livestock Service (SPEL) is not sustainable both for financial
reasons - termination of project funding - and management reasons -
1/    The PCR estimate of the economic rate of return is likely too high
because it includes some of the achievements of the First Village
Livestock Project; it was impossible to filter these out with the
information available. All the sane, it is certain that the actual
economic rate of return of the project exceeds appraisal estimates.



v 
overstaffing and confusion on respective roles. The decision to terminate
FAFIFAMA's project role and transfer back its responsibilities to the Animal
Production Service (SPA) of the Ministry of Animal Production and Water and
Forest Resources was therefore taken in 1988, and FAFIFAMA was terminated in
early 1991.
8.          Since Government cannot ensure adequate recurrent cost funding for
a national animal health and extension service, it has become necessary to
move towards a system of increased cost recovery through fees collected from
the beneficiaries and, in parallel, towards an increased privatisation of the
animal health services. These actions are now part of the Livestock services
reforms agreed to by the Government in the context of the Livestock Sector
Project, which was presented to the Board on May 16, 1991.
9.          The project's efforts to ensure the supply of veterinary products
to the country by having them imported and distributed through a centralized
Government agency (Pharmac!e Centrale) was clearly not sustainable; thLs has
since been taken over by private suppliers in the context of the macro-
economic reforms and liberalisation of imports which took place in 1987-1988,
and is working satisfactorily.
Findings and Tessons Learned
10.         The project has, through both its successes and its failures,
taught a number of important lessons, which either have been addressed in the
context of the structural adjustment program, or are being addressed in the
Livestock Sector Project:
(a)   the creation of a specific project authority (FAFIFAMA) next
to the provincial livestock service (SPEL) is not
sustainable both for financial reasons - termination of
project funding - and management reasons - overstaffing and
confusion on respective roles. The decision to terminate
FAFIFAMA's project role and transfer back its
responsibilities to SPA was already taken in 1 988, but only
executed in 1991.
(b)   the design of an animal husbandry component needs to be done
at preparation time and take into account not only supply
side constraints, but demand constraints and the economic
environment as well. In the event, the cessation of meat
exports as well as the declining local beef market made a
successful executicrn of this component totally impossible.
(c)   the imposition on a project authority to carry out
activities that fall outside the project should be carefully
reviewed and in general, only rarely be allowed. In the
event FAFIFAMA's financial management was weak, it turned
out impossible to separate project accounts from non-project
funding.



- vi -
(d)   the question of sustainability of regular vaccination
campaigns, an open issue during project implementation, is
now being addressed in the Livestock Sector Project; a fee
system has been introduced which will initially pay for the
medicine, and progressively include payment of the
vaccinators, as veterinary services are being privatized.
(e)   importation and distribution of drugs should be handled,
where appropriate, by the private sector, or where severe
market distortions exist by the private sector in
competition with a public sector agency.

2.          Project Background
2.1         At the beginning of the 1980s, agriculture accounted for 40% of
GNP and 80% of exports; it provided a livelihood for 80% of the population.
The livestock subsector played e special part, given the size of the country's
herds and flocks (10 million head of cattle, 1.8 m.llion sheep and goats, and
1.1 million pigs) and its high potential for production (420,000 km2 of
rangeland and comparatively favorable animal health conditions, since
Madagascar is free of many of the livestock diseases frequently seen in
Africa). In addition, livestock breeding has an important function in village
economies subsisting on small-scale farming: cattle, for instance, are widely
used for field work and transportation; and consumption of beef, the cheapest
meat on the market, is relatively high, although it has been declining in the
last decade due to falling incomes.
2.2         The Second Village Livestock Project was the third livestock
operation in Madagascar. The first livestock project in Madagascar, the Beef
Cattle Development Project (Ln. 585-MAG), called for the introduction of new
techniques (ranching on state owned farms) and importation of animals (Brahman
cattle, which had not been tested in the Malagasy environment), major
investments in infrastructure, and intensive technical assistance. The
project failed primarily due to poor project design, which was never seriously
reconsidered during implementation, and a neglect of land tenure issues. The
design of the second livestock project, the First Village Liveatock and Rural
Development Project (Cr. 506-MAG), incorporated many of the lessons learned
from the first project. Government and IDA abandoned the ranching concept and
opted for a model of village development based on building up animal health
and extension services for traditional livestock breeders. In order to
implement the project, a special development agency, the Livestock Development
Agency for West Madagascar (FAFIFAMA) was set up in 1974. In general,



-2-
implementation of the project proceeded satisfactorily, despite initial delays
related to the status of FAFIFAMA. The objectives of the animal health
component were achieved, in particular with respect to veterinary
infrastructure, staff training, and implementation of livestock vaccination
campaigns. The pasture improvement component was not very successful, as was
part of the rural infrastructure component (with the exception of the
conatruction of schools).
3.          Project Obietives and Descriptiop
3.1         The objectives of the Second Village Livestock Project were to
increaae Madagascar's meat production, thereby raising incomes for poor
livestock owners and increasing exports, to strengthen livestock institutions
and to support policy changes for the sub-sector. The main emphasis in the
project would be given to expanding output through maintenance and extension
of animal health programs in the area covered by the first project and,
thro':gh imports of essential veterinary products and equipment for the
national veterinary service, throughout the country. This emphasis reflected
the experience under the previous project that animal health programs have
great potential for raising productivity cheaply and quickly under traditional
husbandry systems. The project was to test several different systems oa whose
success future livestoclk intensification efforts would depend.
3.2         The project included the following components:
For Mahajanga province:
(a)   Continuation and extension of the basic animal health program;
(b)   A pilot animal production program;
(c)   Road construction and maintenance;
(d)   Water supply; and
(e)   Management and material support for FAFIFAMA, the project
implementing agency.
For the livestock sub-sector nationally:
(a)   Technical assistance to improve the organization of the sub-sector
and its institutions;
(b)   Imports of veterinary products, equipment and materials for the
national veterinary service;
(c)   Applied research; and
(d)   Studies, documentation and training.
4.          P
4.1         The project was prepared by FAFIFAMA, based on a feasibility study
conducted by SEDES, a French consulting firm. After an application for
financing was addressed to IDA in October 1979, an appraisal mission visited
Madagascar in June and July 1980. A post-appraisal mission was sent in
November 1980  v take a more in-depth look at the subsectoral and



- 3 -
inetitutional aspects of the proposed operation. During appraisal,
significant changes in project design were made. First, the project was
reviewed in the overall context of the sub-sector, in order to identify the
relationship between the proposed components and the economics of livestock
production throughout Madagascar and to clarify the implications of Government
policy. As a result, components were added to the project to support
Government initiatives in redefining policy for livestock and improving
management of the sub-sector. Second, the proposed animal husbandry
intensification and commercial steer fattening program was reduced to the
scale of a pilot program, on the grounds that too little information and
technical experience were available to justify a large-scale program; and the
technical experience and managerial capability available to develop and manage
the proposed fattening farms were too limited. Purther changes were agreed
upon during post-appraisal, largely as a result of the rapid deterioration of
the economic and financial situation of the country in the second half of
1980. The pilot component for animal husbandry intensification was further
reduced and a program to import veterinary products for the national animal
health pragram was introduced. Finally, project implementation arrangements
were modified to take into account the recent reorganization of the Ministry
of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform (MDDRA).
4.3         FAFIFAMA would be respon :ble for the components to be implemented
in Mahajanga province; the Animal Production Service (SPA), which was part of
MDDRA, would implement the sub-sector components. The choice of FAFIFAMA was
virtually automatic, since the First Project PCR had indicated that its
management capabilities had proven satisfactory. Little attention was
therefore paid to the risks inherent in having FAFIFAMA simultaneously
implement the project and be responsible for the commercial management of the
abattoirs and cold store. The subsector component, supposed among other
things to strengthen the organizational side of animal production services,
had logically been assigned to SPA. However, no plans were made to set up a
project management unit within the Department.
5.           roiecst Imnlementation
5.1         Proiect Effectiveness.  As a consequence of bureaucratic delays in
meeting credit conditionality, the credit did not become effective until March
1983, more than one year after Board approval. The IFAD loan, which had been
approved in March 1982, also did not become effective until March 1983,
because of cross-conditionalities.
5.2         Xmnlementation Schedule.  The project, to be implemented over five
years, was closed December 31, 1988, a year later than planned. The extension
of the closing date by one year was necessary to allow for the completion of a
thorough review of sector issues that IDA and Government had agreed to do, in
preparation of a new generation livestock project.
5.3         Proiect Costs and Financina.  The total cost of the project had
been estimated at US$25.83 million, to be financed as follows: US$15 million
from IDA, US$8 million from IFAD, and US$2.33 million from the Government. On
termination of the project, total actual cost was only US$12.3 million, with



-4-
IDA and IFAD having contributed US$7.4 milion a%d US$4.4 million
respectively. French, Swiss and German bilateral aid also contributed to the
project costs, through donations of veterinary medicine. Project coats were
significantly below appraisal estimates for a number of reasons. The animal
production pilot program had to be abandoned because of shortcomings in the
underlying studies and the economically discouraging results obtained on
trials; management difficulties and problems in formulating a policy on
pastoral watering facilities led to a considerable reduction in the scope of
the rura). infrastructure program; and implementation of the livestock
subsector component ran into numerous administrative difficulties which not
only slowed down the execution process but also reduced its scope. In
addition, devaluations of the Malagasy franc led to a significant reduction in
the cost (denominated in U.S. dollars) of numerous inputs and local
expenditures. Project costs and financing are shown in Table 5, Part III.
5,4         Disbursements.  Due to implementation delays and the large
reduction in project costs, disbursements lagged considerably behind appraisal
estimates. The Credit was closed on December 31, 1988. The last disbursement
was on August 29, 1989, at which time the undisbursed balance of USS 7.5
million (50% of the original credit) was cancelled.  Estimated and actual
disbursements for the IDA credit are shown in Table 3.A, Part III.
5.6         Proiect Risks.  The Staff Appraisal Report identified several
risks associated with the livestock sub-sector part of the project: (i) the
organization of the veterinary service could affect the effectiveness of the
importation of veterinary producte; and (ii) the successful implementation of
the other components of the livestock sub-sector depended on new policy
orientations from the Government and the implementation of a coherent
production strategy.
5.2         Issues during Project Implementation.  Three major sets of
circumstances are at the root of the difficulties encountered during project
implementation:
(i)      During the execution process, frequent changes were made in the
institutional framework on which the project depended. The
responsible Ministry was reorganized three times (1982, 1983, and
1985) the Animal Production Department, in charge of the national
sub-sector component, was reorganized twice, and project
responsibilities were split between two different services from
1985 onwards. These institutional changes were accompanied by
appointments of new managers and a rapid turnover rate of
personnel, which was prejudicial to sound project execution.
(ii)      Hurricane Kamisy, one of the most violent Madagascar has ever
experienced, caused very serious damage in the project zone in May
1984. Infrastructure built during the First Project and the early
part of the Second was damaged, particularly buildings constructed
of local materials. It was therefore necessary to rehabilitate or
reconstruct numerous buildings, and since the opportunity was
logically taken to chan:ge to a permanent type of construction a
major increase in Costs ensued.



(iii)      Management of the Mahajanga export slaughterhouse had been
entrusted to FAFIFAMA, despite strong objections of IDA and other
donors. Due to inefficient managemnent and unsanitary conditions,
the slaughterhouse lost its export license to the EEC, and its
subsequent operation at undercapacity caused severe losses.
Cashflow problems appeared very rapidly, since the government
budget contained no provisions for reimbursing these losses.
Despite repeated requests, Bank supervision missions never
succeeded in obtaining the complete separation of commercial from
project activities. This burdened the project with constant
cashflow problems, over and above those created by delayed and
inadequate releases of local counterpart funds.
6.          Project Results
(a)   Regional comnonents
6.1         Basic animal health:  At appraisal, it had been decided to increase
the number of communes included in the target zone from 527 to 1,351 -- thus
expanding coverage to the entire Province. This expansion was completed in
three years instead of the four anticipated, despite the damage done by
hurricane Kamisy in 1984. It was also during the third year that the maximum
number of vaccinations against blackleg and anthrax was achieved (2.6 million
animals vaccinated, or 95% of the goal set for the end of the project period).
The number of vaccinated animals was maintained thereafter at 1.9-2.2 million
head of cattle, or 70%-80% of the project objective. According to FAFIFAMA
executives, the decline in the number of vaccinations was due to delays in
deliveries of vaccines and, from 1988 onward, to the dismissal of a third of
the village vaccinators, as a result of cuts in Government funding. These
vaccination rates (covering 60-75% of the total number of head in the
Province) were sufficient, however, to ensure effective coverage approaching
the economic optimum. A SEDES survey in 1986 found that an increase in the
vaccination rate from 60% to 75% reduces the number of deaths by half, but
that beyond the 75% point there is no longer any perceptible gain. In
addition, the number of calves treated for endo-parasites reached 157,000 head
in 1985, then falling to 135,000 over the next two years, and finally to
100,000 in 1938. The project goal, which was to treat 22% of calves, was
therefore achieved during a three-year period. FAFIFAMA executives regarded
the decline as the consequence of less widespread acceptance by farmers of a
new treatment offered them after 1985 and of the dismissal of vaccinators in
1988. As regards vaccination of pigs and poultry, the results achieved were
equally satisfactory. After having reached maximum figures in 1985 (pigs:
53,000; poultry: 700,000) the number of animals vaccinated fell during the
last years of the project. It is not possible to compare achievements here
against project goals, since the latter were set at a level significantly
below the pig and poultry vaccination rates achieved early in the course of
the project.
6.2         To achieve these results, the project expected to recruit 115
supplementary staff, including 56 village vaccinators, 30 veterinary



-6-
assistants and 6 veterinarians. In February 1987, however, 47 more
vaccinators had been recruited than envisaged, bringing incremental
vaccination staff to 137. By December 1987, incremental vaccination staff had
dropped to 120, and by December 1988 to 80. Despite this reduction, the
number of vaccinations per staff increased, which implies that FAFIFAMA
effectiveness improved. The solution advocated from 1986 onward by
supervision missions, namely that local authorities (at the commune level)
assume the cost of vaccinators, seems to have had little success; no figures
were available to the PCR mission except in the case of one district where
responsibility for two out of three vaccinators had apparently been taken over
by the local authority conicerned. Some degree of confusion was created after
termination of the project, because a policy to privatize and liberalize the
veterinary sector was announced. Government circles, professionals and local
authorities are waiting for information on the practices and procedures that
will be used to give effect to this policy, the main concern being how it will
impact on operations in the field.
6.3         In order to provide agents with housing and work facilities, 80
veterinary centers and 20 vaccination crushes were built; hurricane Kamisy,
which in May 1984 had destroyed numerous buildings constructed of local
materials during the First Village Livestock Project, added to the building
requirements. By September 1987, 86 veterinary centers had been either built
or rebuilt and 16 crushes created. According to information assembled during
the PCR mission, there were, on termination of the project: 9 primary
veterinary centers (6 of them built during the First Project), 7 secondary
centers, and 79 tertiary posts (34 of them rebuilt following the hurricane).
No new vaccination crush was installed after 1987, although materials required
for an additional 35 of them are available (crush building goals had been
increased during project implementation).
6.4         Pilot livestock in  nsification prooram:  This program was
abandoned in 1985. The survey that was to identify the 40 participating
villages and determine the actions to be introduced proved disappointing.
Moreover, cattle-fattening trials, at both industrial and smallholder levels,
demonstrated that the profit potential of the operation was uncertain. The
Credit proceeds were therefore reallocated to a dairy program, which was
designed as part of a study carried out in the Mahajanga region. A milk-
processing plant was built in 1988, which has been collecting an increasing
proportion of the milk output of three livestock breeder associations,
organized by the project, since the beginning of 1991.
6.5         Road construction And maintenance:  This component was designed to
be carried out in the pilot project zone. However, after the pilot project
was abandoned, the equipment intended for it was used to build roads serving
project facilities elsewhere and by the Public Works Department to
rehabilitate major and secondary roads. On termination of the project, the
equipment was leased to a private firm. In all 383 km of roads were built or
had maintenance work done on thom (100 km estimated at appraisal). These
roads have been operational and contribute significantly to tae economy of the
region.



-7-
6.6         Water supolv schemes:  Plans for watering points in grazing areas
were affected as a result of the abandonment of the pilot livestock
intensification program and by the controversy over whether tube wells or
surface storage units (ponds, small dame) were to be used. In the end, only
six watering points were developed, instead of the 36 planned; they consisted
of one reservoir (where the dam wall was destroyed during the second year of
operation) and five wells equipped with windmills and installed adjacent to
FAFIFAMA's livestock purchasing posts. At the time of the PCR mission, no
windmills were operating for lack of maintenance, although some of the wells
were being used by the local population. The village water-supply program,
which called for the sinking of 80 wells with beneficiary participation in the
form of both labor and materials equivalent to 20% of installation costs,
virtually achieved its target (with 75 wells sunk), despite considerable
difficulties encountered by the project management unit in obtaining necessary
information from the Hydrogeologic Service. Participation by villagers in the
work of construction was not required until 1986 and 1987. Most of these
wells are still in use.
6.7         SuPDort for FAFIFAMA: The measures making up this component had
to do mainly with staff training and the establishment of a monitoring/
evaluation unit. At the time of the mid-term evaluation mission, it was noted
that all FAFIFAMA employees, whatever their qualifications, had had the
benefit of an on-the-job training program in the form of a period of advanced
training spent at Antsiranana (CETEL), Antsirabe (CFC), the Tombotsoa school
farm, or in the workshops of firms holding concessions for equipment used by
FAFIFAMA. The head of the Animal Production Department made a study tour of
several months' duration in Europe and the Pacific (New Caledonia). The head
of the Water Supply Division visited installations in France, Togo and Kenya
to broaden his experience and knowledge of pumping technology. The managing
director of FAFIFAMA took part in a management training course in Mauritius.
As to the monitoring and evaluation function, a Department with these
responsibilities wB set up in the first quarter of 1983. Its first task was
to collect and process data generated in the course of the pilot livestock
intensification program. After the decision was taken to discontinue this
program, it concentrated on administrative tasks. At that point, nothing had
yet been done about establishing a management information system, supposed to
include an improved cost accounting system.
(b)   Sub-sectoral Components
6.8         Technical assistance to imorove organization in the subsector:
This component was to consist of: (i) two studies; (ii) design and
implementation of a training program for SPA personnel; and (iii) procurement
of equipment and motor vehicles for SPA. The subject of the first study,
"Meat Supply to the Capital," was altered and became "Availability of Meat and
Hides for Export." Terms of reference were drawn up in 1983 and a call for
tenders issued in 1984. The contract was not awarded, however, until two
years later, because of disagreements between the Ministry of Animal
Production and Water and Forest Resources (MPAEF) and IDA. The second study,
a thorough review of key institutions in the livestock sub-sector, was
financed by USAID. In addition, MPAEF commissioned a study on restructuring
of the central veterinary pharmacy. Institutional changes and high staff



turnover rates were major constraints affacting the design and implementation
of the proposed training program for SPA personnel, while the subcomponent for
procurement of vehicles and equipment was carried out in full.
6.9         Studies. documentation and scholarships:  Since the goals of this
component and the previous one were similar in many respects, the two should
have been combined. The findings of the studies were useful in that they
improved knowledge of the subsector. After the mid-term evaluation of the
project, a proportion of the available Credit proceeds was reallocated for the
preparation of a new livestock project. This decision has turned out to be
beneficial. The studies have been instrumental in laying the basis for a
dialogue between the Bank and the Government which has led to fundamental
changes in the role of the 1ii:.stry vis-a-vis the private sector, and a shift
in emphasis from beef towards Qairy production.
6.10        A consultant was commissioned to examine the status of SPA
documentation services and to make recommendations for its improvement and
rational management; this study indicated a need to rehabilitate the SPA
library and train specialized personnel. No more than a few scholarships
(short-term) were organized, as a consequence of the many institutional
changes and high staff turnover rates.
6.11        Imports of veterinary products and materials:  Government policy
coupled with scarcity of foreign exchange made it necessary for the project to
finance imports of veterinary products and materials to satisfy the needs of
the country; this was done by the Central Pharmacy, a service run by MPAEF.
The component has suffered from a series of mishaps: (i) ignorance of
effective demand; orders were placed on the basis of administrative estimates
that had little to do with actual demand or delivery capacity; (ii) faulty
procurement; long delays in the procurement process caused a scarcity in
supplies in the first years of the project and an oversupply in later years
(e.g. at mid-term evaluation it was found that sufficient supplies of a
certain drug were stored for four years of consumption whereas the effective
life of the drug was 18 months); and (iii) mismanagement of stocks. In the
end, imports totaling US$ 2.7 million were financed by IDA (68% of what was
expected at appraisal) and US$ 0.9 million of imports was financed by other
bilateral donors. These mishaps do not appear to have affected the adequacy
of veterinary supplies at the project level. The experience nevertheless
convinced both IDA and the Government in 1987 to stop official imports and
leave the field to private importers; the import regime was subsequently
liberalized. Also, IDA insisted on closing down the Central Pharmacy, an
action which - after a good two years delay - was finally taken by Government
in 1991.
6.12        Appjjled research:  The funds allocated for this subcomponent were
supposed to serve for preliminary cross-breeding experiments between the local
Zebu and exotic breeds. The amount allocated was not sufficient to carry out
a significant experiment, in addition the time available within the project
period was found to be too short for experimentation. It was therefore agreed
that the funds would be reallocated to other project activities.

7.          Economic and Financial Results
7.1         The PCR mission was unable to obtain the technical data that would
have allowed "with project" and "without project" comparison of the farming
model formulated in the Appraisal Report. The financial rate of return from
this model has therefore not been calculated. It was possible, however, using
data from the 1974 and 1986 censuses, to assess the benefits (at faritany
level) of the vaccination campaigns (Part C, Table 6A)t this information
provided the basis for estimating the economic rate of return, which, at over
50% (Part C, Table 6B), is much higher than the appraisal figure (36%).2  The
rapidity and extent of the effects of vaccination campaigns on improving
animal mortality rates is what explains the high rates of return. The
difference in rates between the PCR and the Appraisal Report basically
reflects the fact that surveys indicated that the benefits associated with
vaccinations became apparent more rapidly than had been expected at appraisal.
In addition, the investment program of the project was greatly reduced, which
positively affected the rate of return.
8.          Sustainability of Project Results
8.1         While the project has proven that in terms of expertise and
organization, a satisfactory vaccination coverage to improve animal health can
be achieved, the question how this effort can be sustained once project
funding comes to an end, needs to be addressed.
8.2         The creation of a specific project authority (FAFIFAMA) next to
the provincial livestock service (SPEL) is not sustainable both for financial
reasons - termination of project funding - and management reasons -
overstaffing and confusion on respective roles. The decision to terminate
FAFIPAMA's project role and transfer back its responsibilities to SPA was
therefore taken in 1988, and FAFIFAMA was terminated in early 1991.
8.3         Since Government cannot ensure adequate recurrent cost funding for
a national animal health and extension service, it has become necessary to
move towards a system of increased cost recovery through fees collected from
the beneficiaries and, in parallel, towards an increased privatisation of the
animal health services. These actions are now part of the Livestock Services
reforms agreed to by the Government in the context of the Livestock Sector
Project, which was presented to the Board on May 16, 1991.
8.4         The project's efforts to ensure the supply of veterinary products
to the country by having them imported and distributed through a centralized
Government agency (Pharmacie Centrale) were clearly not sustainable; this has
since been taken over by private suppliers, in the context of the macro-
2/    The PCR estimate of the economic rate of return is likely too high
because it includes some of the achievements of the First Village
Livestock Project; it was impossible to filter these out with the
information available. All the same, the actual economic rate of return
of the project exceeds appraisal estimates.



10 -
economic reforms and liberalisation of imports which took place in 1987-1988,
and is working satisfactorily. Adequate supplies of veterinary products now
are available through private importers, although problems persist in
distributing them throughout the country. MPAEF and the importers themselves
should study these distribution problems jointly.
8.5         Although left aside by the project, research and experimentation
into methods of intensifying animal production have lost none of their
importance. These actions should nevertheless be taken up again only when it
becomes clear that effective demand is increasing. With the reopening of meat
exports and the slow return to growth of the economy, the prospects for this
to happen are becoming better.
8.6         The three associations of milk producers set up with project
support have become convinced that the operation they are engaged in is
worthwhile. Regular increases in their deliveries of milk to the processing
plant confirm this. If the operation is to develop further, the plant must
continue to ensure that milk is collected regularly from the whole group, and
at a price acceptable to both parties. As FAFIFAMA has been dissolved, the
producer associations will need to appoint a dairy processing plant manager
officially and ensure that he respects producers' interests.
8.7         Results of the move to reinforce the Animal Production Department
were disappointing. However, reinforcement is still essential if the
Department is to have help in formulating a policy for development of the
animal production subsector, as well as support in putting it into effect.
Such assistance could be provided as part of a new project with World Bank
financing.
9.          Bank Performance
9.1         It has been pointed out earlier that the weaknesses that affected
both preparation and appraisal of several components of this project made the
work of the supervision missions more difficult. This difficulty was
compounded by the fact that Bank staff responsible for the project changed
several times over the course of the first year. Subsequently (Table 8, Part
C), over a nearly three-year period, supervision missions were dispatched very
regularly, to the undoubted advantage of the project -- although some of them
would have been more useful if they had included an economist, who among other
things could have provided better support for the Monitoring and Evaluation
Department. During the last two years of the project, no supervision missions
at all were organized. Although requested as early as the beginning of 1986,
the mid-term evaluation mission was not sent out to Madagascar until September
1987, four months prior to the scheduled credit closing date.
9.2         During the course of the project, the Bank seconded a staff member
who had previously worked on the project to MPAEF for two years. This
arrangement was certainly of benefit to the project: for instance, very
detailed technical and financial documents were prepared by project staff for
use by the mid-point evaluation mission, while various studies in preparation
for a third livestock project were begun in 1988.

10.         Borrower Performance
10.1        Government's support for the project was evident throughout, but
the services of MPAEF proved very weak. Three factors reduced the
effectiveness of this backing: (i) major delays in executing a number of
components, as a result of the lengthy nature of bureaucratic procedures,
particularly in the area of procurement - to which must also be added delays
in taking decisions and then carrying them out; (ii) the effects of several
reorganizations of the Animal Production Department and high rates of turnover
among its top staff -- the key reasons for the lack of continuity in the
project execution process and the difficulty of getting a training program
into place; high staff turnover rates also had played a role in the slow pace
at which decisions were taken; and (iii) Government's refusal to act on
donors' recommendations regarding separation of accounts and activities in
FAFIFAMA's "development" and "commercial" segments; the result was that
counterpart funds, which were already insufficient, needed to be diverted in
part to cover losses sustained on this agency's commercial operations.
10.2        FAFIFAMA executed the vaccination campaigns in the beginning ahead
of schedule, however, when funding constraints became apparent the
effectiveness of the parastatal began to decline. Financial management,
accounting and procurement were weak, a situation which was compounded by the
money losing commercial activities that had been entrusted to FAFIFAMA.
11.         Consulting Services
11.1        At the time tne project was being prepared, it was decided there
was no point in resorting to long-term consultants; only short-term
consultants were to be retained. This technical assistance was used mainly to
prepare the ground for studies, with few consultants taking any part in actual
execution of the project. With hindsight, it now appears it would have been
beneficial to strengthen national agencies with long-term consultants; this is
particularly true as regards the livestock subsector component, the ambitious
goal of which was to upgrade the organization of the Animal Production
Department.
12          Protect Documentation
12.1        The PCR mission had access to detailed data on the first four
years of the project, initially compiled for the mid-term review in September
1987. In contrast, only fragmentary data were available on the last year of
the project. In addition, the mission could meet with only three former
project professionals, the others having been assigned to other positions on
completion of the project in December 1988 or on the dissolution of FAFIFAMA
in April 1990. Moreover, once the mid-term review mission had announced its
findings, project personnel lost their motivation, and as supervision missions
were also suspended, data relating to the 1987-1988 phase of the project are
virtually non-existent.



- 12 -
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE 3
1.    Relative to the objectives and design of the project, one can say that
project results have been satisfactory in terms of livestock coverage in the
Mahajanga province. This despite problems encountered by the different
participants in the project ever since project start-up, as well as the
numerous administrative problems that delayed and limited project
achievements.
2.    Project implementation was delayed because of the following reasons:
-     insufficient preparation of certain project components;
-     rapid staff turnover
-     one year delay in credit effectiveness, as a result of which
project funding did not become available until April 1983;
-     insufficient and delayed availability of counterpart funds; and
-     cumbersome procurement procedures, because procurement guidelines
of both the World Bank and the Government of Madagascar had to be
followed.
When taking these factors into account, the technical and financial
achievements of the project are acceptable.
3.    At the date of credit closure in 1988, several issues were still
unresolved, such as the link between FAFIFAMA and its former cattle slaughter
ajtivities, and the transfer of livestock service responsibilities from
FAFIFAMA to the Mahajanga province SPEL. These issues have now been resolved.
4.    Lessons learned from the project:
(i)   the management of FAFIFAMA circumvented whenever possible the
Department of Livestock within the Ministry. The only regular
communication was on the annual work program of FAFIFAMA and on
the use of the proceeds of the IDA Credit. As a result, when the
decision was taken to close the FAFIFAMA parastatal, the
Department of Livestock was completely unaware of FAFIFAMA assets,
debts, activities, etc. The Department was therefore never able
to follow-up on the project. In order to prevent such a situation
from recurring, a special unit has been created within MPAEF to
coordinate the activities of the Livestock Sector Project.
(ii)  Recruitment of special project personnel creates problems after
project closure. To the extent possible, civil servants should
therefore be used for all administrative activities planned under
the Livestock Services Project.

Government on June 19, 1991. The original letter is in project files.

IJ   In the Staff Appraisal Report, the increases in production are based on increases achieved
since 1977, year 1 of the First Village Livestock project. In the Project Completion Report,
these increases are based on the increase in production achieved since 1982.
21   The fourth project year (1986), is the year in which the SEDES survey took place and when
the highest vaccination rates were achieved.
;J/   The year 1989 was the last year for which this mission was abl3 to collect data.
4/   PCR estimates are based on the SEDES survey in 1986, which indicated that the animal
health activities of FAFIFAMA had reduced annual beef cattle mortality by 44,000 animals
compared to 1978 and by 80,000 animals compared to 1974. The live weight of these
animals is estimated at 300kg. After 1987, the vaccination coverage has started to decline
and it is assumed that for budgetary reasons long-run coverage will decline by 20%.
.a/   Vaccination protects, on average, 25% of the pigs. The average live weight is about 80kg.
Long-run coverage will decline by 20%.
Atu  Vaccination protects, on average, 33% of all poultry. The average live weight for poultry is
about 0.8kg. Long-run coverage is expected to decline by about 20%.

project coverage. These costs are estimated at 10, 50 and 20 percent of the value of the
incremental production of beef cattle, swine and poultry.

1/ At present, Madagascar neither imports nor exports pork. Interior prices, presently superior by 50%  to those of
beef, indicate a certain tension on demand; on the International market, however, prices for beef are double the price
of pork. The level of unsatisfied demand justifies the import-substitution option chosen to calculate the economic
price of pork.
21 In constant 1990 prices.
2/ Estimated at 2% of CIF price.
_4t Estimated at 7% of carcass value.
A/ Estimated at 5% of live animal value.
13t Price noticeably superior to actual market prices (1500 FMg/kg of live weight).
