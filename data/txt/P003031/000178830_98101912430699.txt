I. ENVIRONMENT
A.   The Industrial Sector
1.01      The Industrial Sector (including manufacturing but excluding mining
and basic metal processing) represents a relatively small part of the Zairian
economy and presently contributes some 8-10% of GDP. Over the past decade
the pattern of growth of the sector has been uneven and has tended to mirror
the variable growth trends of the economy as a whole. Between 1968 and 1974,
manufacturing output (see Annex 1) grew at an annual average rate of 10%. In
1975 and 1976, however, manufacturing output declined by 7% per annum and
is estimated to have fallen by an additional 10% in 1977 and 15% in 1978.
Over the 1966-76 period the relative performance of different industrial
subsectors varied considerably. Among consumer goods industries, beverages
and tobacco expanded significantly, while more moderate growth was posted
by light chemical industry (soaps, paints, varnishes, etc.) and plastics.
Conversely the metal products, leather goods and clothing industries grew at
best very slightly. In intermediate and capital goods, transport equipment
(mainly motor vehicle assembly) and non-metallic minerals (cement and concrete
products) grew substantially, while woodworking output declined considerably.
Overall the trend has therefore been away from processing local materials, in
favor of industries based upon imported raw materials, partly as a result of
declining supply of local agricultural and forestry inputs. Also consumer
goods industries grew significantly faster than intermediate and capital
goods.
1.02      In 1970, the last date for which detailed statistics are available,
there were 530 industrial enterprises with modern accounting systems, which
provided full-time employment to some 102,000 persons. It is estimated that
industrial sector employment expanded between 1970 and 1974, but has declined
substantially thereafter with the already noted fall in output between 1975
and 1977. Presently industrial employment is estimated to represent 15-20%
of total employment in the monetarized sector of the economy. The size
distribution of industrial enterprises would also appear to have changed
little since 1970, for which year the last industrial census indicates that
enterprises employing over 100 workers predominated, accounting for about 89%
of total manufacturing value added. In 1970, industrial enterprises were
concentrated geographically in the two major urbanized areas, Kinshasa and
Lubumbashi, contributing 43% and 19% respectively of industrial employment and
51% and 20% respectively of industrial value added. Since then, Kinshasa's
importance as a manufacturing center has increased further, with most new
large manufacturing projects being located in that region.
1.03      Up until 1973, almost all major industrial enterprises were owned
by foreign and locally-based expatriate interest. The "zairianization"
measures of 1973-74, however, transferred to private Zairian hands ownership
of many firms in the transportation, commerce and agriculture and agro-
industrial sectors, and to a lesser extent in manufacturing. In 1974-75,
the Government's "radicalization" measures effectively nationalized about 67%
of firms in the manufacturing sector, which nevertheless continued to be
managed for the most part by their expatriate former owners and managers.

The "zairianization" and "radicalization" measures resulted in severe dis-
location of the distribution system of manufactured goods (especially in the
interior), a drastic decline in the level of industrial investment and a
substantial deterioration in relations between the private sector and Govern-
ment. In 1976-77, under the Government's "retrocession", program, ownership
of almost all nationalized firms and a large number of "zairianized" enter-
prises was returned to their former foreign owners, who were required sub-
sequently to find Zairian partners to purchase 40% of their shareholdings.
Although locating suitable local partners has in many cases proven difficult
given the limited number of Zairian entrepreneurs, several foreign owned
industrial firms have so far managed to do so. There thus would appear to
have been a significant change in ownership structure in the industrial
sector, as a number of Zairian entrepreneurs have also retained control of
"zairianized" companies which they later purchased, while others have used
profits earned in trade and commerce to purchase shareholdings in manufac-
turing firms. Of a sample of 67 large and medium-scale enterprises in seven
branches of manufacturing taken in late 1976, 21 were totally foreign-owned, 13
totally Zairian owned, 7 were State-owned and the remainder (26) were mixed
ventures.
1.04      Industrial investment in 1970 amounted to g 14.6 million or about
15% of total investment in that year, and represented 18% of industrial value
added. Although data for later years are not available, it would appear that
industrial investment probably remained at the same level until 1973/74 when
the "zairianization" and "radicalization" measures had a severe dampening
effect upon its overall level and in particular halted almost all inflows of
private foreign investment. Since then, with the deepening economic crisis
in Zaire, the investment climate has remained depressed. Following "retro-
cession" in 1976/77, owing to the lack of adequate maintenance and replace-
ment of plant and equipment during the period of "zairianization" and
"radicalization", plants in many branches of industry were in major need of
modernization and rehabilitation. However private foreign investments for
this purpose have not been forthcoming due to continued uncertainties in the
investment environment coupled with declining demand for certain manufactured
products and shortages of foreign exchange for profit repatriation and im-
ported raw materials and spare parts. In some branches, notably those based
on processing of local raw materials (and especially agro-industry), net
disinvestment had been occurring since the late 1960s as a result of inade-
quate pricing policies (see para 1.10) and a progressive decline in the avail-
ability of agricultural inputs. In this environment, SOFIDE has become the
major, if not the only, source of term investment finance (in particular in
foreign exchange) and has financed much of the investment required to
preserve Zaire's industrial base and to restore agricultural and agro-indus-
trial production.
1.05      Government Industrial Policies.  The Government has tried to use a
number of policy instruments to regulate and promote industrial development
in Zaire. The most important of these are analyzed below, with the exception
of foreign exchange controls and credit regulations which are described else-
where in this report. (see paras 1.17 - 1.20) (a) Price Controls. Prices
of almost all manufactured goods are controlled at the producer, wholesale



- 3 -
and retail levels by the Ministry of National Economy, although with high
inflation rates in recent years, changes in official prices have been rela-
tively frequent. Producer prices are generally established on the basis
of production costs (including depreciation) plus a 20% profit margin before
tax (which is 50%). Fixed margins above these prices are also set for whole-
salers' and retailers' mark-ups. Increasing general and also i.termittent
shortages of supply of manufactured goods, however, have caused price control
mechanisms to be rather ineffective particularly at the wholesale and retail
levels, where high profit margins of extended chains of commercial interme-
diaries have tended to greatly increase final consumer prices above officially
established ones. (b) Foreign Trade Regulation. Taxes and duties on imported
goods in Zaire do not seem unusually high by comparison with other developing
countries, but appear somewhat unsystematic and haphazardly applied. As a
result, some local manufacturers have difficulty in competing with imported
goods owing to higher tariffs being charged on their imported inputs than
on competing imported finished products. Industrial exports, which represent
only a very small proportion of Zaire's total exports are in numerous cases
discouraged by imposition of export duties and have been almost totally stymied
in recent years by the exchange rate. (c) The Investment Code. Under the
Investment Code established in 1969 and revised in September 1979, the Gov-
ernment can grant a number of tax exemptions (on profits, expatriate income
taxes, property taxes, import duties on capital equipment) and guarantees for
repatriation of capital investment, profits and interest. The Investment Code
benefits are granted for periods which vary in length depending on the size
of the projects and of their priority for the country. Until September 1979,
the Code was administered by an Investment Commission within the Department
of National Economy which examined all project applications for approval and
granting of incentives. Although the 1969 Code had specific criteria for the
assessment of the economic contribution of projects, the small staff of the
Investment Commission was not able to review adequately the large number of
applications, and decisions to grant the advantages of the Investment Code
were sometimes taken for political reasons outside the Commission. Some
projects received extremely favorable and economically unjustified advantages,
such as practically unlimited protection against foreign and local competi-
tion. Moreover, due to lack of overall guidelines and objectives, the Commis-
sion might decide without adequate financial and economic analysis. Incen-
tives were given to some projects with low economic return or high dependence
on imports. Consequently, the 1969 Code was not used as an effective tool to
channel investments to priority sectors. As pointed out in the OED perfor-
mance audit report, the relationship between the Commission and SOFIDE was
not clearly defined at the outset; in practice it has been informal and ad
hoc. A condition of the fourth IDA credit was that SOFIDE should be more
closely and formally associated with the activities of the Investment Commis-
sion.  In practice, however, development of such a relationship has to date
made little progress for the reasons already mentioned above. SOFIDE, however,
does assist clients in their application for benefits under the Investment Code
and in such cases cooperates with the Commission in its investment screening
process.  In September 1979, the Investment Code underwent a major revision
in its contents particularly with regard to the organization of its implemen-
tation by the Investment Commission. The objectives of these changes are:
(a) to strengthen and improve the process of project evaluation by establishing



- 4 -
specific economic criteria for selection of projects for award of benefits and
through more complete financial and economic analysis; (b) to streamline and
simplify the decision-making process; and (c) to encourage foreign investment
which brings into Zaire new investment capital, while deemphasizing suppliers'
credits as a means of financing new projects. To achieve these objectives,
the Investment Commission (responsibility for which has been transferred to
the Planning Commission) is to have a permanent membership consisting of rep-
resentatives of the Departments of National Economy and Finance, BDZ, and a
President of the Commission itself, as well as a permanent technical secre-
tariat within the Planning Commission.
1.06      In the crisis which has beset the Zairian economy since 1974,
the impact of price controls, foreign trade regulations and the Investment
Code upon the activities of the industrial sector has in practice been very
limited. The effectiveness of these and other policy instruments has also
been reduced by insufficient qualified manpower in Government administration.
However, such manpower shortages exist on a national level and it will require
a major training effort in the medium and longer term for it to be overcome.
Additionally, the Bank's report, "The Manufacturing Sector in Zaire," 1/ makes
the following recommendations for improvement in present industrial policies:
(a) in the short and medium-term, better allocation of scarce foreign exchange
away from non-essentials and in favor of raw materials and spare parts for
local producers, revision of the price control system to provide greater
incentives to local production (especially in agriculture) and introduction of
a simple but regular industrial reporting system; and (b) in the longer term,
giving priority to development of industries based upon local raw materials,
reform of the tariff system to provide adequate incentives for local produc-
tion and strengthening of the system for identifying and evaluating industrial
projects. The report's major recommendations have been taken into account in
the preparation by Government of its recovery program for the Zairian economy
(the Mobutu Plan). However, since their implementation would have economic
implications beyond the industrial sector, it is not considered appropriate
that specific industrial policy changes be linked to the proposed credit.
1.07      In addition to the principal Government institutions involved with
industry, which have already been mentioned above, the Office for Promotion
of Small and Medium-Scale Zairian Enterprises (OPEZ) was established in 1973
to provide assistance to small-scale enterprises in Kinshasa. To date OPEZ
has been unsuccessful in fulfilling this role because of inadequate organiza-
tion and staffing and the lack of a defined strategy supported by the Govern-
ment. SOFIDE has tried with some success to develop its assistance to Zairian
entrepreneurs and has also tried to establish closer cooperation with OPEZ
in this field, but has not succeeded in doing so owing to OPEZ's limited
capabilities. SOFIDE is planning to continue its attempts to work with OPEZ,
1/   Report No. 2212-ZR, October 29, 1979.



and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is presently con-
sidering financing a project which would involve extensive technical assis-
tance to strengthen OPEZ's organization and a line of credit to SOFIDE for
providing term financing to small scale enterprise projects appraised by OPEZ.
However, OPEZ's present institutional weakness will have to be overcome for
it to make a ignificant contribution to SSI development in the near future.
B.   The Agriculture Sector
1.08      The agricultural potential of Zaire is considerable.  The country's
geographical location astride the Equator and the differences in elevation
within the country result in several climates, which make possible a variety
of agricultural activities. Approximately 75% of the population derives
its livelihood directly from agriculture, and much of the remaining 25% is
indirectly dependent on it for employment. Zaire also has the world's
largest reserve of tropical hardwoods, and fishing could be developed consider-
ably more in the country's extensive river and lake network.
1.09      The agricultural sector consists of two types of production units:
(a) some 3-4 million traditional small family farms (on 4 million ha) accoun-
ting for 60% of total agricultural production and growing mainly food crops
for subsistence such as cassava, maize, plantain, rice, groundnuts and to
a lesser extent some cash crops such as cotton and coffee; (b) about 900
large scale agro-industrial plantations, covering about 400,000 ha producing
such products as coffee, tea, rubber and cocoa for export or sugar, palm oil,
and cattle for the domestic market. Processing of agricultural products is
mostly carried out by agro-industrial enterprises which process the output of
their plantations as well as additional crops purchased from smallholders.
Many processing plants are old, badly maintained and lack new equipment for
replacements and spare parts.
1.10      Agricultural production has been severely hampered by the political
turmoils of the 1960's, the disruption of transportation and commerce, the
deterioration of Government services, unfavorable farm prices, nationalization
policies, and the deterioration of the rest of Zaire's economy. The results
have been a reduction in the volume of crop exports, and an increase in
imports of foodstuffs to meet the needs of the fast-growing urban population.
Production of some commodities which the country used to export has decreased
to the extent that, in a number of cases, such as palm oil and cotton, there is
a need to import to meet local demand unless the current decline is reversed.
Food imports account for about 20% of merchandise imports. The effects of this
situation on the balance of payments have been serious. Even more critical is
that food imports are not sufficient to meet demand, which results in serious
food shortages and important increases of food prices. Agricultural exports,
principally coffee, still account for 14-21% of all. exports, depending on
price fluctuations for coffee and copper. Foreign exchange allocated to
importing agricultural inputs, however, has fallen; these now constitute less
than one percent of total imports.
1.11      Marketing of most agricultural crops is dominated by the private
sector. Although prices are fixed by the Government at various levels of the
marketing chain, actual prices paid by consumers are often much higher than
the fixed prices as prices in the domestic market are affected by the high



- 6 -
margins of a long chain of intermediaries, by inadequate high-cost transport-
ation, by packing and storage problems and by high losses especially of
perishable products. All of this results in either permanent shortages of
supply or intermittent supply which often does not meet demand. Export
marketing is handled by commercial plantations or trading agents.
Institutional Structure
1.12      Despite Government declarations of its intention to give priority to
agricultural development, agriculture's share of the recurrent budget from
1970-76 was about 1.5% but increased to an average of 3% in 1977-78, while its
share of the investment budget fluctuated between 2% and 8%.
1.13      The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DOA), formed in
1979 by merger of its two components, is responsible for establishing general
agricultural production policy, implementing price and marketing policies for
agricultural crops, carrying out agricultural research and providing extension
and village drinking-water services. The DOA is headed by a State Commis-
sioner for Agriculture, with two State Secretaries under him, one for Agricul-
ture and one for Rural Development. DOA is currently able to provide little
effective extension service to the country's farmers. Extension is effective
only for the small minority who benefit from the roughly 30 rural development
projects (almost all foreign assisted). Its operations are hampered by lack
of research and of improved seeds and other inputs, poor transport and com-
munications, and weak organization in general. The National Institute of
Agronomic Research and Studies (INERA), under DOA, is in charge of agri-
cultural research in Zaire. Its activities cover plantation and field crops
as well as livestock. INERA has 22 research stations, not all of them active
due to inadequate budget allocations. In 1971, Government started to set up
specialized development organizations ("Offices") for each major agricultural
product. ONAFITEX, the first established, dealt with cotton; ONACER, the
National Cereals' Office, with maize and other grains. The principal respons-
ibility of the Offices was to provide technical assistance to farmers, to buy
produce at fixed Government prices and to process and sell it either on the
domestic market or for export. In May 1978, most Offices, including ONACER
and ONAFITEX, were abolished. The National Staple Foods Products Office
(Office National des Produits Vivriers, ONPV) has replaced ONACER to provide
farmers with inputs and assure marketing of food crops, however, because of
lack of funds and qualified staff, ONPV plays only a minor role in food crop
marketing. For cotton marketing and processing, Government has promoted
regional mixed capital companies in joint ventures with textile firms.
1.14      The commercial agricultural sector is served by commercial banks and
by a national development bank (SOFIDE) whose farm financing of agricultural
investment projects has grown rapidly in the past 3 years. There is no
institutional credit for small farmers, except for that minority that benefits
from special agricultural projects. Agricultural credit demand and possible
institutional structures are being studied in three projects financed by
FAO/UNDP and by Italian and Canadian bilateral assistance.
1.15      IDA has ongoing projects as follows:  livestock development (Shaba
Region), smallholder cotton development (Equateur Region), a second livestock
project in the Ituri region and an oil-palm project (Haut Zaire and Equateur



- 7 -
Regions). All projects have encountered severe start-up problems and problems
obtaining promised local contributions. The Shaba livestock project and the
Ituri livestock projects have been hampered by delays in local contributions.
The cotton project has been set back, among other things, by abolition of
ONAFITEX, while the oil palm credit is not yet effective.
C.   The Financial Sector
1.16      The principle institutions comprising the Zairian financial system
are the Central Bank, the commercial banks, and one development bank (SOFIDE).
All these institutions are based in Kinshasa, but some notably the larger
commercial banks, have branches in most major centers in the interior. The
Central Bank (BDZ) is responsible for regulating all the financial institu-
tions in the country and for establishing and administering national monetary
and credit policies. BDZ also manages Zaire's international reserves, as
well as being in charge of Zaire's import licensing and foreign exchange
controls system, which it administers with the assistance of the commercial
banks. As a financial institution, BDZ also lends to Government but not to
public enterprises which are considered as part of the private sector as
far as credit is concerned. There are eight commercial banks with a total of
46 branches throughout Zaire. The Banque Commerciale Zairoise (an affiliate
of the Belgian Societe Generale de Banque) is by far the largest, with deposits
accounting for more than 60% of all commercial banks' deposits, and 20 branch
offices. The second largest is the Banque du Peuple, which is 100% state-
owned, and the third largest is the Union Zairoise de Banques (UZB). Others
include the almost fully Zairian-owned Banque de Kinshasa, the Banque Inter-
nationale pour l'Afrique Occidentale (BIAO), First National City Bank and
Barclays Bank. Deteriorating economic conditions, high inflation rates
and the interest rate maxima on commercial bank credit have meant that in
recent years commercial banks have been very reluctant to lend on a medium or
longer term basis. Thus most of their lending is short-term, although through
some revolving short-term credits they have also contributed to financing
industrial investment (in conjunction with SOFIDE financing on some projects).
Additionally, the commercial banks play an important role in the financing of
imports and exports, in which they act under regulation of the Central Bank.
The principal source of long term finance and only non-governmental source of
term foreign exchange financing is the development bank SOFIDE, which is
described in detail in the next chapter of this report.
1.17      Credit Control and Interest Rates.  Many changes have occurred
in Zaire's credit control system over the past few years. During the years
of economic "boom" in 1973 and 1974, credit controls had been progressively
relaxed permitting increasingly rapid growth in the money supply. In 1974,
the credit ceilings limiting the volume of commercial banking operations
were replaced with an obligatory reserve requirement system, and in 1975 the
reserve requirements of commercial banks were raised from 40% to 45% in
order to hold down expansion of credit. Having been abandoned in 1977 and
replaced once more by credit ceilings, in early 1979, reserve requirements
were reintroduced, commercial banks having to deposit 25% of their liabilities
with BDZ. The credit ceilings system was also retained, limiting the overall
volume of credit a commercial bank could provide over a given quarter in



relation to the volume of its deposits at the beginning of that quarter.
Individual ceilings were also established within that overall limit regulating
the relative proportions of commercial bank lending to different priority
sectors and uses (e.g., agriculture, industry, commerce, transport, local
production of essential goods, etc.), with a small residual "free" or un-
regulated amount of a commercial bank's credit availability for a given
quarter remaining for other loans.
1.18      Until the end of 1978 maximum interest rates on commercial bank
loans, which had been set in January 1974 ranged between 6% and 15%. Effective
January 1979, new rates were established (as indicated below) exclusive of
commissions of up to an additional 2% p.a. BDZ's rediscounting facilities
have been re-activated following introduction of tighter credit restrictions
but are only applicable for loans within the specific credit ceilings and when
the loans meet conditions regarding their timing and conditions of repayment.
Maximum Interest Rates

A.   Loans Rediscountable with BDZ
(a) Short-term
-    Production and machinery financing:          7.5%               5%

(b)  Medium and Long-term

-    Others:                                    15%                 15%
B.   Loans Not Rediscountable with BDZ
-    Short-term                                 18%
-    Medium and Long-term                       20%
1.19      The decline in economic production, limitations on imports, limited
convertibility of the Zaire, and a reluctance to make term investments have
all contributed to the commercial banks being highly liquid, until the re-
introduction in January, 1979 of reserve requirements (see para. 1.17) to
reduce excess liquidities. Given the limited scope for traditional commercial
banking activities and the reluctance of the commercial banking system to seek
new sectors of investment, the onlending interest rates prior to January 1979
appear to have played little role in the allocation of local currency re-
sources. However, the new interest rate regime introduced in January 1979
is expected to have a somewhat greater impact on resource allocation.

1.20      Import Licenses and Foreign Exchange Controls.  Until 1974,
BDZ had delegated administration of almost all foreign exchange transactions
to the licensed commercial banks, except for exports of copper, cobalt and
diamonds. With the fall in world copper prices for 1974 onwards and the
increasing burden of principal, interest and arrears on Zaire's public exter-
nal and comme7cial debts, stricter foreign exchange controls were introduced.
Following the 1976 devaluation of the Zaire, the volume of foreign exchange
(essentially from export receipts) available through the commercial banks
was further restricted; 10% (and an additional 11% of coffee export earnings)
being allocated to BDZ to help service Zaire's mounting external debt, 10%
being allocated to the exporter and the remaining 80% being divided between
purchase of a prescribed list of essential imports (including industrial
raw materials and spare parts), and other imports for which advanced BDZ
permission was required. The reduction in the overall volume of imports,
however, together with continued high levels of imports of non-essentials
effectively reduced the availability of imported raw materials and spare
parts for industry, which contributed to significant declines in rates of
manufacturing installed capacity utilization. Under this system, however,
there were two authorized means for obtaining foreign exchange cover:
(a) through the commercial banks, and/or (b) under the new guarantee program
of BDZ (the "NGBZ") 1/. With the still mounting pressure on Zaire's external
debt, foreign exchange restrictions were made even more severe through
BDZ's Circular Number 156 to the commercial banks which became effective in
September 1978. This has abolished the NGBZ and, further reduced the amount
of foreign exchange available from the commercial banks, 2/ which are thus
now the only source of foreign exchange cover for industrial imports of raw
materials and spare parts.  In addition, all foreign exchange transactions
must now take the form of confirmed irrevocable letters of credit for which
the commercial banks must have assured foreign exchange cover available.
Since NGBZ was in the past two years a major source of foreign exchange for
industry, its suspension has approximately halved the foreign exchange avail-
able for imports of raw materials and spare parts. Although any forecasting
of economic and financial developments in Zaire is subject to a considerable
degree of uncertainty, it is nevertheless expected that four factors may act
to somewhat improve this situation: (a) the stabilization program and stand-
by agreement signed with the IMF in August 1979, (b) improved foreign exchange
and credit allocation by the BDZ as a result of assistance provided by a team
of foreign experts hired by the Government in close collaboration with the
IMF, and (c) improved competitiveness of locally produced goods as a result of
the devaluation of the Zaire.
1.21      Inflation.  Over the past three years inflation in Zaire has averaged
87% per annum (60% in 1977, over 100% in 1978 and 100% in 1979). Major
contributing factors include: (a) reduction in supply of goods both imported
and domestic coupled with declining but still excessive demand; (b) expansion
of the money supply, in particular up until early 1975; and (c) the impact of

exchange cover for imports of goods and services.

worldwide inflation upon Zaire's imports. For the next 3 years, Bank
projections indicate that inflation in Zaire might be of the order of: 60%
in 1980, 40% in 1981 and 30% in 1982.
1.22      Exchange Rates.  At the time of the March, 1976 devaluation, the
decision was taken to peg the Zaire to the SDR at a rate of S1.00 = 1 SDR.
Since November, 1978, the Zaire has been devalued in several stages by a total
of about 62.5% and thus the exchange rate presently stands at 71.00 = US$0.49.
II. THE INSTITUTION
Previous IDA Lending
2.01      IDA has made four previous credits to SOFIDE.  In 1970, a first
credit of US$5 million (190-CK) was made and IDA acted as executing agency
for a program of technical assistance from UNDP as well as seconding a staff
member as Director General. IFC subscribed 19% of SOFIDE's initial share
capital. A second credit (271-CK) of US$10 million was granted in 1971, a
third IDA credit (463-CK) of US$10 million in 1973, and a fourth credit
(710-ZR) of US$10 million in 1977. In 1976, the World Bank Operations Eval-
uation Department conducted a project performance audit of the first line of
credit to SOFIDE (190-CK), and concluded that in general SOFIDE had success-
fully fulfilled the objectives that were set at its creation but pointed out
that there was scope for improved performance, particularly in appraisal and
supervision work. Included within the institution-building objectives of the
fourth credit (710-ZR) was improvement of appraisal capabilities and internal
procedures, and during the last two years SOFIDE has made considerable pro-
gress while operating in a very difficult environment. However, the deterior-
ation in the environment has placed even greater stress on SOFIDE's project
selection and appraisal capabilities and under the fifth credit further
progress in these areas will be sought (see para. 3.02).
2.02      The lending objectives under the fourth credit were very general in
nature, i.e. to "finance productive enterprises". SOFIDE has, under this
credit, generally sought to focus its financing on projects meeting the most
pressing needs of the economy, and to thereby assist in preservation of
Zaire's industrial base. Projects financed involving existing companies
included rehabilitation/modernization of production equipment at existing tin
mining and quarrying companies, modernization of a bakery as well as a
project to make toilet paper from local waste paper, another to produce shoe
soles locally instead of importing them, a project to replace imported metal
consumer goods by local manufacture, and also a jute sack manufacturing
project utilizing a combination of local and imported jute. New projects
included a soap manufacturing project in the Kasais using local palm oil.
Several of these projects were designed to use local raw materials to reduce
imports. However, the present exchange rate severely limits export opportuni-
ties, and thus the projects are all either import substitution or service
sector projects. Average investment cost per job for projects approved by
SOFIDE was about US$30,000, which is high, but reflects the large proportion
of modernization and rehabilitation projects financed. The projects were
generally well conceived and were financially and economically attractive
investment opportunities.

A.   Institutional Aspects
Background and Objectives
2.03      SOFIDE was established as a limited liability company in 1970; IDA
and IFC played an instrumental role in its creation with IFC subscribing to
19% of SOFIDE's initial share capital. Since then IDA has granted four
credits totalling US$35 million to SOFIDE. As defined in its Statutes and
Policy Statement (Annex 5), the institution's broad objectives are: (a) to
provide equity and term loan finance for investments in the productive sectors
of the economy; and (b) to foster the distribution of shareholdings and the
development of a capital market in Zaire. Given the limited scope of the
financial market in Zaire, SOFIDE has essentially concentrated on pursuing
the first of these two objectives. SOFIDE has therefore operated as a tradi-
tional development bank, providing term investment finance primarily to
industry, but also increasingly to agriculture. As the only institution of
its kind in Zaire, SOFIDE, though still a relatively young development bank
has firmly established itself as one of the principal sources in particular
of foreign exchange for term investment. In this role, it has been aided
considerably by the technical and financial assistance it has received since
its creation from IDA and IFC.
Share Capital and Ownership
2.04      In order to restore SOFIDE's borrowing base which had been eroded by
the 1976 devaluation and to expand its debt capacity to enable it to finance
an increased volume of projects, SOFIDE's share capital was doubled from
i 2 million to g 4 million in 1977 1/, with the Government increasing its
share from 25% to 40% of the total, and two new foreign shareholders -- the
European Investment Bank (EIB) and Deutsche Entwicklungs Gesellschaft (DEG) -
subscribing 20% of the increase. Ownership of SOFIDE's share capital is
presently distributed as follows: public sector shareholders (including the
Government and the Central Bank) 40%, local commercial banks and private
investors 24%, IFC 9% and other foreign schareholders 27%. A detailed list
of shareholders is provided in Annex 2. In addition to its share capital,
SOFIDE has quasi-equity of 9 6 million, consisting of 9 5 million in long
term loans (with maturity of 40 years) bearing 1% annual interest, 9 1 mil-
lion in Government advances bearing no interest and extended for the life-time
of the company, and rolled-over IDA funds relent to SOFIDE by Government (see
para. 3.05(h)). Government has also recently accepted to convert into quasi-
equity the 9 13 million Special Fund for Agriculture presently managed on its
behalf by SOFIDE, however, the details of the conversion has yet to be finalized.
Board of Directors
2.05      SOFIDE's Board presently consists of ten members (as detailed in
Annex 3), and is chaired by SOFIDE's President and General Manager. The
Board of Directors adequately represents the various shareholders interests.
1/   15% of the increase had not yet been fully paid-in as of June 30, 1979.



- 12 -
The Board meets on a quarterly basis to deliberate upon major policy issues and
to approve loans exceeding US$300,000 and equity investments above 9 50,000.
The Board's members are competent and Board decisions have generally been
sound, inspite of the difficult and deteriorating economic environment in
which SOFIDE has to operate. The presence of an IFC representative has
contributed significantly to the Board's effectiveness.
Executive Committee
2.06      The Executive Committee consisting of six members, five of whom are
also locally-based Directors (see Annex 3), meets at more frequent intervals
than the Board. It has authority to approve individual loans below Board
limits (see para 2.05). IFC is represented on the Committee by IBRD's resident
representative in Kinshasa.
Management and Staffing
2.07      Management:  SOFIDE's present Chairman and General Manager, a
Zairian national, joined SOFIDE in 1973. He is a capable manager, and
is widely respected in Zairian public and private sectors. He has been
assisted, since joining SOFIDE, by a Deputy General Manager seconded by the
Bank, the incumbent in that position having changed recently. SOFIDE's
management has performed well, and under its direction SOFIDE has gradually
strengthened its procedures and also become an increasingly dynamic institu-
tion. SOFIDE's middle level management consists of six department directors,
all but one of whom are Zairians; these managers have now gained in develop-
ment banking experience and are both competent and capable.
2.08      Staffing:  As of June, 1979, SOFIDE had a staff of 113, including
45 professionals, four of whom are expatriates. SOFIDE has developed a small
core of experienced Zairian professionals, who have been with the institution
several years. With the rapid operational expansion over the past two years,
professional recruitment has been increased. However, additional professional
staff will need to be recruited as operations continue to increase and the
regional offices become operational. SOFIDE is actively seeking suitable new
Zairian staff. Professional staff members receive training on-the-job and are
also regularly sent by SOFIDE to attend courses abroad such as those offered
by CEFEB and EDI. SOFIDE's staff is young but generally competent, dedicated
and hardworking, and is steadily gaining in experience. The overall quality
of SOFIDE's staff is satisfactory and the staff training program is adequate.
2.09      Organization:  As of June, 1979 SOFIDE was organized into six depart-
ments and three regional branch offices (see Annex 4). Five of the six depart-
ments were established in the early 1970s.
2.10      Since appraisal (in May, 1976) of the fourth IDA credit to SOFIDE,
two major developments have occurred in SOFIDE's organization structure:
(i) the growth of the Agriculture Department, and (ii) SOFIDE's decision
to establish regional branch offices. The existing organizational structure
of SOFIDE is adequate to meet its operational needs.



- 13 -
The Agricultural Department
2.11      The Agricultural Department was created with FAO technical assist-
ance in 1976 and has expanded very rapidly having established that substantial
demand exists for term financing of private commercial agricultural projects
in Zaire. In 1978, it contributed 36% of SOFIDE's total approvals by amount
and 48% in 1979. The department is now organized into three sections spe-
cialized in the analysis of projects in:
(a) Livestock,
(b) Fruit and vegetable production, and
(c) Agro-industry and forestry.
It is responsible for the technical, managerial and financial aspects of
agricultural projects appraisal and works with the Risk Management Department
on supervision of projects it appraises. It is adequately staffed with a
Zairian director and 8 professionals, including 2 expatriates funded by FAO.
Regional Offices
2.12      With the recent rapid growth of particularly its agricultural
operations in the interior, SOFIDE decided in 1978 to establish four regional
offices in Goma, Kananga, Lubumbashi and Kisangani. These offices will
play a supporting role vis-a-vis all SOFIDE's main operating departments
(i.e., in promotion, appraisal and supervision) and will thus assist consid-
erably in overcoming the major logistical constraints imposed upon SOFIDE's
operations in the interior, and thereby improving the effectiveness of SOFIDE's
regional activities. Two regional offices (Kisangani and Goma) started up in
August, 1978; the third (in Lubumbashi) was opened in July 1979, and the fourth
(in Kananga) is scheduled to open soon. Each regional office is managed by an
experienced senior staff member, who is assisted by two administrative assistants.
Additional professional staffing will be needed in the offices as their respon-
sibilities and work expand. FAC has also proposed to second two expatriate
technical experts for the regional offices. The organizational arrangements
for the four offices are generally adequate.
Policy Statement
2.13      SOFIDE's policy statement is satisfactory (Annex 5).  It was
revised in 1973 to permit SOFIDE to finance parastatal enterprises up to
25% by amount of its total commitments. In practice, however, with the
retrocession of the majority of nationalized enterprises to their former
foreign private owners, SOFIDE's financing of parastatals has receded in
importance.
Procedures
2.14      Appraisal:  SOFIDE has made significant progress in improving
and systematizing its procedures for project appraisal, though occasionally
some appraisal work in the past has been rushed and not fully completed prior
to Board presentation. To overcome this problem, a project appraisal manual
has been prepared and recently adopted. In particular management has decided
that an Investment Committee (comprising all SOFIDE department directors) will
undertake a final review of all appraisal reports following any revisions, to



- 14 -
ensure their adequacy and completeness before being submitting to Management
and the Board. At negotiations, SOFIDE confirmed that this procedure has been
adopted.
2.15      Economic Analysis:  SOFIDE has continued making progress in its
economic analysis of projects.  Under the fourth IDA Credit, SOFIDE was only
required to calculate economic rates of return on import substitution projects.
However, implementation of SOFIDE's investment strategy (Annex 6) will require
more detailed economic analysis of projects. Under the proposed line of
credit, SOFIDE agreed at negotiations to provide: (i) complete economic
analysis (including calculation of economic rates of return) for all non-
service sector projects except small-scale enterprises; (ii) full qualitative
economic analysis, supported by all available quantitative data, for service
sector and small-scale enterprise projects. (Economic analysis of projects
would also include where applicable, an assessment of the proportional dis-
tribution of economic benefits to foreign project sponsors and to the national
economy). Such economic analyses will form an integral part of appraisal
reports at Board presentation.
2.16      Supervision:  SOFIDE's supervision procedures, which are generally
satisfactory, have been further strengthened and systematized, and super-
vision staff has been increased to a generally adequate level. SOFIDE recog-
nises that, with the rapid projected growth in its portfolio, supervision
activities will still need to be strengthened, in particular with respect
to agricultural projects in the interior; this will be assisted by the work
of the regional offices.
2.17      Project Promotion:  SOFIDE has been increasingly active in project
promotion particularly in the interior -- and has successfully identified
investment opportunities in agriculture, agro-industry and transportation
as well as potential Zairian promoters with capital to invest in these.
Promotion missions have been well-planned and comprehensive in scope.
2.18      Procurement and Disbursement:  SOFIDE's procedures for procurement
and disbursement are adequate. SOFIDE does not usually require competitive
bidding, although project promoters are requested to obtain quotations from
a number of different suppliers, from amongst whom the promoter, with SOFIDE's
assistance, selects the most advantageous. SOFIDE then disburses against
presentation of invoices or relevant documentation, after the promoter has
paid his share of the investment.
Auditors
2.19      SOFIDE's accounts are audited by the Brussels based firm of auditors,
Berger, Block, Kirschen, Schellekens & Co. The audited accounts covering the
period ending December 31, 1978, are available and, in the opinion of the
auditors, present fairly SOFIDE's financial position and are in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. The audits are generally sat-
isfactory in thoroughness and quality and provide adequate analysis of SOFIDE's
portfolio in line with IDA's requirements. At the occasion of the next audit
however, SOFIDE and IDA have decided to review in detail the treatment of
foreign exchange losses (para. 2.21) by the auditors, which appeared deficient
in the 1978 audit. SOFIDE would continue to employ independent auditors
acceptable to the Association and its audited accounts would be submitted to
IDA within three months of the end of the fiscal year.

Interest Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk
2.20      At time of appraisal (September, 1978, SOFIDE's interest rates
ranged between 6% and 12.5%. On local and foreign currency loans not tied to
lines of credit with specific onlending conditions (see Annex 12), SOFIDE
charged an interest rate of 12.5% plus a commitment fee of 1% and an appraisal
commission of 1%. Lower interest rates are charged on onlending of funds from
lines of credit obtained from KfW (6%), and CCCE (9%), and on local currency
resources obtained from the Special Fund for Agriculture (7.5%), which SOFIDE
manages on behalf of the Government. Under prevailing inflationary conditions
in Zaire, these rates were negative in real terms at least with respect to
SOFIDE's local currency loans and those foreign exchange loans (other than
IDA) for which Government provides cover against foreign exchange risk. Our
projections indicate that inflation in Zaire over the next three years may
exceed 90% in 1979, tapering down to 30-40% by 1981 onwards. In March 1979,
SOFIDE increased its interest rate on loans not tied to credit lines with
specific onlending conditions from 12.5% to 15%, and commitment fees from 1.0%
to 1.5% per annum on undisbursed balance. At negotiations in accordance with
IDA recommendations SOFIDE agreed to a covenant in the development credit
agreement whereby it would seek to charge its subborrowers a positive real
interest rate (including fees) and to review such charges with IDA every six
months. SOFIDE also agreed to onlend the funds under the fifth credit which
will be entirely in foreign exchange at 15% per annum (plus commitment fee and
appraisal fee) with the foreign exchange risk being passed on to all medium/
large scale industrial and agricultural subborrowers. The proposed rate which
would apply to the larger part of SOFIDE's relending operations from the
Credit represents a substantial increase over SOFIDE's previous rates (see
above) and is positive in real terms, since subborrowers will take the foreign
exchange risk, which under presently prevailing economic conditions in Zaire,
represents a very real risk to SOFIDE's subborrowers over the lifetime of the
loans. It is considered that recent devaluations will result in additional
upward readjustments of price levels to acommodate increasing operating costs
particularly in industrial projects which have a considerable dependence on
imported inputs. During this period of price adjustment, some enterprises may
encounter acute liquidity problems and be temporarily unable to service their
increased foreign exchange liabilities; this may necessitate some rescheduling
of loans by SOFIDE. Despite the possibility of such temporary liquidity
problems arising, we consider that in view of their potential profitability,
SOFIDE's medium and large scale enterprise clients should continue to carry
the foreign exchange risk. On other foreign lines of credit to SOFIDE which
require Government to cover the foreign exchange risk, SOFIDE has agreed to
increase the commission charged for foreign exchange risk cover from 3% to
5% p.a. 1/
I/   In March, 1978, SOFIDE started to charge on behalf of the Government an
annual commission of 3% for providing cover against foreign exchange
risk to medium and large-scale SOFIDE subborrowers under SOFIDE's other
foreign exchange lines of credit.



- 16 -
2.21      Regarding foreign exchange risk, SOFIDE has recently agreed with the
Government that it will change its policy such that on all foreign borrowings
to be negotiated in future it will seek to have the exchange risk passed on to
all subborrowers except in the case of specific categories of client as agreed
by Government. The foreign exchange risk on all SOFIDE's foreign exchange
loans contracted to date, however, is borne by the Government, with the excep-
tion of the Third and Fourth IDA Credits and the recently agreed OPEC Special
Fund Loan. (Under the Third IDA Credit, medium and large scale subborrowers
had the option of assuming the foreign exchange risk or receiving cover from
Government against a 1% commission. Under the Fourth IDA Credit, the Govern-
ment assumed the exchange risk on SOFIDE's loans to small-scale Zairian
majority-owned enterprises against payment of a 1% per annum commission; all
other clients however were required to carry the foreign exchange risk.) In
the case of SOFIDE's other foreign borrowings where subborrowers do not assume
the foreign exchange risk, SOFIDE's 1970 Establishment Convention provides for
Government assuming the exchange risk resulting from SOFIDE's foreign exchange
borrowing operations up to a ceiling of US$30 million. (Excluded from this
ceiling are the first three IDA Credits (193-ZR, 270-ZR and 463-ZR) totalling
US$25 million for which Government has provided separate guarantees.) Follow-
ing the devaluations of the Zaire in 1978 and 1979, foreign exchange losses
were incurred on principal and interest payments falling due on foreign
borrowings (excluding IDA Credits) directly contracted by SOFIDE and upon which
the subborrowers do not carry the exchange risk. These losses were initially
covered by SOFIDE out of its own resources since Government guarantees under
the Establishment Convention were not activated and no mechanism for activating
them had been established. Losses thus incurred through end 1979 amounted to
9 4.2 million, with future losses on the same borrowings totalling an estimated
9 7.7 million to be incurred mostly on payments falling due in 1980 and 1981.
Government has reimbursed to SOFIDE the 9 4.2 million in losses already
incurred, and has signed through the Office of Public Debt Management (OGEDEP)
an agreement with SOFIDE to automatically cover from January 1980 onwards as
they are incurred all future foreign exchange losses on SOFIDE's foreign
exchange borrowings contracted to date on which the subborrowers does not
assume the foreign exchange risk. Covenants reflecting these obligations will
be included in the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between Government and SOFIDE.
2.22      Regarding small-scale enterprises, defined as Zairian-owned enter-
prises with total assets not exceeding g 200,000 (about US$98,000), SOFIDE has
agreed that IDA funds be onlent at 15%, with the Government taking the foreign
exchange risk for a fee of 2.5% p.a. This is consistent with Bank policy with
respect to SSE operations 1/ that small-scale borrowers should be exempt from
such risks since most would find them incomprehensible, and that it is there-
fore appropriate for Government to assume them, charging a reasonable fee.
1/   See:  World Bank, Employment and Development of Small Enterprises, Sector
Policy Paper, February, 1978, p. 45.



- 17 -
Although such onlending conditions for small-scale enterprises would not be
positive in real terms, these conditions represent a substantial increase over
previous rates charged on IDA funds channelled to small-scale enterprises
through SOFIDE. They also remain favorable enough to enable SOFIDE to use
part of the proposed IDA credit for this type of enterprises in line with the
Government's desire to develop small-scale Zairian-owned entrprises, although
it is not expected that a substantial part of the credit would be used for
such operations. Regarding local currency loans SOFIDE has raised
its rate to 15% (plus fees) as against 12.5% plus fees at time of appraisal,
and has agreed to raise its rate to industry to 20% starting in the third
quarter of 1980.
2.23      SOFIDE's interest rates are generally consistent with those pre-
vailing in Zaire. SOFIDE's total interest charges for medium and long-term
lending to agriculture are above the Central Bank maximums and for industry
(at about 17%) are on a par with commercial bank rates. The forecasts of
SOFIDE's operations and financial results indicate that its present onlending
rates would allow SOFIDE a sufficient spread to cover operating costs and
realize an acceptable level of profitability. (Net profits after tax as a
percentage of average total assets are projected at 1.2% in 1979 rising to
1.5% in 1981 and maintain that level through 1983.)
B. Operations
2.24      Given the deteriorating state of the Zairian economy in the recent
years, SOFIDE as the major non-Government source of term foreign exchange
finance has had to adapt and reorientate its investment strategy and opera-
tions to meet the most pressing needs of the economy. As a consequence lend-
ing to the agricultural sector has been rapidly expanded, transportation
projects have been financed, and industrial financing has generally been
limited to high economic priority projects. For a young development finance
institution, in such a difficult environment, SOFIDE deserves considerable
credit for the progress that has been made; however, there remains room for
further improvement.
2.25      The evolution of SOFIDE's operations from its establishment in
1970 is shown in Annex 7. After the initial build up of operations, total
loan approvals fluctuated about 9 4/5 million/year in the period 1971/75
before growing rapidly between 1976 and 1978 when total loan approvals rose
from Z 8.6 million in 1976 to Z 21.6 million (including 9 2 million in sup-
plementary financing) in 1977, Z 22.4 million in 1978 and Z 51.3 million in
1979. Even after taking account of the high levels of inflation in Zaire in
the past three years (see para. 1.21) and the 1976 devaluation, SOFIDE's
volume of loan approvals still grew rapidly in real terms by 60% and 100%
respectively in 1976 and 1977, and maintained its 1977 level in 1978. After
account is taken of the 1978/79 devaluations, the 1978 level of approvals was
continued through 1979. The rapid growth in recent years has been due to:



- 18 -
(a) formation of an agricultural department in SOFIDE in 1976
which contributed 33.5% (9 7.4 million) of total approvals
in 1977, 36% in 1978 and 48% in 1979;
(b) many of the major industrial companies in Zaire were
retroceded to their former owners in late 1976 and 1977
resulting in a significant demand for loans for rehabi-
litation and extension of existing businesses.
2.25      In line with approvals, the pace of commitments and disbursements
has increased rapidly between 1976 and 1978. In the first half of 1979,
however, the level of commitments declined principally because of delays
in effectiveness of anticipated fresh foreign exchange resources. Disburse-
ments have continued to increase into 1979 with disbursements on the fourth
IDA credit running about 10% ahead of schedule at appraisal. However there
are a number of older projects approved and committed by SOFIDE where only
partial disbursement or no disbursement has taken place. These projects were
deferred or delayed by client companies due to difficulties of project imple-
mentation particularly during the period of "zairianization". Discussions
have taken place with all such companies and new project implementation
proposals have been agreed.
2.26      Annex 8 shows a breakdown of SOFIDE's approvals by sector, region,
size and type of project. SOFIDE's approvals have been well diversified with
the maximum investment in anyone subsector (food and beverages) only amounting
to 16% of the total approvals, followed by construction (11%), livestock (10%)
transportation (9%), agro-industries 8%, wood industries and textiles 6% each,
and metal working (5%). SOFIDE has progressively sought regional diversifica-
tion of its investments with investments in Equateur and Kasai regions being
18% and 13% respectively of 1977 approvals, and Bas-Zaire 14% and Shaba and
Kivu each 11% of 1978 approvals. The substantial part of SOFIDE's invest-
ments by both number and value has been rehabilitation/expansion projects (76%
by number and 82% by value in the period 1970-78). Investment in new projects
in recent years has been small due to the high risk associated with such
investment in the prevailing economic climate. Insofar as most of the major
industrial companies following retrocession are foreign-owned or have foreign
majority interest, much of SOFIDE's financing has inevitably gone to finance
these companies; however such investment has been necessary to try and protect
the industrial base of the economy and also protect employment. More recently,
particularly in the agricultural sector, SOFIDE has been financing Zairian-
owned small and medium-scale projects. The majority of investments by number
(70%) have been below Z 400,000 although by amount such investments only
represent 30% of total approvals. The number of large loans above Z 800,000
has been limited and only represented about 14% by number of total loan
approvals although 47% by value.
Portfolio and Provisions
2.27      As of December 31, 1978 SOFIDE had made partial or total disbursement
on 143 projects. The following table indicates the overall situation of the
portfolio at that date:



- 19 -
Type                         Number                  Level of Disbursement
100%     >      50%     <      50%
Projects in Operation           36             36              -               -
Projects in Construction
or not in Operation yet    107              15             33              59
143            51             33              59
By June 30, 1979, loans to 61 projects had been fully disbursed.  Thus a high
proportion of SOFIDE's projects are still in the construction phase and are
not yet operational.
2.28      Loan Portfolio.  The total loan portfolio outstanding as of
June 30, 1979 amounted to s 33.2 million. The portfolio affected by arrears of
more than 3 months was 9 8.4 million or 26.9% of the loan portfolio outstanding,
which is quite high and reflects at least in part deteriorating prevailing
economic conditions. Three larger projects accounted for about 60% of arrears
above three months: (a) a tin mine having suffered a 2-year implementation
delay for technical reasons, (b) a cement factory with liquidity problems
before the revision of its controlled prices in 1979, and (c) a hotel in
Kivu with a persistent low occupancy rate. Following continued intensive
supervision by SOFIDE, improvement is anticipated in two of these three
projects' performance in 1980. Of the remaining projects in arrears, four
were not in operation, and the reasons for arrears in the others were mixed
and included poor management, cash flow and technical problems. The problems
of the industrial sector in recent years have resulted in delays in project
completion and cost overruns. SOFIDE has made supplemental loans to cover
cost overruns and has rescheduled loans in 49 instances. Forty-five of the
loan reschedulings have occurred in the last four years, i.e. 6 in 1976, 9
in 1977, 16 in 1978, and 14 in 1979; most of them were rescheduled before
disbursement because of the impact of"zairianization" or devaluation upon
investment costs. As of June 30, 1979, only 6 of the rescheduled projects
had fallen into arrears above three months again; on one project SOFIDE is
legally seeking recovery of its loan, a second has agreed repayment of arrears,
a third a hotel project, is in arrears again due to lack of tourists in Kivu,
two have encountered further implementation delays and one has agreed to
strengthen its technical management to overcome technical problems. Thus,
SOFIDE appears to have rescheduled loans for good reasons and not to disguise
a portfolio with serious arrears due to operational problems.
2.29      Equity Portfolio.  As of June 30, 1979, SOFIDE had a small equity
portfolio totalling s 1.7 million consisting of equity investments in seven
companies. Zairian companies are essentially seeking term foreign exchange
resources from SOFIDE and hence the scope for equity investments in local
currency has been limited. SOFIDE's participation in these companies ranges
from 5.5% to a maximum of 26.6%. Three of the older projects have paid
dividends. The return on the average equity portfolio in 1978 was a modest
3.4%.



- 20 -
2.30      In assessing the overall portfolio, note should be taken that 71%
by number and 78% by value of SOFIDE's investments are for rehabilitation/
expansion of existing projects.  Many of SOFIDE's clients are leading indus-
trial companies in Zaire and are sufficiently diversified to allow them
to service SOFIDE's debt whilst the projects are being implemented. This
they have been able to achieve despite having to operate recently at depressed
capacity levels due in many cases to shortages of raw materials and spares.
Most of these large companies have strong relations with the commercial
banking sector and generally have been able to receive sufficient foreign
exchange for raw material imports to allow continued operation. By contrast
the smaller locally owned companies have more difficulty acquiring foreign
exchange for raw material imports, and hence are more vulnerable. (It is
principally to these companies that IDA's emergency working capital assistance
through SOFIDE (para. 3.03) will be directed to prevent their possible closure).
However, despite many clients companies operating at reduced capacity levels,
as of June 1979, SOFIDE's portfolio was generally sound and creditworthy.
Although conditions in the industrial sector may deteriorate further in the
short term particularly with regard to supply of foreign exchange for raw
material imports, SOFIDE's emergency working capital fund should tide its
clients through such a period. It is expected that the supply of inputs would
improve once outside commodity assistance becomes effective and foreign ex-
change allocation procedures are further tightened by the Central Bank (para.
1.20).
2.31      Provisions.  SOFIDE has adopted a generally conservative approach
to provisions; as of December 31, 1978 specific provisions against doubtful
debts amounted to 9 316,000 and additional provisions against general risks
amounted to 9 823,000. Hence total provisions amounted to 4% of the loan and
equity portfolio outstanding as of end 1978. This level of provisions is more
than adequate for a portfolio which is generally sound and has good security.
SOFIDE's investments are generally well secured particularly as the 1976 and
1978/79 devaluations and recent inflation have increased the Zaire value of
SOFIDE's fixed asset security. Thus, the provisions for general risks do
represent an adequate reserve against future losses on the portfolio.
Financial Results and Condition
2.32      Annexes 9-11 show SOFIDE's financial performance in recent years.
Having moved strongly into profit in 1977 with net profit after provisions
rising to 9 464,000 (from 9 120,000 in 1976), in 1978 SOFIDE's net profit de-
clined somewhat to 9 409,000, mostly as a result of larger general provisions
totalling g 386,000 being declared for that year as a precaution against
further deterioration in economic conditions. Income generation from loans
however followed the overall growth trend of the previous year. The fast
growth in SOFIDE's operating profits over the last three years is attributable
to two main factors:
(1) the rapid growth in lending operations, and
(2) the increased spread earned on the loan portfolio.
In early 1977 SOFIDE increased its total interest charges for lending to
large-scale enterprise to 13.5% p.a. This resulted in the interest earned
on the average loan portfolio rising from 11.7% in 1976 to 13.0% in 1977 and



- 2 1 -
13.9% in 1978.  At the same time SOFIDE's average cost of debt declined from
5.3% in 1976 to 4.6% in 1977 and 4.7% in 1978 due to lines of credit being
received from bilateral sources at preferential interest rates. Additionally
Government lends in local currency directly to SOFIDE at 3.5% and charges 4%
on "rolled-over" IDA funds.
2.33      The increased income generation has partly been offset by increases
in SOFIDE's administrative expenses which at 4.7% of average total assets in
1978 are high for a development bank. This high cost is due to the high level
of local inflation and its impact on an expanding staff's salaries and also
high overheads incurred on project work in the regions. However, despite
these costs, net profit as % of average equity rose from 9.4% in 1976 to 17.0%
in 1977 and 20.6% in 1978, -- a considerable achievement for a young bank
operating in a very difficult environment.
2.34      SOFIDE's share capital was increased in 1978 to A 4 million, to
expand SOFIDE's debt capacity to allow the rapid growth in lending. However,
as a result of rapid debt-financed portfolio growth and the recent devaluations
and consequent increase in the Zaire equivalent value of foreign exchange
borrowings, as of December 31, 1978, SOFIDE's debt/equity ratio (including
quasi-equity as equity) was 2.5:1 as compared to 1.9:1 one year previously,
and was forecast to rise to 3.8:1 by end 1979.
Resources
2.35      SOFIDE's resource position as of August 31, 1979 is included in
the basic data. At that date, owing to the very rapid growth in operations
since 1976, there was a resource deficit at approval level of 9 26.1 million,
9 24.7 milion of which was in foreign exchange. As regards local currency,
the resource statement shows a resource gap of Z 0.14 million at commitment
level. SOFIDE has received local currency resources from share capital in-
creases, Government loans, rolled-over IDA Credits and net cash generation.
Also in addition to the resource identified in the resources statement
a Special Fund (of 9 13 million) has been provided by Government for agricul-
tural investment. SOFIDE presently only acts as manager of this Fund,
although Government has agreed to its conversion into quasi-equity terms and
conditions of which are still to be finalized. SOFIDE now receives a 4%
spread as a management fee on monies invested in agricultural projects from
this Special Fund. Two tranches totalling 9 3.0 million were paid in by
Government in 1978, and the remaining 9 10 million only in mid 1979. There
thus still remain significant local resources for financing SOFIDE's agricul-
tural investments.
2.36      As regards foreign exchange resources, SOFIDE, at IDA's instigation
and with its assistance, has made considerable progress in diversifying its
sources of foreign exchange. In 1978, a first line of credit was opened with
the OPEC Special Fund (for which IDA has been appointed loan administrator) as
well as a first line of credit with the African Development Bank; and SOFIDE



- 22 -
now has lines of credit from eight different sources. Annex 12 shows the
conditions attached to these lines of credit. Apart from IDA, many of these
borrowings have numerous conditions attached to them which are inhibiting
SOFIDE's flexibility of operation. The SBI and CCCE loans are tied to Belgian
and French procurement with SBI only being prepared to cofinance 50% of a
project's foreign costs. EIB funds are channelled to specific subprojects,
and KfW and OPEC funds have numerous conditions relating to size, region and
sub-sector of projects. The foreign exchange risk is only passed on to the
medium- and large-scale clients under the IDA and OPEC Special Fund lines
credit. For other borrowers, where the Government carries the risk on for-
eign currency sub-loans, SOFIDE charges fees on behalf of the Government of
3% to large borrowers and 1% to small scale enterprises. At negotiations
SOFIDE agreed to raise these rates to 5% and 2.5% respectively (see para.
2.20).
C.   Prospects
2.37      Pro4ect Pipeline:  (Annex 13).  In early 1979, SOFIDE had a
substantial pipeline of 122 industrial and agricultural projects. SOFIDE
financing for these projects was estimated at X 63.7 million, and total proj-
ect costs at 9 123 million (at the then prevailing exchange rate) or the
equivalent respectively of US$41.5 million and US$80.1 million. The promoters
of these projects were for the most part Zairian and locally-based foreign
private firms, with some projects being joint ventures either between Zairian
and foreign interests or between the Government and private groups. The
majority of the projects are modernizations and/or expansions of existing
concerns, with only a small number of creations of new firms. SOFIDE's
agricultural pipeline consist of some 80 projects with a broad sub-sectoral
spread, including proposed investments in forestry, livestock (including
cattle, goats and poultry), vegetable oil processing, coffee, fisheries,
maize, groundnuts, rice mills, vegetable production, jute and cinchona.
Outside agriculture, projects presently under study include: purchase of
transportation equipment (notably trucks and barges), cold storage facilities,
bakeries, textiles, tyre retreading, metal-working, mining, furniture making,
ice-manufacture, construction materials and hotels. A substantial proportion
of the projects in the pipeline are located in the interior of the country.
SOFIDE will be providing predominantly foreign exchange financing, with a
higher proportion of local currency financing in the case of agricultural
projects. The demand for SOFIDE's foreign resources considerably exceeds
resources currently available to SOFIDE and this situation is expected to
continue through the projection period; hence SOFIDE will continue to have to
carefully select the projects it decides to finance.
2.38      Financial Forecasts:  The forecasts of SOFIDE's operations and
financial results for the period 1979-1983 are shown in Annex 15 and 19. The
recent devaluations of the Zaire result in a substantial increase in the Zaire
equivalent value of forecast approvals; however, in real terms industrial
apprevals were forecast to decline by about one-third in 1979 and by 10% p.a.



- 23 -
until 1981, before rising by 5% p.a. through 1983. Due to the need to expand
agricultural investment in Zaire, a real growth of 20% was forecast for 1979,
this level being maintained until 1981 before increasing by 5% p.a. in real
terms through 1983. The growth in current terms in lending operations coupled
with the increased interest rates, results in rapid growth in the loan port-
folio and interest revenues. Following a sharp increase in operating costs in
1979, from 1980 onwards the growth in these revenues is sufficient to offset
both the increasing cost of resources and more particularly the rising
administrative costs. Administrative costs, which were forecast to rise by 130%
in 1979 and by 60% in 1980 due to inflation and development of the regional
offices, and by 40% per annum thereafter, are projected to represent 6% of
average total assets in 1979, and will remain above 5% through 1983, when they
will represent 5.9%, which is high. Despite highly inflationary environment,
the introduction of a 50% tax rate in 1980 and a conservative provisions
policy (i.e. 3.5% of year-end portfolio) SOFIDE will be able to operate
profitably.  Net profit after tax is projected to rise from 0.9% of average
total assets in 1980 to 1.5% in 1981 through 1983. Achievement of this
profitability in the near term will be dependant on close supervision by
SOFIDE of its portfolio to limit arrears whilst the economy recovers and
continued disbursement so that interest revenues will offset the rapidly
inflating operational costs.
2.39      The rapid growth in lending operations results in SOFIDE being
progressively undercapitalized. The current share capital is not sufficiently
large to carry the level of borrowing forecast through 1983. Because the
share capital was increased in 1977, an interim measure has been agreed at
negotiations whereby qualifying rolled over IDA funds may be considered as
quasi-equity in a debt/equity ratio increased to 5:1. This limit was set to
reflect changes in SOFIDE's foreign borrowing liabilities following the
1978/79 devaluations, the generally good condition of SOFIDE's portfolio, and
the adequacy of SOFIDE's supervision activities. Such a limit will allow SOFIDE
to continue normal operations until a restructuring plan is firmed up. SOFIDE
has agreed to have prepared by June 1980 such a plan in particular for the
expansion of its capital base.
Resource Requirements
2.40      SOFIDE's forecast foreign exchange resource requirements for the
period September 1979 to June 1981 amount to US$51.9 million. As of August 31,
1979, SOFIDE had uncommitted foreign resources amounting to US$0.8 million, thus
leaving a resource gap of US$51.7 million through mid-1981. SOFIDE is seeking
to cover the gap with additional resources from:  IDA (US$18.5 million) 1/ KfW
(US$5 million), CIDA (US$5 million), SBI (US$7.0 million) ADB (US$9.0 mil-
lion), and CCCE (US$7 million). As several of the new lines of credit are
anticipated to have special conditions regarding their use, and as there is
still some uncertainty concerning the CIDA and SBI loans, which would be
dependent on Zaire's foreign aid donors agreeing upon on overall recovery plan
for the Zairian economy, SOFIDE should therefore continue to aggressively seek
additional sources of foreign exchange.
1/   US$0.23 million of which would be allocated to the technical assistance
and equipment components.



- 24 -
2.41       SOFIDE's local currency resource requirements over the period
September 1979-June 1981 amount to US$21.0 milion equivalent. Of these,
US$14 million equivalent will be met from net cash generation, from the
Special Fund for Agriculture, which SOFIDE manages on behalf of the
Government, 1/  nd from further "rolled-over" IDA funds (i.e., repayments
of subloans under previous IDA credits which are relent by the Government
to SOFIDE). The local currency resource gap at commitment level will amount
to US$4 million equivalent by end 1980, increasing to US$7 million equiv-
alent by mid-1981.  However, given the lag between commitment and disburse-
ment of funds, strong cash generation in the interim will permit SOFIDE
comfortably to meet its local currency disbursement requirements through
mid-1981. Subsequently, the increasing volume of net cash generation together
with partial liquidation of current assets will enable SOFIDE to meet its
disbursement requirements over the remainder of the projection period. In
addition, SOFIDE may where necessary rediscount loans with BDZ, and therefore
does not expect to have difficulty in raising local currency resources.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives of the Proposed IDA Credit
3.01      Since previous IDA lending to SOFIDE has assisted in financing
principally medium and large scale projects in industry and tourism, the
proposed fifth IDA Credit to SOFIDE constitutes a substantial shift in
sectoral focus with a significant proportion of the credit being allocated to
financing investment projects in agriculture and agro-industry, which are
currently considered by IDA to be priority sectors for investment in the
Zairian economy. The objectives of the credit would be:
(a)  to provide a fast disbursing project which will result in the
efficient allocation of resources for investments in the Zairian
priority sectors of agriculture, transportation and industry
through an institution in Zaire capable of successfully implementing
the project;
(b)  to continue to financially support a predominantly Zairian operated
financial institution which is both competent and capable, and by
maintaining such explicit World Bank support, to assist in main-
taining its momentum and autonomy of operation as well as furthering
its institutional development particularly with regard to its
agricultural operations;
(c)  through IDA lending to subprojects, to mobilize local currency
resources held particularly by the Zairian private sector, into
productive term investments and also assist in the development of
local managerial capabilities in the subprojects.
3.02      In order to achieve these objectives and because present demand for
SOFIDE financing exceeds projected resource availability, SOFIDE with IDA
assistance has developed and adopted a new Investment Strategy (see Annex 6).
This strategy and the criteria established in it allow SOFIDE to identify and
1/   See para. 2.35.



- 25 -
finance high economic priority projects which not only meet the more immediate
basic needs of the economy, but also assist in the preservation/rehabilitation
of Zaire's industrial base. The criteria are used to "weight" initial proj-
ect applications on receipt by SOFIDE in relation to their importance to the
Zairian economy and thereby establish a priority ranking of projects. This
process is then reinforced by full economic analysis of all projects.
B.   Description of the Project
3.03      The proposed US$18.5 million project would have the following five
components:
(a)  Agriculture:  In addition to financing larger existing agro-
industrial projects, SOFIDE is promoting and financing small/
medium scale predominantly Zairian-owned projects in the regions in
three subsectors: livestock; fruit and vegetable products; and
agro-industry and forestry. These regional agricultural projects
are designed to rapidly produce foodstuffs for the major urban
populations and thereby help reduce the level of food imports.
Many of the projects include a transportation component to
facilitate shipment of products to the cities and inputs to pro-
cessing centers. SOFIDE has undertaken promotion missions to
the regions, identified affluent businessmen (often traders)
and has persuaded them to make term investments in agricul-
tural projects thereby mobilizing local resources. SOFIDE
requires and helps identify experienced management for the
projects and will only disburse when adequate management and
technical expertise has been found.
As of early January 1979, SOFIDE's pipeline of
agricultural projects included about 80 projects requiring
about US$16.3 million in foreign exchange, which accounts for
about 40% of these projects' total costs. About 30% of this
total foreign exchange requirement were for agroindustrial
projects (mainly oil and rice mills), 20% for animal production,
and 52% for general agriculture and forestry, (transport
projects are accounted for in the industry pipeline). The
regional distribution of the projects is also expected to be
more balanced than in the past: 26% of the projects would be
in the Shaba region, about 15% each in Kivu and Bas-Zaire, 8%
each in Bandundu, Equateur, Haut-Zaire, and the Kasais, and
the remaining 12% in the other regions, following deliberate
attempts by SOFIDE to distribute its agriculture operations
more evenly across the regions.
At least US$7.5 million of the proposed line of credit would be
for financing the foreign exchange component of SOFIDE loans in the
agricultural sector.
(b) Transportation: The Zairian transportation sector is beset
by three basic problems: a shortage of fuel particularly
in the regions, deteriorating state of the highways and



- 26 -
an acute lack of transportation equipment in good repair.
SOFIDE's pipeline includes a limited number of transporta-
tion projects many of which include a servicing/maintenance
facility. The basic objectives of lending to such projects
would be to facilitate the movement of products along in
transport arteries (e.g. Matadi-Kinshasa) and the transfer
of agricultural and industrial products from the regions
to the urban centers and for export. Financing such projects
would clearly only have a small impact on the overall transpor-
tation problems of Zaire. They would, however, complement
other Bank Group lending to the transportation sector in
Zaire (for highway maintenance, and increasing the capacity of
the Voie Nationale) which are aimed at helping Zaire through
rehabilitation and maintenance to overcome some of its most
severe infrastructural bottlenecks.
(c) Industry: Most of the industrial sector in Zaire at
present is operating at well below installed capacity
(in many cases below half capacity) for a variety of
reasons including reduced demand, equipment in need of
rehabilitation, lack of spares, shortages of both local
and foreign raw material inputs and transportation problems.
Despite the depressed level of production, there remains
demand for a number of products and due to the limited
impact of price controls, industrialists have been generally
able to generate sufficient cash flow to at least service
debt. Some industrial projects not constrained by shortages
of inputs and spares have generated substantial profits.
Historically SOFIDE has financed many of the leading
industrial companies in Zaire which have had strong
connections with the commercial banks and have conse-
quently been able to assure at least a minimal supply of
foreign exchange for raw materials and spare parts to
allow production to continue.
In this environment, proposals for financing
new projects become increasingly difficult. However, the
majority of the industrial projects in SOFIDE's pipeline
are rehabilitation and limited size expansion projects. The
rehabilitation projects can be justified not only in terms of
protecting the industrial base of Zaire but also in terms of
conservation of industrial employment. The new or expansion
projects are designed to meet a continuing unsatisfied demand
for some manufactured products. SOFIDE has an industrial
pipeline of some 45 projects which appear to be of varying
economic priority but does include projects which are Zairian
majority owned, minimize imported raw material input require-
ments by developing local raw materials, and service regional
needs etc. Strict application of the proposed investment
strategy reinforced by full economic analysis, should result
in high economic priority projects being financed by SOFIDE.
Given that many industrial firms in Zaire are majority foreign-
owned, the economic analysis will also demonstrate that adequate
economic benefits also accrue to the national economy (see para.
2.15).



- 27 -
Projects submitted by SOFIDE for financing under
the proposed Fifth Line of Credit would not be operational
for a further 2-3 years, by which time, it is expected that
the economic/industrial situation of Zaire should be recovering.
Additionally IDA can finance the foreign exchange component of
initial working capital, which would further extend th. time
before these projects would be dependent on the banking system
for foreign exchange resources.
(d)  Working Capital:  As mentioned in para 1.20, the new Circular
No. 156 has resulted in a reduction of about 50% of the foreign
exchange available for raw materials and spares for the indus-
trial sector. At IDA's request, SOFIDE conducted in later 1978
and early 1979 a detailed study on the working capital needs of
high economic priority projects in its portfolio required for
them to break-even and service their debt. The study revealed
that many of the firms surveyed were operating at about break-even
capacity levels because of low imported input stock levels and
reduced availability of foreign exchange from the banking
system, and that some firms had had to shut down as a result.
To protect SOFIDE's portfolio from the potentially serious
short-term effects of this situation, an amount of up to US$3
million of the fifth IDA Credit to SOFIDE shall be allocated to
finance on an emergency last-resort basis temporary foreign
exchange working capital for high economic priority projects in
SOFIDE's portfolio to enable them to operate at break-even
capacity levels and to service their debt. Such assitance
would be provided only in cases of extreme emergency where a
firm's inability to obtain foreign exchange from any other
sources for imported inputs and spare parts would, if allowed
to continue, cause it to close once existing stocks had
been exhausted.
The criteria for the allocation of working capital assis-
tance are as follows: (a) small-scale Zairian-owned firms, and
(b) firms producing entirely for the local market but lacking
external corporate affiliation which might otherwise offer
prospects of supply. Total foreign exchange working capital
requirements up to break-even capacity levels p.a. of these
enterprises in SOFIDE's portfolio are estimated at: (1) category
(a) US$1.3 million, (2) category (b) US$2.3 million. Temporary
foreign exchange working capital assistance will be provided as a
one-time (i.e., non-renewable) facility to any individual firm,
and will cover up to a maximum of 12 months requirements for
firms in category (a) and up to a maximum of 6 months requirements
in the case of category (b) firms. The aim of such assistance
will be to allow beneficiaries time to continue operations while
also seeking to cover subsequent future needs from other sources
(notably the banking system). The minimum maturity of such working
capital loans will be 2 years and the interest rates charged
and conditions regarding foreign exchange risk will be the same
as those proposed for term investment financing (see paras.
2.20-2.22). To assure that firms applying for such assistance
have not already received foreign exchange allocations from the



- 28 -
banking system for the same period of operations, the Banque du
Zaire has agreed in principle to assist SOFIDE in checking
allocations already granted by the commercial banks. SOFIDE
clients will be permitted to apply for working capital loans up
to 3 months prior to the time when new stocks will be required
to allow sufficient lead-time for delivery without disruption
in their operations.
(e)  Technical Assistance and Equipment:  With the current acute
shortage of foreign exchange in Zaire, SOFIDE has been
experiencing difficulty in getting foreign exchange cover
for the equipment required to make the regional offices
operational (i.e., radio equipment, typewriters, transport
etc) and also for the costs of training staff overseas.
With its rapid operational expansion in recent years, SOFIDE
has greatly increased its recruitment in particular of
younger professionals, for whom SOFIDE has an continuing
program of training at courses offered by specialized insti-
tutions abroad (such as CEFEB in Paris, and EDI among others).
SOFIDE presently sends three professionals abroad per year
for further training, and expects to continue to do so in
future. Therefore up to US$230,000 of the proposed credit
will be provided for (a) equipping the new regional offices
(US$190,000) and (b) technical assistance and staff training
needs (US$40,000).
C.   Proposed Credit to SOFIDE
3.04      The US$18.5 million line of credit to SOFIDE will finance the
foreign exchange component of the fixed capital investment and some working
capital requirements of subprojects approved by SOFIDE in the agriculture,
transportation and industrial sectors and will in addition cover SOFIDE
technical assistance and equipment needs.
Terms and Conditions
3.05      The proposed Fifth Line of Credit to SOFIDE would carry the
following terms and conditions:
(a)  Sectoral Allocation:
(i)  at least US$7.5 million should be invested in the
agricultural sector;
(ii)  up to US$3.0 million will be for working capital
financing of existing high economic priority projects
in SOFIDE's portfolio;
(iii) up to US$0.23 million would be for technical assis-
tance and training needs;
(iv)  the remainder up to a maximum of US$7.77 million
would be for investment in the industrial/
transportation sectors.



- 29 -
(b) Onlending Rates and Exchange Risk
Interest Rate and Exchange Risk. SOFIDE has agreed to
a covenant in the Draft Project Agreement whereby
it would seek to charge its subborrowers a positive real
interest rate (including fees) and to review such charges
with 7DA every six months.
Specifically, SOFIDE will onlend the funds for fixed
and working capital investments under the fifth credit at
15% per annum (plus commitment fee and appraisal fee) with
the foreign exchange risk being passed on to all medium/
large scale industrial and agricultural subborrowers (at
appraisal, the rate was 12.5% plus fees plus exchange risk).
The proposed rate, which would apply to the larger part of
SOFIDE's relending operations from the Credit, represents
a substantial increase over SOFIDE's previous rates and
is positive in real terms, since subborrowers will take the
foreign exchange risk.
Regarding small-scale enterprises, defined as Zairian-
owned enterprises with total assets not exceeding 200,000
(about US$98,000), the IDA funds will be onlent at 15%,
with the Government taking the foreign exchange risk for a
fee of 2.5%. Industrial subloans made by SOFIDE to this
category of client would not be financed by IDA beyond
US$100,000 equivalent.
For the technical assistance and equipment component
Government will carry the foreign exchange risk at no charge
to SOFIDE. With regard to local currency loans made from
untied local resources, SOFIDE has raised its rate to 15% for
agriculture (plus fees) and will raise its interest rate to
20% for industry from mid-1980 onwards as against 12.5% (plus
fees) at the time of appraisal.
(c) Onlending Rate to SOFIDE: The Credit will be onlent by
Government to SOFIDE at the full prevailing World Bank
interest rate and commitment fee (see para. 2.20).
(d) Free Limit: In view of SOFIDE's continued progress in
improving the quality of its appraisal work, the free limit
for projects in all sectors should be raised from US$150,000
under the fourth IDA credit to US$250,000 for the proposed
fifth IDA credit. The aggregate free limit should be
US$7 million.
(e) SOFIDE's Investment Strategy: This strategy (see para. 3.02)
should be strictly applied in order to identify high economic
priority projects for financing by SOFIDE.



- 30 -
(f) Economic Analysis of Subprojects: SOFIDE will be required to
provide a complete economic analysis including calculation
of the economic rate of return on all non-service sector
projects, and full qualitative economic analysis for all
small-scale enterprise and service sector projects (see
para. 2.15).
(g) Amortization Schedules: The subsidiary credit (Government
to SOFIDE) would have a flexible amortization schedule that
would substantially conform with the aggregate of the
amortization schedules of the subloans and equity investments
made by SOFIDE and financed under the proposed IDA credit,
subject to a maximum of 15 years including a grace period
not to exceed five years. SOFIDE would agree with Government
on an appropriate amortization schedule for the technical
assistance and equipment component.
(h) Debt/Equity Ratio: Despite the general difficulties of
the Zairian economy and in particular the shortage of foreign
exchange for imports of raw materials and spare parts,
overall SOFIDE's portfolio is well diversified and of accept-
able quality and its level of arrears still compares favorably
with that of other African DFCs. SOFIDE has taken a number
of sound measures to forestall the possible adverse impact of
arrears and doubtful loans on its financial situation by
increasing special provisions and reserves and stepping up
its supervision effort. In addition, part of the proposed
credit can be utilized to finance working capital needs
to alleviate the short term problems that lead some of its
clients into arrears. Because of the circumstances mentioned
above and also because SOFIDE has demonstrated since its
creation in 1970 a remarkable ability to develop soundly and
stay in a satisfactory financial situation despite the
difficult environment it has been operating in, it was agreed
at negotiations that the debt/equity ratio limit would be
maintained at 5:1, to which it had been increased from 3:1 as a
provisional measure after the November 1978 devaluation.
A share capital increase cannot be effected immediately
for a number of reasons. Firstly, SOFIDE share capital was
about doubled to 4 million zaires in 1977. Secondly, 60%
of SOFIDE share capital being in the hands of private local
and foreign investors (including IFC, DEG, EIB and a number
of foreign institutions), a further increase would require
somewhat lengthy discussions. Therefore as an interim measure,
the Government will convert into quasi-equity the necessary
amounts of Government loans made from rolled-over IDA funds so
as to keep a 5/1 debt/equity ratio. (This will be achieved by
increasing the maturity of the rolled-over IDA funds outside
the final maturity of repayments by SOFIDE to the Government



- 31 -
of this IDA credit, and subordinating these funds to the rank
of share capital in the event of a liquidation). SOFIDE has
also agreed to submit to the Association by June 1980, a plan
to restructure its equity and increase its share capital to a
reasonable level for its projected level of operations.
Project Cost Estimates
3.06      The total contribution of SOFIDE to projects it is forecast to
finance from September 1, 1979 to June 30, 1981, together with SOFIDE
technical assistance and equipment requirements for that period amount to
US$90.2 million, of which the foreign exchange component is US$67.1 million.

1/ See Resources Requirements (para. 2.40).
Thus IDA funds cover only about 36% of SOFIDE's foreign exchange requirements
or 26% of the total resource requirements to June 30, 1981.
Project Implementation
3.08      Reporting requirements:  SOFIDE would be required to submit quar-
terly reports as it has done under previous credits, which would include
financial statements, resource position, statement of arrears and notes on
subprojects encountering serious operational difficulties. SOFIDE would
also be required to continue to submit audited annual accounts prepared by
qualified accountants along with the SOFIDE annual report (see para. 2.19).
3.09      Procurement:  Procurement for the subprojects refinanced under
the credit would be in accordance with the standard IDA practice for develop-
ment banks (see para. 2.18).



- 33 -
3.10      Disbursement:  The proceeds of the proposed Fifth Credit would be
disbursed on SOFIDE subloans as follows:
(a)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported goods or services
for eligible subprojects;
(b)  up to 85% of the cost of previously imported equipment
which is purchased locally for the subprojects;
(c)  up to 70% of the cost of equipment produced in Zaire
substantially from previously imported components or
raw materials; and
(d)  up to 55% of the cost in Zaires of construction works
included in subprojects and carried out by Zairian
contractors.
3.11      The credit component is expected to be fully committed by June 30,
1981 and to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1984:
Benefits&and Risks
3.12      The benefits of this project are essentially twofold:
(a)  through the subprojects to be financed by SOFIDE the
project will be addressing itself to helping meet some
of the most pressing basic needs of the Zairian economy.
This is particularly the case in the agricultural sector,
where there is an urgent need to develop local food
production to feed the urban populations;
(b)  through continuing World Bank Group support to one of
the new competent and capable institutions in Zaire, we
would be assisting in protecting SOFIDE's independence,
furthering its institutional development as well as
increasing the possibility of SOFIDE acquiring additional
lines of credit from other external sources of foreign
exchange: in sum helping to maintain SOFIDE as a viable
institution through Zaire's current economic difficulties
so that it can play a significant intermediary role in
future recovery programs in Zaire.
3.13      The risks involved in this project relate essentially to the
economic conditions prevailing in Zaire and to the impact on SOFIDE's sub-
borrowers of: (a) the shortages of foreign exchange for the importation
of raw materials and spares; (b) the rate of inflation in Zaire.
3.14      Both of the above factors could have a serious affect on the
ability of SOFIDE's clients to service their debt which in turn might affect
the liquidity and financial condition of SOFIDE. The working capital compo-
nent is only proposed as an emergency resource; SOFIDE's clients should be



- 34 -
essentially reliant on the commercial banking sector for foreign resources for
raw material imports. If agreements can be reached on an economic recovery
program for Zaire and its financing, then support from external donors shotuld
help alleviate the above problem. Similarly it is expected that inflation
would be reduced under a recovery program thereby allowing SOFIDE clients to
operate in a stabler economic environment.

SOCIETE FINANCIERE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (SOFIDE)
Statement of General Policy
(Approved by SOFIDE's Board of Directors on February 10, 1970
and amended on March 14, 1973 and December 18, 1978)
The purpose of this Statement is to outline the policy that shall
be applied to the activities of the Societe Financiere de Developpement here-
inafter referred to as the Company, subject to any amendments that may be
made to this policy, after appropriate studies, by the Company's Board of
Directors.
I.   OBJECTIVES AND OPERATIONAL CRITERIA
1.        The Company shall assist in the development of soundly managed
enterprises in the Republic of Zaire in all the productive sectors of the
economy. The Company may not, however, engage in activities relating exclu-
sively to land or housing nor in activities of a purely social, commercial
or consumption nature.
2.        The Company shall assist enterprises which are majority privately
owned. The Company will also assist, up to a limit of 25% of its commitments,
enterprises with juridical personality that have, in fact, an autonomous
administration, financial management, accounting system and control, and in
which the State contributes directly or indirectly more than 49% of their
share capital. Those enterprises shall also meet all the other eligibility
requirements set forth in the Statutes and in the present Statement of Policy.
3.        The Company shall extend its assistance on the basis of economic
and financial criteria only. Enterprises that submit projects to the Company
shall be required to have efficient management, be technically sound, have
satisfactory market prospects for their production, be able to guarantee a
financial return on the investment and generally to contribute to the economic
growth of the country. The Company shall take all these different aspects
into consideration when appraising the projects submitted to it.
4.        The Company shall make every effort to foster the distribution of
industrial shareholdings and the growth of a capital market in the Republic
of Zaire. With this end in view it shall subscribe to issues of shares and
bonds in appropriate cases and shall sell shares from its portfolio, provided
that these operations are carried out under satisfactory conditions and that
the enterprises concerned are not prejudiced by such a sale. The Company
shall endeavor to create a market for its own shares in the Republic of
Zaire and to do everything within its power, within the framework of the law
and its own Statutes, to encourage Zairian investors to participate in its
capital.



-40-
ANNEX 5
Page 2
5.        In accordance with Article 3 of its Statutes the Company shall
extend all kinds of assistance, financial and other, in keeping with its
objectives. The Company shall invest in the capital of enterprises and shall
subscribe to issues of shares and other securities. It shall grant medium-
and long-term loans, for periods depending on the type of project involved,
with an appropriate grace period. The Company may also furnish guarantees in
certain cases. It shall endeavour to actively promote the establishment of
new and the expansion of existing enterprises. It shall give its clients
technical assistance and advice on the planning, layout and execution of their
projects. These loans and participations may be granted for construction
work, purchase of plant and equipment and for the constitution of permanent
working capital.
II. INVESTMENT POLICY
6.        The Company's assistance in the form of loans or participations or
both forms combined may not normally amount to less than Z10,000. However,
the Company is prepared to consider requests for financing of projects which,
without reaching this amount, nevertheless present a definite economic
interest.
7.        As a general rule, the total amount of loans granted by the Company
together with its participations and any other commitments of a financial
nature in favor of a single enterprise may not exceed 20% of the paid-up share
capital, the unimpaired reserves and the quasi-capital contributed by the
Government pari passu with the share capital.
8.        The Company shall join with other financing institutions, whether
local, foreign or international, in financing projects whose financial re-
quirements exceed its capacity.
9.        The Company's total investments in the form of equity participa-
tions may not exceed the total of the Company's share capital plus unimpaired
reserves and the government advance of M1 million ranking pari passu with
the share capital.
10.       As a general rule, the Company shall limit its equity participation
in any one enterprise to a maximum of 10% of its own share capital plus un-
impaired reserves and the government advance of 91 million ranking pari passu
with the share capital.
11.       Generally, the Company shall not assume managerial responsibilities
in enterprises it assists and shall limit its share participations to 25% of
the share capital of any given enterprise. It may, however, by unanimous
decision of the Board, exceed this percentage and even assume managerial
responsibility if this is justified by the circumstances or the nature of
the nature of the enterprise. The Company may also, notwithstanding the
above restrictions, take any action it considers essential to protect its
investments.

ANNEX 5
Page 3
12.       Whe- the Company underwrites an issue of shares or other securities,
it may commit itself for an initial amount in excess of the limits fixed in
the above Articles 10 and 11, as long as it has good reasons to believe that
its final investment will remain within those limits.
13.       When deciding upon the amount and form of financial assistance it
shall provide, the Company shall take into account all the financial require-
ments of the project and the financial situation of the enterprise in ques-
tion. In principle, the loans the Company grants shall not together exceed
50% of the total cost of the project. It may, however, exceed this limit if
there is special justification, such as in the case of an expansion project.
14.       The Company shall endeavour to maintain a balanced portfolio by
distributing its loans, participations and other commitments among all the
sectors of industrial and economic activity within the range of its objec-
tives.
III. FINANCIAL POLICY
15.       The general aim of the Company's financial policy is to maintai
the value of its own capital, to manage its funds in such a way that it is
at all times able to honor its obligations on time and to achieve a profit
margin that enables it to cover its operating costs, form adequate reserves
and distribute reasonable dividends to its shareholders. To this end the
Company shall:
-    maintain a satisfactory balance between the maturities
of its own obligations and those of the loans it grants;
-    not incur debts of more than one year of term in excess
of five times the amount of its capital plus quasi-
capital;
-    not incur exchange risks in respect of those of its
borrowings that are repayable in foreign currencies;
-    generally require appropriate guarantees for the loans it
grants;
-    fix its interest rates, commissions and other charges at a
level that will enable it to obtain a satisfactory return;
-    make adequate provisions against potential losses and build
up reserves to a level consistent with sound financial
practices, taking into account the size and quality of its
portfolio of loans and investments as well as the need to
pay adequate dividends to its shareholders.

ANNEX 5

IV. ORGANIZATION - SPECIAL PROVISIONS
16.       The Company shall strive to develop and maintain a solid and well-
balanced organization and a management team capable of appraising the finan-
cing proposals put before it, assisting enterprises in the formulation of
their projects and supervising their execution. With this in view it shall
give special attention to the training of its professional staff both locally
and abroad. Professional and other staff shall be recruited solely on the
basis of their professional qualifications.
17.       The Company shall require that its borrowers have an accounting
system which meets the requirements of sound management. It shall, as far
as it is possible, exercise the right to check the activities and inspect
the accounts and books of the companies it finances.
18.       The Company's own accounts shall be kept in accordance with gener-
ally accepted international standards. The Company shall engage the services
of an independent firm of professional accountants of international repute
to audit its annual accounts.
19.       The Company may undertake the management of special funds only
on condition that such management does not, in the view of the Board of
Directors, interfere with the Company's capacity to fulfill its main objec-
tive of promoting and financing productive investments. Such funds shall
only be managed by the Company on condition that it receives a remuneration
to be determined in the light of the service rendered.

Investment Strategy Statement-
Criteria for Selection of Projects by SOFIDE
Selection of projects shall take into account economic conditions,
the major problems facing the country and national priorities, whilst also
bearing in mind the limited resources at SOFIDE's disposal.
Following an initial analysis, SOFIDE has identified the
following problems:
(a) satisfaction of basic needs;
(b) transport;
(c) stabilization of the balance of payments;
(d) industrial integration;
(e) increased exploitation of local raw materials; and
(f) employment creation.
To this end, SOFIDE will give priority in its lending to projects
which contribute to resolving one or more of these problems. Specifically,
SOFIDE shall assist primarily:
-    agriculture and livestock projects;
-    transportation projects;
-    export-oriented projects;
-    import substitution projects;
-    industrial integration projects;
-    projects involving exploitation of local raw materials;
-    labor-intensive projects;
-    projects located in the regions;
-    projects promoting Zairian-owned firms.

T1-c above areas of activity constitute the criteria for pre-
selection of projects. Appraisal of all projects will then include an
economic analysis, on the basis of which the decision to finance any given
project will be taken. From amongst the projects meeting the above
criteria, SOFIDE will select for its financing those with the highest
economic rates of return.

Assumptions for Financial Projections
1. Approvals
For agriculture in real terms, approvals increase in 1978/79 by 20%,
thereafter through 1981 maintain the level before increasing through 1983 by
5% p.a. Equity investments grow at 15% p.a. in current terms.
For industry in real terms, approvals decline in 1978/79 by about
1/3, thereafter through 1981 decline by about 10% p.a. before increasing through
1983 by about 5% p.a.
2. Commitments
Owing to foreign exchange resource constraints in 1979, ornly % of 1979 approvals
are committed in that year, the remainder being committed the following year. From 1980
onwards, it is assumed that 70% of loans will be committed in the year they are approved,
and 30% the following year. Loan approvals totalling Z 14.1 million uncommitted at the end
of 1078 are assumed committed in 1979.  All ecuitv investments are committed in the year
tney are approved;.
3.  Disbursements
25% of loans committed are disbursed in the year of commitment; 40%
in the following year; and 35% in the third year. Equity investments are
completely disbursed in the year of commitment. Undisbursed commitments at
end 1978 totalling 942.9 million are assumed disbursed 60% in 1979 and 40% in
1980.
4. Foreign Exchange Component
In agricultural loans, the foreign exchange component is assumed on
the average to account for 65% of SOFIDE's disbursements. For loans to industry
and all other sectors, it is assumed to account on average for 80% of SOFIDE's
disbursements. All equity investments are in local currency.
5. Loan Maturity
For the existing loan portfolio, which will predominate in repayments
in 1979-80, average loan maturity is five years including one year's grace period.
In the slower disbursing new loan portfolio, which will predominate in repayments
from 1982 onwards, loan maturity averages 8 years including 2 years' grace.
6. Interest Income
For all term lending except on the Special Fund for Agriculture, an
average interest rate of 16% p.a. (inclusive of commitment fees) is assumed on
all disbursements from 1979 onwards, and 13% p.a. for all disbursements before
1979.

Page 2
7. Dividend Income
The return on capital invested in SOFIDE's equity portfolio is
assumed to average 3% p.a.
8. Appraisal Fees
Appraisal fees are assumed at 1% of loan amount payable at commitment
for all projects.
9. Income on Short-term Investments
Average interest earned on short-term deposits is 9% p.a.
10. Special Fund for Agriculture
This Fund is managed by SOFIDE on behalf of the Ministry of the Plan
and is for the financing of small and medium-scale agricultural projects. The
Fund consists of Z13 million in local currency which is being drawn down by SOFIDE
in tranches. SOFIDE pays the Ministry of the Plan 3.5% p.a. interest on these
funds, which are on-lent at 7.5%.  It is assumed that 80% of agricultural disburse-
ments are made from this Special Fund. Government has agreed to SOFIDE consolidating the
Fund into quasi-equity; however it is not considered as such in these projections since
maturity and ranking in the event of liquidation are not vet determined. It is assumed
that loan collections under the Fund are rolled-over and relent by SOFIDE.
11. Cost of Funds
The 95 million long-term Government loans carry interest of 1% p.a.
"Rolled-over" IDA funds -- i.e., repayments in local currency upon outstanding
IDA credits which are in turn relent to SOFIDE by the Government - are at 4% p.a.
The average interest charged on all new foreign borrowings is 8% p.a. (on all old
foreign borrowings 6% p.a.).
12. Taxes
Under the 1970 Establishment Convention between SOFIDE and the Government
SOFIDE is exempt from income tax until 1980. From 1980 onwards SOFIDE pays
income tax at 50% of net profits.
13.  Provisions for Losses
General provisions for losses are assumed at 3.5% of year-end loan
portfolio outstanding.
14. Administrative Expenses
Administrative expenses (excluding depreciation) are estimated at Zaires
3 million in 1979 and are projected to grow at 60% p.a. in 1980 and thereafter at 40% p.a.
15. Dividends
SOFIDE is assumed to distribute dividends of g400,000.

16. Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are forecast to grow at 15% p.a.
17. Share Capital
No share capital increase is included in the projection period
although SOFIDE will complete study for share capital increase by June 1980.
