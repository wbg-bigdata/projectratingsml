Executive Summary


Poverty issues: situation and trends


All communities in the survey (both inland and coastal) represent poor hamlets/communes, with a

high incidence of poor households: 61% in Vinh Tuong hamlet (Ninh Thuan), 52% and 42,6% in

Thach Hai and Tuong Son hamlets (Ha Tinh) respectively, over 23% in Hiep My Dong and My
Nam Long hamlets (Tra Vinh)1. Progress with poverty reduction has been slow in these

communities. Kinh people are the majority as compared with other ethnic groups in surveyed

communities; only 2 communes in Quang Ninh (Duong Hoa and Quang Dien) have a small number

of ethnic minority people such as San Diu, Tay, Nung, Chinese; a large number of ethnic Khmer

was observed in My Long Nam and Hiep My Dong communes in Tra Vinh Province.


Resource utilization and how the fishing communities access resources:


For coastal communities: The off-shore fishing productivity level in many areas does not indicate a
significant decrease2. Only better-off fishing households are able to access offshore resources. Poor

fishing households in surveyed hamlets/communes are unable to do so, since they cannot afford

adequate fishing equipment and vessels. Nevertheless, catches of offshore resources are not stable

in many areas. Although the fisherfolks still use explosive fishing method which damages species,

the near-shore resources have decreased. Some households access inshore resources mainly, for

example, by diving to catch lobsters and sea snails, using fishing nets close to shore (Ninh Binh, Ha

tinh), alga and glacilaria picking (in Ninh Thuan), and fish and squid catching (in Ha Tinh, Quang

Ninh, Ninh Binh). Poor households have little or no capacity for exploitation of areas for

aquaculture such as: farming of shrimp/prawn, fish, snail, seaweed cultivation, due to limited

capital stock, techniques and management skills. The poor fisherfolks also pointed out that they

could not undertake near shore or brackish fishing because the water surface either belongs to the

State or Army or is being tendered at such a high price that only the better-off could bid. (Ninh

Binh, Ninh Thuan). The sea surface also belongs to the provincial authority, and is not delegated to

the district or commune authorities, so that the poor can neither obtain information nor access

bidding procedures.



1 In Tra Vinh, there was high poverty rate, (the poorest earn 122,000VND permonth compared with the average poor of VND200,000
capita per month) which is defined by MOLISA, Aug 2005. The consultation shows the poverty was constituted by shortage of lands , or
no land tenure, lack of knowledge on production, low land fertility
2Hatinh, in Thach Ha district off-shore fishing productivity show stable from 21,170 tons (2001) to 21,050 tons (2005), but Can Loc
district in Hatinh shows gradually decrease (225 tons in 2000 to 185 tons in 2005) , Ninh Binh 2,075 tons (2005)

For inland communities (using freshwater): Most poor households in surveyed areas rely on

agricultural activities that have little potential to generate adequate income. Poor households'

access to resources for aquaculture (freshwater fish, frog, tortoise, sweet snail) is also very limited

due to lack of capital and access to markets (Ha Tinh). Most of those poor people work in non-

farm, low-pay jobs. In some areas the poor can be involved in aquaculture exploitation because they

have land to convert to lagoons/ponds (Ha tinh). But in many cases aquaculture activities are not an
available option for the poor because they do not have land (Tra Vinh, Ninh Thuan)3. Since land

was sold for the better-off who do extensive aquaculture farming, the poor do only the paid labour.


Livelihood opportunities: Situation ­ constraints ­ trends


Overview: In general, there is diversity in livelihoods of surveyed communities (both coastal and

inland). Livelihoods range from agriculture (cultivation, animal husbandry) to fishery

(catching/exploiting and aquaculture), home production (seafood processing such as fish sauce,

shrimp paste, dried fish and squid), and trade services (small scale trading) and hired workers (for

all types of activities including labor exporting). Most surveyed communities have more than 10

types of livelihoods (income generating activities). For instance, Duong Hoa and Quang Dien

communes have as many as 17 livelihoods, Phuoc Dinh, Phuoc Diem have over 15 livelihoods.


Aquaculture livelihoods: status quo and trends


In general, 100% of surveyed communities (both coastal and inland) have livelihoods/activities in

aquaculture. In some communities, these livelihoods contribute greatly to income generation. It is

worth noting that all communities realize that they are sustainable in the future and selected as the

first priority livelihoods. However, specific activities/livelihoods vary from community to

community.


Coastal surveyed communities have more diverse livelihoods in aquaculture: (i) surveyed

communities in Ninh Thuan focus on shrimp/fish cage rearing, shrimp hatchery, sweet snail and

especially E.Cottonii seaweed (recently); (ii) in other coastal communities in Ha Tinh, Ninh Binh,

Quang Ninh, Tra Vinh aquaculture activities focus on tiger prawn rearing, sea fish cage rearing,

brackish water crab, oyster and other mollusk cultivation.

3There are many examples in Vietnam whereby resources have been allocated to wealthy outsiders and not to poor households in local
communities eg. Sea water surface in Van Phong Bay, Khanh Hoa province given in leasing to Japanese, Korean and European private
companies to farm pearl oysters, green mussels and fish in cage. It is also envisaged that part of such resources should and could be
directly exploited by the poorest within local communities. One of the most difficult case in Thach Ban (box 4.2), has been the allocation
of land with associated title deed ("red book") to "real" poor households.

Inland surveyed communities focus their aquaculture livelihoods on freshwater fish rearing (which

has been ranked as the top income generating livelihood in aquaculture in these communities) of Ha

Tinh, Quang Ninh, Ninh Binh and Tra Vinh. Various forms of freshwater fish rearing are practiced

in lagoon, river, lake, low rice field (rice-fish farming)


For coastal communities: Livelihoods in fishery dominates in a few communities in terms of

number of workers and generated income. For example, more than 50% of workers/households are

involved in fishery and income from fishery (fish catching/aquaculture) is ranked no. 1. In some

coastal communities, fishery livelihoods account for over 30% of total income (e.g. Thach Hai

commune ­ Thach Ha ­ Ha Tinh; Kim Dong ­ Kim Son- Ninh Binh) and 50% of total income and

total population (Kim Dong commune of Kim Son District)

    · Potential for fishery livelihood development: offshore fish catching is not clearly apparent

        in poor fishing communities. In these areas, though there are positive views on off-shore

        fishing potential, there is still limitation of off-shore fishing in terms of vessels as those

        vessels belong to the cooperative (stated owned) and only few fisherfolks work in the

        vessels. Poor fisherfolks do not have access to sufficient capital for investment in vessels.

        Their livelihoods are centered on inshore exploitation. However, this unsustainable

        livelihood is about to cease soon due to coastal resource depletion and the Law of Fisheries

        discouraging such activity.

    · Although presently aquaculture ranks second after agriculture (rice growing, husbandry,

        cattle raising etc.) in terms of livelihoods, it contributes considerably to income generation.

        The trend is becoming more oriented toward greater intensification, expansion of cultivated

        area, and change in cropping patterns. More important is that communities consider

        aquaculture having great potential and being sustainable. The common trend in all

        communities, particularly poor fisherfolks, is an income diversification through pro-poor

        aquaculture including pond and cage culture systems and a range of species comprising

        crustaceans (shrimp and prawn), molluscs (sweet snail, oysters, clams), fresh and brackish

        water fish, frogs and seaweed (e.g. E. Cottonii).

    · Industrial and home production livelihoods exist but account for an insignificant proportion

        in surveyed communities. Remarkably, few of them have traditional trades such as fish

        sauce making in Phuoc Dinh, Phuoc Dien (Ninh Thuan), fish sauce and paste making in

        Thach Hai (Ha Tinh).

    · Other coastal related livelihoods, such as small scale services, trading, and casual labour

        are common in all coastal communities, contributing to income generation. In particular,

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs6

        some communes such as Phuoc Dinh and Phuoc Diem in Ninh Thuan Province hired labour

        in shrimp farms like digging, feeding the shrimps or working in vessels. These activities

        bring significant contributions to poor communities especially for male workers. For

        women in fishing communities, casual labour tends to be in small scale seafood processing

        (Hatinh, Ninh thuan), trading, in shore-catching (Ninh Binh, Ninh Thuan), and seaweed

        raising (Ninh Thuan),


For inland communities: Agriculture-related livelihoods are predominant. In many surveyed

communes, income from agricultural livelihoods accounts for above 80% of total income (Duong

Hoa commune, Tuong Son commune, Vuong Loc commune); this figure is over 40% in the other

communities.

    · In general, potential for agricultural livelihoods is very limited; most communities have

        disadvantaged production conditions: drought-stricken, infertile land in Ninh Thuan, Ha

        Tinh. In Ninh Binh, Quang Ninh, Tra Vinh provinces, limit land area for cultivation in

        many communities.

    · However, some communities (including coastal) have potential for animal husbandry. For

        example, Phuoc Dinh and Phuoc Diem in Ninh Thuan province have potential for sheep

        (the most important sheep raiser in Vietnam), goat and cattle raising. In the other

        communities, pig raising made a considerable contribution to income generation. In many

        areas including coastal areas (Ninh Binh, Ninh Thuan), the combined livelihood economies

        for households are strongly preferred (integrated husbandry and agriculture/gardening with

        pond fish culture known as V.A.C system in Vietnam) with the reasons of low costs and

        low risks.

    · Industrial and home production livelihoods exist but account for an insignificant proportion

        in surveyed communities. Other livelihoods, for example small-scale services, trading, and

        casual labouring are common in all coastal communities, contributing significantly to

        income generation.


Priority livelihoods for the fishing communities


As mentioned earlier, this is the top priority livelihood option of consulted communities. There are

several aquaculture systems which are currently practiced in Vietnam but not all would be suitable

for poor communities who generally lack or have limited technical knowledge, experience and

access to capital. Therefore, given their current potential and external financial resources, the poor

(**)Thach Hai commune is the coastal commune but some villages are located by the beach. Some

villages are categorized as inland coastal and not close to the sea. The inland coastal areas have a

river and a lake, so the freshwater is selected as potential livelihood.


The study identified several constraints for poor households to develop those livelihoods

which varied from area to area. Some commonly identified implications are the following:

· Environment. Natural resource constraints caused by generally degraded environment

     (polluted water, increased salinity, massive use of pesticide in agriculture), affect key



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 9

    livelihoods of the people such as rice cultivating, aquatic product exploitation and aquaculture.

    It also causes spreading of diseases.

· Extension. Lack of technical officers and extension workers to train and support farmers to

    start and/ or improve agriculture and aquaculture system.

· Credit. Many households are unable to access formal credit systems such as Vietnam Bank for

    Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD) which require collateral. Moreover, some

    aquaculture systems such as intensive shrimp farming are considered a high investment-high

    risk activity especially for poor households.

· Infrastructure. Generally the water supply and drainage systems are obsolete and insufficient

    to serve these communities. This has a tremendous impact on the fresh water supply for

    household use, irrigation and aquaculture activities. For the latter, the lack of a suitable water

    management system including inlet water supply and storage and outlet water drainage and

    treatment pond causes disease outbreaks and crops failures.

· Awareness. Awareness raising for fisherfolks/farmers regarding environmental protection and

    disease prevention has been weak. This may put aquaculture production at risk should a disease

    outbreak occur.

· Market access. In some inland and remote areas (Hai Ha district, Binh Binh/Ninh Binh

    province, Can Loc district/Ha Tinh province) poor farmers face difficulties in accessing

    markets for selling fish.


Risks and risk management measures for priority livelihoods

In general, in all surveyed communities (both coastal and inland), risks were mainly found in

aquaculture activities. Four most common risk groups have been identified and mitigation

measures (which are in fact demonstrated in selected livelihoods) proposed by communities are as

follows.


    (i)      Calamity risk (flooding): (i) broken or severely damaged national dykes causing total

             loss of farmed products; (ii) contaminated environment causing diseases (iii) broken

             mechanical equipment due to high flood tides (in case of E. Cottonii seaweed).

    (ii)     Contaminated water: causing mass dying of sea species for many reasons: improper

             planning, lack of technique, lack of a proper water management system.

    (iii)    Diseases: due to several reasons including natural disasters, pollution, poor knowledge

             of technique.

    (iv)     Fluctuating market price: due to several reasons including insufficient seafood

             planning, lack of food processing plants, lack of market information and product

              marketing. Price is usually driven by local middlemen who set the price for farmers on

              a daily basis or on free market basis. The farmers/ fisherfolks become very dependent

              on these traders.


Regarding risk mitigation measures, some have been proposed by communities, which are

presented in their livelihood priority as above. For instance, the model of inshore cage farming of E.

Cottonii seaweed is likely to minimize such risks as damage by floodtides, loss of seaweed,

seaweed eaten by fish. For the poor households, it seems that the integrated model (eg. Rice-cum-

fish or blackish fishing in one season) seems to be feasible with fewer risks. In some areas where

they do off-shore cage farming, it is possible for farmers to move their cages away from

contaminated waters, but the costs are high. Among the measures, sound aquaculture zones

planning, enhanced technical support, strengthened management capacity, and market mechanisms

for the poor are key and highly recommended by the poor fishing communities.


Needs of the poor fishing communities


In table 2, the four possible household scenarios which are reported were identified during the

study. It is likely that in each commune all cases occur although in different proportions. For each

of them the approach to identification of resource and investment needs varies considerably.

Role/capacity of local authorities (provincial/district/communal) and organizations in poverty

reduction for communities

In general, the roles and capacity of the local authorities and officials at all levels in aquaculture

development and management still represent constraints for economic development and economic

integration. In some provinces (Ha Tinh, Quang Ninh, Ninh Thuan) where many development

projects have been implemented, local government officials reflected a need to have good

management and leadership skills that enable them to receive, manage and implement development

projects in a proper manner. More emphasis would be required on strengthening management

capacity of fishery staff at all levels.

There is a general observation of management capacity for fishery development in Vietnam:

"Management capacity is limited, far from meeting development and integration requirements.

State management apparatus for fishery at district and communal level is asynchronous. It is

noteworthy that in many provinces with potential for fishery development district and communal

fishery departments have not been established yet. In the case of Ninh Binh, there has no separate

local department of aquatic products but lack of officers under DARD (Department of Agriculture



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 14

and Rural Development) to implement the aquacultural economies and extension support" (Source:

5 year Review Report [2001-2005] of Ministry of Fisheries)


In reality, the fishing communities appreciated the support from many social groups like NGOs,

and mass organizations at all levels (Women's Union, Farmers' and Fishermen's Associations) and

credit organizations (VBARD and Vietnam Bank for Social Policy - VBSP) which are considerably

important for poverty reduction in general and fishery development in particular in all provinces.


Women's Union at many levels (province, district, commune, hamlet) in some provinces such as

Ha Tinh have extensive experience in receiving, managing and implementing community-based

foreign funded projects (e.g. projects funded by IFAD, UNDP). In other provinces like Ninh Thuan,

Quang Ninh, local Women's Union has recently been participating in development projects (for

example Quang Ninh Women's Union made great contribution to the success of Project PAM

5322).


Farmers' and Fishermen's Associations at many levels (province, district, commune) in surveyed

provinces have experience in managing and implementing projects funded by their Central

Headquarters and have actively supported community development projects.


VBARD has participated in receiving funds, disbursement and handling financial transactions for

development projects. At the moment, provincial branches of VBSP are dealing with these

activities. From the consultation it appears that the capacity and willingness to receive funds

disbursed by this banking system are sound, but the poor still meet many difficulties with

procedures, and in raising collateral. Term and size of loan are still not relevant whereas the

VBARD does not offer a combined savings and credit scheme which would be very highly

appreciated by the poor fishing communities.



The main recommendations from the research team for aquaculture development include the
followings:

· Addressing poverty issues and pro-poor fishery development: Identify the most suitable pro-

    poor aquaculture systems (pond, net enclosure, cage, mono and polyculture) & species context

    specific which are appropriate for the consulted communities, especially low-in-the-food-chain

    species (e.g. sea cucumber, tilapia, seaweed, mussels, clams and other molluse);

· Development of master plan: the development of aquaculture is within the provincial, district

    and commune master plan;

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 15

· Establishment of self-help mechanism: Encourage small-scale farmers to get affiliated in self-

    management groups and Aquaculture and Fishery Associations. Or identify and set-up a

    savings & credit scheme via Women's Union and/ or local credit organizations to meet the

    investment needs for each kind of aquaculture model proposed; support mechanisms to assure

    financial sustainability to farmers' groups and Association as project exit strategy (e.g. OASIS)

· Identify aquaculture training needs and provide technical training to farmers. Beside technical

    subjects, trainings shall include: (a) record and book keeping; (b) basic aquaculture economics,

    and (c) business plan development to improve farmers' capacity to get a loan and to manage

    aquaculture business;

· Provide technical support through sufficient and capable local extension officials from DARDs

    and DOFIs.. Improve the extension system by supporting the establishment of Voluntary

    Extension Workers at commune and hamlet level;

· Support and train Associations to improve skills and capacity to represent farmers, have access

    to information and deal with early disease warning system and management (including medical

    kits/boxes and water quality test kits);

· Identify the source of good quality seed for the identified species and help the community to

    access them; Whenever possible, establish backyard hatcheries in selected households to breed

    and nurse freshwater species;

· Support "needs based" R&D in DOFI, Universities and Research Institutes for Aquaculture

    (RIAs) to develop technology to breed pro-poor aquaculture species. Support in-country

    technology transfer of already proven technology [e.g. sea cucumber (Holothuria scabra) and

    abalone (Haliotis asinina) in RIA-3; freshwater giant prawn (Macrobrachium rosembergii) in

    RIA-1 and RIA3 and Can Tho University);

· Identify alternative aquatic product outlets and help communities to build commercial links

    with those markets;

· Explore alternative and complementary livelihood options including aquaculture and capture

    fisheries post-harvest processing added value and link to national and international markets

    (e.g. dried sea cucumber to Hong Kong; dried seaweed to Malaysia and China);

· Encourage and support local initiatives to raise community awareness about environment and

    livelihoods (e.g. mangrove reforestation; small initiatives in primary school);

· Infrastructure development (irrigation and roads); improve the dyke to ensure sufficient fresh

    water (in some provinces).

· Enhancing administrative reform and ensuring the effective implementation of Fisheries Law


Recommended measures to reorganize aquaculture production

    · Strengthening the forecast of fishing ground; train fishermen in off-shore fishing. Some

       places within the study areas are successfully piloting Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) for

       specific fisheries habitats (Kim Son/Ninh Binh province, Tra Vinh province). Other

       provinces like Quang Ninh, Ninh Thuan do not have MPAs yet, and there exist serious

       environment effects on the fisherfolk livelihoods;

    · Adjustment of regional aquaculture planning towards stable and sustainable development;

       Finalizing planning and developing regulations on inland aqua reserves and marine

       reserves; Releasing breeds of shrimp and fish to the wild in order to regenerate and develop

       aquatic resources; Planning of water supply and drainage system for aquaculture;

    · Allocating the proper fish boat warning system seems to be at high attention of most local

       officials. However, due to financial and investment constraints, most areas consulted do not

       have a proper emergency awareness system. This may cause losses for the people working

       offshore. It is recommended to the government support the implementation of effective

       models that promote the cooperation of fishermen investment and government's services

       with on-the-sea operations in cost-sharing manner to better respond to fluctuating input

       costs. Support fishermen to help each other in case of emergency at sea;

    · Strengthening information dissemination activities on protection and development of

       marine resources;

    · Encouraging the development of diverse aquaculture at sea and on islands and assuring

       access be prioritized for poor households in the vicinity, depending upon interest and

       demand that should be promoted through awareness building and other educational and

       training activities;

    · Develop community-based and co-management pilot models within an Integrated Coastal

       Zone Management framework and under the Gov. decentralization process promoted by the

       Fisheries Law and Decree on Democracy;

    · Foster environmental conservation and the use of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA)

       for aquaculture development;

    · Building capacity for aquatic animal health in aquaculture;

    · Further develop post-harvest technologies;

    · Introduce standard for aquatic products for food security and produce. Trace-ability:

       Develop a bar code system for farmed aquatic products in safe aquaculture farming zones

       following BMPs and GAPs to comply with EU and other international market regulations;

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 17

    · Emphasizing international markets as driving forces for sustainable development of

        aquaculture while attaching appropriate importance to domestic market.


Recommended measures on institution development for fishery /aquacultural development


From the survey on management and implementation capacity of local authorities and mass

organizations at appropriate levels in all 5 provinces, management and implementation model of

projects have been discussed and suggestions are as follows:


    Keeping in mind the pro-poor approach that land and water resources, particularly publicly

    owned/controlled land and water resources that could be converted to productive resources, be

    predominantly allocated to poor households in the vicinity rather than being allocated to

    wealthier groups.

· In order to strengthen management and monitoring capacity for communities, it is

    recommended that local authorities function as good project planners and environmental

    management managers and resource use planners. Projects must be designed to meet the needs

    of local communities (technical and others) in an environmentally sound and socially

    acceptable manner. Although surveyed communes participated in managing and implementing

    funded projects, none of them worked as project managers, especially in fishery projects.

· Initially district authorities would be project managers who would give instruction to and

    supervise communal authorities and communities for the fulfillment of commitment to funding

    sponsors. In addition, there are often 2-3 fishery technical workers at district level who would

    be able to provide technical support to participants to pilot projects;

· People's Committees and interested organizations in project communes should bear the

    responsibility to disseminate project information to communities;

· Pilot Projects should be implemented by household or group of household

· Promoting fishery extension in exploitation and protection of aquatic resources, in breeding

    (seed and species raising/keeping in local area), farming, product processing and post-harvest

    services;

· Strengthening cooperation in R&D, breeding and feeding technologies, resources forecast; use

    of alternatives method to banned chemicals (e.g. BMPs and GAPs);

· Enhancing international cooperation, experience exchange; effective implementation of

    international projects funded by Norad, Danida and other organizations as SEAFDEC, NACA,

    FAO, and the World Fish Center;



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 18

· Finalizing development planning of training institutions in fishery industry and preparing

    human development strategy with emphasis on technical and staff management;

· Socializing i.e. Mobilizing other resources and assistance than the government support

    regarding training and capacity building activities within the fishery industry;

· Encouraging the participation of the private sector; applying community-based model with

    enhanced roles of associations and cooperatives in production and business services; fostering

    national initiatives in public-private partnership.


Key recommendations on the process to identify aquaculture development/ pilot work (from

the views of the research team)

· Identify target beneficiaries and engage in consultation with them and local authorities;

· Carry out a thorough PRA in the pilot commune(s) with the general objective of developing

    aquaculture and water resource management for poverty reduction;

· Identify the most suitable pro-poor aquaculture systems (pond, net enclosure, cage, mono and

    polyculture) & species context specific which are appropriate for the consulted communities,

    especially low-in-the-food-chain species (e.g. sea cucumber, tilapia, seaweed, mussels, clams

    and other molluse);

· Make sure that development of aquaculture is within the provincial, district and commune

    master plan;

· Define and quantify type(s) of intervention needed. For example, according to sub-group in the

    pilot commune: people currently involved in aquaculture, people without access to water &

    land resources;

· Identify aquaculture training needs and provide technical training to farmers. Beside technical

    subjects, trainings should include: (a) record and book keeping; (b) basic aquaculture

    economics, and (c) business plan development to improve farmers' capacity to get a loan and to

    manage aquaculture business;

· Carry out all EIAs, Carrying Capacity and other relevant study to aquaculture development;

· Encourage and support local initiatives to raise community awareness about environment and

    livelihoods (e.g. mangrove reforestation; small initiatives in primary school);

· Support "needs based" R&D in DOFI, Universities and Research Institute for Aquaculture

    (RIAs) to develop technology to breed pro-poor aquaculture species. Support in-country

Chapter 1: Introduction



1. Summary



Over the past decade, the resource base supporting fishing communities in coastal and inland

Vietnam has been depleted or is in a state of serious decline to the point where livelihoods are

seriously threatened. Therefore, it is critical to move towards improved management of the fishery

sector complemented by the development of alternative income generating activities. Improved

fisheries management would need to be comprehensive, addressing issues of the use of captured

fisheries gear and the establishment of environmentally sound practices and actions to improve and

sustain fisheries productivity and biodiversity.


To achieve the above, a co-management strategy would need to be developed that would engage

local households and communities; local organizations (Fishermen's Associations, Women's

Unions, other NGOs); local government departments (DOFI, MPI, PPCs); credit institutions
(VBARD and BSP), and the Ministry of Fisheries. The current Vietnamese legal framework5

allocates specific responsibilities to local governments with regard to the management of fisheries,

coastal and inland waters, aquaculture development, and the establishment of protected areas.

Experience has shown that direct engagement of all stakeholders in formulating management plans

for natural resource use is the strongest approach to assuring sustainable and productive use of

those resources.


1.1 Objective

The main objective of this work is to develop the information required to formulate a follow-on

project that would be of benefit the poorest fishing communities in particular in the country through

sustainable development and management of inland aquatic and coastal resources. This would be

done under that operation through the implementation of pilot demonstrations that would include

alternative income generation activities such as (a) aquaculture, handicrafts, and other options that

would be identified during the seed-grant phase; (b) provision of training for management,

environmental monitoring and productive activities; and (c) strengthening of local institutions and

community groups in cooperative decision making for sustainable resource use. These pilot-scale




52003 Vietnam Fisheries Law (2003); Decree on Democracy (2003)
Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 21

activities would be selected through a community driven demand process that would draw together

all interest groups, including local governments, NGOs, and others.



The specific activities under this assignment would include the following (as the original TOR

required):

a) Consultation with poor fishing communities in representative and geographically diverse coastal

and inland areas to understand the constraints they face with regard to generating income;

b) Discussion with poor fishing groups the potential options for alternative employment as they

pertain in particular to marine and coastal aquaculture development based on the experience in

Vietnam and China and with local governments the types of interventions -- e.g., establishment of

areas for sustainable aquaculture development, support facilities, environmental monitoring

capacity, training needs, etc. -- and actions that would be required for men and women from poor

households to gain access to the use of land and water resources for this purpose. Emphasis should

be placed on marine aquaculture options since there are many suitable near-shore areas for

development as well as inland options for diversification of agricultural production -- e.g., further

development of integrated rice-fish and other farming involving animal husbandry and pond fish

culture;

c) Exploring options that can help poor households gain access to required training, area for

production, inputs, credit and other production needs in an environmentally sound and socially

acceptable development strategy from gender and ethnicity viewpoints and preferences;

d) Identifying the specific constraints that limit poor households in gaining access to resources and

credit and suggest means by which these constraints can be overcome to improve livelihoods in a

sustainable manner;

e) Preparing a summary report of the main outcomes of the consultations with regard to the

identification of development options, policy needs and investment required improve the

livelihoods of poor fishing communities and the resource base upon which they depend.


1.2 Method

Key Features of Our Approach

A comprehensive framework is to be developed

matching two methods: qualitative and quantitative.

However, there is a need to focus more on PRA, PPP,

in order to facilitate obtaining information from the

communities.

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 22

The three main phases of this small scale

consultation     include:    literature  review,      direct

consultation with fishing communities at local levels

and stakeholder dialogues for sharing and validation of

information at higher level.

· The consultation will be conducted following the

    community      based     and    participatory     approach.

    Participation is highly promoted and exercised during

    the workshop as is grassroots consultation in the

    villages/communities especially the poor fisher folks.

· Benchmarking with non-fishing communities can

    be useful, as can comparing the regions with

    different natural characteristics like inland and

    coastal areas where the fisheries communities are

    earning their living differently.


1.3 Selection of area

Two provinces represent the North (Quang Ninh and Ninh Binh), 1 for the Middle (Ha Tinh) and 2

for the South (Ninh Thuan and Tra Vinh). One representative district is selected for each province

(2 for Ha Tinh) and 2 communes for each province (1 inland and 1 coastal commune) representing

the district features. The selected communes shall ensure the following norms: (i) contain a large

number of poor households; (ii) be diverse in ethnic groups; (iii) have demand and capacity of

economy mechanism shifting with emphasis on aquaculture development; (iv) transparency and

willingness of the local authority; and (v) participation capacity and commitment fulfilment of the

local people (community). Selection of commune for survey is as follows:

1. 4 The stakeholders



Consultation with stakeholders using a participatory approach: it is intended to engage local

households and communities; local organizations (Fishermen's Associations, Women's Unions,

other NGOs, etc); local government departments (DOFI, MPI, PPCs, etc.); credit institutions
(VBARD and VBSP), and the Ministry of Fisheries. Current Government instruments6 allocate

specific responsibilities to local governments with regard to the management of fisheries, coastal

and inland waters, aquaculture development, and the establishment of protected areas. The team

would pay particular attention to the participation of poor women and ethnic minorities in fishing

communities.

Chapter 2: Findings from the communities



2. The coastal and inland water areas characteristics in Vietnam


2.1 General about coastal areas

The coastal areas in Vietnam comprise of 28/64 towns and cities directly under central government,

14 cities under provincial government, 28 towns, 273 suburban districts, 38 urban districts, 68

wards, 243 towns and 4.134 communes. The total area, including 28 provinces, is appropriated 41%

of Vietnam. Details as follows: (i) 5 North provinces (Quanh Ninh, Hai Phong, Thai Binh, Nam

Dinh, Ninh Binh); (ii) 6 North central part provinces (Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh,

Quang Tri, Thua Thirn Hue); (iii) 8 South central part procinces (Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang

Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan, Binh Thuan; (iv) 2 South-East provinces (Ba

Ria - Vung Tau, Ho Chi Minh city;(v) 7 South-West provinces (Cuu Long river delta ­ Ben Tre,

Tien Giang, Tra Vinh, Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, Kien Giang)


2.2. Poverty:

The Main Causes (from the poor fishing communities' perspectives)


High population causes poverty: The coastal area has high population growth, both in terms of

natural growth (particularly in fishing communities) and mechanical growth (mainly in fast

developed industries and services areas). The coastal area has a large scale population with high
density, 369 persons/ km2 medium. However, there has been an unequitable allocation in provinces
and cities. From Hai Phong to Ninh Binh, average population density (2001) is 981person/km2.
Meanwhile from Thanh Hoa to Thua Thien Hue this density is only 198 person /km2. In the area of
Cuu Long river delta, this figure is 577 persons /Km2. In other areas such as Hai Hau (Nam Dinh)
which has high popualtion density, about 1.221 person/km2


Absence of employment opportunities is widespread in the coastal area, causing poverty: Access to

farming land per head is low but agriculture still constitutes the largest scale of employment. The

number of employment in industries and services is still limited, except in cities. Increasing

urbanisation and new tourist sites in the coastal area are factors leading to resettlement and

reallocation of employment between urban and rural areas. Women's employment accounts for

50% of total employment and they tend to be involved in heavy, labor intensive work such as



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 26

planting rice, harvesting aquaculture or processing and small businesses (although this area has

large potential in the development of tourism and industry).


Other reasons for high incidence of poverty include sole dependence on agriculture, unfavorable

natural conditions, and slow economic development more generally. There are constraints in

opportunities for diversification of livelihoods.

Poverty is significantly higher in rural areas and in particular among ethnic minority groups. In the

selected province, there was a relatively high representation of ethnic minority groups which

allowed the team to gather data and understand the poverty issues of this group. In Tra Vinh

province, which has quite a large number of Khmer communities (the percentage of Khmer

households accounted for about 32% of the total households of the province but the number of the

Khmer poor households accounted for 38.8%), poverty is intimately linked to the longstanding

customs and maintenance of traditional livelihoods; incomes remain low from agricultural

livelihoods (cultivation and animal raising). The extent of poverty is reflected in the shortage of

lands for production and land tenure. (According to the provincial officials in Tra Vinh figures on

poor Khmer groups from August 2004 show 12,348 households without land for production, and
1,427 households have only under 1,000m2 production land, 4,508 households have 1,000 ­ 3,000
m2 production land)

Poverty is also prevalent among women. Consultation with women groups in fishing communities

allowed the team to capture the causes of poverty including (i) Women's lack of skills (ii) women

have livelihoods as well as childcare responsibilities (iii) women's education level is low (iv)

women have more difficulty than their male counterparts in accessing paid employment

opportunities. More specifically, the illiteracy rate among women is still high; hence women lack

production knowledge and have difficulties in accessing information useful for their livelihoods.

Degradation of environment and resources constrain the incomes of the poor significantly since

their livelihoods are dependent on natural resources: Near shore fishing used to be the main

livelihood and over exploitation of these marine resources has exhausted the potential of this form

of livelihood. This situation has also caused other problems such as difficulties in obtaining a fresh

water supply, downgrading the environment and misusing land (like case of Ninh Thuan).

Aquaculture production without proper zoning has been a serious problem.

    Box 2.1 Causes of poverty in Tra Vinh

· The location with interlaced rivers and streams systems but limited transportation links causing

    low economic dynamics

· most farming lands are infected by virtual salt causing low yields yet the people mainly depend

    on agriculture

· Lack of infrastructure

· Natural calamity and diseases causing bad harvests and losses in many years.

· Commodity market supply (outputs and inputs) are generally unstable, which causes losses for

    agricultural and aquatic products

· High population growth rate exacerbates unemployment and there is a shortage of stable

    employment, unskilled employment appropriates 90% of total labor resources

· The poor still have difficulties in accessing resources, particularly credit. They have to use

    external credit facilities (money lenders) with high interest rates

· Low education levels; lack of knowledge, production experiences and information;

    reliance on traditional or customary livelihoods which are highly unproductive are the

    poor's constraints


2.3 Coastal resources: situation analysis and utilization


2.3.1 Natural resources in the selected coastal areas



- Estuary: There are over 50 estuaries along the coast. The estuary area is strongly developed

economically, in terms of fishing and seafood processing, business, transportation and urbanization.

However, the development of this area at present is not really sustainable in terms of economic

returns due to lack of proper zoning and lack of ports (including fish ports and trade ports).

Environmental degradation in this area is remarkably high. This is evident in polluted surface and

ground water resources due to the vast and uncontrolled production activities. Swamp and flooded

water areas predominate along the lagoon and extensive tidal zone along the coast, estuary and

surrounding islands.


- Land availability: Land in this coastal area is always assigned for farming, planting, and

aquaculture, urban and industrial development. The downs and low-lying salt-marshes are two

special resources with high attention in the coastal area that would bring future economic returns.

Land resources are open for inland (fresh water) aquaculture.




Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 28

- Landscape for tourism: The coastal area has potential for developing tourism with beautiful sand-

banks and clean water. While industries and services are under developed, there is potential for

establishing small-scale trading and tourism businesses in these areas.


- Marine resources: There are a lot of natural resources in the sea and coastal areas such as: fish

(2.000 kinds of fish species, ecology system, coral reefs and mineral resources. In the sea and the

coastal area, resources are open for in-shore aquaculture, brackish water aquaculture or off-shore

fishery.


2.3.2 How do the poor fishing communities use the coastal resources?

Group discussions in all provinces showed that the poor are constrained in accessing resources for

aquaculture livelihoods for poor people

· Offshore catching: this requires large-scale investment in vessels and equipments, as well as

    technical capacity, and has high risks due to hazards so it is not suitable for the poor.

· Near-shore catching: the poor can still have small boats and facilities for near-shore fishing.

    However, exploitation of this resource is not encouraged (pursuant to Fishery Law by the

    government). The fisherfolks are still using destructive catching methods in near-shore fishing,

    causing serious environmental damages

· Near-shore aquaculture resource for aquaculture production and processing: poor households

    cannot access the water because they do not have ownership of the water surface (which

    belongs to the state owned company, is open at prohibitively high price bidding, or under

    management of the provincial authority).

· For inland (fresh water) production or fish farming, the poor communities use their land that

    has been converted to ponds or lagoon (Ha Tinh, Ninh Binh, Quang Ninh), the shifting of low-

    efficiency agriculture land into aquaculture area is also a good approach which can help poor

    people to move out of poverty. But in many cases, the poor have little land or no land tenure or

    land belong to the better-off (Tra Vinh, Ninh Thuan) which causes paid employment to become

    the poor's livelihoods. However, research in the surveyed areas reveals that poor people cannot

    shift to aquaculture now as they do not have sufficient initial capital. In the surveyed

    communes, only normal or wealthy households can invest in aquaculture. However, the fishing

    communities are involved in aquaculture on a household scale with severely limited farming

    skills. The support facility to enable effective use of these inland resources includes a solid

    irrigation and drainage channel system to supply sufficient water for aquaculture.



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 29

· The coastline area (for brackish water fishing) seems available for the poor. However, the poor

    benefit less from this and are left with more difficulties since some of these areas are prone to

    flooding (Quang Ninh), have a poor inlet- outlet system (Ninh Binh), are inside the dikes

    (Quang Ninh), or are over-salinated (Tra Vinh, Ninh Binh) which creates significant difficulties

    for livelihoods due to high investment risks and high possibility of diseases.

However, there are advantages of diversified resources for livelihood which have been shown quite

clearly through the consultation. The poor fisherfolks use natural coastal areas (tidal areas outside

the dike) for fishing and molluse raising and low fertile inland area or area inside the dike for

aquaculture/fresh water fish farming and brackish fish raising. The poor communities consider

near-shore fishing and catching as a good livelihood since it is "easy and does not need much

investment and it creates work in agricultural idle time". The poor can earn stable incomes from

this method. The table below from Ha Tinh province shows that the resources are not fully utilized

for the poor's livelihood options. The poor fishing communities mostly use marine resources for

food security, not yet for income generation.

The marine resources, based on various geographic conditions, may create diversified livelihoods

which differentiate groups of beneficiaries. The diagram below from Ninh Binh province illustrates

the relation between resources and fisherman livelihoods as one example. It shows that most of the

poor can only use item 4 and item 5: i.e. marsh land (salted land) for fresh water or brackish

fishery. The feedback shows they met many difficulties in dealing with salted soil (can not grow

crops any more since land has converted to ponds); and flooding and improper sea water flow

which cause losses for brackish species like shrimp or crabs.

Natural disaster/calamity risk: Unpredictability of natural phenomena such as quality and

quantity, frequency of fresh water flow; the volume and the length of storms; speed and scale of

natural processes; for example eroding and rising sea-levels, ecological performance, subsidence

and running height of land, changes in climate and long-term effects to coastal ecology and

activities of the people in general management area in the sea and the coastal area.



Environment degradation and water pollution: Marine environment and resources are being

damaged due to current exploitation. Development of any fisheries livelihoods should take into

consideration sustainability issues, such as waste pollution to the water source. The poor fishing

communities think that "investment into aquaculture should not take into consideration the benefit

in 5 years but longer than that", while other (Ha Tinh) people still continue to damage the

environemnt though already acknowledge the risk.



There is increasing concern about the environmental effects of shrimp farming. Extensive

cultivation has little the impact on the environment due to the small scale of production. Shrimpers

are being encouraged by the government to restructure and reclaim land. Intensive cultivation, due

to water resources needed and large quantities of waste, may cause environmental pollution (Ninh

Thuan has a shortage of underground water for sand shrimp raising. People here often use

underground water to meet their living and livelihood demands. This causes over exploitation of

underground water, so that the water level is lower and its quality is gradually decreased. Also, in

Ninh Binh water is polluted due to lack of infrastructure for inputs and outputs flows, in Tra Vinh

and Ninh Binh the concern is salted soil). In order to achieve sustainable growth of the shrimp

industry, comprehensive planning and sound mechanisms are required to safeguard the

environment. Big investments are needed in terms of capital and technology for environmental

safeguards as well such as waste treatment on shrimp farms, irrigation systems and management. It

is therefore the responsibility of local authorities to have master plans for land and environmental

management to limit unplanned reclamation and over-exploitation of natural resources while

promoting economic growth through shrimp raising. In the dry season, there is a lack of fresh water

due to erosion of salt water into mainland; back water flow from cultivation areas but lack of proper

irrigation causes aquatic environment pollution.


Run out of near-shore species due to over exploitation: The over exploitation can cause

difficulties for fishermen. Their daily food sources from near shore catching are running out.

Destructive fishing methods such as using poison and explosives threaten the lives of 85% of

species and coral reef and also damage the biological diversity of mineral resources and fish

species. Local seeds become disappear.


The following box provides a case study which illuminates the risks faced by the poor fisherfolks



  Box 2.2 : everyone says that prawn and crab farming bring big benefits, but would anybody

  become rich? Instead, they become poorer

  Both discussions (with two groups) in Village 1, Kim Dong commune reveal same reason for

  their poverty: their prawn, crab lagoon. Just 2 years ago, these farmers still grew rice, only

  some households prepared lagoon for aquaculture. From the latest crop, the whole commune

  got rid of rice and shifted to crab and prawn farming. The water drained inside channel is no

  longer fresh water but brackish water. Consequently, many households that have participated in

  aquaculture farming course had to shift their field into lagoon, ponds.

  The reason is not clear: due to bad varieties or bad farming (they are not sure of both), prawn

  and crab suffer from diseases and die. The local people here face the possiblity of the next

  continuous crop failure.

  Due to huge investment using large loans without getting back capital, these households suffer

  from huge debts. They said "if we had continued rice crop, we would have had plenty of rice in

  our house. However, now we can't get any crab or prawn and have to worry for rice day by

  day".

  Now the fields have been turned into lagoon. They have to depend on that. If this crop is a

  failure, they will lose all their investment and their poverty exacerbated "crab go to the bank,

  my mother do not have any area for rice cultivation".

2.3.3 Risks: Mitigation Measures

Among many mitigation measures, the poor fisherman suggested the following:

· Invest in a solid channel system (input and outputs) or water storage system for drought season

    (short and medium terms) if raising aquaculture.

· Support by "needs based" R&D for diseases and breeding and a nursery to help the poor

    fisherfolks to cope up with diseases.

· Encourage and support local initiatives to raise community awareness about the environment

    and complementary livelihoods (e.g. mangrove reforestation; rush/sedge, one fish ­ one crab);

· Improve the reservoir to ensure sufficient fresh water (in some provinces).

Chapter 3: Livelihoods opportunities for fishing communities



3.1 Traditional livelihoods: Current situation, constraints and opportunities


In general, people are doing diversification of livelihoods in coastal areas, and most of which are

dependent on the natural resources. In assessing livelihoods in all selected areas and consulted

communities, some factors for assessment and consultation include the (i) economic benefit

(income generation for the poor), (ii) sustainability (pollution) of the environment, (iii) the

availability of assistance (by the State, local government, financial assistance, technique, etc.) An

overview of traditional livelihoods in consulted communities is provided for each province.


a) Quang Ninh:


The different natural characteristics of the areas (including both inland and coastal areas in two

communes Duong Hao ­ inland and Quang Dien - coastal), there are a total of 17 livelihoods,

namely: (1) Wet rice, auxiliary crop, (ii) Cattle keeping, (iii) Coastal fishing, (iv) Vendoring, (v)

Seasonal hired labour, (vi) Fresh water aquaculture, (vii) Natural aquaculture, (viii) Clam, shell and

molluse farming (ix) Collecting firewood, (x) Afforestation, (xi) Farming vegetables, (xii) Tea

plantation, (xiii) Raft aquaculture, (xiv) Shrimp farming, (xv) Handicraft, (xvi) Mining, (xvii)

Production of building materials.


1st Rank: Among all, the communities ranked fresh water aquaculture with the highest points. Even

though fresh water aquaculture development is spontaneous and on a small scale, many of the poor

households do not have access to sufficient capital. However, in the future poor communities put

the fresh water aquaculture as the top priority livelihood, because it would bring sustainable income

to overcome poverty especially while land becomes less productive for traditional agriculture

production to generate income. There are several major advantages in fresh water aquaculture In

fact, the present models prove that fresh water aquaculture has an income of 4 ­ 5 times higher than

wet rice cultivation. Also, fresh water aquaculture would have a minimal affect on the environment.

However, difficulties related to aquaculture livelihoods are seen in utilization of good sources of

food/inputs, and the input costs have been increasingly high.




Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 35

In some coastal areas, the fishery communities gave high attention to clam, shell and molluse

farming. This kind of livelihood does not require large investment in facilities but only in seedlings;

hence it is highly favorable for the poor owing to the utilization of available sources of feed.

However, similar to the fresh water aquaculture, without assistance in credit or capital or good

seedling/nursery, this model seems still difficult for the poor.


2nd rank: Wet rice and auxiliary crops remained the traditional livelihood in these communities.

However, due to the unfavorable conditions (dependent water supply, high input costs) as well as

low productivity due to soil degradation these livelihoods are only sufficient for family food

consumption.


3rd rank: Cattle farming is an alternative traditional livelihood. However, the poor said that they

lack capital and knowledge in buying breeds and preventing diseases.


4th rank: The near-shore coastal fishing gains highest points over creating income and creating jobs

for lots of people but there was high environmental concerns due to uncontrollable, unplanned and

unmanaged exploitation causing threat of depletion of resources, therefore this livelihood in its

current form is not so highly appreciated. In spite of this shrimp farming and raft aquaculture would

create high incomes, but it is unsuitable for the poor due to the high investment and good

technology.


Amongst others, the poor are doing hired labour that brings about regular income but still is

unstable in terms of job demand. However it remains the choice of lots of households, especially

the poor ones with limited resources like land and capital.


b) Ninh Thun


The selected areas are both coastal communes (Phuoc Dinh and Phuoc Diem) and they have many

in common. However, through the consultation it was possible to distinguish the difference in

livelihood between men and women for two communes. The people consulted focused on

opportunity for income generation. Findings reflected that the poor people with no land or capital

always go for hired labor and catching the natural species in the sea shore for livelihoods. The

opportunities will be open for women and men if they have capital, they can do some

complimentary businesses to fisheries like producing fish sauces, and seaweed drying (post-

land and capital. The following table helps to see livelihoods by groups in detail.

c) Ha Tnh


The selected consulted areas are two districts: Thach Ha (Thach Hai and Tuong Son Communes),

and Can Loc (Thinh Loc and Vuong Loc Communes). In Can Loc district, Thinh Loc commune:

Livelihoods vary from agriculture, seafood fishing, making herbal medicine, or working out as

hired labor in other provinces. A small number of well-off people choose to work overseas. While

in Vuong Loc commune, a low land area, agriculture is the main source of income of the

households (80%). Handicrafts and trade account for a very small amount (only 4.8% and 15.2%

respectively). Livelihoods in the table below show that the poor ranked highest the coastal fishing.

90% of households living in coastal areas are doing this livelihood since it is "easy going" and

provides a relatively high income. However, 100% of households still do agriculture. This means

that agriculture and coastal fishing are the two main livelihoods to ensure the income and food

security for the poor. In the low land and land locked areas like Can Loc, aquaculture seems not yet

be attractive to the poor because there is still lack of capital, high price of bidding land for lagoon,

and lack of market for the products.

The poor need to have a way out of the poverty, from their traditional livelihoods. The poor are

facing many difficulties that constrain them from large scale and sustainable livelihoods. Most of

the poor consulted mentioned the lack of investment. They still cannot access the credit facilities,

which are supposed to be available by the official banking system like Policy Bank (VBARD) at all

levels. The inputs and output factors like seeds, technical know-how and market access respectively

represent frequent difficulties. The poor would need concrete support to mitigate any possible risk

like losses due to disasters or poor quality of seeds or lack of knowledge of production. They would

need to receive training, capital and especially infrastructure which require big investment from the

local government. The table below describes difficulties and measures by each category of

livelihood.

d) Trà Vinh

In Tra vinh, poverty incidence has been high in consulted communities especially among the ethnic

minorities. Also the poor face difficulties in doing their traditional livelihoods like rice growing,

vegetable growing or animal husbandry (pigs, cows). The consultation allows us to see that the

traditional livelihoods are becoming less important, as they are not creating high incomes and jobs

in the area. Poor fisherfolks still lack jobs during low seasons. And for traditional livelihoods, the

most difficulties are (1) lack of funds for production, (2) no skill and (3) no land for production.

The communities said that the poor who have no land can raise cows (pig and fowls) and offer

hired labour. People remain in poverty also for other reasons like low educational level. (Refer to

box 2.1)

The poor fishermen in Hiep My Dong and My Long Nam communes found the shrimp farming

attractive as a way out of poverty as this livelihood has created high incomes and employment

opportunities for them. However, the poor fishing communities here have recognized that they need

to diversify their livelihoods, in both large and small scale. However, they should have their own

land and equipment. Those who have little land can: (i) Cultivate rice - auxiliary crops + Raise

cattle and (ii) Cultivate auxiliary drops + Offer hired labour. Current cow raising for the poor is

being used. Some people can pursue a combination of livelihoods in order to escape from poverty

such as offering hired labour (practicing thrift) -> to purchase pigs and cows -> To purchase land ->

To cultivate rice/auxiliary crops/shrimp


    Box 2.3. Poverty- exit experiences from the women in Cai Gia Ben village­ Hiep
    My Dong
    Ms Ngo Thi Lien's family has 5 members, with three small children so there are only
    two labourers. Before 2001, they had only 0,5 `sao' land plot for vegetable cultivating.
    They lived on hiring their labor to other well-off people. However, they had enough food
    for six months of the year, and were hungry for the remainder. In 2001, they borrowed 3
    million Dong to buy a cow; after 12 months, it delivered a baby buffalo and so they
    could sell it for 2,5 million VND. They invested this money in production. In 2004, they
    sold both mother cow and calf with for a price of 8 million VND to pay their debt,
    redeemed a land plot mortgage (1,5 million dong), dug a water well and bought
    equipment to irrgate (2 million VND). Rice cultivation could then give them an average
    of 500 ­ 700.000VND/month. The family started a fish and shrimp pond in their 1 land
    plot )



e) Ninh Bình

In Ninh Binh, the local people are involved in all kinds of livelihoods, as a typical Red River Delta

area, ranging from rice growing, cattle (pork, buffalo, cow) and poultry raising, and handicraft.
Rice and sedge cultivating7 is followed by handicraft. Making use of the labour in the leisure time

after harvested crop and the available source of materials, the people of Kim Son manufacture

many handicraft products such as sedge mat, sedge sandals, sedge bags. Although this is not the key

production but working in the handicraft trade plays an important role in handling the redundant

source of labour and bringing a regular income for the people of Kim Son. The area has had

favourable natural conditions for agricultural production for long time because of the rich fertile

land of the estuaries. However, Kim Son area are facing the difficulties because of downgraded

environment (polluted water, increasing salt level in soil), which impacts much on the main

livelihoods such as rice cultivating, aquaculture raising.

Brackish aqualculture seem to attract quite a few number of people (table 2.6), including the poor.

However, water pollution because of a lack of inlet and outlet system became the big problem.

Brackish aquaculture requires large volume of fresh water to regulate the salt levels, but it is also

difficult for other poor people who are doing their traditional agricutural livelihoods like rice

growing because the salt water used for aquaculture seeps into the field and contaminates the soil

for crops. The trend for aquaculture raising is also growing very fast. The people of Kim Son have

an saying, "Nowadays, rice-fish enroach sedge ponds enroach aegiceras, aegiceras enroach the

sea".

3.2 Alternative livelihoods for poor fisheries communities

The poor fishing communities are also involved in some other activities related to fishing and

aquaculture besides their traditional livelihoods. Among other kinds of alternative livelihoods

considered now as a way of moving out of poverty are: fresh water fish, combined fish-rice,

molluse and oyster or seaweed raising. It seems that the people already recognized the bad effect of

natural resource exploitation through some kinds of livelihoods like brackish shrimp raising, hence

this livelihood does not rank high. The poor do not also prefer near shore fishing. Instead, the

combination of livelihoods seems to be the selection. There is always one alternative for the people

to take advantage of the natural resource and to minimize investment, given some shortage of

capital. For these alternative livelihoods, some selection will be elaborated further in section 3.3 ­

the priority by the fishing communities.

· In Quang Ninh, although the traditional livelihoods also bring income, due to unfavorable

    production conditions the people have been moving to more fishing farming or cattle farming.

    The coastal fishery like molluse raising attracts the poor people.

· In Ninh Thun: Cattle farming livelihood (sheep, cow, goats and pig) is seen like good

    alternative to traditional rice growing. However, with the reason for diversification, the people

    started to do some seaweed raising (also in cage) as with relatively reasonable investment. Fish

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 43

    sauce production is ranked the 3rd livelihood alternative. In some village like Phuoc Diem fish

    sauce production has been a tradition livelihood. Fish sauce is currently the livelihood of rich

    households. However, poor households still have approach if they receive proper initial capital

    assistance. Although some other livelihoods such as near coastal catching (fish, prawn) bring

    good income for poor people, they are not sustainable. The Fishery law prohibits exploitation of

    coastal resources.

· In Ha Tinh, the choices of alternative are quite similar to Ninh Thuan, with prefered

    Aquaculture, especially fresh water farming and fish-rice combination. Cattle keeping and

    aquatic products processing are helping the poor out of poverty. Aquatic resources for

    livelihoods like near-shore catching, natural fish catching, inland molluse farming and rice-fish

    combination models are extremely important livelihoods for poor households as they only

    require small investment but generate high income.

· In Tra Vinh, although there is new but good choice: oyster raising, a combination alterative

    like crab in mangrove is in pilot. This means of livelihood both uses and protects natural

    resources. See further table 3.7

· In Ninh Binh, with the risk of environmental degradation and the loss of productivity in

    brackish aquaculture, people tended to move to fresh water aquaculture for alternatives. This

    fresh water aquaculture can still be combined with other agricultural livelihoods like 1 rice-1

    fish. This way reduces risks and diversifies incomes for the poor.

(**)Thach Hai commune is the coastal commune but some villages are located by the beach. Some villages

are located as inland coastal and not close to the sea. The inline coastal areas have a river and a lake, so the

freshwater to be selected as potential livelihood.



a) Quang Ninh:

· Fresh water aquaculture livelihood (fish raising) can be considered one among the best choices

    under the current conditions of 2 selected communes (Duong Hoa and Quang Dien) is

    considered as `livelihood for the future' if proper assistance (knowledge transfer, quality of

    seed, capital) is provided.

· Raising species like oyster, molluse in the coastal commune (Quang Dien) is also desired by the

    poor fishing communities. This livelihood does not require big investment in seed and

    infrastructure. Therefore it is quite convenient for the poor people. If capital assistance for

    varieties procurement is provided, this model can be developed by the poor people.

· Cage shrimp and fish farming bring about relatively high income. However, as this type needs

    large investment and advanced technology, for the time being, poor fisherfolks do not consider

    it very suitable for their current situation.


b) Ninh Thun:

· Aquaculture is the best livelihood choice for fisherman communities, especially poor people in

    the future. Aquaculture of algae (rong sun): grows to be a good choice in both two surveyed

    communes. However, its constraint in farming cartilage algae is the risk of climatic conditions

    (wind, storm and being food of the fishes). These risks can be limited by applying cage farming

    techniques.

· Cage fish, shrimp keeping: this livelihood also brings about high income for the fisherman

    community. In the long run, this livelihood can take advantage of the natural potentials of the

    coastal area. However, this livelihood requires large investment and modern technology. As

    such, it is not suitable for poor people at the moment.

· Shrimp varieties/ nursery raising generates very high income but only for the richer fisherman

    groups. The poor fishing community can not do this livelihood.


c) Hà Tnh

In the coastal area of Ha Tinh (Thach Ha district) the choice of fish ­rice and fress water fishing as

1st livelihood for income generation and sustainability was also the dominant view of those

consulted. The priority for inland is fresh water fishing and in-field fishing farming. However, the
Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 49

constraints encountered by people are: weather (flood), high temperature, lack of capital, varieties,

accessing markets for products, techniques ­ practice, shortage of capital for lagoon improvement,

techniques, varieties, output (market information), drainage and intake system.

As such, to improve productivity and economic efficiency, the local people have prioritized their

needs in the following order:

· Construction of intake channel (1)

· Inter-hamlet roads (2)

· Establishment of typical aquaculture area (3)

· Techniques for cattle farming and aquaculture (4)

· Capital aids (5)

· Construction of sea-water prevention dike (6)

· Varieties (7)\

· Loan provision (3)

d) Trà Vinh

Aquaculture is not the first livelihood choice of poor people in the selected poor communities in

Tra Vinh. "One rice ­ one shrimp" becomes the 1st priority in coastal areas. Those living in the

coastal area also want to integrate aquaculture and agricultural livelihoods. Some shrimp raising

models although they bring high incomes are not the `1st priority because they require considerable

investment and advanced techniques and also carry greater risks. According to the poor people's

viewpoint, their capability in development of oyster raising, a model considered to be suitable for

the poor, is also limited. The challenges mentioned are: (i) Shortage of capital for varieties, food,

(ii) lack of infrastructure for farming on offshore warp (iii) Poor fisherman can not afford to pay a

protection fee and (iv) risk easily occurs.

e) Ninh Binh:

Since the beginning of use of coastal alluvial warp in 2001 up till now, the aqualcuture area has

been increasing continuously. Increasingly, all people in Kim Dong commune, a commune located

in between dikes (Binh Minh 1 and Binh Minh 2), have abandoned rice land plots to shift to
brackish water aquaculture ponds, which were ranked the 1st priorty in coastal areas. In inland area,
the combination of rice ­ fish is the 1st priority. In Ninh Binh, the combination of livelihoods

(aquaculture ­ agriculture) seems to be the best choice to benefit from natural resources and also

income generation must go with food security. However, the difficulties for communities in Kim

Son distric of Ninh Binh to develop aquaculture livelihoods are reflected, including;

· No zoning in development of ponds and lagoons together with lack of inlet and outlet system

    that creates epidemic deseases due to unhygienic conditions

· Poor quality of variety/seed because there is no extension and quality control by the local

    government extension system, while there are no nursery producing stations in local area.

· Lack of technology, knowhow and knowledge

· Aquaculture needs bigger investment than common practice of rice crops or other crops while

    poor households do not have access to credit assistance from the banks.


3.4 Livelihood model for the poor fishing communities with investment

needs

The model and recommendations from the poor fishing communities will be described by each

province. As mentioned, each province can develop the inland (fresh-water) aquaculture as well as

near ­ shore fishing or brackish water aquaculture. This allows the province to diversity the

livelihoods. However, each province, among their priority choice of livelihood, recommends the

most suitable livelihood model for the poor fishing communities in this section together with some

recommendations. In general, the options with low investment are chosen, with a condition of

proper credit scheme, training on know-how and techniques for aquaculture livelihoods and access

to high quality seeds and extension support, as well as proper infrastructure system are among the

most important recommendations.

a) Qung Ninh

Reference to the Master plan for aquaculture development of Hai Ha district for 2006-20108 and

people's and local officers' views.

For inland area: a combination of rice - fresh water fish farming for low-efficiency agricultural

land (inside dike of Duong Hoa and Quang Dien communes) is recommended. Fresh water fish

farming received the highest response from the poor. But poor households lack necessary capital to

apply this model. It is promising because it still does not require big investment, neither does it

create environmental burden.

For coastal area (or near shore), oyster and molluse raising, this is highly recommended by the

poor fishermen because it does not require large investment in infrastructure. Oyster and molluse

aquaculture raising brings high income for fisherman and the coastal natural resources can be

preserved properly and sustainably.

Although fresh water fish farming or near-shore farming like oyster, molluse raising bring much

higher income in comparison with traditional agricultural production, the poor people can not

participate in shifting to this model due to (i) shortage of investment capital (ii) lack of farming

techniques to monitor and prevent epidemic diseases (iii) lack of solid infrastructure system for

aquaculture (dike, dam, sewer, channel, road, electricity), (iv) lack of water in dry season due to

lack of irrigation supply system. Water shortage occurs in 3 months in place with soil channel, thus,

local people have to sell immature fish.

The recommendations from the poor fishing communities on their existing problems include;

    1. Provide credits for household groups for a period of 2 years, loan amount 25-35

        million/household with favorable interest

    2. Provide assistance for establishment of fresh water fish varieties production (following the

        province's fishery master planning)

    3. Provide trainings on fish farming skills, epidemic diseases prevention (including medicine

        cabinet for aquaculture at hamlet level)

    4. Establish the fishery extension network (on aquaculture) at hamlet level

b) Ninh Thuan:

For coastal area: Further development of aquaculture in inland area (like shrimp raising in sand

land) is not encouraged now as it has created many problems including (i) risks due to diseases (ii)

shortage of underground water (iii) big investment

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 53

For inland area: Seaweed is considered 1st priority livelihood (alternative)

From the feedback from the fishing community, as well as the current situation on aquaculture

development, it is recommended that the livelihood for poor fishing communities in inland area

should be promoted. In particular, assistance for demonstration of cage seaweed farming as a pilot

alternative livelihood with small investment for poor fisherfolks is recommended.

The main recommendations for implementation are as follows;

    (i)      reinforcement of management capacity of aquaculture staff at province, district level

             (through training on management skills and techniques),

    (ii)     reinforcement     of    fisherman      community        awareness   on    livelihoods    and

             environment/natural resource management

    (iii)    A form of credit which is suitable to the fisherfolk situation i.e. catching and selling,

             self help group or in the form of cooperative/group credit

However, in order to implement the pilot project or needed in the proposal of the coming project,

further study in a form of real PRA on household poverty and economic structure will be required.

c) Ha Tnh
In coastal area, aquaculture is given the 1st priority: including fresh water fish farming () with a

combination of

    (i)      aquatic catching + aquaculture raising + agriculture + aquatic product processing and/

             or

    (ii)     Agriculture + trees planting (pine, casuarinas, cajuput, etc) in the sandy land by the

             coast.


In inland area, rice-fish combination model is now widely developed as a good alternative with

small investment and low risk.

Nowadays, aquaculture raising is seen to be important as it is reflected that the marine natural

resources have been depleted gradually.

Box.3.2. Comparison of inland aquaculture and off shore coastal fisheries

· Investment level: The investment in livelihood in coastal area is normally higher than the inland

    area. (i.e. ship and vessels, plot making cost is much higher than making ponds and lagoon)

· The interest rate for aquaculture raising (short term) is higher than the fish catching (long term)

· Aquaculture raising in inland area meet less risks by natural disaster (and storms) but meet

    more risks by diseases

· The aquaculture raising attracts more labor than off shore fishing, where both men and women

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 54

    can participate in livelihoods.

· The aquaculture development attract more poor households than the off shore

    catching/exploitation




The development of aquaculture (prawn, fish) will boost the development of various other services

(supply of varieties, food, products consumption, preliminary treatment service). Thus, large

amounts of labour will be needed. However, huge investment is needed for aquaculture (for a 3 ha

lagoon: construction of infrastructure ­ lagoon embankment, water circulation, procurement of

varieties, food... it cost around 250 million VND for extensive farming) whereas high risk is

encountered due to unpredicted climatic conditions and shortage of aquaculture knowledge. A

formation of enterprise or cooperatives for aquatic product processing is also a model that needs

investment and assistance in the future. This livelihood will attract large number of poor female

labour and bring a relatively acceptable income for poor people in the coastal area.

Box 3.3. People in Ha Tinh propose their needs to ensure livelihood in the following priority order

(according to priority order xxx-1):

· Channel construction (1)

· Inter-hamlet road (2)

· Establishment of pilot model for aquaculture (3)

· Cattle breeding and aquaculture techniques (4)

· Loans (5)

· Construction of salty-water prevention dike (6)

· Varieties (7)




d) Ninh Binh:

Diversification of livelihoods and safeguards to enviromental and social sustainability is the choice

for fishing communities in Kim Son district (see table (all households in Kim Son maintain at least

two activities currently). As mentioned previously, each livelihood has its own natural and social

advantages or its own constraint. As almost all of the major livelihoods belong to agriculture and

fishery, non-agricultural activities only constitutes a minor portion, difficulties in production

usually originate from natural and socical conditions. The poor people, however, can get used to

livelihoods that requires negligible investment and depend on labour, such as agricultural and

handicraft activities.
Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 55

The difficulties, among others, encountered by the fishing communities to do the aquaculture

livelihoods include

Aquaculture needs huge investment. The poor can not borrow sufficient funds for the aquaculture

raising (especially shrimp and crab) ­ see box 3.4 and box 3.5

Box 3.4. Costs of one aquacultural model (unit: 1 hectare of lagoon/pond) in Ninh Binh
Lagoon/pond excavation: 10 million VND
Inside-lagoon channel : 1 million VND
Irrigation fee : 180.000 VND
Inside-lagoon channel management and maintenance: 66.000 VND
Varieties : 5 million (prawn), 15 million (crab)
Food : 6 million VND



    · aquaculture requires advanced techniques but the poor fishermen do not have adequate

           knowledge and training.

    · Aquaculture (especially the brackish) encounter numerous risks including the losses due to

           diseaseas and water pollution

    · Poor people can not access to resources such as lagoon land9

  Box 3.5: 1 mm wrong choice, 1mile far to correct

  Mrs Nguyen Thi Gam and family have lived in hamlet 1, Kim Dong commune since 1993

  (decision on commune foundation issued in 1998). On an area of 1.75 ha, they grow 01 rice

  crop, plus breeding and knitting. Although they do not have any savings, production plus some

  income from employment of Mrs Gam's husband is sufficient for the whole family's life.

  At the beginning of 2005, upon hearing that crab and prawn farming would generate high

  income, Mrs Gam's family decided to abandon rice cultivation. With an amount of 4 million

  (loan with interest of 5% in 7 months), they turned 1.75 ha of rice field into lagoon and raised

  prawn. Upon harvest of the 1st crop, and discovering that the amount from prawn sales was

  just sufficient for farming investment plus interest, they shifted to crab farming.

  Investment for crab farming is higher than that for prawn. The Bank for Agriculture and Rural

  Development lent 15 million. Due to loss caused by storms and epidemic deseases, at the end

  of the crop, the number of remaining crabs was quite small, thus, they could not get much

  money and cound not clear the debt with BOARD.

  At present, apart from the said unpaid debt, Mrs Gam's family have difficulty in deciding how



9 the division of coastal plain land into ponds, lagoons unintentionally turns coastal aquatic resources from community
property into private property. All the alluvial warp are under government ownership or army units, local people in Kim Son
are not allowed to carry out catching in this area.

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 56

  to proceed. They do not have capital for further investment in aquaculture. They can not pay

  interest if they get loan from outside. Also it is impossible for them to get another loan from

  the Bank as the current debt has not been cleared. They can not grow rice as before because all

  the field area has been turned into pond which has been contaminated by salty water.

  Transformation needs time and also investment..



In order to implement the livelihood models that are suitable for the poor fishing communities, the

key recommendations from the communities include;

    · Kim Son district needs to prepare a master and detailed plan for each area, together with

        plan for maintenance and development of livelihoods to ensure stability and sustainabiliy of

        livelihoods

    · Diversification of livelihoods which is the combination of aquaculture and agriculture (like

        rice ­ fish model) would be suitable with household's capacity and financial situation

    · Investment in infrastructure is essential to ensure water flows and to reduce water pollution

        in case of raising aquaculture

    · Production of seed is needed locally

    · Training of fish farmers on aquacultural breeding (especially in case of shrimp and crab

        farming)

In Tra Vinh, inshore aquaculture was a key livelihood for the poor fishing communities especially

in the coastal areas though it seemed that the better-off participate more in these livelihoods than

the poor.

- The poor lack capital

- The poor lack technical knowledge, (crop calendar, producing procedures, preventing and

    curing epidemic diseases)

- The poor has less chance to participate in long term projects

HHs contribute monthly guarding fees based on assigned land

The participation of the poor is very limited due to corresponding capitals (monthly they have to

contribute between 50.000- 100.000 VND) is a challenge to poor HHs with unstable incomes.

Groups of agricultural extension are established with voluntary members with high responsibilities

and Group "Determination" model.

Inter-group and inter-village activities have diverse content: technical training, visiting, sharing

experiences, supporting HHs in risk. High self-awareness and discipline ensure usual activities.

The recommendations from the poor fishing communities to overcome their weaknesses and

threats include;

- Diversifying incomes can ensure sustainable poverty riddance for the poor in coastal areas and

     no destroying environment and aquatic resource.

- Access and ownership of land is really a sustainable means for them.

- Poor women themselves need to have their sustainable livelihood activities,

Box ­ Investment needs for Raising Tra and Basa for poor fish farmers in An Giang11


Tra and Basa farming is a traditional livelihood in Mekong Delta and particularly in An Giang

province. In An Giang province, there are now 3,400 catfish cages (2002) on the flowing river and

a water surface of 1,430 ha for catfish ponds. The number of ponds in the province is not high due

to a large amount of land owned by farmers. In An Giang, 80% of households are engaged in

catfish farming, not less than 10,000 people in raising catfish by cage and about 20,000 farmers

provide services for Tra and Basa farming cages, ranging from hired labor on cages and ponds to

working in seafood processing). For the fish farmers in An Giang, the investment cost of rafts

(cage) and some equipment is quite high (over VND 100 mil for 30 tons capacity cage). Usually the

farmers have to mobilize from savings or borrow from bank.                  Other costs include costs of

fingerlings, feeding, labor, and other costs. The farmers can also borrow from the processing and

export company with sale contracts or at very high interest rates from the money lender (2%-3%

per month). Investment in cages is much higher than that in ponds. Though there was good market

for the Tra and Basa products and the companies operating in local areas give purchase orders for

farmers directly, there were still some risks caused by fluctuating prices and the control of private

traders. Although water flows or ventilation has not been a big problem due to the natural flows of

Mekong River, the emerging issues for the catfish farmers may include the preventive and curative

measures together with safety and hygienic standards for export quality level like ISO9001 or

HACCP where the role of local authority may be crucial.

Chapter 4: Role of market and other assistance to poor fishing

community



4.1. Market and its influence over the possibility of diversification of income

for poor

a) Market influence:

· In Quang Ninh (Hai Ha district), both input and output markets are opened for individuals

    without the local authority monitoring and management over quality or the government's role

    in supply of quality material and varieties. Thus, consumption channels and sustainable

    contracts for procurement with processing enterprises have yet not established. Due to

    uncontrolled input market, whereas the government's service system for material and varieties

    supply is ineffective and insufficient, the local people usually have to procure from individual

    agents with uncontrolled quality. It easily causes risks, resulting in loss. The origins of varieties

    for aquaculture are highly diversified. From 2002 on, the number of oyster-farming households

    rapidly increased and oyster varieties source have become limited. Thus, 80% of the

    households have shifted to keeping white oyster with varieties being procured from southern

    provinces and neighbouring provinces such as Nam Dinh and Thai Binh. Garrupa varieties (fish

    in salty and brackish water raised in sewer dike) are procured by local people. They use nets to

    catch those varieties. Prawn varieties is procured from China, the majority of those varieties are

    not subject to quarantine. The province has taken some counter-measures by construction of

    some varieties production farms, but supply cannot meet demand. A variety quality control

    station is located in Mong Cai (border area with China). The output market for aquatic products

    is also diversified, as the local market and Chinese market demand is relatively high and local

    supply is limited (due to low productivity), all the output products are procured by individuals

    on site. Especially, fresh water fish is not enough for local demand. As such, output markets do

    not seem to be a risk for aquaculture farmers here in the near future..

· In Ninh Thuan, the market factor does not cause significant impact on livelihood of community,

    especially for the poor fisherman. Some major livelihoods (mentioned above) are subject to

    market influence, such as seaweed keeping. Up till now, there is almost no problem regarding

    market share and price. However, regarding horn cattle farming livelihood (sheep, cow, goats),

    the market greats affect income. At present cattle farming is widely developed. Sheep, cow and

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 63

    goat farming is considered to be an advantage of Ninh Phuoc. The price is unstable, and many

    households suffer loss due to change of varieties.

· In Ha Tinh, market (both input and output) has significant impact on diversification of people's

    income, especially the aquatic products aquaculture and processing. In Thach Ha district, the

    input market (varieties, food, epidemic disease medicines) and output market (high value

    aquatic products such as green grayfish, frog, and tortoise) are open and controlled by

    individuals. The local authority does not exercise any monitoring over input quality or provide

    any assistance in formation of product consumption channels. The consumption market is not

    yet developed as local people can not afford the product price while yield is not sufficient for

    sell-out but potential for aquatic products is quite huge. In addition, at present, the demand for

    African carp and aquatic products of high value for export is extremely high. There was a

    phenomenon of `redundant for eating but insufficient to sell' for the local people because of a

    lack of markets for the aquaculture products. Nevertheless, the price of each product unit is

    heavily dependant on the price and fluctuation of input materials. As such, the market usually

    plays a decisive role in the efficiency of production in general and production of farmer and

    fisherman in particular.

· In Ninh Binh, factors such as market conditions and prices are often given high attention by

    farmers. Due to the ignorance of market tendencies and farmers just following the season,

    prices for aquaculture tend to fall very low and fluctuate. There is an informal market where

    small traders (located in the commune center) buy back products from farmers who set the

    price. The situation is the same for aquatic input prices such as seeds and aquatic food.

· In Tra vinh, the fishing community revealed that merchants/business men supplied the inputs

    and outputs are often unfavorable towards those who rely on agricultural production, especially

    the unstable price of farm produce and foodstuff, aquatic products means the producers,

    particularly the poor, make a loss. More so than price, the people are concerned about the

    quality of inputs. Hence, they would hope for a supportive system of agriculture, and

    aquaculture at commune or district level to ensure the quality of input price like variety, food,

    materials, fertilizer, technical services and insecticide. The fishing community also recognize

    the role of association/ collective group (perhaps among 3 and 4 fish farmer households; or

    enterprises to get to mutual benefit in bargaining the output price.




Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 64

b) Recommended solutions for market improvement for poor fishing communities:

The poor fishing communities are facing market problems with deterioration of the market

mechanism and the influence of informal market players. They have suggested several solutions as

follows;

· A government logistics service system for fishery in the district and commune in should be

    established in order to ensure quality and maintain stable input prices for varieties, food,

    material, and medicine. However, it is still to encourage individual businesses to extend the

    service network to communes, hamlet to serve local people for price and quality competition.

· The selling mechanism should be flexible to be competitive with individuals (deferred

    procurement, loan).

· The local authority should reinforce their role of supervision, monitoring over quality and price

    of individual logistic services for fisheries.

· Information center in the hamlet on aquaculture knowledge, farming techniques and market

    behavior should be established.

· Farmers should have better links with processing enterprises for output purchasing and even for

    technology and technical assistance.

c)      Financial related measures

One of the critical issues is credit for the poor. The poor fisherfolks have limited access to credit,

both informal and formal channel, which hinders them in their livelihoods. Reasons varied from

procedures and relevance of credit policies by the Bank. Though the Policy Bank has implemented

some more flexible mechanisms for the poor (i.e. no collateral), in fact, few people can lend or

rotate credit because the term and loan size is not really suitable to the fishing livelihoods.

Recommendations related to credit policies are captured, as follows;

- The loan period should be about 2 years (not too short), thus, the local people do not have to

    sell immature fish. Also, the poor should benefit from favourable interest. Loan size could be

    about 25-35 million VND/household, (which is sufficient for 5 ha of fresh water fish farming).

- Credit can also be channeled via mass organizations. The experience from Quang Ninh or Ha

    Tinh (Women Union and OASIS) may be a good case of credit provision to household groups

    so that they can assist each other where community's supervision responsibility is enhanced.

Box 5: Labour for aquaculture lagoon preparation ­ this seemingly easy solution turns out to be

infeasible as the local people are still occupied with daily worries.

Fresh water fish farming only needs initial investment, to cover pond, lagoon excavation, and

preparation. Significant labour is needed for pond embankment for flood prevention. Pond

excavation, and embankment cost is 5-7 million /sao (=350m2), the average area of each

households is 5 sao, thus total required investment adds up to 25-35 million. Labour has to be hired,

and labour circulation can not be exercised as all households are busy with daily life.

(opinion of men in village 5, Duong Hoa commune, Hai Ha district)




4.2 The Government and local authority's related policies:

In general, the Government has implemented some policies. Fishery Law was introduced in 2005.

However, at the local level, the policies need to have schemes in order to be implemented properly.

The poor need some policies to assist them to overcome many constraints (like lack of assistance

for fishery encouragement: supply of technical-scientific knowledge of farming, epidemic diseases,

aquatic products catching, unavailability of typical models, shortage of information on varieties

market, food, output markets) A number of synchronous assistance mechanism and policies need to

be developed, in order to minimize risk for people taking part in aquaculture.

In Quang Ninh for example, although the province and district authority has introduced proper

policy to shift low-efficiency agricultural land to aquaculture, they have not issued attached

supporting policies and mechanism, such as investment for infrastructure (construction of solid

dike, sewer, channel, traffic roads and electricity), credit assistance, technical training (conduct

more practice and increase the number of typical models), dispatching of more aquaculture staff to

locality, construction of convenient logistic service system (varieties farm, varieties quality control

center, material ­ food ­ diseases prevention and curing medicine supply service, products

collection, processing units). Assistance from donor and other organizations is also limited. Only

the SUMA project (through Ministry of Fishery) has assisted the district (Hai Ha district) in

development of plan for salty and brackish water aquaculture in 2006-2010 period and provided

some training courses on aquaculture skills (with emphasis on theory) through Women's Union and

Province Agriculture Encouragement Center.

In other case like Ha Tinh, both districts reflected lack of assistance from the local authority on

aquaculture though there was some external assistance from SUMA. The province and district's

policy of shifting the low-efficiency agricultural land to aquaculture is quite sound and suitable

with local people's wishes. However, despite encouragement policy and detailed mechanism,
Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 66

policy has not been developed (lack of assistance for fishery encouragement: supply of technical-

scientific knowledge on farming, epidemic diseases, aquatic products catching, unavailability of

typical model, shortage of information on varieties market, food, output market). Both communes

have not received loans from overseas organizations or from the fishery industry, apart from loans

from Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, Bank for Policy. Can Loc district has also not

received any assistance from organizations for poor people in the aquaculture development process

(catching, farming, processing):

The key recommendations from the poor fishing communities regarding support from government

and local authorities include;

- To combine capital sources, focus on solid construction, synchronous upgrade of infrastructure

    of aquaculture development (dike, sewer, channel, road, electricity). Inter-commune irrigation

    system should be constructed. Once the active irrigation and drainage system is constructed,

    efficiency can be enhanced and risk in aquaculture is reduced.

- To establish varieties production centers and varieties control center for districts and hamlets.

- To provide more training on aquaculture, with emphasis on practice and establishment of pilot

    models.

- To dispatch aquaculture staff to local areas. To establish aquaculture encouragement staff

    network down to hamlet level (hamlet chairman or experienced person, selected by local

    people).

- To reinforce development of processing stations under combination model to take advantage of

    capital and skills from partners (like the medusa processing model in Cai Chien island).

- To develop aquaculture risk insurance policy

- In addition, it is necessary to set up hydrography and meteorology observation system to be

    aware of the climatic conditions in order to give timely warnings to coastal farmers, minimize

    risks for aquaculture households, especially farming areas in tide plain and coastal area.

Chapter 5: Recommended Strategy to support poor fishing

community


This chapter generally comes up from the research team, capturing the experience and current good

practices in Vietnam and other countries, experience from assistance of international donors to

address the issues identified through the consultation. The chapter also tries to link with key

recommendations to work out an strategic approach that may help the poor fishing communities on

their livelihood development, resource utilization and enhanced support institutions in the future.


1. Institutional development:

Although associations and farmer groups may vary in size, services and financial basis, some

common features can be found (Fig. 1). The first step would be to cluster farmers' in self-

management groups according to geographic location within the commune, species farmed, and/ or

farming system. The second step would seek the way to establish a legal Fishery or Aquaculture

Association (FA and AA) at commune level with its own charter and which would represent the

several farmers' groups. Such FA & AA would then be registered with and work under the local

district or provincial VINAFIS (nationwide association of fisherfolk and fish farmers with a new

charter), and would facilitate the link with CPC, DOFI and/ or DARD.

Lessons learnt from SUMA project show that the organization of local user groups have several

advantages, both economically and at household level but is also expected to pave the way for

improved methods of implementing management forms with a higher inclusion of the user groups.

The financial sustainability of such organizations would be assured by fostering the establishment of

One-stop Aquaculture Supplies & Information Shops (OASIS) focal points at village level and/ or

nested within the FA or AA (Fig. 1 and 2).

OASIS can be defined as business oriented and self-financing small centers which get economic

benefits from commission on input sales to farmers and/ or on marketing farmers' produce. Within

a village they usually are located in small shops and are run by entrepreneurial farmers. They also

provide the contact point whereby trained and non-trained farmers could gather together to

exchange information while relaxing after a working day. OASIS could provide information as to

where quality seed can be bought (contacts with hatcheries and traders), extension material from

DOFI, DARD and the private sectors, and host training courses for farmers. Extensionists could

organize weekly meetings where answers to specific problems raised by farmers would be

provided. If equipped with computers and access to internet, OASIS could link to domestic and

international markets and provide key information to farmers' group and FA & AA which could co-

ordinate produce harvest and sell it directly to processing plants thus by-passing intermediaries and

getting a fairer price.

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 69

Experience from India, Bangladesh and from Vietnam, show that OASIS are a sustainable source of

information and inputs at the village level, are cost effective and sustainable as they are self

financing. SUMA experience shows that the FA and AA formed in the 4 locations have been very

varied in terms of service to their members (Box 2). Nevertheless the overall experience with FA &

AA and OASIS has been positive and it is envisaged that in the future with improved links to

VINAFIS, a product certification and disease early warning systems in place, these mechanisms will

be increasingly more successful.



 Box 4.1 : OASIS in Quang Ninh province

 In Hai Lang commune, Tien Yen District, Quang Ninh province, SUMA has been instrumental to poverty

 reduction through aquaculture: in 2005 out of 947 households in the commune, 388 (41%) were involved in

 aquaculture compared with 186 (22.2%) in 2001. All 388 farmers were clustered in groups and four OASIS,

 one in each of Thanh Hai, Hai Thai, Doi May and Trang Tien villages were established following a

 participatory consultation. The four OASIS are located in small shops run by aquaculturist-cum-extension-

 volunteers and provide input services (feed, fertilizer and other aquaculture material) and free extension

 material and information to all farmer groups. Further to this, a general consensus in more than 100 farmers

 resulted in a Fishery Association (FA) set-up whereby farmers are willing to pay an annual membership fee

 and one of the OASIS owners, Ms. Hue has been democratically elected in the FA Board by the FA

 members. The FA is also adopting a participatory M&E system.

Aquaculture & Fisheries Associations: Main Constraints. At local level, one of main constraints

is the general tendency to run the business individually resulting from the lack of perception of

benefits if acting as a group. Farmers have limited education and access to information. They lack

knowledge of future international market requirements such as food security and trace-ability. At

provincial and district level, there are still few VINAFIS "branches or hubs" which do not have a

well defined role and responsibilities. At central level, VINAFIS has still a blurred institutional set

up lacking a clear leading and active role and strategy.


Key recommendation for establishing Aquaculture & Fisheries Associations with OASIS:

· Identify any existing farmers' Group and Associations in the pilot commune and build on their

    experience;




Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 70

· Encourage small-scale farmers to get affiliated in self-management groups and Aquaculture and

    Fishery Associations;

· Foster the link between Groups and Associations with DARD, DOFI, WU, and credit

    institutions;

· Support Fishery and Aquaculture Associations to establish a Participatory Monitoring &

    Evaluation system (PM&E);

· Support and train Associations to improve skills and capacity to represent farmers, have access

    to information and deal with early disease warning system and management (including medical

    kits/boxes and water quality test kits);

· Identify and support mechanisms to assure financial sustainability to farmers' groups and

    Association as project exit strategy (e.g. OASIS);

· Provide each OASIS aquaculture related posters, leaflets, booklets, extension materials and

    different inputs from DOFI, DARD, development projects. These extension material will be on

    show as reference material with certain leaflets and guidelines for sale;


Key recommendation for establishing OASIS at village level:

· Identify in villages, people running small shops; possibly already doing aquaculture; who have

    interest in developing his/her knowledge in various aspects of aquaculture and shows interest

    and capacity to transfer such knowledge to other farmers; respected in the community;

· Provide appropriate training and basic equipment to those shop owners;

· Provide each OASIS with aquaculture related posters, leaflets, booklets, extension materials

    and different inputs from DOFI, DARD, development projects. These extension materials will

    be on show as reference material with certain leaflets and guidelines for sale;


2. Market development

Market access is considered a bottleneck for poverty reduction projects through aquaculture and

there is a need for a vertical integration from producer to consumer through the whole value chain.

At a local scale, the low level education of farmers and opportunity to access to information limit

the opportunity to identify and explore new market outlets. Moreover, small-scale farmers usually

run their business individually and therefore harvest their products without consulting other

farmers, are usually linked to seasons and need to get cash income as soon as possible. Sometimes,

the need to sell is also driven by a crop which shows signs of disease or because the bad season is


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 71

approaching increasing the risk of loosing the crop. Acting as a single farmer can never generate

enough produce which would be needed to be sold at once to processing plant or international

buyers. Investing in traveling far to develop market channels could be very expensive and require

negotiation and other commercial skills. Thus, most farmers sell their produce to local middlemen

or middlemen from other provinces that drive the price. Pressure on price occurs also for the second

crop in areas where harvest time is close to flood and storm season and farmers are urged to sell the

crop to avoid risk of losses.


At national and international level, MOFI foresees further competition from foreign rivals in both

domestic and export markets after Vietnam joins the World Trade Organization (WTO). To

increase the Vietnamese competitive capacity and retain and improve market penetration, the sector

must continue to meet markets' quality standards and conform to regulations in other countries,

including those related to tariffs, anti-dumping issues, and certification schemes. Currently Vietnam

accounts for 170 processing plants which are already licensed to export to the very strictly regulated

EU and an even larger number who are authorized to export to the US and Japan. Moreover, it is

crucial to improve the domestic flow of raw seafood material from production areas with few

processing plants to areas with high processing capacity via better infrastructure but also through a

better producers' organization via Farmers' Associations. This would allow the sector to be more

resilient for temporary lack of raw materials for processing in some areas which also cause the need

for imports from abroad. Further, this would also help farmers getting a fairer price during seasonal

production surges when the price usually drops.


Key recommendations for market:

· Identify alternative aquatic product outlets and help communities to build commercial links

    with those markets, taking them through each and every step of the process;

· Explore alternative and complementary livelihood options including aquaculture and capture

    fisheries post-harvest processing added value and link to national and international markets

    (e.g. dried sea cucumber to Hong Kong; dried seaweed to Malaysia and China);

· Encourage small-scale farmers to get affiliated in self-management groups and Aquaculture and

    Fishery Associations to get organized and harvest as a group to provide sufficient produce to

    potential buyers;

3. Extension services


The Fishery Extension Centers (FECs) in DOFI organize regular aquaculture trainings every year

especially at the beginning of farming season. There are technicians who receive training and up-

dating extension material to review and study every year. They may operate in different groups

which cover one or more district each and organize training sessions at commune level according to

the need. The methodology employed is usually traditional or on-site training and extension

material might be handed over to farmers depending on available resources. According to site, FEC

might be mainly involved with shrimp farming training reflecting the general CPCs priority for the

industry in terms of economic growth and job creation. For inland communes DARD is involved in

fisheries extension. The following needs might improve extension effectiveness:


      Need for ToT to improve the knowledge of FECs and DARDs extensionists;

      High quality extension material e.g. leaflets on BMPs and GAPs;
      New training methodology e.g. Aquaculture Farmers' Field School (AFFS)12;

      More training equipment e.g. LCD projector.


Feed companies might also provide valuable extension training though not in a regular way.

Universities, NGOs, and development projects might also be engaged in regular extension and

training in aquaculture. All these extension iniatives including those from GoV, project driven and

private sector, are usually not coordinated and may generate confusion to farmers especially if

proposing different messages. Another issue is to which extent the trainings delivered are

developed following a participatory Training Need Assessment (TNA). Moreover, the New

Fisheries Extension Strategy which MOFI is planned to promulgate in 2006 and which aim at
making the Decree 56 operational13, acknowledges the key role of extension for the fishery sector

economic development and poverty reduction:


      "It is clear that there should be changes in Vietnam fisheries extension and that these changes should be based

      on the available resources. One of the challenges is to ensure the quality and efficiency of extension work. In the

      future, better off stakeholders in the fisheries sector may be able to pay for high quality extension services. But it

      is also necessary that effective extension services also reach large numbers of the poorest fish producers, free of

      charge"




12AFFS derives from the agriculture sector and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) principles. Briefly, AFFS is a participatory training
methodology where farmers work in group combining theory with practice in the field at pond site. The extension workers act as
facilitator and create conditions for farmers to discuss and exchange their ideas (farmer to farmer aquaculture technology transfer).
SUMA has piloted AFFS for shrimp farm in Ca Mau and Quang Ninh province from 2003-2005.

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 73

and calls for new ways to strengthen the relationships between partners and the links between State,

NGOs and private enterprise, to improve the quality and reach of fisheries extension services to as

many targets as possible. Therefore, the extension service would definitely benefit from a better co-

ordination between stakeholders. Moreover, at local level the establishment of Farmers' and Self-

Management Groups, Aquaculture and Fisheries Associations and OASIS would greatly contribute

to improve the extension service (Fig. 1 and 2).


Key recommendations for extension:

· Identify aquaculture training needs and provide technical trainings to farmers. Beside technical

    subjects, trainings shall include: (a) record and book keeping; (b) basic aquaculture economics,

    and (c) business plan development to improve farmers' capacity to get a loan and to manage

    aquaculture business;

· Provide technical support through sufficient and capable local extension officials from DARDs

    and FECs in DOFIs via ToT;

· Need to develop public and private extension service synergy and improve co-ordination

    between agencies engaged in extension (GoV, private sector, NGOs, Universities, projects);

· Explore new extension methodology eg AFFS;

· Improve the extension system by supporting the establishment of Voluntary Extension Workers

    at commune and hamlet level;

· Support the adoption of aquaculture Better Management Practices (BMPs) and Good

    Aquaculture Practices (GAPs) according to NACA and regional trends;

· Encourage small-scale farmers to get affiliated in self-management groups and Aquaculture and

    Fishery Associations.



4. Credit provision and access


Micro-finance institutions (MFI) providers in Vietnam include the formal sector of banks and credit

co-operatives, the semi-formal sector with involvement of mass organizations, and the informal

sector of money lenders and other private lenders. According to the new micro-finance decree No.

28, micro-finance is defined as an activity providing simple banking services to low-income

households and people, especially the poor. The following are the most commons MFIs:



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 74

Formal sector. Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD) is a state-owned

commercial bank, with a nationwide network of branches in all 64 provinces and 563 districts of

Vietnam, and with some inter-commune branches and transaction offices. VBARD is a financial

institution with considerable experience in serving rural areas and handle credit activities. It

operates on a nationwide approved system of rules and mechanisms which set the lending capacity

to the district branches whilst the provincial headquarters retain the authority to approve loans

which exceed the district loan disbursement upper threshold. The access to credit via VBARD

appears difficult to poor because of (i) the district branches are far from remote areas thus difficult

for the poorest to reach; (ii) although some improvements in the lending process for small loans it

appears that VBARD does not have specific product targeting the poor.


Moreover, although official regulations do not call for collateral for small loans, in practice

VBARD still requires loans guarantees from clients. The land use title deed (also known as "red

book") is largely the most common assets which VBARD holds until the loan repayment is

completed. The latter can explain why most poor people still face difficulties in accessing formal

credit as they do not have any other assets to be used as collateral or do not dare to borrow money

taking the risk of loosing the red book.


The Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP) is a non-profit financial institution established to

provide loans to poor households (according to MOLISA standards) at subsidised rates and thus

supporting the poverty reduction program in Vietnam. As for VBARD, VBSP has its own network

in provinces and districts and headquarters in Hanoi. Since 2002 VBSP uses the WUs to funnel

credit at grassroots level by means of savings and credit groups. VBSP provides max VND 7

million per loan repayable in 2-3 years at 0.50-0.65% monthly without requiring collateral. To be

eligible for a load VBSP requires a recommendation from the credit groups and endorsement by

WU and CPC. Business plans are not required but an evaluation is done by WU and later on by

VBSP. The heavily subsidised loans raise doubts about their long term sustainability and there are

also concerns about the efficacy to target the real poor.


Semi-formal sector: The Women's Union (WU) is a political mass organization with nationwide

coverage at all administrative levels which promotes the role of women and their participation in

social activities, and plays a key role in micro-credit outreach. Although the WU are not yet

considered an MFI according to Decree 28 (GoV, 2004) they have been allowed to operate as such

by the GoV and the SBV. WU is currently acting as the implementing agency for micro-finance

activities for a large number of donors, international NGOs and for VBSP. For the latter, WU


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 75

disburses loans based on a group budget until funds end and members start to repay the loan, which

is crucial for the other members' ability to get a loan. Working in partnership with the WU is quite

cost effective as their staff is salaried by Gov., get some training and provision of some equipment

(computer and software) and a modest commission for the implementation of micro-finance

activities.


The WU operates credit and savings activities which can be categorized in two types:

                Organizing group and acting as a loan guarantor for its members borrowing from

                VBSP funds;

                As main manager (most of the time owning in perpetuity as well) of fund from

                members' savings, loans and grants from INGOs and other Donors.


WU establishes groups at village level where a leader is usually elected and a socio-economic
development plan prepared14. Within the groups women promote credit and saving schemes, and

revolving funds and operate a peer pressure on members to return money on time and the whole

household is liable. The general criteria for borrowing money through the WU are: (a) be poor, (b)

to be affiliated to WU, (c) capacity to work (not old or disabled people), (d) capacity and

willingness to saving, although each case is considered individually. When people receive a

recommendation from their credit group they generally receive the loan. WU collects the interest

and repayment on monthly basis and organizes a monthly meeting. The repayment rate is high at

about 95% and in some cases the debt can be written off, for instance when a mother dies and

leaves behind her children. WUs are usually not involved with the VBARD credit scheme.


Informal sector: These include revolving funds and saving schemes (community-based),

middlemen, neighbours and relatives who are related to the borrowers. They play a key role for

those poor households who cannot have access to the formal and/ or semi-formal credit. As the loan

procedure is usually much simpler than the formal and semi-formal one and it is based on trust

rather than on assets, most farmers prefer to use the unofficial credit system.


Interest rate policy: In 2002 the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has decided that credit institutions

(except VBSP) can determine their own interest rate whilst VBSP continues with subsidized

lending.

Credit possibilities do exist in Vietnam and tailor-made savings & credit schemes could be

envisaged in aquaculture development projects. However, if there are no sound investments to be

made, in this case and in a broader sense for farmers doing aquaculture without a proper technical

knowledge, or the farmers are already heavily indebted, it is unlikely that the provision of credit

will be an effective means of increasing the household income. There are too many examples in

Vietnam where farmers without proper knowledge turned overnight to shrimp culture and failed,

accumulating debts of millions of VND. Moreover, generally farmers do not have the capacity to

develop a sound business plan to submit for a loan request, and they pay little attention to or cannot

have savings.


Key recommendations for credit:

· Carry out a credit need assessment within the pilot commune in connection with the identified

    aquaculture system promoted and target beneficiaries;

· Identify and set-up savings & credit scheme and revolving funds via Women's Union and/ or

    local credit organizations to meet the investment needs for each kind of aquaculture model

    proposed;

· Provide training to WU to increase their financial management capacity;

· Identify aquaculture training needs and provide technical trainings to farmers. Beside technical

    subjects, trainings shall include: (a) record and book keeping; (b) basic aquaculture economics,

    and (c) business plan development to improve farmers' capacity to get a loan and to manage

    aquaculture business.



4. ICZM & Aquaculture


Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been widely proposed as a more comprehensive

approach to coastal management which addresses the limitations and difficulties associated with

sectoral and enhanced sectoral approaches, particularly in relation to coastal aquaculture (Barg,

1992, Scialabba, 1998, GESAMP, 2001). The followings are some reasons (GESAMP, 2001):


    coastal aquaculture commonly straddles the boundary between land and sea;

    resource (land, water, and their products) ownership or rights allocation, and related

    administration, is often complex or ambiguous in prime aquaculture locations;



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 77

     aquaculture may be seriously affected by water quality and habitat degradation caused by other

     activities;

     aquaculture itself may affect environmental quality and the interests of other users through

     conversion of natural habitat, through pollution of recipient waters with nutrients, organic

     substances, and potentially toxic (hazardous) chemicals, and through the spread of disease;

     poorly sited or planned aquaculture may result in negative feed-back and self pollution.


However, although ICZM is getting more and more popular as general framework it is generally

recognized that its implementation is very challenging usually due to institutional and political

barriers to the key requirement for vertical and horizontal integration, especially in developing

countries. GESAMP (2001) identified the followings as main constraints to ICZM: (i) there may be

significant political barriers to full participation, (ii) the resource use issues are usually complex,

(iii) control or ownership of land and water in the coastal and especially inter-tidal areas

(commonly used for aquaculture) could be also an issue, (iv) the scope of comprehensive ICZM can

make it a long and complex exercise, (v) dealing with this complexity, and defining the level of

detail or accuracy required for any resource appraisal or participatory process is challenging, (vi)

detailed and comprehensive plans with specific development prescriptions may be undermined by

the sheer power of financial and political/economic interests and this may be a particular problem

with those types of aquaculture, such as shrimp farming, which are the most profitable.


Many of the issues associated with the adoption of an ICZM approach might be mitigated by

developing initiatives at local level first which would reduce complexity and make stakeholders

participation more manageable and effective although this may appear to undermine the principle of

vertical integration. It is envisaged though that the bottom-up approach would exert pressure from

below to achieve change and/or integration at higher administrative levels. Therefore aquaculture

development and its potentials and associated issues may serve as a stimulus and starting point for

developing of an ICZM process (GESAMP, 2001).


ICZM is expanding rapidly in Vietnam associated to an evolving institutional structure under the

Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) and Donors funded projects such as the

"Vietnam­Netherlands Integrated Coastal Zone Management (VNICZM) phase I (phase II

currently in pipeline)" and the "Livelihood Improvement in Central Coastal Provinces, Viet Nam"

(MOFI-World Bank, 2004; ADB, 2005).




Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 78

Given that ICZM implies multi-sectoral planning and regulation, and therefore some form of co-

ordinating body or authority to assess and balance the various sectoral interests, it has been

suggested that an ICZM Committee need to be established in Vietnam at the provincial level with

representation of all involved provincial departments and representatives from other key

stakeholders groups (MOFI-World Bank, 2004).


Key recommendations for ICZM and Aquaculture Development

· Begin with more focused local coastal management initiatives, or enhanced sectoral initiatives;

· Work with local authorities at provincial, district and commune level to identify, develop and

    support aquaculture development;

· Liaise with other Gov. agencies at every level to develop integrated cross-sectoral planning

    including aquaculture;

· Promote co-management & community-based management regimes via identified initiatives

    and ensure both local government and communities are well trained;

· Support for small-scale producers and groups to cluster in Aquaculture & Fisheries

    Associations would facilitate the establishment of co-management regimes at different scale;

· Strengthen the collaboration with other sectors;

· Support the link to national ICZM initiatives e.g. ADB and the Vietnam­Netherlands VNICZM

    projects.


It is clear that all these aspects should be taken into consideration when planning pilot

interventions. The following example in Thach Ban commune (Box 4.2) reports a recent Donor

driven full-scale intervention for poverty reduction through aquaculture targeting poor households

without access to water resources and without access to land.

Box 4.2 Poverty reduction through aquaculture development: case study in Thach Ban

commune, Thach Ha district, Ha Tinh province (SUMA ­ Support to Brackish Water and

Marine Aquaculture).


The objective of the intervention was to develop community based brackish water and marine

aquaculture in a sustainable way to improve farmers' income and contribute to poverty and hunger

alleviation.


42 ha (80%) of a total of 75.6 ha

of    converted    salt    land   to

aquaculture has been included in

a    safe   aquaculture    planning

process, completed and approved

by     provincial    and     district

authorities in August 2003. Major

infrastructures have been built

with    Donor    funds     including

supply    and    drainage    canals,

bridges, and settlement ponds involving hundreds of local laborers for most of their construction in

2004 and 2005. These facilities will serve the adjacent salt field as well which will continue to be

productive and guarantee an income to farmers. With such infrastructure in place, 33.6 ha (of which

28.6 ha water area) already planned could be easily developed further and allocated to other

Households (HHs).


After a lengthy and participatory process 105 ponds of 3,300 m2 each with associated land title deed

have been allocated by DPC to 105 poor and close to poor HHs which represent 12.5% of 841 HHs

in 8 villages (see table below). A range of 7.2% to 17.5% HHs in each village has received a pond,

including average and better-off family to boost aquaculture in the area. The productive water area

covers 31.7 ha out of 42 ha being transformed in ponds.


SUMA has created a strong awareness about the potential for aquaculture to reduce poverty. In

2000 only 10 HHs in Thach Ban were involved with aquaculture under the Program 773, a Gov.

initiative supported in several poor communes. Since then thirty five training courses were given in

9 subjects (including techniques in stocking, pond building, infrastructure, disease control, house

economic analysis, credit management, tiger shrimp and clam culture) to 150 farmers of which 50


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 80

were women (30%). Several study tour have been organized to visit nearby districts and provinces

where successful aquaculture operations are in place.


An Aquaculture Association has been established to replace the PMU and a potential OASIS focal

point has been identified. Aquaculture extension material has been distributed to farmers since

2001. In 2005 the link with DOFI Extension Centre has been strengthened and two extensionists

were assigned to visit Thach Ban on regular basis to assist farmers.


A MoU has been signed with the district Women Union in Thach Ha (WUTH) to run a micro-credit

and savings scheme and to encourage diversified pro-poor aquaculture in Thach Ban. Training on

micro-credit management was delivered to the WUTH who has organized the selected 105 HHs

into 10 credit & savings groups.


From 2001 to 2005 several pro-poor aquaculture species & models have been tested by farmers in 4

trial ponds including tiger shrimp, mud crab, grouper, tilapia and innovative aeration systems. Hard

clam culture has also been supported in the mud flat along the estuary. The 105 pond systems will

adopt an `improved extensive' shrimp production intercropped with species like brackish water

acclimated tilapia to reduce the risk of failure due to disease outbreak. Moreover, the national dyke

has been remarkably improved with major intervention to the sluice gates for a better water flow

management to the whole productive area.

embankments etc. as the running costs are discounted in the net profit rates below.


The system life cycle is considered to be 10 years. This is not because it will deteriorate beyond use

by that time but due to the probability that by 2015 an intensified system will be put in its place.

The system currently comprises 105 x 3,300m2 ponds with a total usable water surface area of 31.7

hectares. There is an additional 3.5 ha of water settlement area on the outlet side where seaweeds

and bivalve molluscs can be seeded to absorb some of the nutrients from the system. Total culture

area is 35 hectares. The productivity is assumed to be an average of 800 Kg/ha shrimp for one crop

in the 31.7 ha area as an improved extensive system with tilapia as a second crop with 500 Kg/ha

production levels.


The value of shrimp @ around 20mt/yr for the system is USD 64,000 net. The value of Tilapia @

around 15mt/yr for the system is USD 9,000 net. Seaweed/tilapia from the sedimentation systems

would amount to an additional USD 1,000/yr. Total annual production USD 74,000 x 10 years =

USD 740,000


10 year Benefit / Cost = 740,000 / 411,000 = 180%.

Appendix 5 ­ The national workshop proceedings




Sustainable livelihoods and coastal economies for poor fishing communities

Date: 10 May 2006

Place: Hoa Binh Hotel, Hanoi, Vietnam


The purpose of the workshop was to enable

discussion                  of                 coastal

management for fisheries livelihoods, to discuss

the findings and recommendations of the draft

report "Engaging poor fishing communities in

sustainable livelihood management in Vietnam"

supported by JFPR fund and the World Bank. The

consultation was jointly conducted by Center for

Development and Integration (CDI) and a team

from National Institute of Economics (VIE) led by

Dr. Nguyen Van Huan. The draft report has been

presented to over 50 participants from ministries,

local administrative levels and representatives of 5

provinces who participated in consultation for

comments and discussion.


Vietnam has an extensive coastline with diverse

marine resources. Fishery is considered as

economic potential livelihood, for contribution to

the State Revenue and economic growth and

improvement of the people's lives. Development

of aquaculture and catching are choices for many

localities for poverty reduction. In addition,

despites its achievements and advantages, fisheries




Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 8

development also faces many challenges, including

environment pollution, ecological imbalance. The

workshop is organized for all

stakeholders, government officials, beneficiaries, environmentalist, researchers and communities to

discuss the issues and to comment on "Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification

of resource management and investment needs".

73 participants from ministries, such as MOFI, Research Institute of Fisheries, Ministry of

Agriculture and Rural Development, Prime Minister's Research Committee, University of

Agriculture, Institute of Agricultural Economics, Donors and projects in fishery sector especially

from the 8 provinces representatives and the research team.



The workshop was co-chaired by Mr. Pham Quang Yen ­ Deputy Director of International

Cooperation Department ­ MOFI and Mr. Ron Zweig, the World Bank's Fishery Specialist, Task

Manager. The panelists are Dr. Nguyen Van Huan ­ VEI ­ Head of research team and Dr. Prof. Vo

Dai Luoc, General Director, VAPEC, member of Prime Minister's Research Committee


Mr Pham Trong Yen presented briefly the Vietnam fishery developments. Fishery plays a very

important role in the economy with a volume of 3.5 million tons in 2005 and exports of USD 2.73

million, accounting for over 4% of GDP. The growth of the sector also confronts many challenges in

terms of sustainability with exhausted costal resources, unstable offshore fishing, low capacity of

resource assessment and allocation. Rapid, unplanned and unprompted aquaculture development by

farmers has lead to negative impacts on the environment, and diseases among species raised.

Therefore, support for the poor's livelihoods need attention from government agencies, international

and local organizations, and authorities at all levels. The workshop is an opportunity for releasing all

findings from research, surveys, discussions and comments to enable better understanding of all

stakeholders on of the urgent sectoral issue of harmonizing fishery development with environmental

protection.


Mr. Ronald Zweig - WB representative and Task Manager delivered sharing speech "An overview of

Vietnam's fishery development". The main issues of the country's fishery development: coastal

management, fish catching and aquaculture, and market penetration were presented in the speech. He

also referred to the issue of poverty and specifically the poor living standards of coastal fisher folks

despite diverse and abundant resources. Based on the current conditions, specific policies and




Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 9

regulations, support is urgently needed for the poor in order to reduce poverty whilst at the same time

preserving the environment.


Dr. Bui Quang Te ­ Representative of Aquaculture Research Institute, shared experiences in coastal

fishery and aquaculture. He highlighted the important role and great contribution of the sector to the

economy. The sector potential, situation and effectiveness of Vietnam coastal aquaculture

development were presented. Aquaculture is a kind of farming of very high economic effectiveness: 2

-3 times higher than rice cultivation with profit rates of 33%. The activity also creates employment,

narrowing the income gap between urban and rural areas, and improves local security situation.

However, due to excessively rapid and unplanned development, and use of inadequate techniques it

has had negative impacts on the environment. Most environmental degradation levels in localities are

much higher than the accepted levels, mangrove deforestation for shrimp raising leads to serious

ecological imbalance, and also underground water resources are exhausted due to abuse of shrimp

catching. Some policy solutions (providing planned cultivation area, encouraging community

participation and awareness, setting up technical management systems, timing, settling all raised

problems), and the promotion of good models based on feasibility, effectiveness and environmental

protection are to be implemented in order to minimize negative impacts, and achieve sustainable

development.


Representative from CRES provided information about the mangrove ecosystem, regarding status of

mangrove conservation in Vietnam and its implications on fisheries development. Mangroves play an

important role in the life of fish, and provide firewood, charcoal, and medicine for the communities.

Mangroves are also an important habitat for a great diversity of reptiles, mammals, and aquatic

species. The trees can be seen as the "giant kidney" of the planet, the "green wall" protecting costal

areas. The mangrove, however, has been rapidly destroyed for shrimp ponds, degrading wetland

ecosystem and causing the loss of the "mangrove shield" which protects sea dykes and coastal estuary

areas, with an area of just 155,290 ha in 1999. The situation requires the cooperation of the Ministry

of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and the

Ministry of Fisheries in planting and rehabilitation of protective mangroves, planting wave-buffering

mangrove belts along river banks and the coast planned fishery development. Reforestation of

mangrove can benefit residents significantly as developed faunal resource, source of biodiversity, and

as a destination for research and ecological tourism. The mangrove preservation and reforestation

should be the focus of management agencies and the whole community.




Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 10

Dr. Nguyen Van Huan ­ Head of the research team ­ summarizes the findings and community

feedback from the poor fishery communities in 5 participating provinces. The report shows the

characteristics of the coastal and coastal line areas for diversification of livelihoods as well as the

possibility of access to resources, associated advantages and risks, government support, participation

of private sector and international support. The recommendations were made based on the poor

fisherfolks priorities for investment and livelihood development. The report shows the poor's

constrained access to coastal resources, and little capital for investment. The poor's livelihoods such

as diving for shrimp collection, and catching shellfish, lead to exhausted resources. Various costal

communities' livelihoods include sandy soil agriculture, livestock raising, fishery cultivation and

catching but are associated with high risks such as natural disasters (floods), water source pollution

and epidemics. Data and information obtained from the study are the basis for concluding

recommendations and requirements such as incentive credit for the poor, technical and breed support,

output procurement, irrigation improvement, creating favorable conditions for the poor's sustainable

livelihoods. There are also a number of recommendations from the research team, such as the

establishment of grassroots aquaculture associations, promotion of fishing site forecasts, publication

of offshore fishing guidelines, popularization of effective production models and especially

improvements in community awareness of environment protection.



Dr. Mai Thanh Cuc ­ member of the research team ­ shared fishery development experiences from

Ninh Phuoc district, Ninh Thuan province. Communities are sustained through various livelihoods

such as cattle raising and fish sauce processing but the most popular is fish-breeding (50% of

labourers are in the sector). However, the poor's lack of capital directs them to costal fishing mainly.

Aquaculture focuses on shrimp, fish cage farming, shrimp breeds, sweet snail raising, and especially

algae (rong sun). it is usual that aquaculture faces many disasters and risks of water pollution and

epidemics but the advantages of the model of seaweed alga cage cultivation outweigh the

disadvantages because it can minimize failures with avoidance of loss, of being broken by waves, of

being eaten by fish, and can be easily shifted to another location. The model is in rank 4, in terms of

income generation, but is the first choice for many community members, and is the sustainable

livelihood of poor farmers when classified by combination of all criteria. The folks, however, are in

need of support in production as they receive few projects and programs. Improved management

capacity of staff, community awareness of sustainable development, and dissemination of the alga

cage farming model are needed in order to further support communities.


The representatives from the provinces commented on the report. The key points of their comments

are as follows;

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 11

All provinces represented agreed that the report reflected the true situation and trends for fisheries

development and local livelihoods and agreed with the recommendations (on seed, capital, technical

support, training, market and infrastructure).

Regarding the resources; the participants agree with the focus on:

    -   Marine resources have been over exploited in many places, there is a lack of preservation and

        restoration.

    -   Fisherfolks lack capital to buy a fishing vessel for off-shore catching

    -   Fisherfolks lack knowledge and know how for catching and raising of aquaculture

Regarding raising of aquaculture:

   - In almost all provinces/areas, there is potential for aquaculture. Large areas of salt water and

        brackish water ( Ninh binh with 7000 ha, 10000 ha of land that only grow one seasonal rice)

    -   But fisheries are seen to be the livelihood for the high income / rich and middle income

        people.

    -   People lack capital and investment in infrastructure for fisheries activities

    -   High risks remain: epidemics, lack of techniques

    -   Economic integration is fast but local government has no capacity to cope up with price

        fluctuation, product quality and market volatility

    -   Local government provided support but with limited resources.


    The challenges for fisheries development to use the potential resources effectively would be:

    -   People lack knowledge of fisheries livelihoods and face high risks

    -   The environment allows generating good productivity in the first few years but risks come

        often in the later years with epidemics.

    -   Water is polluted due to lack of infrastructure (eg. water irrigation channels)

    -   Community awareness is low in appropriate water usage

    -   Poor quality of seeds

    -   Weak management in collective business or household business to promote healthy private

        sector development (ship purchasing, cooperative operation)

    -   Over exploitation because of the low community awareness on sustainable environment and

        resources management (eg. explosive catching)



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 12

Recommendations:

    -   The expertise of a research institute in the fishery sector in providing technical support or

        seeds would be highly demanded

    -   There is a strong need for extension services strengthening

    -   The poor and localities need external support (capital, investment)

How the poor participate to generate livelihoods


The fisherfolks need to participate to bring about their own choice on livelihoods and also participate

in resource management. If the investment is only for economic growth purposes, the rich may

benefit more, and the poor may still have difficulties in accessing resources.


The provinces also gave the models that they found effective in fishery livelihoods in the context and

situation. The specific feedback from the provinces is as follows:


Representative of Hai Ha district - Quang Ninh province


Hai Ha is 160 km far from Ha Noi, on the Chinese border, with favorable conditions for catching and

aquaculture development. Mollusc raising (in eight costal communes) has been focused on for

development in the "Hai Ha Aquaculture Development Plan to 2010" with district government's

support for product consumption. However, farmers experienced failures due to their lack of technical

knowledge, recurrence of diseases, as well as limited investment. Thus, the poor have no other

livelihood options except for exploitation of costal resources. At present, mangrove planting is one

way of environmental protection in the province. Local people can reach incomes over 220,000 VND

per capita per month from resource collection and not be considered poor (under new poverty line)

but the resources cannot exist for long time without protection. Local authorities are concerned with

the poor's livelihoods and try to support them but limited capital resources have been a constraint.

Therefore, the locality needs support from all organizations for pro-poor aquaculture development.

The research team's comments on supports for investment, breeding, technology, and market

penetration for farmers are also agreed upon.

Representative of Ninh Binh province


Ninh Binh comprises large water surface area of 17,000 ha, including 7,000 ha costal brackish water,

and 10,000 ha uncultivated area with just one rice crop annually.

High economic value of aquatic products has lead to mass investment in aquaculture. But difficulties

in knowledge and cultivation techniques among farmers have resulted in risks and failures as well as

negative environmental impacts. Moreover, poor infrastructure especially irrigation system (water

supply and drain by the same system) is also a reason for failure. At the moment, the issue of shrimp

breeding is urgent in aquaculture development since it plays a decisive role in output quality. There

has not been any program or research on the issue in the province yet. Furthermore, ineffective

implementation of offshore fishing and aquaculture projects and failure in operating new and modern

equipment due to fisherman's low capacity also obstruct poverty alleviation. Poverty has caused

costal resources to be exhausted. The Ministry of Fishery and Research Institutes should play a more

active role on the issues of breeding and techniques, in order to achieve efficient and sustainable

fishery.



Representative of Thach Ha ­ Ha Tinh


Thach Ha district consists of 37 communes, including 9 communes specialized in fishing with 800

small capacity boats, an annual production of 4,500 tons, and rising output of 3,500 tons. Some years

ago, investments were made in some large and modern fleets for offshore fishing but then they have

been sold for bank repayment due to failure of operation. The policy of seasonal fishing and two main

models of intensive and semi-intensive aquaculture have been developed. However, farming density

has been reduced due to prevalence of diseases. Now, despite completion of the fishery development

plan, the district lacks capital for implementing it. Rapid development of aquaculture is a

disadvantage as farmers with inadequate awareness, low access to techniques, no upgraded estuary

dykes, and lack aquaculture extension staff creates many difficulties and negative effects. Farmers,

with awareness of shrimp's high economic returns, focused on shrimp raising but then did not receive

profits due to low prices and failure to access market. It is necessary to support farmers in technical

training, environmental awareness improvement as well as planed aquaculture production, toward

sustainable development.

Representative of Ninh Thuan province


Facing the situation of over-exploitation of coral by unemployment and the poor, the model of

"Community participation in costal coral range management" was established and developed with

wide dissemination among farmers, fisherman, and school groups. With awareness of the two issues

that livelihoods should be identified with the Poor's participation in order to be effective and the poor

have limited access to aquaculture models which require much investment, the province made great

effort to support the poor in their livelihoods. Research and surveys show feasibility of the model of

alga farming in costal areas as it is pro-poor, associated with environmental improvements, and

possible to duplicate. Communities play a very active role in obtaining suitable and sustainable

livelihoods for themselves.



Representative of Tra Vinh province


Cau Ngang district (of Tra Vinh province) is very poor, with low community management, and low

awareness levels. People, having little land and capital for production, do costal exploitation by the

extermination method, leading to exhausted resources. Some models for sustainable income

generation and poverty reduction have been applied, such as integrated mangrove planting and

aquaculture extension, integrated rice and secondary crops cultivation (in sandy soil), and oyster

raising. The models will be implemented efficiently with aquaculture training courses, strengthened

technical staff, extension system, provision of quality breeds, improved infrastructure (land survey

devices, irrigation system, etc). It is also necessary to create mirrors and cases for duplicating among

the poor.


Dr. Vo ai Luoc ­ VAPEC was the peer review for the workshop, he commented that: Situation and

trend, reasons for poverty and difficulties as well as potential and weaknesses of studied coastal areas

are well highlighted in all reports. Fishery development, based on local situations, needs planning, a

feasibility survey, and to be harmonized with the whole costal area. The coastal resources that have

advantages of geographical position also should be taken in consideration. Vietnam's geographical

location is highly desirable for other countries. Moreover, aquaculture in all localities, up to now, is

only on a household scale but not larger. Thus, the farm model or company model may be a good.

Fishery development requires comprehensive measures with participation and cooperation of all

stakeholders.

Comment by Mr. Ron Zweig ­ WB representative in Viet Nam


The world fishery is in crisis and so is the Vietnam's fishery. Aquaculture development has had

negative impacts on the environment, causing serious environmental degradation. Effective

aquaculture models of integrated rice and aquaculture farming, fish cage and oyster raising should be

duplicated. The sector's development is to be well planned and participated in by all stakeholders.


Dr. Pham Trong Yen, Deputy Director of International Cooperation Department, MOFI


Much attention is paid to balanced fishery development and natural resources and environment

protection. Aquaculture encouragement in localities faces many challenges that need support by many

organizations, especially in dealing with provision of sustainable livelihoods for the poor.


Over the past few years, the fishery sector has developed very fast. The Government of Vietnam takes

the fishery sector to be one of the prominent growth sectors for the economy. In 2005, the

productivity of the sector achieved 3.4 million tons of which catching was 2 million tons and raising

was 1.4 million tons. The total export revenue reached 2.73 billion USD. In the last year, fishery

sector contributed 4% of GDP. It is estimated for 3.5 ­ 4 billion USD, the productivity achieve 4

million tons of which catching would be 2 million tons and raising 2 million tons. In the period of

2006 ­ 2010, the catching productivity will remain at 2 million tons a year while the breeding will

increase from 1.4 million tons to 2 million tons a year by 2010


Together with the high growth rate, the sector also faces challenges of sustainable development. One

of the big challenges is the maintaining natural resources; the near shore resources have been over

exploited. The reservation and size of the fish decreased. The productivity of the high value fish also

decreased, and ran out in some areas. many fisherfolks have left the near ­ shore catching and moved

to smaller hole nets, which facilitate faster exploitation of near shore marine resources. The

aquamarine area in the North (Northern Bay), and in the West (Thai Lan bay) have been also over

exploited. The off-shore fishing has become unstable because of big initial investment, high price of

inputs (petrol eg) the post ­ harvest technology is still at low quality, the reservation survey and

allocation of marine resources and the possibility of sustainable exploitation have not been reviewed.


With this situation, the fisherfolks move more to aquaculture raising. Many coastal line areas have

been converted to aquaculture raising instead of agricultural crops especially the Government's

Resolution09/2000- NQ-CP dated 15 June 2000 on economic restructure. However, the conversion of

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 16

land use for aquaculture raising has happened very fast, and lacked a master plan from the central to

local levels, which lead to negative impact on the environment, and livelihoods losses. That has also

created losses and risks to the fisherfolks.


Meanwhile, almost 20 million of the population in 115 coastal districts and towns are living on

aquaculture related breeding and fish catching. Almost all fisheries communities are poor, and

education levels in fishing communities are low so the livelihood support to the poor is very

important. The livelihood support would depend on the commitment of localities and Government,

International organizations and it also depends a great deal on perception, awareness and

understanding of fishing communities.

1. Overview of socio-economic and environmental development and potential for
exploiting coastal fishery resources and aqua-culture in the surveyed province, districts
and communes

1.1. Quang Ninh province

Quang Ninh province is located within big coastal corridor of the North. Together with Hai
Phong, Quang Ninh plays an important role for the whole country to open up to the sea in the
North. In the future when the strategy for "two corridors, one belt" is put into operation it is
also important for provinces in the South West of China and the North of Laos. With Mong
Cai international border checkpoint, increasingly improved roads and convenient seaport
system, Quang Ninh has become an important link in goods transport and transactions
between Vietnam and other countries in the region and the world. In addition, Quang Ninh
can lie within goods transport and transaction channel among provinces in the East and West
of China.

Quang Ninh's administrative structure comprises one city, three provincial towns and 10
districts with 130 communes and 54 precincts/district towns. Its population in 2005 is about
1,081,363 persons, including 51% population living in rural areas15.

Tourism resource is dominant advantage of Quang Ninh with Ha Long Bay and a system of
islands, numerous beautiful beaches and natural landscapes recognized by UNESCO as the
world natural world heritage. Quang Ninh has abundant mineral resources, especially coal
and construction materials. Sea and marine resources are important factors in Quang Ninh's
strategy for sustainable development. .

The province's economic structure during the period 2000-2005 is relatively stable, of which
industry, construction and service account for a large share in the province's GDP while
share of agriculture, forestry and fishery is very small. share of each economic sector in
Quang Ninh's GDP is 50.9%, 7.8% and 41.3% respectively16.

During 2001-2005, Quang Ninh's fishery had recorded strong development in areas of
exploitation, aqua-culture, processing for export and fishery logistics, achieving the highest
growth rate in agriculture, forestry and fishery and creating regular employment for over
30,000 employees, improving income for people. Some results are presented in table 1:

With regard to aqua-culture, Quang Ninh Department of Fishery coordinates with
authorities at district and provincial level, providing guidance for fishery development in
forms of marine, brackish and fresh-water aqua-culture, promoting investing in sustainable
fishery development. It also focuses on guiding the development of some concentrated aqua-
culture zones, shrimp raising projects, fish raising in cage in the sea and pearl-oyster raising
at large scale, establishment of shrimp breeding stations and sea fish breeding stations (with
some achievements recorded in sea fish breeding), promoting research of new breeds,
emphasizing technology transfer and replication of new high yield fishery breeds. The
province's aqua-culture has recently gained considerable progress.

Aqua-culture area has been rapidly increased, from 14,657ha (2001) to 16.700ha (2003); fish
raising in cages: from 1,360 cages (2001) to 5,300 cages (2004). In addition, there are nearly
500ha of water surface enclosed and dozens of ha of fences erected on traits for fish raising
in the sea. With regards to structure transformation, realizing the Resolution 09/2000/NQ-CP
on structure transformation, in three years (2002-2004), the province had transformed 500 ha
of low yield agricultural land to aqua-culture area, gradually creating freshwater fish raising
zone for export and domestic consumption, contributing to poverty reduction for farmers and
fishermen17. As of the end of 2004, the province had 11 shrimp breeding stations. Some of
them had been invested but have not yet met the requirements. Breeding technology transfer
had met with difficulties and volume of investment mobilized was low18.

With regard to fishery resource exploitation, off-shore fishing meets with numerous
difficulties such as increased prices of input materials and oil, low capacity of the majority of
ships with limited off-shore operation, mismatching management qualifications and fishing
techniques, fishery logistics fail to meet the requirements. Many off-shore fishing ships
operate with low efficiency, resulting in low principal and interest service to the state. As of
the end of 2004, 20/58 fishing ships stopped operation due to capital shortage and lack of
management capacity by ship owners. Fishing techniques are mainly based on experience
and coastal fishing.

With regard to the province's master plan and plans for fishery development, in 2001
Department of Fishery formulated master plan for fishery development for the period 2001-
2010, which was approved by Provincial People's Committee. Then the Provincial People's
Committee provided guidance for districts to formulate master plans for fishery development.

The Provincial People's Committee also approved the Project on strengthening and
developing fishery resources in Quang Ninh for 2003-2010 and the Project on developing
fishery logistics services and seafood processing establishments in Quang Ninh during 2003-
2010. At the same time, the Project on sustainable fishery development and Policy on
encouraging aqua-culture in the province were formulated. Investment in constructing
infrastructure for 10 concentrated aqua-culture zones has been made; master plans for raising
fish in cages in the sea and for raising mollusk, pearl oyster. Quang Ninh Provincial People's
Committee coordinated with localities to formulate the Project on transferring low yield
paddy growing areas to aqua-culture.

Assessment of aqua-culture of the province over the past years indicates that achievements
are not proportional to its potential, advantages and requirements.

Box 1: Outstanding issues in development of Quang Ninh's fishery19

- Aqua-culture: Although 10 concentrated aqua-culture zones have been established, they
have not yet been developed positively into concentrated material zones for export
processing. The raising modes and techniques are mainly intensive and improved intensive
raising. Intensive and semi-intensive raising is still conducted in a small area, and therefore
output and yield are still low. Techniques for raising high yield shrimps still depend on a
team of engineers that are still in short in the province. New breeds are mainly produced in
some shrimp breeding stations, fails to meet the demands. At present, the province is in badly
shortage of sea fish and mollusk breeds.

- Fishery exploitation: Vocational orientation in fishery exploitation meets with many
difficulties. Research and technical innovation in fishery exploitation have still been slow
and conducted in scattered manner. Vocational structure transformation is slow with a small
number of trained labor forces. Fish men mainly base on experience, leading to low output
and productivity. Aqua-product value in fishery exploitation is not high and percentage of
materials for export processing is low. There are some inconsistencies in guidance and
management of fishery exploitation, off-shore ship building according to Decree 393/Ttg. At
present, imbalance in development of coastal fishing force and fishery resources,
environment and ecology is of great concern.

- Fishery processing for export: Investment has not been made in processing new products;
new markets are still in a small number; domestic products are poor; domestic consumption
markets have not yet been expended; trade promotion programmes have not yet given

attention to and their potential has not yet been made used of; export value over the past
years increased rapidly but unstably.

- Fishery logistics service: It has not yet been invested proportionally to fishery industry's
potential. It is still of small scale and in patchy manner, fays to meet the province's fishery
industry development. Investment in terminals for ships and boats to anchor has not yet been
given appropriate attention as stipulated.

- State management: of breed quarantine, disease and epidemic prevention, feeds, registration
and register fishing ships still met with various difficulties.


1.2. Hai Ha District

1.2.1. Natural conditions

Geological location: Hai Ha is a mountainous, border and island district, 150 km away from
Ha Long city to the North and 40 km away from Mong Cai international border checkpoint.
It borders China to the North with the border line of 22.8km in length, the East sea to the
South with the coastline of about 35km, the West to Binh Lieu and Dam Ha and the East to
Mong Cai provincial town.

 Hai Ha district has a relatively convenient transport network. The district center is located on
the highway 18A linking to Mong Cai international border checkpoint and Ha Long city.
With the coastline of 35 km in length and many river estuaries, Hai Ha has great advantages
in trade and transaction by waterway with our country's coastal provinces and other
countries. Hai Ha has Bac Phong border checkpoint with China and Cai Chien islands with
healthy environment and beautiful landscape. It has high annual fishery output and potential
for the development of fishery industry, tourism, service for tourists and transit import ­
export to Quangxi and Yunnan provinces in China.

With regard to climate, Hai Ha is a coastal mountainous district, and therefore its climate is
mixture of mountain climate with cold winter and hoarfrost that cause harmful effects on
people's life and production and coastal tropical climate with summer season having, storms
and low pressure that cause negative impacts on fishery production. Especially in Cai Chien
islands, it has dry and drought winter resulting in great negative impacts on agriculture
production, particularly on Spring ­ Winter crop.

System of rivers and streams in Hai Ha district is relatively dense. Rivers are normally
small and sloppy with wide upstream and narrow downstream. River estuaries are under the
impacts by tides. Hai Ha coastal district has 5 river estuaries. Only Ha Coi river has a large
reservoir (upstream) with a very big flow in rainy and stormy season, while the remaining


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 26

rivers are small with negligible flows. Due to the funnel shape of the estuaries, the district's
estuaries are affected by salty tidal water most of the year. However, due to the region's high
and sloppy topography, rivers' estuaries are greatly affected by flood in rainy and stormy
season. Low flow of river in dry season and salt intrusion occurred regularly lead to
difficulties for agricultural development and shortage of freshwater supplied to aqua-culture
zones in dry season.

Land resource: Hai Ha natural land covers an area of 49,565.16ha, including only 4.781ha
of agriculture land (accounting for 10% the total), 22,068.5ha of forest land (accounting for
44.6%),      241ha of unused plain land and 12,939.7ha of hilly and mountainous land,
6,332.6ha of unused tidal flats, 1,677.87ha of rivers and streams and 7.4ha other types of
land.20 This indicates that area of unused land in the district is still large and can be
efficiently exploited for socio-economic development and poverty reduction. However, soil
in use in the district is very poor, not appropriate for crop development. Major areas that are
suitable for shrimp culture are enclosed with relatively solid dike system, thus having fewer
impacts by sea waves. The dike outer tidal flats are mainly sand mud or mud, very
appropriate for raising mollusk like oysters...

Wetland is a natural resource, playing an important role for sea ecology. Wetland resource
of Hai Ha district is very abundant and diverse, including coastal wetland, inner wetland and
artificial wetland. Almost all aqua-culture activities are developed on wetland areas. The
district's sustainable fishery development is to establish a model for rationally using and
preserving the wetland and its ecology. .

In conclusion, in terms of natural conditions, Hai Ha district has the following main
advantages and disadvantages for sustainable development:

    · Advantages

    -   Large area of water surface and tidal flat enclosed by a system of islands, convenient
        for salt-water aqua-culture.

    -   Abundant and diverse fishery resources with numerous high economic value species
        that are now mainly raised in tidal flats, brackish ponds and cages in the sea like
        oyster, seashell, arca, perch, red snapper... These are among natural potential breeds
        for aqua-culture.

    -   Climate and hydography in Hai Ha are relatively favorable for development of
        brackish aqua-culture.



20Master plan for brackish aqua-culture in Hai Ha district for the period 2006-2010, December 2005.

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 27

    -  Soil in tidal flat is especially suitable for raising mollusk like oyster, arca, and
       seashell.

    -  Hai Ha's natural environment has not been polluted by industrial, service, agricultural
       and domestic wastes. This is a very favourable condition for aqua-culture
       development.

    -  Its geographical location that is situated on the Ha Long ­ Mong Cai economic axis
       with Phong Sinh border checkpoint ­ only 40 km away from Mong Cai border
       checkpoint is favourable for export seafood to China.

    · Disadvantages

    -  In winter, the district is affected by northeast monsoon which leads to sudden low
       temperature, affecting growth rate of raised species. Great variation in temperature,
       air, rainfall and tidal regime from March to May have direct impacts on aqua-culture,
       especially on mollusk raising.

    -  High rainfall in rainy season (accounting for over 75% of total yearly rainfall). This,
       combined with strongly divided topography, the slope of rivers and streams, leads to
       the fact that in rainy season, very rapid and strong freshwater inflows destroy aqua-
       culture ponds or cause sudden overflow of fresh water in coastal water, resulting in
       shocks and death of raised species, especially in coastal mollusk raising zones.

    -  Despite relatively favourable hydrography, Hai Ha's sea is shallow (3-5m in depth),
       only suitable for applying simple cage raising techniques rather than advanced
       techniques like Norway iron cage that requires at least the depth of 20 meters.

    · Calamities:

    -  Storms and floods: are regularly occurred, causing most serious impacts on coastal
       aqua-culture. Annually, there are 5-6 storms occurs in Hai Ha sea area. Strong stormy
       winds result in rapid flood on the district's short and sloppy rivers, leading to big
       river water outflows to the coastal area. If this is combined with rising tidal,
       consequence will be very serious. It will result in destruction of pond banks, bridges
       and culverts, leading to loss of breeds and high costs for repairing and maintaining
       and massive death of raised species due to be shocked by inflows of great volume of
       fresh water. As a result, attentions should be given to techniques to ensure river
       banks' sustainability in rainy and stormy season. In addition, seasonal factors should
       be taken into account in such a way that harvest can be carried out before rainy and
       stormy season to minimize losses. Due to sloppy topography and the river estuaries
       that are greatly affected by flood water in the rainy and stormy season, attention

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 28

        should be given to variation of salty degree in the water of the river estuaries when
        developing aqua-culture in the interval of rainy and dry season.

    -   Coastal line erosion and land slide: The coastline of Hai Ha District situates on the
        funnel shaped river estuaries with Tien Yen ­ Ha Coi hollow where collapse in
        tectonics is in progress and sediment is in shortage, leading to erosion of coastline.
        Land erosion in coastline is not so big; it still causes gradual loss of tidal flat area...

1.2.2. Social, economic and environmental features

Administrative units: Hai Ha district has 16 administrative units at grassroots level. It has
one town and 15 communes, including 9 coastal communes which have great potential for
cultivating brackish and salt-water aqua-culture.
Population, labor force and living standards: The district's total population is 50,267
persons, including 25,352 females. Total number of households in Hai Ha district is 11,108.
There are 8 ethnic groups living in the district, namely Kinh, Dao, Tay, San Diu, San Chi,
Nung, Muong and Hoa; 77% of total population is Kinh while Dao accounts for 17.2%.
Percentage of urban population and rural population in total population is 13.7 and 86.3
respectively. Average population density of the district is 102 persons per square km,
compared with 179 persons per square km of the whole province. It means that Hai Ha is
thinly populated. However, population is not equally allocated among communes1. Labor
force of the district is 23,593 people, accounting for 47% of the total population, including
12,244 females. If only coastal communes and islands are taken into account, there are 5,129
households with labor force amounting to 11,834 people, of which 5,715 are females. In
2004, 20,288 persons engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishery, including 2,560 people
involved in producing aquatic products; of which 1,711 people engaged in fishing, 617 in
aqua-culture and 232 in fishery services1. The district has more 800 new entrants to labor
force every year, but its industrial and service sectors have not been developed well, so only
40% demand for jobs can be met. This is a great challenge for the district on its development.
Average GDP per capita of the district is VND 4.72 million per year, accounting for 78.4%
of the whole province. Incidence of poor households in 2004 was 7.81%, decreased by 1.22%
in comparison with that of 2003 (old criteria). In 2004, there were 171 households getting out
of poverty, while 58 households falling back to poverty or becoming poor. In 2005, number
of households getting out of poverty and falling back to poverty is 119 and 23 respectively.
By 30/10/2005, among 747 poor households, there were 360 ethnic minorities ones.

Infrastructure: In terms of irrigation, due to its favorable conditions of river system, Hai Ha
district has a relative good system of irrigation. In the whole district, there are 20 focal works
with 322.5 km of irrigation canals, including 36 km of the main canals, 66km of the first
grade, 107.5 km of second grade and 123 km of third grade canals. The district has some
head irrigation works, such as the Chuc Bai Son dam and some small dams Quang Thanh,
Quang Duc and Quang Son communes. Sea-dyke system is 32 km long with 53 culvert gates.

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 29

Up to now, some irrigation works have been degraded resulting in low utilization efficiency
and limited irrigated areas. Thus, in recent years, the district has invested in consolidating
12km of dykes among the existing 8 dyke routes, 2 dams and 19km of canals (including 4.8
km of main canals, 7 km of 1st grade canals and 7.2 km of inner field canals). With regard to
transport, Hai Ha district has 27 km of national highway No 18A and 18.3km of provincial
road No 340. Inter-commune road axis is 117 km long and inter-village road is 572 km in
length. In some places, there are only earth paths of low quality. Waterway network is of
small-size but relatively dense. In the whole district, there are 8 ports for anchorage, 1 fish
port in Cua Tieu of Cai Chien island. With regard of electricity, by the end of 2004, in the
district, there are 15 out of 16 communes/towns have accessed to electricity. 72.8%
households have accessed to electricity and 100% of towns and communes access to
telephone and television.

Culture, education, health care and social issues: At present, in 11 communes, there are 16
culture houses and another 11 culture house are under construction. In the whole district,
there are 30 schools, including 29 primary and lower secondary schools with 458 classes, and
1 higher secondary school with 29 classes. Besides, there are 61 kindergartens. The district
has 1 regional hospital with 45 beds and 19 clinics belonging to communes/precincts and
agencies and enterprises with 58 beds.

Economic development: In 2004, agriculture (including cultivation, animal husbandry,
forestry and aqua-culture) accounts for 45.96% total value of all productive sectors. The
figure in industry, small and handicraft industry and capital construction was 24.72%; and
that of trade and services was 29.32%. In agriculture, aqua-culture contributed 40.1%, much
lower than real aqua-culture potential of the district1. With regard to fishery exploitation,
total number of fishing ships was 724, most of which are of small size and only for onshore
fishing. In the whole district, there are 18 kinds of different fishing professions, mainly
coastal ones. With regards to aqua-culture, in 2004, there were 1,675 ha devoted to aqua-
culture, including 113 ha for fresh water aqua-culture, 383 ha for shrimp raising (mainly
improved extensive raising), 871 ha for mollusk raising, 33 ha for sea-worm and sea-leech,
275 ha for brackish and salt-water fish. Aqua-culture output in 2004 was 3,322 tones,
increasing by 40.7% in comparison with that in 2003. There were 617 workers in aqua-
culture sector with average cultivated surface area of 2ha/person. By the end of 2004, the
district has had 2 co-operatives and 5 enterprises operating in aqua-culture. In terms of
fishery logistics services, the district has 8 ship terminals, mostly allocated at Ha Coi estuary
and fish grounds in Tien Toi, Phu Hai and Quang Ha towns. Fishery logistics services are
mainly under the forms of fishing equipment provision and ship repair. Almost all breeds
and feeds for aqua-culture are imported from other districts or provinces1. The district aqua-
culture performance in 2005 indicates that, in the same area, benefits brought about by fresh
water fish raising is 4 times higher than paddy growing; inner dyke extensive brackish and
salt-water fish raising has brought about returns to households but the amount is not high;


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 30

industrial scale shrimp raising requires big investments but unstable returns; oyster raising
brings about good result but it is difficult to find good sources of breeds and capital, resulting
in waste of cultivated area; sea-worm and sea-leech raising is only at simple level so the
productivity is low, though it has not caused loss; many households are raising fish in small
cages on sea, but due to their lack of knowledge, capital and stable sources of breeds, the
returns is not so high; due to difficulties in finding sources of breeds, mystius smaragdinus
raising has not been extended widely in the district1.

Environment: Because industries have not well developed, there is nearly no industrial
waste in Hai Ha district. Most of the district's area is mountains and hills so the area for
agriculture is very little and exhausted, thus agriculture has not yet well developed. Fertilizer
and chemicals are not widely used. In mountainous regions, teas are widely planted, and the
amount of pesticide residues on tea trees may have impacts on environment of coastal areas.
Besides, other resources of impacts on the quality of coastal environment mainly are daily
garbage, lubricant from machines of coastal fishing ships and chemicals from fishing
activities. At the moment, amount of all above wastes is not much, but it is very dangerous in
the future. In order to develop aqua-culture, Hai Ha district needs to control all sources of
wastes.

In summary, in terms of social, economic and environmental conditions, Hai Ha district has
both advantages as well as disadvantages in developing sustainable aqua-culture.

* Advantages

    -   In recent years, aqua-culture in Hai Ha district has been considered as one of sectors
        that created economic breakthroughs, so it has been given great attention by the
        district's leaders.

    -   Labor force of the district is abundant and traditionally hardworking. People here
        expect to shift from low quality traditional agriculture, which is not suitable to soil
        conditions of the region, to aqua-culture in order to improve the living standards,
        increase income and reduce poverty.

    -   Most of coastal communes have ship terminals. The system of inter-communes roads
        is relatively developed. These are favourable conditions for a convenient exchange of
        goods.

    -   Irrigation system is quite good and it is important resource of fresh water for aqua-
        culture in the district.

    -   Demand for seafood products is high (from both domestic markets and contiguous
        Chinese provinces), especially demand for fresh water products (demand from only
        the district itself exceeds supply). Products are purchased at ports so it is very
        convenient for sellers and buyers.



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 31

    -  Hai Ha district was assisted by SUMA project, Ministry of Fisheries in formulating
       the Master plan for brackish and salt-water aqua-culture of Hai Ha district in the
       period of 2006-2010 in December, 2005. This is an important and firm scientific
       foundation for developing sustainable aqua-culture of the district in the next 5 years.

    -  In many years, the district authorities have continuously established transitional and
       pilot aqua-culture models, formulated projects such as Project on sea oyster raising
       for export (June, 2001), Project on industrial scale shrimp raising in Quang Minh
       pond (August, 2001), Project on fish raising in cages in the sea (October, 2002),
       Project on sugpo prawn raising in high tidal flats for export (October, 2002), Project
       on South American super lean frog raising (February, 2006), Project on mollusk
       breed hatching for meeting the raising demand in Hai Ha district by the year 2010
       (February, 2006), Project on medusa processing for export (March, 2006).

    -  Hai Ha district has cooperated with Phong Thanh district of China that provides much
       of breeds for aqua-culture and also consumes great amount of seafood produced,
       though it is still only spontaneous cooperation. The district has also established some
       cooperation models with China with technical and financial assistance from China (8
       medusa semi- processing establishments in Cai Chien Island).

* Disadvantages

    -  Most communes in the district are poor, leading to capital shortage for aqua-culture.
       Capacity for bringing into full play internal strength by the people is limited.
       Borrowing from Policy Banks is very difficult for aqua-culture because of its high
       risks.

    -  Aqua-culture in the district is operated spontaneously. Farmers do not have enough
       skills and experience while working in this sector is risky.

    -  Infrastructure for aqua-culture, such as dams, canals, drains, roads, electricity, etc
       existed but degraded, incompatible and insufficient. Especially, irrigation system for
       aqua-culture is not separated with system for agriculture. Most canals are earth built
       causing water leak and high risks of diseases. Some regions are lack of fresh water
       (relying on rainy water and subject to 3 months of dry and drought every year). As a
       result, it is very hard for the district to transform its structure and develop aqua-
       culture.

    -  Coastal fishing is spontaneous, mainly exploiting natural resources, without paying
       attention to reasonable exploitation and preservation of coastal fishery resources.
       Regulations on timing and seasons that fishing is not allowed have not yet been
       established. Fishing equipment is so primitive, only for coastal fishing, thus coastal
       resources are facing threat of being exhausted in the near future.



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 32

    -   Logistics services for aqua-culture have not met requirements. In the district as a
        whole, there is no establishment that produces and tests breeds. There is also no
        establishment for processing frozen seafood, partly because it is much easier to sell
        fresh products and output is so low that supply can not meet market demand. As a
        result, the importance of frozen seafood establishments has not yet been aware of. At
        present, products are kept mainly by frozen water. Provision of feeds, breeds,
        preventive and curing medicines for aqua-culture and post-harvest product
        consumption are totally operated by private sector, without monitoring and inspection
        by local authorities, so it is difficult to ensure quality and market risks are quite high.

    -   Lack of assistance from aqua-culture professionals: In the whole district, there are
        only 2 fishery engineers. At commune and village level, agriculture extension system
        does not have aqua-culture profession. Financial and technical assistance to aqua-
        culture by provincial and local authorities is limited.

    -   Coastal environment is vulnerable, especially by changes of water level in case of
        flood, storm in rainy season and coastal erosion. Therefore, it is necessary to pay
        more attention to using technology for dykes and drains around ponds to decrease
        impacts of catastrophe.

1.2.3. Selection of communes for conducting survey

    Selection of 2 communes for conducting survey is based on criteria established by the
    research group, with participation by some important staff from district People's
    Committee and concerned departments (see appendix 1). Two communes that were
    selected are Quang Dien (coastal commune) and Duong Hoa (inland commune).

1.3. Duong Hoa commune

Duong Hoa is a mountainous midland commune in the Southeast of Hai Ha district. It is
contiguous to four communes, namely Quang Phong (in the southeast and the north), Quang
Lan (in the west), Tan Binh (in the south) and Quang Son (in the north). Duong Hoa has 9
villages. This is the old inner-dyke tidal flat. As located in the downstream of Duong Hoa
river, effected by upstream water and tides, the commune is flooded from May to November
every year.

Duong Hoa commune's natural land covers an area of 4,239 ha, including 404 ha of farming
land. The commune's topography is low and sunken. Total area of coastal and estuary land is
367 ha, equal to nearly one sixth of the whole farming area. This area had been used for
agriculture with one crop cultivation, but efficiency was low and unstable. Therefore, in
recent years, this area has been converted to aqua-culture.1

There are 3 sources of fresh water in the commune, namely rain water, river water and deep
well water. Most of underground sources are salted and acidic.


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 33

The commune has 703 households with 3,296 inhabitants. In the commune, there are 3 ethnic
groups, namely Kinh (the majority), Dao (128 households and 651 inhabitants) and Nung (4
households and 19 inhabitants). In 2005, number of poor households in the commune was
36, equal to 5.33% of population, including 10 minor ethnic households. There were 5
households getting out of poverty and no household being repoverished. Duong Hoa is a poor
and pure agriculture commune. Agriculture accounts for 87% of total production value.
Industry, small and handcraft industry, trade and services have not been well developed.
Labor force of the commune is abundant and exploitable land potential is great. By
December 2004, in the whole commune, there were 97 shrimp and salt-water fish ponds and
more than 5 ha for fresh water aqua-culture, creating jobs and income for a great number of
laborers1.

Infrastructure, especially transportation system, is very poor with the majority of earthpaths
causing difficulties for travelling, especially in rainy season, failing to meet requirements for
travelling and goods transportation.

Duong Hoa commune was assisted to formulate the Project on detail masterplan for aqua-
culture in Duong Hoa commune in December 2004 by northern Centre for Vocational
Training and Aqua-culture Technology transfer. This project covers 45 ha of coastal area
belonging to Village 4 and Village 5 of the commune, which is inefficient for wet paddy
cultivation. Based on Master plan for brackish and salt-water fish raising in Hai Ha district
in the period 2006-2010, area for brackish and salt-water fish raising is 246.55 ha, including
244.95 ha for shripms (villages 4, 5, 6, 8), and 1,6 ha for fish (village 5).

In summary, Duong Hoa commune has following advantages and disadvantages in
developing sustainable aqua-culture (consolidated from discussions with key staff of the
commune)

* Advantages

    -   Large area of undeveloped natural land.

    -   A coastal commune with 6 km-long sea dykes. National highway No 8A runs through
        the commune so it is very favourable for transporting goods.

    -   Tidal flat land is suitable for shrimp, fish and molluck raising.

    -   Availability of agriculture labour redundants, mainly migrants from Hai Phong so
        they have good knowledge of aqua-culture.

    -   People want to transform inefficient agricultural areas to aqua-culture.

    -   Stable security and public order in the commune.

    -   The commune has had detail masterplan for aqua-culture development.




Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 34

* Disadvantages

    - The commune's basic infrastructure has existed (tranportation roads, dams, dykes,
canals) but dedgraded. Almost all transportation system is earthpaths so it is very difficut for
travelling, especially in rainy season. In many areas, roads are only accessible by motor bikes
rather than cars or vans. Network of culvets and dams have been extremely degraded,
causing overflows every year. Most canals are earthbuilt causing water leak. In many areas,
there are no canal system so irrigation depends much on rain. Electricity is insufficient for
developing sidelines and services.

    -   People are poor and therefore do not have enough capital for structure transformation.
        Demand for borrowing is great while there is no support projects.

    -   Scientific knowlegde is limited while structure transformation is spontaneous.

    -   The commune has to buy fish breedings from Hai Ninh district. In the commune,
        there is no centre for preserving and testing breeds so it is very difficult to ensure the
        quality of breeds, and people have to transport breeds in very difficult conditions.

    -   Lack of projects that creat jobs for farmers in non- farming period, especially for
        women.

1.4. Quang Dien commune

Quang Dien is a commune in coastal area of Hai Ha district. It is about 5km to the south west
of the district center.

Natural land area of Quang Dien commune is 1,180.79ha, including 186.52ha of two crop
cultivated land, 139.995 ha of land for annual crops, 392.41 ha of land for aqua-culture,
31.255 ha of fruit-tree cultivation land, 164 ha of forestry land and 266.65 ha of unused
land1. The terrain is sloping from the north east to the south west, with a dense network of
rivers and springs, which are originated from mountainous areas to the sea, creating ponds,
langoons, estuaries and plain tidal flats. In these areas, there is much of ephemera. Their
major geological composition is sand, mix of sand and soil or mud. This is favorable
condition for aq such as shrimps, fish, crabs, oysters, sea-worm and sea-leech raising. Inner-
dyke brackish and salt-water ponds areas for shrimp raising is about 10 ha. Most of these
ponds are enclosed by firm system of dykes which is not much effected by sea waves and
favorable for shrimp raising at industrial scale. The outer-dyke tidal flats where there is
mixture sand and mud suitable for molluck cultivating, especially oysters;                      areas with
mixture of soil and sand suitable for constructing salt-water fish ponds; mud areas are
suitable for mangrove forests, such as aegiceras, etc.

Road and waterway are quite favorable with commune roads linking to contiguous
communes. The commnune has many river estuaries and Ghenh Vo port. Main transport axis
of the commune has been in the process of rehabilitation. Infrastructures such as schools,


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 35

clinics, culture houses, post offices, etc are relatively good. Villages have accessed to
electrictity.

The commune has 614 households with 2,552 inhabitants, including 1,115 persons in labour
force; of which 510 envolve in aqua-culture. In 2004, there were 32 poor households. In the
commune, there are 5 ethnic groups, namely Kinh, San Diu, Tay, Nung, Hoa. By the year
2005, there were 10 households getting out of poverty, but 3 falling back to poverty. By
30/10/2005, there were 25 poor households left (old criteria), equal to 4.07% of total number
of households of the commune.21

Before the year 2002, because economic development was not good and land policies were
not widely propagated, some households had sponstaneously transformed their agricultural
land of low productivity to aqua-culture. From 2002 to 3/2005, thanks to Decree No 10 by
District People's Council on transforming land use purpose, another 34 households took part
in transformation models with area of 52,922 square meters. Results of transforming
inefficient agricultural land to aqua-culture were that income increased 4-5 times more than
rice cultivation and other farm produces. This result has encouraged farmers to invest on
tranformation models. In the period 2006-2010, another 10 ha of inefficient traditional
agriculture sunken areas is planned to be transformed, increasing total transformed areas in
the whole commune to more than 15 ha by 20102

Quang Dien commune has been supported by the district a master plan for aqua-culture in the
period 2003-2010, in December 2003. This is a scientific foundation for aqua-culture
development in the commune in the next five years.

In summary, Quang Dien commune has the following advantages and disadvantages in
sustainable aqua-culture development (consolidated from discussions by key staff of the
commune):

* Advantages

    -    Natural cultivation areas which are suitable for molluck raising (oyster, arca); non-
         farming period exploitation (sea worm); dyke edged areas are suitable for shrimp
         raising.

    -    Being located in lower area, Quang Dien commune has better infrastructure than
         others in the district; resource of fresh water is more abundant than in others,
         especially mountainous communes, so provision of water for aquacuture is ensured.
         Located near the district centre favorable for travelling.

    -  Canal with water discharged from Chuc Bai Son hydroelectric lake runs through the
       commune.

    -  A bundant labour force; primary education universalisation

    -  Market demand for seafood is great, and these products are easily sold to private
       traders on the spot.

* Disadvantages

    -  Most difficulty of the commune is irrigation. Canals are earth built causing water
       leak. Water resource is not enough for maintaning aquaculture in certain season.
       Consequently, ponds' water exhausted in dry season (3 months). In this case,
       products are harvested too early so economic efficiency is low.

    -   Terrain is sloping to the sea and therefore water flows naturally. There is not any
       seperate canals for aqua-culture so in case disease breaks out in upstream, it will
       easily spread to lower areas.

    -   Lack of capital while there is no credit support for aqua-culture.

    -  Due to lack of knowledge, no effective solutions are taken when diseases break out.

    -  Breeds for aqua-culture and feeds for shrimps are bought from households so quality
       can not be ensured (fish and oyster breeds are bought from Nam Dinh, Ben Tre, Hai
       Phong, then farmers have to transport them to Quang Dien by themselves. Oyster and
       shrimp breeds are bought from Chinese private traders through middlemen, who
       come to Vietnam to buy seafood).

2. MAJOR FINDINGS FROM COMMUNITY ANALYSIS

2.1. Income diversification and risks faced the people

2.1.1. Livelihoods and their impacts on the poor and sustainable development

Livelihoods in coastal areas are often diverse, depends on natural resources. Consequently,
those that help people easily earn their living will more or less badly affect the environment.
Meanwhile, orientation toward sustainable development is not to excessively exploit natural
resources and negatively affect the environment. When evaluating different kinds of
livelihoods, criteria to consider are both present and future benefits (in terms of income) for
the poor, sustainment of the environment (in terms of level of pollution), and availability of
financial and techinical supports... from the government, local authorities and donors.

Evaluations by score were made in discussions with officials of two-surveyed communes

and district (shown in table 3). Because of differences in natural characteristics of inland



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 37

Duong Hoa commune and coastal Quang Dien commune, some livelihoods only exist in one

of the two. Out of the 17, there are 6 livelihoods exist in both communes.


In   evaluation of      impacts of livelihoods on different affected criteria by total scores,
freshwater fish raising has the highest score. Though freshwater fish raising is spontaneous
in several areas and some poor households can not implement this model because of capital
shortage, freshwater fish raising, according to the poor themselves, is the most effective
livelihood that can bring about stable income and poverty reduction, especially in areas with
unfavourable natural conditions for traditional agriculture activities. Reasons for that are: (i)
cost for freshwater fish raising has reduced as inputs can be taken full advantage from other
activities; (ii) sale of products is very easy due to high demand. Implementation of model
indicates that income from freshwater fish raising is four or five times higher than that of wet
paddy growing. Besides, freshwater fish raising does not severely affect the environment. By
contrast, fish help improve the environment by killing larvae.

The second most effective livelihood is wet paddy and non-staple crop growing. It is
traditional way to earn money among agricultural activities. However, on one hand, because
of unfavourable conditions (lack of irrigation water, high input cost), productivity of this
activity is quite low and only enough for self-sufficient. On the other hand, the environment
will be destroyed as fertilizers and pesticides are used during cultivation.

The third highest score is for livestock raising. But this livelihood has severe effects on the
environment because of the fact that the poor lacks capital and techniques and are unable to
invest for synchronized raising facilities. Consequently, epidemic diseases can easily occur.

Though livelihood of coastal fishing has the highest score in terms of improving income for
the poor and creating new jobs, it only ranks the forth in total scores due to excessive
exploitation, weakness of planning and management, leading to exhaustion of resources and
decreased environmental sustainability.

Despite working as hired labourer can help the poor earn quite a lot of money but this kind
of work is not stable. However, it has been taken by many farmers, especially during leisures
after havest times in order to improve their income, and ranks fifth in total scores among
different kinds of livelihoods.

Out of livelihoods that were not included in all three discussed criteria, oyster and mollusk
raising should be taken into consideration. It has rather high total scores (to be at sixth
position in both communes) though only developed in coastal communes. It is suitable for
the poor as it does not require large investment in infrastructure, only depends on quality of

breeds and feeds can be taken full advantage from other activities. However, like when
applying freshwater fish raising model, the poor will hardly be able to implement this model
without financial assistance to buy breeds

Shrimp and caged-fish raising is not suitable for the poor though it can create high
earnings. The reason is that it needs a lot of capital and complicated techniques.

Box 2: Freshwater fish raising ­ a livelihood for the future

Though total score of freshwater fish raising is very high, benefit to the poor of this
livelihood in terms of income creation tends to be realized in the future. It is because at
present, only a few poor households can implement this model due to lack of capital to invest
in breeds and raising ponds and there is no support in capital, breeds and techniques by the
government and local authorities, except policy directions and spiritual encouragements
(There have been master plans for aqua-culture, for shifting ineffective farming areas to
aqua-culture). Fact shows that income from freshwater fish raising is four or five times
higher than that of paddy growing. However, due to lack of irrigation water in some areas,
farmers have to sell young fish (many areas only rely on rainwater, no waterway system and
people have to sell young fish 03 months earlier). Consequently, income will be affected. (It
is estimated that if there is enough water for irrigation, income from this livelihood will 10
times higher than that of paddy growing). In order to make this livelihood realized and stable,
there is critical demand for synchronized assistance for breeds, raising techniques, prevention
epidemic diseases and infrastructure for aqua-culture (especially permanent waterway
systems) from the government, local authorities and donors.


2.1.2. Risks and opportunities for development of different livelihoods

2.1.2.1. Freshwater fish, oyster and mollusk raising

 Strategy of fostering development of aqua-culture is supported by provincial authorities,
especially in coastal areas, where non-staple crop growing is ineffective as farming land is
infected by salt. Aqua-culture is an effective livelihood for coastal people, creating new jobs
and improving income. Selection of aqua-culture suitable to specific conditions of locals and
capacity of the poor should be done carefully. If this process is uncontrolled and unprompted,
it will surely fail like what happened to offshore fishing program. It is widely agreed that
livelihoods required complicated techniques and large investment like shrimp and caged-fish
raising is not suitable to the poor as it is very risky and can be out of control of the poor. As a
result, choice of both inland and coastal freshwater fish raising, oyster and mollusk raising at
coastal tidal flats is ideal in this context as it requires only an initial investment for
infrastructure and breeds; feeds can be taken full advantage from other activities; it is easy to
sell because of high demand (even from the district itself). The district has had policy and

regions in both surveyed communes.

However, this livelihood also contains risks. Most notable one, which determines success
and failure of livelihood, is effects of natural conditions such as rain, flood, drought... In both
surveyed communes, lack of water for aqua-culture due to inadequate harmonious waterway
systems is real challenge to people. Quang Dien commune has better irrigation system than
Duong Hoa commune, but it is only earth built, leading to great loss of water. Because there
is no water reserve system, water is not enough for irrigation in dry season (03 months of
winter) and the people have to sell young fish to avoid loss of revenue. Infrastructure system
of Duong Hoa commune is very poor. The commune only has earth roads and has no
concrete ones, causing many difficulties in traveling, especially in rainy season. At surveyed
site in village No. 5 (which will shift to freshwater fish raising as planned), waterway system
for irrigation has almost disappeared. Remains are drearily unclear traces of waterway
sketches covered by brushes. The only source of irrigational water is natural rain. Besides,
raising ponds can be easily destroyed by floods due to sloping terrain. People have to repair
damage by heightening ponds' banks. Though some households has shifted to freshwater fish
raising and gained good results, income is four or five times higher than that of paddy,
people in Duong Hoa commune also have to sell young fish 03 months earlier to avoid
drought like those in Quang Dien commune. As a result, quite large amount of their income
is lost.

Besides, another risk of this livelihood is epidemic outbreaks. (In 2002, raised oysters died
massively in April and October with loss of around VND 12 billions22). People buy breeds
themselves at private providers without inspection by local authorities and investigation of
breeds quality by authorized agencies. Implementation of this livelihood is spontaneous and
lack of scientific knowledge. Though people in some areas attended training courses, results
are limited as they mainly focused on theory rather than practice and practical model.

2.1.2.2. Paddy and non-staple crop growing

Paddy and non-staple crop growing is traditional livelihood of farmers. Fields in coastal
sunken areas are easily flooded or drought, especially those without dykes or low quality
ones. Hai Ha district has 32 km coastal dyke, in which only 10% are solid. Consequently,
impacts of natural conditions (drought, flood) on this livelihood are significant. System of
cannels for irrigation is in same situation with only 10% concreted. Exhausted soil and weak
irrigation system make agriculture heavily rely on changes of weather. Besides, people are
facing traditional risks as seeds and materials are not guaranteed such as fertilizers and
pesticides bought from private providers, shortage of scientific knowledge for
implementation of high yield models.

2.1.2.3. Livestock raising

The most critical risk of this livelihood is epidemic diseases. The poor often does not have
enough money to invest in qualified raising facilities and lacks raising skill. As a result,
epidemic diseases can occur easily. Massive outbreaks of poultry and cattle diseases recently
have caused many difficulties in animal husbandry development to improve income for
people.

2.1.2.4. Coastal fishing

At surveyed areas, coastal fishing can create new jobs and higher income for people. Though
fishery reserve has reduced significantly and fishing technique is not high, this livelihood still
creates stable income for people in coastal areas. It does not require large investment for
fishing equipment, especially in case of ashore fishing. People can improve their income by
catching sea-leeches and sea-worms with only a rake. However, coastal resources can be
exhausted due to shortage of regulations on times for exploitation. This livelihood also much
relies on weather and faces risks of epidemic diseases.

2.2. Markets and their impacts on income diversification


Input market and output market all have certain impacts on income diversification. In Hai Ha
district, two markets are left for private individuals without quality control by local
authorities, provision of qualified inputs and breeds, establishment of commercial channels
and stable purchase contracts with processing establishments by the government. Because
input market is out of control while state supply system of breeds and materials is still weak
and inefficient, farmers often buy low quality inputs from private providers and will easily
take risks and get loss. Breeds market for aqua-culture is rather diverse in variety sources.
Number of oyster raising households has been increasing rapidly since 2002. As local source
of oyster breeds is scarce, 80% of white oyster raising households have to buy breeds from
southern provinces and neighboring provinces like Nam Dinh or Thai Binh. Garrupa breeds
(brackish and salt-water raised in inner dyke areas) is bought from local farmers, who caught
them by buried-net and drift-net. Shrimp breeds are mainly bought from China without
sanitary quarantine. Province has tried to improve the situation by establishing some breeds
hatching farms but unable to meet demand for breeds. Station breed quality testing based in
Mong Cai province and people hardly use this service because of inconveniences in
transportation and traveling to the station.

Market of aqua-culture products is also very diverse. Because of high demand from domestic
and Chinese markets and limited supply of local (due to low productivity), products are often
bought by private merchants immediately. Fresh-water fish is even not enough for
consumption of province itself. Apparently, aqua-culture farmers would not likely to face
market risk in the near future.

2.3. Assistance to the poor in aqua-culture development by organizations


 Policy on shifting ineffective agricultural land to aqua-culture is proper and meets demand
of people. Most local people want to shift to one kind of aqua-culture suitable to their

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 45

capacity because production of non-staple crop is not effective due to exhausted soil and lack
irrigation water. As analyzed above, shrimp and caged fish raising can produce higher
revenue but requires high techniques and large investment, and not realistic for the poor. So,
most suitable livelihoods for them is freshwater fish raising (for inner-dyke ineffective
agricultural area) and oyster and mollusk raising (for outer-dyke tidal flats) because they
only require initial investment for breeds and ponds, products can be sold easily, raising
techniques are relatively uncomplicated, input cost is low as                  feeds can be taken full
advantage from other activities. Though province and district have adequate policy on
shifting ineffective agricultural areas to aqua-culture, the policy has not been brought into
play. The reasons are shortage of support policies and mechanisms on investment in
infrastructure (for example, consolidation of dykes, dams, irrigation canals, roads and
electricity system), organizing training courses on scientific techniques (which focus on
practices and implementation of typical models), strengthening aqua-culture professional
staff for local, establishing convenient system of logistics services (breeds hatching farms;
stations for breeds testing; provision of inputs, materials, medicine for                   treatment and
prevention of diseases; purchase of produces, processing factories). support from donors is
also limited. There are only SUMA Project on master planning for salty and brackish aqua-
culture for 2006-2010 through Ministry of Fishery and some training courses on aquatic
techniques (mainly focused on theory) through the province's Women's Union and
agriculture extension centre. Central Women's Union provide a credit of VND 100 millions
to Duong Hoa commune's Women's Union to support 50 women members (targeted are poor
women and high-risk women to integrate into community) in order to improve economic
development capacity for women in rural areas (by raising livestock and setting up small
business). Credit support for the poor to develop aqua-culture (which requires large
investment) is quite limited because banks consider aqua-culture risky. Consequently, it is
very difficult to get credit approvals from banks, and the poor themselves are also afraid of
credit as they may be unable to pay for their debts.



Box 3: Lack of investment support by provincial authorities and donors

Though the district is located at a favourable geographic position, right in the middle of
Ha Long and Mong Cai, this seems a disadvantage for the district as provincial leaders
hardly visit the district and their usual final destination is Mong Cai. As a result, the
district hardly get support and investment from the province, the government as well as
from donors.

Economic Issues, People's Committee of Hai Ha district)

Box 4: Mr. Nguyen Tien Nhanh ­ a dynamic and wholehearted village head

Whenever there are village's works, I need to travel for almost one day to announce
information for all people in village as they scatter in different hills. When I became head of
village in 2000, I encouraged some households to shift from paddy growing to freshwater
fish raising due to ineffective agricultural lands. Initial economic achievements are
remarkable. However, I was criticized seriously several times by the district and commune
authorities as they were afraid of losing agricultural lands. I myself wanted to shift, but I had
to obey regulation and decision of local authorities as I am a village officer. I really hope the
government and local authorities support people in my village, especially for water sources,
so that they will have more favourable conditions to develop freshwater fish raising.

(According to Mr. Nguyen Tien Nhanh, head of village No. 5, Duong Hoa commune, Hai Ha
district)

2.4. Access to fishery resources by the poor
 Uncontrolled exploitation of resources like fish and mollusk is a very important livelihood of
the poorest households. This is a livelihood to improve income for the poor because of
pressure of earning money to cover their living expenses, easy method of exploitation, low
initial investment, effective job creation and not very high profit but stable income for the
poor. However, it is widely acknowledged that unprompted and seasonally unplanned
exploitation can cause exhaustion of coastal fishery resources. The poor people have
different demands. Some groups of the poor can take part in production process and some
only can work for others. Most positive change to poorest group is increased demand for
labor in line with higher income. The poor in Hai Ha district has more advantages than those
in other areas as they have farming land and only work for other people during non-farming
period after harvest time (they do not work for others all year round like the ones in areas
without farming land). Though ineffectively traditional agricultural farming is not productive
enough for self-sufficiency of the whole family (with approximately 03 months under
shortage of food), it is capable of earning relatively enough for living in one crop. If these
poor people have sufficient capital or financial support and live in area where inefficient
agricultural land is planned to transfer to freshwater fish raising, they surely can take
advantage of coastal area for freshwater fish raising (in case of inner-dyke areas) or oyster
and mollusk raising (in case of outer-dyke tidal flats), creating higher income and poverty
reduction. If there are other supports for breeds, raising techniques, medicine for epidemic
diseases and solid irrigation system for supplying irrigation water in an active manner),
change would surely brings about a bright future for the poor in coastal rural areas. Once
stable jobs and income can be gained through aqua-culture, working for others and exploiting
coastal fishery resources will reduced, people will be look for more sustainable livelihoods.


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 47

Examination at surveyed areas showed that the poor has been unable to implement shifting
model mostly because they lack initial investment capital while financial support for
development of aqua-culture is still limited due to high level of risks of this livelihood. It is
very difficult for the poor to get credit approvals from banks, and the poor themselves are
also afraid of credit as they would not be able to pay for their debts.

2.5. Some aqua-culture models in the district
By the end of 2005, aqua-culture area has covered 1,532 hectares (see aqua-culture area
structure in Figure 1) with 290 sea fish-cages and 500 mytilus smaragdinus (green mussel)
net bags.

2.5.1. Shrimp raising
Total area in 2004: 383 hectares, cultivated by 45 households, among which 43 households
were responsible for 472 hectares of improved extensive raising and 2 households were
responsible for 11 hectares of semi-intensive raising.

Shrimp breeds and origin: Shrimp breeds were imported from China, mostly unquarantined,
low quality and inadequate quantity. Two shrimp breeds are white-leg prawn and sugpo
prawn.

Two crops: Spring-summer (from March to June) and summer-autumn (from July to
September)

Shrimp-feeds: China and Vietnam made.

Productivity: average yield of improved extensive raising is 150kg/hectare; of white-leg
prawn is 285kg/hectare. Spring-summer crop yield of semi-intensive white-leg prawn raising
is 2,450kg/hectare. Summer-autumn crop yield of improved extensive white-leg prawn
raising is 335kg/hectare. Average yield of semi-intensive raising is 1,750kg/hectare.



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 48

Highest profit: VND 23 million /hectare (2 households). Biggest loss: VND 30
million/hectare (1 household).

Epidemic situation: as shrimps are mostly extensive and improved extensive raised, there are
hardly shrimp epidemics in the district.

2.5.2. Out-dyke mollusk raising
Mollusks have been raised since 1991. By the end of 2004, 368 households has raised
mollusks in 871 hectares, most of which were at tidal flats of Quang Minh, Phu Hai, Quang
Dien and Quang Phong communes.

Mollusk breeds and origin: Oysters was raised in the period of 1991-2002 with breeds from
Nam Dinh. Since 2002, due to scarce oyster breeds, 80% households have shifted to white
oysters with breeds from Ben Tre.

Breed density: Breed density of white oysters is 1.2-1.5 tons/hectare. Size of breeds is 250-
500 individuals/kg. In 2004, 550 tons of oyster breeds were raised. Price of oyster breeds in
2004 was VND 1,500/kg.

Raising period and live rate: Oyster raising period is 12 months, during which oysters grow
from size of 350-500 individuals/kg to harvestable size of 60 individuals/kg. Estimated live
rate is 80%.

Productivity: 3.2 tons/hectare.

Economic efficiency: each oyster raising household is provided with 2 hectares of tidal flats
and makes an average annual profit of VND 25-30 million/2 hectares. The highest annual
profit is VND 70 million-100 million/2 hectares.

Epidemic situation of out-dyke oyster raising: there were mass deaths of oysters in April
2004 and October 2004 but the reason was unknown. In 2004, main breeds raised were white
oyster and there has been no epidemic reported.

2.5.3. Sea-worm and sea-leech raising at small-scale in concentrated manner on tidal flats
In 2004, there were 8 households raising sea-worms and sea-leeches in 33 hectares of tidal
flats (3 households with 6 hectares at Phu Hai commune, 5 households with 27 hectares in
Quang Phong commune).

Raising condition: for sea-leeches is sand and soft sand, for sea-worms is soft land mixed
with sand.

Size and origin of breeds: breeds are collected from nature, 1.5-2.5 cm in length. Price of sea-
worm breeds is VND 10,000-12,000/kg, of sea-leech breeds is VND 14,000-15,000kg.

Raising period and productivity: After 12 months of raising, yield is 1.2-1.5 tons/hectare.
Price of fresh sea-worms is VND 25,000/kg, of dried sea-leeches is VND 250,000-
280,000/kg.



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 49

Economic efficiency: After 1 year of sea-worm raising, each household makes a profit of
VND 10-12 million/hectare. After 1 year of sea-leech raising, each household makes a profit
of VND 15-17 million/hectare.

 Challenge for households is difficulty in collecting breeds from nature as exhaustion of
natural breeds. Meanwhile, there has been no artificial breed production yet.


2.5.4. Brackish and salt-water fish inner-dyke raising

In 2004, 37 households raised brackish and salt-water fish in 257 hectares of inner-dyke
areas. Existed lakes created during sea-dyke construction have been modified to be used as
fish ponds. Extensive raising method is applied. Fish breeds are collected from nature, thus,
there are many varieties and miscellaneous seeds. As fish breeds are collected according to
rising tide, success depends more or less on fish pond owners` techniques and on sea areas.
Without feeding investment, crop yields are low (0,6tons/ha) and unsteady.



Only one household raised 3,500 garrupas, using garrupas breeds of 8-12 cm in length and
feeding with fresh miscellaneous fish. This household's total garrupa raising cost was VND
89 million. An average garrupa weighs 0.9kg. With crop yield of 2,500kg and selling price
of VND90,000/kg, this household made a profit of VND 136 million.

2.5.5. Sea caged-fish raising
Sea caged-fish has been raised since 2001. By end of 2004, there have been 61 sea caged-
fish raising households with 290 fish cages.

Raised species: red garrupas, fat garrupas

6-8 cm long breeds are collected from nature or imported from China

Fish-feed: fresh food such as shipworm intestines, snail intestines, small shrimps, and
miscellaneous fish.

Yield: total yield of 35 tons, sold at domestic and China markets. Price of garrupas (1-1.2kg
each) is VND 150,000-160,000/kg; of chinese fish (5-7kg each) is VND 60,000-80,000/kg;
of american fish (1-1,2kg each) is VND 45,000-50,000/kg.

Epidemic situation: fish scabies and fungus have occurred. In addition, there have been
unknown-reason deaths of fish.



2.5.6. Freshwater fish raising
In 2005, freshwater fish raising area covered 152 hectares, among which 48 hectares were
transformed from ineffective agriculture land. Despite                   short period of applying and

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 50

unprompted development, statistics shows that freshwater fish raising can bring a profit four-
times higher than paddy-farming in the same area, and is sustainable and suitable for rural
households.



3. RECOMMENDATIONS

3.1. Measures for income diversification

Traditional agriculture has limited potential for development as natural condition is severe
and soil features are unsuitable for food crops. These low-income activities, however, still
play an important role as a fundamental source of income and help to reduce shock effects. In
addition to traditional livelihoods of farmers (food crop production and animal husbandry),
inhabitants and local authorities have chosen freshwater fish raising (in ineffective
agriculture inner-dyke area of both communes) and oyster and mollusk raising (on tidal flats
of Quang Dien commune) as alternative livelihoods. Goal is to create a strong momentum
for improving and diversifying income in a sustainable manner and to make use of local
resources. Two livelihoods, however, have different risk levels. Risks that freshwater fish
raising households usually face are natural calamity (drought) and epidemic that can be
overcome. Oyster and mollusk raising households, in contrast, not only face above risks, but
also have to bear risks of storms that cannot be surmounted. risk level of oyster and mollusk
raising, therefore, is much higher than freshwater fish raising.

Targeting inhabitants' income diversification, especially for combining stable income
livelihoods with coastal advantages and resourse using, policy of transforming low yield
paddy growing areas to aqua-culture and planning aqua-culture zones alone is not sufficient.
There should be numerous comprehensive support mechanisms and policies to minimize
risks for aqua-culture households.

*Financial measures

- Capital-lending policy: lending cycle should be 2 years so that farmers do not have to sell
young fish. Suggested interest rate is preferential one. Average credit amount of VND 25-
35 million/household is advisable for 5 perches of freshwater fish raising greenfield
investment. As the poor has limited capital mobilization capacity, it is necessary to take into
account rational level of tied-counterpart fund requirement.

- Credit modality: Loans can be provided to groups of households in order to strengthen
mutual support in case one household meet with misfortune and to improve community's
supervision responsibility.

- Reschedule policy for unfortunate households.



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 51

Box 5: Mutual assistance in fish pond construction ­ seems to be easy but in fact is
infeasible when people are still busy with daily subsistence.

 Major investment for freshwater fish raising is spent at begining stage, mainly for fish
pond construction. To build high edges for flood preventing, great labor is required. Cost
is VND 5-7 million /perch. Average pond area each household has to build is 5 square
perches. Total cost, therefore, is around VND 25-35 million . Solution is labor hiring but
not mutual help as everyone is busy earning his livings and has no time for labor
exchange.

 (opinion given by a male group from village No 5, Duong Hoa commune, Hai Ha district
on 8th March 2006)

* Market and price related measures

- Develop state owned system of fishery logistics in district and communes to ensure quality
and to stabilize price of inputs such as breeds, feeds, materials and medicine for raised
species. Commercial mechanism should be flexible (purchase, deferred loans) to compete
with private ones.

- Establish close relations with processing firms in breed purchasing and providing.

* Support policies by Central and local governments

- Integrate capital sources, concentrate investment on strengthening and comprehensively
improving infrastructure for aquacultural development (dykes, dams, culverts, cannels, roads
and electricity). Irrigation system should be inter-communal. Active irrigation system is
essential for efficiency improvement and risk reduction in aqua-culture.

- Reinforce local government's inspection on quality and price of private fishery logistic
system. Encourage private companies to expand service networks to communes and small
villages to facilitate farmers' production.

- Develop centers for hatching and testing breeds for district and commune groups.

- Develop information centres in communes to provide aqua-culture knowlegde and
techniques as well as information about aquatic and seafood markets.

- Organize more training courses on aqua-culture that focus on practices and demonstrations.

- Strenthen aqua-culture staff at local level. Establish fishery extension network to villages
(village heads or experienced and competent ones as selected by people).

- Foster development of local processing establishments to take advantage of capital and
techniques from external partners (like medusa processing model in Cai Chien island).

- Develop aquacultural risk insurance policy.


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 52

- Establish hydrometeorology observation system for timely warnings in order to minimize
aqua-culture households` risks, especially in sea raising area and tidal flats.

* Other measures

- For geographical and natural condition of project area, it is necessary to pay attention to
harvest time to prevent bad effects from natural disasters (drought and flood), to minimize
risks to increase responsibility of project participant's commitment.

3.2. Selected models

3.2.1. Project owners

With general guidelines of supporting the poor and improving management and supervision
capacity for community, in principle, project owner should be local authority. Surveyed
communes, nevertheless, have not yet received any financial support so far and have had no
experience in project management and aqua-culture professional staff. As a result, in order to
bring into full play efficiency of financial assistance, district-level authority should be project
owner at initial stage to guide commune authorities and community to perform recipient's
commitments. Besides, two fishery engineers of the district can efficiently support project
participants.

3.2.2. Project area and beneficiaries

 Planned destination of Project "Assisting poor community to develop sustainable fishery" is
area planned by the district for fisheries development in period of 2006-2010 in Duong Hoa
commune (Village 4 and 5) and Quang Dien commune. There have been some initial
successful shifts in the area. Despite pro-poor goals of the project, 20% of beneficiaries
should be those who have applied model (middle level households), so that they will share
their experience and techniques to the poor beginners. This will help to reduce risks as on-
the-spot and timely support from aquaculture staff of the district is limited for understaff and
large area difficult to access, especially in rainy season.


3.2.3. Selected livelihood models

Without fundamental foundation (infrastructure for aqua-culture), in order to build an area
specialized in commodity products (aquatic and seafood),                    existing one paddy crop is
definitely still indispensable for daily food security in unefficient agriculture land in Duong
Hoa va Quang Dien communes. Nevertheless, in spite of aqua-cultural development potential
of a coastal land, inhabitants can hardly alleviate poverty if they are tied with this traditional
livelihood/poverty alleviation is unfeasible with this traditional livelihood alone. Based on
detail master plan for brackish and salt-water aqua-culture of Hai Ha district for the


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 53

period 2006-2010 using SUMA technical and financial assistance, and on survey among
inhabitants and local authorities about shifting low yield agriculture land to aqua-culture
area, research group find that paddy growing together with freshwater fish raising (in
ineffective agriculture inner-dyke areas of Duong Hoa and Quang Dien Communes), and
oyster and mollusk raising (on tidal flats of Quang Dien Commune), accompanied by
supports of irrigation infrastructure, financial credits and techniques, are livelihood that
will bring about great improvement of income for inhabitants in coming years. These can
be considered sustainable livelihoods, based on appropriate uses of coastal natural
resources and bring stable incomes to people.                     Moreover, with economic efficiency
provided by those livelihoods, people will reduce livelihoods used to be applied for better
income that have negative effects on environment and sustainable development (such as
unplanned coastal fishing without obeying seasonal and technical regulations which cause
coastal resource exhaustion; firewood cutting; construction materials exploitation, etc.)


3.3. Support modalities

It is shown that though income from freshwater fish raising (in both communes), and oyster
and mollusk raising (in Quang Dien commune) will be several times higher than that of
traditional agriculture,     the poor cannot participate in shifting model as lack of initial
investment and techniques of monitoring, epidemic preventing and treating for raised
species. Most important requirement for risk limitation in aqua-culture is comprehensive
improvement of aquaculture infrastructure (dykes, dams, culverts, cannals, roads and
electricity). This, however, involves large, inter-district and inter-communal investment that
one donor cannot provide. It is neccessary, therefore, to combine aid with other funds,
especially public rural infrastructure investment. "Disadvantage" of Hai Ha district is that
it locates in Quang Ninh province that have relative economic potentials (so it can hardly
attract government and donors' pro-poor projects, except very few projects in Program
135) and is even only 30km away from Mong Cai town (while province is concentrating
investment on strategic focal economic areas such as tourism development in Ha Long
Bay, seaport system and border line economy development in Mong Cai). As the result,
Hai Ha District seems to be "investment and financial aid abandoned". With district's
limited capacity in private capital mobilization and financial support, aid is in urgent need by
inhabitants in Hai Ha district generally and those in project areas of Duong Hoa and Quang
Dien communes particularly. With one donor, it is better to focus aid on most urgent needs
of people that can be financed by aid package, included the followings:

    -   Water-supply irrigation system: In many areas of the district, people still have to rely
        on rain-water as there are no cannal system. Where earthcannals exists, water

       shortage still occurs in 3 months of                year, so farmers have to sell young fish.
       Therefore, based on financial support level, investment selection can be either solid
       cannal system (for long-term) and water resourvoir (for short and medium term) and
       that is suitable for people's needs.

    -  Credit loans: Credit loans should be provided to groups of households, with duration
       of 2 years, lending amount/credit limit up to VND 25-35 million/household and
       preferential interest.
    -  Investment support for building freshwater fish breeding stations (based on
       province's plan)
    -  Organize training workshops to disseminate raising and epidemic prevention
       knowledge; concentrate on practices and demontrations.
    -  Set up fishery extention network at village

    -  Support establishment of aquaculturemedicine stations at village-level.

Appendix 1: Selection of communes for conducting survey


To select 2 communes for conducting survey, research group established some criteria as
follows:

     - 01 inland commune and 01 coastal commune represent the district:

     - High poor household incidence

     - Diversity in races

     - Demand for and capable of structural transformation with favourable
     conditions for aqua-culture

     - Transparency by local authorities

     - Paricipatory capacity and commitment of people

 Results after consulting district staff are as follows:

                Quang Dien (coastal):               7/7

                Quang Thinh (inland):               3/7

                Duong Hoa (inland):                 3/7

                Quang uc (inland):                  1/7

Although Quang Thinh commune has higher poor household incidence, its land area is small
with no land for aqua-culture development. As a result, two communes selected for survey
are Quang Dien (coastal) and Duong Hoa (inland).

   1. GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE SITUATION OF THE SOCIO-
       ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT

   1.1 Ninh Binh province

        Ninh Binh is in the South of Red River Delta with the natural area of 1,400 km2, and
the agricultural land is 67,000 ha, in which farming land is 55,000 ha; forestry land is 13,000
ha; natural forest is 10,400 ha and over 20,000 ha is rock mountainous land with limestone
reserves of billions cubic metre; forest and mountains occupy 22% of the natural area of the
whole province.

        In the period of 2001 ­ 2005, the average growth rate of Ninh Binh is 4% per year.
Income per capita is 3,3 million VND, i.e, 2,2 times more than in 2002.


                                                 In coming years, Ninh Binh province will

                                                 In agriculture, the goal is to develop
                              Công               towards commodity production, increasing
                             nghip               the rate of breeding, and aquaculture.

        Three key economic zones of Ninh Binh are determined to be coastal area,
mountainous area and plain. Among those, the coastal area will focus in expanding
aquaculture and develop an area for sedge material.

        Particularly, for aqua products sector, because Ninh Binh has only one coastal
district, Kim Son, therefore, the district play a key role in the development strategy of the
whole province, even in aqua product fishing and raising in salty water, fresh water and
brackish water. Besides, only several sunken areas in two districts Nho Quan and Gia Vien
are able to develop fresh water aquaculture in

        1.2 Kim Son District

        As mentioned above, Ninh Binh has only one coastal district, therefore, this survey
was totally conducted in Kim Son.

        The area of Kim Son is 20,570 ha and the population is 174,500 people.

Dong is the commune with the highest density of aquaculture among other communes in the
district.

        Binh Minh Commune locates inside the dyke Binh Minh 1. In terms of
administration, Binh Minh commune consists of the total area of Binh Minh farm and a farm
town. In terms of production, since most households in the commune are farmers, all
production activities here are in agriculture,excluded some households who run their own
businesses.

        Binh Minh Farm is producing rice and sedge, in which, sedge tree is their advantage
with handicraft products manufactured at work and exported to many international markets.
In addition, cattle and poultry breeding, fresh water fish raising are also supportive
livelihoods of the people here.

2. Sources of livelihood

2.1. Agriculture

        Kim Son has the potential of agriculutre with the advantage of rice growing. This is
the granary of Ninh Binh province. Thanks to the agricultural area of 11,500 ha, in which
8,170 ha are for 2 crops, the annual total food output of Kim Son is between 95 ­ 100,000
tons (equals to 1/4 of total output of the whole province). On average, the annual food output
is between 560 ­ 590 kg per capita. In addition to assurance of food security for the district,
annually, Kim Son has an extra amount of 30,000 tons food for manufacturing and raising.

About 37 ­ 40% Kim Son's annual total food output are special rice. At present, Kim Son is
one among few localities, where Tam rice breed is continually maintained. Although this rice
breed is not as popular as that of Hai Hau, Kim Son's Tam rice is also a famous kind of rice
with high economic value.

        Due to low land conditions, several rice fields in Kim Son are sunken, and only used
for cultivating one crop. In past years, the district planed to encourage rice-fish model
development . It means part of sunken fields are dug to be ponds, and ponds are used for
raising fresh-water fish. Meanwhile, soil collected after digging pond are used to embank the
rest of the field, hence, the rice field for 1 crop turns to be 2 crop field.

        Besides, similar to the majority of farmers'households in the North, pork and poultry
raising, in small scale, takes advantage of available food sources, is also a popular livelihood
in Kim Son. Women usually appreciate this kind of livelihood because of small investment
capital, which is possibly borrowed from women's credit funds and not risky. Nevertheless,
due to limited scale, income from this livelihood is unremarkable.

2.2. Sedge planting

        Kim Son has ideal environment for sedge tree development. It has brackish water,
which makes up the pliableness and firmness of the sedge tree. Sedge planting is a traditional
trade. At the moment, sedge planting area in the whole province is 1,000 ha. Most sedge trees
are planted in Binh Minh farm in Binh Minh commune.

        Kim Son soil can be used to plant both rice and sedge. Rice fields in Kim Son have
never been fallowed. When needed, it can be changed from rice grDue to sedge planting and
vice versa without pending time.

        Kim Son District intends to build a sustainable region 1,500 ha of sedge material.
However, this is only of long-term planning. Therefore, preservation and development of
sedge planting as well as handicraft trades using sedge material depend on many other
elements such as markets, price, etc.

2.3. Aqua and sea product fishing

        Offshore fishing in Kim Son is underdeveloped. Up to now, there is only one co-
operative with 2 acting boat-team in this field. Due to terrain of horizontal territorial waters
with a mountain blocked outside, it is not very potential for offshore fishing. Statistics shows
that annual income from this activities is inconsiderable:


 Year                      2001            2002            2003           2004           2005


 Output (ton)              900             540             400            470            280


        Recently, several surveys on the possibility to build a port in Kim Son have been
carried out but in fact, no certain foundation has been set for the future of offshore fishing in
Kim Son.

        Besides, this livelihood does not affect local economy because number of workers in
this livelihood is low, and fishing and trading are not popular in the district.

        Due to the fact that fish reserves in coastline of Kim Son are quite low, aqua and sea
product fishing in the coastline is not a main livelihood of the Kim Son people . However, for
some households, especially poor ones, this is an activity of considerable income.

        The main fishing method is to use the weirs. Several households use the electric
primers, although they know that this method is harmful to the environment.

        Fishing activity is mainly carried out in the alluvial ground ouside the dyke Binh
Minh 3. This region is managed by the district authority and coastguard. In previous years,
Kim Son people freely exploited natural sea product here but in recent years, this region has
been under a managemen plan. Therefore, households doing free fishing have to move to the
dyke Binh Minh 3.

        Alluvial warp is divided into small plots (with 200 - 300 m for each dimension) and
call for tender, and price for leasing is 1 to 2 million per plot per year. There are more than
1,000 plots like this. The contract winners are often people in the commune, no one from the
neighboorhood. As the tender was organized and coordinated by District and Border Guard
Military service, people from various communes of the district can participate.

        The exploitation heavily depends on natural conditions and crop. In case of
favourable condition, owner can earn as much as 30 millions dong per plot.

                Sea products from natural harvest includes mainly small shrimp, crab, fish.
Part of harvest is used as breed for aqualculture, and other used for production of feed for
livestock and food processing.

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 63

        Sea food processing is not a prevalent livelihood activity although many household
involved in this trade. There is only 1 household involved in processing in professional
manner, with products sold in commune and district market. Other households are engaged in
processing at very small scale, and their products are used mainly for self-sufficient and
retail sale.

2.4. Aqualculture

        Kim son has potential for aqualculture development. After the successful
performance of pilot project on raising tiger shirmp in 1996, since 2001, Kim son has
developed sea aqualculture as key district economic sector. Up to date, total area for sea
products production in Kim son reachs 2,056 ha (in 2005), including area inside and outside
Binh minh sea dikes. Total annual yield came up to 2,935 tons, mainly tiger shirmp, crab
with total value of 196.15 billions dong. In addition, alluvial warp area of 500 ha offshore in
Kimson can be used for oyster raising. In the near future, Kim son is going to project a
brackish water aqualculture with industrial technology on 43.67 ha of Kim Trung commune.

        Despite short time development, this trade becomes the "hostest" livelihood, attracted
large number of households, from provincial officials to ordinary people in Kim son.

        Main reason for people's interest in this livelihood activity is that aqualculture can
bring high profit in a relatively short time. With this advantage, aqualculture is the first
priority for socio - economic development strategy not only for Kim son district but also for
Ninh binh province.

        Raising brackish aqualculture required large volume of fresh water to regulate salty
degree, and that may lead to deficit of fresh water in the long run or making onshore
undergound water salty. For other coastline area of Vietnam, such as Southern Central
regions, because of over-use of underground fresh water for aqualculture, the fresh water
resources became deteriorated for recent 10 years. That lead to serious deficit of fresh water
not only for aqualculture but also for other livelihood activities such as rice crop and other
daily requirements. For Kim son case, there is no clear impact of that as the district is
located between 2 estuarines, but in the long run, continuous exploitation in this way may
affect the sustainabililty of environment in case of aqualculture area expansion.

        Drainage of waste water directly from ponds into canals without any treatment
process caused water pollution. It not only has negative affect on aquaculture (due to disease
spreading pond to pond) but also affect other livelihood activities (cultivating, raising) and
community health.

        Aqua product raising zones invasion in coastal defensive forest even worsen the
environment and weakens storm prevention.

        In addition, if aquaculture is developed turbulently, it is essential to take the market's
impacts into consideration. Because there is no investment on products processing, products

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 64

need to be consumed promptly after harvest. Therefore, price is also concerned by the
producers.

        However, until now, Kim Son has no certain plan for livelihood development. Kim
Son people make a "formula" as followed: "Before the 1990s, rice enroached sedge, sedge
enroached aegiceras, aegiceras enroached the sea. Nowadays, rice-fish enroach sedge, ponds
enroach aegiceras, aegiceras enroach the sea."

3.5. Off-farm activities

        Rice and sedge growing is accompanied by handicrafts. Take advantage of labour
force in leisure time after harvest and available source of materials, Kim Son people produce
many handicraft products such as sedge mat, sedge sandals, sedge bags, etc. Although this is
not a key production but handicraft trade plays an important role in utilisation of redundant
labour force and income generation for Kim Son people.

        After changes in socialist countries in Eastern Europe, Kim Son lost a large number
of partners. The sedge trade was in crisis. People destroyed sedge trees and changed to rice
growing. Sedge area was significantly decreased. In past years, sedge trees have been
recovered. Sedge products are not only available in many parts of Vietnam but also in
various international markets such as German, the Netherland, Japan, Taiwan, and so on.

3. Conditions for livelihooddevelopment

3.1. Natural resources

        Advantages

        In general, Kim Son is a region with favourable natural condition. It locates between
Day River and Can River. Inside Kim Son, there is Vac River (also called Tri Chinh river), a
branch of Day river flows from Ninh Binh town to the gate of Day River. An River crosses
the district, then links to artificial rivers, which are used to be borders for villages, communes
and make up the horizontal and vertical system of rivers, convenient for traffic, irrigation and
agricultural production.

        Water supply for agricultural production in Kim Son is from natural source, based on
principle of tidal movement. Therefore, it is unnecessary for Kim Son to build pump stations
to regulate water but only open or close watergates of water inlet sluice to regulate the
amount of water inside rice fields. In addition, this source of alluvial irrigated water fertilise
rice fields. During crops, farmers in Kim Son are able to save a considerable amount of
money because they do not have to purchase fertilizer.

        Besides, Kim Son is the only coastal district of Ninh Binh province with coastline of
14.75 km length and coastal region of 6,000 ha. Coastal land area continually expands.
Annually, the alluvial ground of Kim Son enroaches towards the sea by 80 ­ 100 metres.

        Difficulties

        Due to the fact that most livelihood are based on and directly affected by natural
condition, therefore, natural disasters are always threat for life and production of Kim Son
people. Especially for households living and doing business outwards the dyke Binh Minh 2,
the sea brings them livelihood but sudden changes of the sea also takes away life any time.

        At present, Kim Son faces downgraded environment problems (polluted water,
increasing salty, etc.), which affect key livelihoods of people such as rice growing, aqua
products fishing and raising, and so on.

        This is one of the greatest community concern. Most people are aware of the
importance of coastal protection forest for the protection of coastal dyke and improvement of
water environment. They also know that for coastal protection forest, natural disaster impact
is usually more serious than in other regions.

        Nevertheless, it is difficult to apply ideas into reality. If drainage of dirty water
without processing through channel and sea can be blame on out-of-date infrastructure
(hence, it is possible to be repaired by State's investment). However, rashly waste disposal of
dead bodies, ill aqua product, which results in epidemic spreading, is supposed to caused by
weak awareness of raising farmers. They not only cause loss for themselves but also affect
the community.

        For aegiceras forest, in addition to capacity to control alluvium and enroaching to the
sea, it also plays the role of a natural filter net, which prevents physical wastes and keeps
water source clean. In the last 10 years, salty-marsh forest area of Kim Son has remarkably
downsized due to eruption of exploitation of coastal land for economic objectives.
Nevertheless, being aware of the importance of salt-marsh forest, newly plantation and
increasing aegiceras area is considered as an urgent and long-term task for Kim Son. At the
moment, 2 projects of aegiceras plantation on tender soil in Kim Son, one is funded by Japan
and the other is Government's Project 661.

2.2. Human resource

        Advantages

        In Ninh Binh, Kim Son people are well-known for their dynamic characteristic. They
are always the first movers and find out new directions for economic development.

        Sedge planting trade is labour-consuming, 3-4 times greater than in rice growing. It is
likely to be the reason for the hard-working characteristic of the people here.

        Leisure labour after harvest is used in sedge trees production such as sedge mat
weaving, and knitting.



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 66

        Besides, quite a large number of young people in Kim Son leave home to work. Their
destinations are often industrial zones in the south such as in Dong Nai, Binh Duong or
coffee farms in Lam Dong.

        Difficulties

        Main difficulties are in aquaculture because this is a rather new livelihood for Kim
Son.

        Ninh Binh has no local Department of aquaculture. Every matter related to aqua
product sector is managed by Department of aqua products protection and development
under local Department of Agriculture and rural development. Besides, the province has
established a Steering Committee of sea economy consisted of Chairman of Province
People's Committee and representatives from local Department of Agriculture and rural
development, Department of Finance and Department of Planning and Investment. This part
is in charge of: 1) protect and develop protectionforest, 2) build and protect coastal dyke, 3)
raising and fishing aqua and sea products, 4) sedge trees plantation

        Due to the fact that this is a new field and developed in such a short time, officers of
Division of sea economy are all senior ones and have to responsible for new task. At present,
there is still a shortage of technical officers in of aqua culture in Kim Son.

        Because of poor professional knowledge, Kim Son people have to face many
difficulties in production process:

        - Right from process of preparing the ponds, because farmers do not conduct in
compliance with correct process, therefore, hygiene standards are not applied, causing
epidemics.

        - In breed selection process, due to lack of experience and assistance from technical
officers, farmers can not to ensure quality of breeding stocks.

        - In terms of food, in one part, to take advantage of available source of breeds and in
another part, as unawareness of households about technical requirements, households
produce food in their own way that meets no standard. That's not only badly affected
productivity but also decrease disease prevention for aqua products raised.

        - In terms of water, as district water regulating system is run by the irrigation and
agriculture officers, sometimes, the quality of supplied water is inappropriate to aquaculture
or the water regulation is not irrational.

2.3. Finance

        Difficulties

        Lack of capital for investment in production is such a problem in Kim Son. Two of
the reasons are discussed below.

        Firstly, all coastline land is used for aquaculture which requires a huge initial
investment (even too huge if compared with popular activity in other rural areas, rice
growing). Although probably considered as an economic field of superprofit, it depends on
the climatic condition and other risks, hence, possibility of crop failure is very high.
Therefore, once farmers use self-supply capital, they face failure for the first crop, losing
both debt and profit, then they have to invest in new crop. This is beyond the ability of
farmers.

        Secondly, for majority of farmer households, loan from Agriculture and Rural
development Bank is such an important assistance source of capital. It is quite simple to
access this source of capital (while assisitance of Social policy Bank is only eligible for
households who are poor according to regulation) and the loan is rather big, which can meet
investment requirement. Nevertheless, to be eligible for loan, households need to have
collaterals. For households, in general, the only property that can be used as a collateral is
certificate for right of land use (Red book). However, because Kim Son always has new land
(got by enroachment towards the sea), communes have been established for a short time,
hence procedure has not been completed yet. As a result, many households are unable to
access credit assistance of banks.

        The Bank now loosen regulations. Household that has no certificate of house and land
possession are permitted to mortgage by determining the house value.

2.4. Infrastructue

        Advantages

        Canal system built by the time that Nguyen Cong Tru came to explored and
established villages still remain and are useful until now. In newly established areas, the local
authority built level 1 and 2 canals system.

        Difficulties

        Several areas have to face difficulties in supply and drainage water as canals are not
synchronic. For some canals, because height and low of areas were not properly calculated at
the beginning of construction making water flows backwards but not downwards as
expected, and causing disorder in the system of water supply and drainage.

        Because in previous time, canals was built to support agricultural production but now
it is changed to be used for aquaculture, hence, waste water from raising ponds directly flows
into canals without any treatment process. It causes environment pollution and spread
epidemics for aqua animals raised.

        Besides, waste water of households also flows directly into these canals.

        Cattle (pork, buffalo, cow) and poultry raising is likely considered to be supportive
livelihood for households who cultivate rice because they can make use of by-produce from
rice to produce fodder and vice versa, use muck to fertilize fields.

        Handicraft and production of sedge items are also supportive livelihoods for
households who cultivate rice + sedge because the number of labour in leisure time after
harvest would be used (for households cultivating rice) and the available materials would be
used (for households planting sedge).

5. SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTED POLICIES

5.1. Infrastructure investment scheme conform to economic resources development

        Up to now, livelihood projects in Kim Son tend to unpromptedly developed. Due to
turbulent and disregulated expansion of seafood breeding activities in recent years, the
ecological environment has been severely downgraded, which caused numerous difficuties to
other means of living in the region.

        In order to ensure stablity and long term solidarity of Kim Son's livelihood, local
authorities need to set up an overall and detail development scheme for eacg fields. Besides,
it is also essential to have various livelihood projects and conform to financial scale and
capacity of every household.

5.2. Diversification of livelihood resources, strengthen environmental and social
development

        In general, livelihood activities in Kim Son are rather plentiful. Each kind of
livelihood has its own natural and social advantages. Nevertheless, each of them has created
some difficulties to every household's economic viability as well. Majority of livelihood
projects are in agricultural and fish-breeding while off-farm activities accounts a modest
percentage. But most disadvantages originate from natural and social conditions such as
weather changes, limited farming land, market and price changes. As a result, diversification
of livelihood projects is highly appreciated. In reality, most households in Kim Son have
other activities beside production to afford life.

        Moreover, local authorities need avoid wild, rough and movement-alike mechanism
changes. For example: decision of shifting all rice-growing into aqua breeding and planting
in Kim Dong commune.

    Box: It is said that shrimp-breeding is of high profit but there are nobody
   become better - off, they are getting poorer.

   After two dicussions with two different groups in Hamlet 1, Kim Dong commune, it is
   concluded that the only reason for their increasing poverty is their private shrimp-
   breeding ponds and lakes. Just 2 years ago, to afford life, most farmers in Kim Dong

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 71

   chose to grow rice while few chose aqua breeding and planting. Last year, all
   household in the commune switched to shrimp and crab breeding activites. Water
   supply for channels are mostly brackish other than fresh one. Consequently, ignorance
   of breeding and planting techniques, many local households must turn their paddy-
   fields into aqua breeding and planting ponds and lakes.

   Local farmers are completely ignorant of the reasea why series of their shrimps and
   crabs died for diseases. The reason for this situation are either: poor quality breeds, bad
   breeding techniques. Farmers in Kim Dong are in danger of second running crop
   failure.

   Due to huge investment, bad debt credits, households are getting deeper and deeper in
   debts. They said: "If we had kept planting rice, perhaps, we would have had a big cane
   of rices hidden in warehouses. At present, there is no sign of shrimps and crabs and we
   have to buy rice for survival."

   Currently, most paddy-fields are turned into ponds and all family members are
   dependent on the only life-earing soures. If crops keep failing, they will lose all like
   "Crabs come on surface, dead, my mother have no place for cultivation".

        Besides, in deployment of each livelihood project, it is essential to consider the
solidarity of its own and related ones. For instance, we must judge the fact that aqua breeding
and planting can polute water resources. It effects not only future development of breeding
activities but others like rice-planting and sedge-planting as well. An official in Binh Minh
plantation is quoted as follows: "In order to invest in aqua breeding and planting, we need
judge all long term benefits instead of a five-year period."

5.3. Set up various methods to avoid financial risks

        As for objects, it is neccesary to completely and specifically evaluate all risks to avoid
accumulating debts. Loan grace period extended, set aside previous loan are suitable but
temporary methods. For long term, proper investment directions for each subject need to be
established.

        In modern ecnonomy, factors like market and prices are often given top priority by
producers. Due to ignorance of market tendencies and just follow the crowd, rice-planting
activites in Kim Son are quite stable. However, the harvested rice just guarantee food
provisions and not much for secondary activities like breeding etc but not developed into a
commodity industries. Mostly, other livelihood projects unstable (area of sedge planting land
changes unsteadily, depending on market prices of sedge, the same as purchasing price of
aqua breeding and planting products).

5.4. Paying more attentions to the poor's chances of accessing natural resources

        The poor proportion in Kim Son (3.5%) is smaller than that of total Ninh Binh's
figure (6.2%). However, on discussion about econonmic development scheme for the whole
province, the poor can not be put aside. The question is that: "Is it possible for the poor to
adapt to changes in economic development model in water territory?"

        The poor can conform to livelihood projects which do not require a great amount of
investment and heavily depend on resources like agricultural or craft industry.

        On the contrary, aqua breeding and planting activities always demand a huge
investment, high skill and put profitable land for the poor at risk. In reality, ponds call for
bids to local or non-local contractors              bring relative economic efficiency while ones
emploited by local residents have no opstimistic signals. In case of crop success, it is a highly
profitable livelihood project. But if any failures happen, owners must have an preserve fund
to continue investing in the following crop. Because the poor do not gain initiative of
capitals, their first investments mostly originate from credits. Once they failed in a crop and
creditors refused to continue providing credits, the poor have no way to maintain their
business. They do not know what to do to pay off interest and principal, let alone gaining
wealth for themselves.

   Box : A miss is as good as a mile

   Mrs Nguyen Thi Gam's family has settled in Hamlet 1, Kim Dong commune since
   1993 (Kim Dong commune was decided to officially set up in 1998). In the area of
   1.75 hectares, they planted one rice crop, together with breeding and knitting. Although
   they do not have money for savings, income from family's production and her
   husband's modest salary are great enough to afford their daily life.

   In the beginning of 2005, hearing that shrimp or crab breeding can create huge profit,
   Mrs Gam's family decided to quit planting rice. With a four-milliion debt (with interest
   of 5%/ month and 7-month period), they turned their 1.75-hectare padding field into
   shrimp-breeding pond. After the first harvest, realizing that profit gained from shrimp
   selling is just enough to invest into the next crop and pay off debts, they decided to
   switch to crab breeding.

   Investment for crab breeding is greater than those for shrimp breeding. Bank of
   Agricultural and rural development provided her family with VND 15 million .
   Because of consecutive damages from hurricanes, diseases, a small number of crab are
   alive and the turnover is modest, Mrs Gam's family can not pay off the debt from the
   bank.

   Currently, apart from the unpaid debt, her family has another hard-to-solve difficulty.
   They have no idea what to do next. If they keep aqua breeding and planting, they will
   not have enough money to reinvest. They have no capital in hand. They are unable to

   afford high interest rate in unofficial market or ask for more debts from the bank
   (because of unpaid credit in the previous term). They can not come back to rice-
   planting as paddy-field was turned into alkalized ponds. It might take them a lot of
   time and finance to improve the paddy-field.

       Division of coastal area into ponds and lakes, accidentally, turns benefits from coastal
seafood from public ownership into private one. Since alluvial ground are already owned,
Kim Son's residents are no longer free to catch fish in the area. It is also necessary to repeat
that ponds and lakes are popular and profitable sources for the poor.

        1. Survey in Can Loc district, Ha Tinh province:

        - Survey was conducted on leading officers, staff of relevant specialized departments
of the district and two communes Vuong Loc, Thinh Loc; each commune selected two
groups including most fundamental members such as: man, woman, rich and poor people, old
and young people, etc. Each group has about 10-12 people, but some groups have 26
participants due to people's interest. The total number of participants in discussion groups is
89 (excluding those separately interviewed).

        - Survey contents consist of consultancy from the coastal poor community in order to
find out difficulties faced income generation: discuss with Poor Resident Groups on
capabilities of creating jobs in aquaculture based on experiences in Vietnam; discuss with
local authority on such solutions as: establishment of sustainable aquaculture areas,
environmental management capability strengthening, etc; making solutions of supporting
poor fishermen in such fields as training, increasing skills, production means, credit, market
and other production demands on the basis of sustainable development in combination with
sex and nationality priorities; identify difficulties of poor fishermen in access to development
resources and propose solutions to increase living standards in a sustainable way.

        2. Introduction about Can Loc district, Ha Tinh province and 2 surveyed
communes:

            2.1.Can Loc district

        - Area, population, natural conditions: Can Loc district is located in northern Ha Tinh
province with total natural area of 37,816.89 hectares. Total population (as of 31 December
2004) is 181,400 (43,039 households). It is divided into 30 administrative units (commune,
town) with 337 villages/hamlets.

        - Natural conditions: Can Loc is located in tropical monsoon region, directly
influenced by transitional climate between the North and the South. There are 2 clear seasons
each year in Can Loc: dry season from March to August. In this season, sunshine intensively
with high temperature of 36-37 degrees Celcius, strong West-South wind, low humidity
(70%), little rain (rainfall only accounts for 10% of total rainfall of the whole year).

        Rainy season often starts from September to February of the next year. In this season,
it is rainy (especially from September to November), low temperature attached with East-
North monsoon. Average temperature is about 25.5 degree C. Average rainfall each year is
about 2,400 mm but unequally distributed, especially from August to October, it accounts for
half of the whole yearly rainfall. Like the special terrain of the Central provinces, its terrain

inclines from west to east. West is high mountain, then gently sloping hill, small and narrow
plain and Eastern coastal plain.

        - Potentials and current economic development situation: National highway No. 1A
goes through Can Loc area 11 kilometers length, 30 kilometers away from Vinh city to the
North, 20 kilometers away from Ha Tinh town to the South. In general, the district is located
in a rather favorable position in economic, science, technology, commodity exchange in the
country and with foreign countries. The district's economy mainly relies upon agricultural
production. Annual average income is always higher than previous year (average income is
VND 1,781,000 /people (in 2000), VND 1,800,000 (in 2001), VND 2,400,000 (in 2002),
VND 2,880,000 (in 2003), and it increased to VND 3,248,000 in 2004). Budget revenue grew
from VND 13,052 million in 2000; VND 15,274 million in 2002; VND 17,370 million in
2003 to VND 19,881 million in 2004.

        - Every year, more than 90% of people in working age have regular jobs, specific
labour distribution is as follows: (see Table 1)

            Rate of poor households tends to decline dramatically (from 34% in 2001,
27.98%-2002; 15.37%-2003 to 11.18% in 2004).

            - Environment:

            + Coastal benefit source: Can Loc has a coastline of 12 kilometer long, fishing is
done manually. Till now, it is one of the sea-water areas in which environment has not been
badly affected (sea water as well as coastal areas have not been polluted).

            + Current situation of aquaculture environment: Until now, aquaculture in Can
Loc district has not faced any big problem in environment in large scale. However, in recent
years, there have been some fish diseases, including diseases caused by parasite and

bacterium, in some places and at some time. In order to limit and prevent fish disease, many
people in Can Loc district think that it is necessary to have a separate water supply system
for fish farming ponds, fish farming fields, to manage chemical usage in agriculture
production according to proper technological process. Fish ponds must be improved and
carefully treated before stocking. For centralized fish farming areas, it is necessary to gather
waste water drainage from polluted ponds to treat centralized before dispose to the
environment.

            - Evaluate of current situation of fishery activities: Since 2000, fresh water
aquaculture has become 'a movement' which is developed in large scale in Can Loc district.
This activity has increased considerably in area; productivity and yield, creating more jobs
opportunities, increasing income for people (see Table 2).

            Figures from Table 2 show that among fishery activities of Can Loc district,
aquaculture is growing, if compare to 2004 figures with 2000 ones, we realize that farming
area rose by 3.12 times, total farming yield is up by 2.1 time; number of laborers in
aquaculture is up by 2.6 times. Fishing is in opposite direction while the number of laborers
increased from 753 (in 2000) to 880 people, fishing yield decreased from 225.57 tones (in
2000) to 184 tones (in 2004).

            Aquaculture in Can Loc district at the moment is mainly improved extensive
farming, semi-intensive farming and increasing integrated and alternated farming. The most
common aquaculture model in Can Loc district is now (1) 1 rice -1 fish; (2) 2 rice intercrop
with fish; (3) 2 rice -1 fish; (4) Raise mature fish in ponds; (5) Nursing from fish fry to

(8) Growing fish in cages; (9) Growing fish in lakes, dams.

            Main species of raised fish are traditional ones such as: mud carp (cá trôi), carp
(cá chép), white ten bream (cá mè trng) and grass carp (cá trm c). Those with high
economic values such as monosex tilapia (cá rô phi n tính), white pomfred (cá chim trng),
cross-bred carp (cá chép lai), frog and trionychid turtle (ba ba) have just been farmed for a
few recent years but not much (at the moment, many households want to be supported to
farm these species).

            Income source: Main income source of people in Can Loc in general and two
surveyed communes in particular are from agricultural production. Apart from the main
income source, they have additional and regular ones from aquaculture, capture, breeding
cattle, poultry buffallo, cow, etc or from traditional medicine, working in other provinces,
from people working abroad, transportation services, carpenter, mason, etc.

            Other potential income sources: Can Loc district has total potential area of 3,782
hectares that is favorable for aquaculture development. There are 65 hectare small ponds, 287
hectare big lakes, 600 hectare rivers; 1,900 hectare hollow fields that are potential for fish
raising. Of the total potential area, Only 559 hectares are now exploited (15%).



      About 12 -15 (50%) communes are potential for centralized aquaculture planning.
    Most local people has experienced in this field. To make the best of idle laborers. New
    kinds of seed are more and more plentiful. The number of fishery staff is more and
    more increasing. Fish farming helps to prevent rice from insects. Self-providing seed
    on the spot are more and more enlarged. More households thoroughly dominated the
    market. Market information is more and more open. Fast transportation. The local
    authority support to build up dikes to prevent from flood and drought. The district
    currently prepares aquaculture planning. (Group of leaders and staff of line agencies

         Findings in two communes showed that aquaculture is considered as the most
potential income generation, improve livelihood of local community, because (1) Large
farming area do not have enough water, produced not enough food; (2) Fishery capture is in
short of capital; even if big ships for fishery capture are invested, it is not favorable because
of coastline without anchorage, especially for refuge in case of storms; (3) Fish reserve for
capture are decreasing, causing lower capture productivity; (4) Shortage of seeds suitable to

local land with high quality and productivity; (5) price of inputs for cropping is rather high
while selling price of products is rather low, but potentials for aquaculture is rather great.

          In Thinh Loc Commune: Key occupations of local people are agricultural
production, fishery capture by hand-made tools, produce traditional medicine, jobs in other
provinces, working abroad (conditions provided).

          For aquaculture: In 2005, many households invested in aquaculture with scales as
follows: 1.5 hectares of fishing ponds; 2 hectares of farming fish combined with rice
growing; two models of frog raising see picture below). In general, aquaculture of
households is developed well and generates high income.

          For fishery capture: According to statistics, total capture volume of the commune in
2005 is 125 tones (1,200 million VND in value). Species of seafood captured by fishermen of
Thinh Loc commune satisfy rather well market needs, with good consumption. It is an
important condition for local fishermen to innovate capture tools towards "preservation of
seafood benefit sources".

                         - The Goverment should have policy that allows people to change land
                         use purpose and call for tender of uncultivated land.
 General                 - The district should establish units to ensure the stable, quality
 recommendations         varieties supply to farmers (including cattle breed, poultry breed, and
                         fish breed).
                         - The Government supports information about markets of agricultural
                         products and diseases prevention for farmers to minimize risks in
                         agricultural production. .


          Some difficulties in income generation for community: Findings from group
discussion reflected current potentials of income generation but most local people, especially
poor households are short of capital, technical knowledge , capacity to prevent natural
calamity, protect water source, etc.

3.2.    Market and its impacts on diversification of community income:

Concerning selection of production scale for any product, most participants in group
discussion or interviewees claimed that it was really difficult to produce one agricultural or
fishery product, but it was far more difficult to reach buyers and markets. This problem has
actually occured in Can Loc for one or two years now. Officials and people have made great
efforts in introducing and successfully raised some fishery species of high economic values
such as green lobster, frog, tortoise... However, local people cannot afford these kinds of
products whereas total output is not enough for export. Consequently, farmers have to sell for
restaurants with low efficiency. Local people called the problem "too much for consumption,
too little for export". Furthermore, unit price largely depend on fluctuation of input costs.
Market, therefore, always plays a crucial role in production determination and business
outcome in general and farmers' income in particular.

Regarding fishery market in Can Loc, Ha Tinh, statistics provided by SUFA, Ha Tinh reveals
that people's annual demand for fresh water fish is 9.6kg/head on average. As for Can Loc, if
we divide total output of 783 tonnes in 2004 by total population of 181,400 people, average
figure is 4.3kg/person/year (satisfy only 45% of the district's demand). Also, Can Loc is
situated in High way 1, an important transport axis and near consumption centers with
convenient transaction condition. Therefore, potential of fishery market is very high, not to

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 88

mention current increasing demands for tilapia and other fish of high economic value for
export. Can Loc district itself considers this a good opportunity to develop and expand
aquaculture scale.

3.3.   Possibility of job creation in aquaculture from experiences in Can Loc in particular
       and Ha Tinh in general:

    -    According to statistics of Can Loc district in 2004, one hectare of fish farming may
         create over 8 regular jobs on average. Hence, with a potential area of 3,782ha, if
         investment provided, can attract 30,256 laborers on regular basis, accounting for
         over 35% of total people in labour age.

    -    In opinions of fishermen in Thinh Loc commune, Can Loc district, investment rate
         of VND 15-20 million in fishing can generate a regular job with monthly average
         income of VND 1.2-1.7 million                    (after deduct all kinds of expenses and
         depreciation).

    3.4. Comparison of inland fish farming and coastal aquaculture:

    3.4.1. Investment rate: Minimum investment in coastal aquaculture is normally higher
            than that for the same activities inland. For example, funding for a good fishing
            boat greatly outweighs that of an aquaculture pond.

    3.4.2. Income rate of aquaculture is currently higher than that of fishing

    3.4.3. Inland aquaculture suffers less from natural calamities such as storm or flood but
            more from diseases.

    3.4.4. Fishing requires strong and trained labor, mainly men, whereas most people can
            participate in fish raising. Therefore, same investment scale in aquaculture
            generates more jobs than in fishing.

    3.4.5. Investment in aquaculture may support the poor better than exploitation.

    3.4.6. Present potentials for aquaculture development remain large and promising while
            aqua reserve is going to exhauste.

    3.5. Supports to the poor from organizations in fishery development (catching,
aquaculture, processing,...):

Main features of the poor in Can Loc are: (1) Aquaculture pattern: only do fish farming in
pond or field; (2) Social-economic features: lack of capacity management (no production
plan), short of fund, almost no cattle raising, lots of children; (3) Child nutrition and health:
not good; (4) Education: lack of adequate concerns, most people just completed primary
schools; (5) Labor and employment; have to do paid work, and jobless after harvest time; (6)

Gender issue: Both woman and man lack of technique, women are too busy looking after
children.

In implementation of mutual support movement, organizations in Vuong Loc commune have
collected money and rice to assist difficult families with total sum of VND 1,700,000, 98kg
of rice, 35kg of seed rice, and 4 breeding pigs. They also contributed to build 3 grace houses
and construct clean water and sanitation works with total value of VND 8,771,000 .

      Organizations have arranged many propaganda campaigns for the poor to raise
  their knowledge and awareness. Though the poor have few chances to access society, the
  locality has via several projects organized vocational trainings in production and
  husbandry... in order to help them to be more confident to improve livelihood. The poor
  are in urgent need of social support, particularly strategy and motivation for them to
  produce and do business themselves. Besides, Farmer Union should assign its branches
  to directly support poor households with knowledge if necessary as well as other means
  for them to improve life. (Group of officials in Vuong Loc commune)

In 2005, Thinh Loc commune helped 12 households to escape poverty (equal to 5.2%). In
term of aquaculture, organizations and community have facilitated and given priority to poor
households in borrowing funds for production development and farming techniques, and seed
in certain cases.

Solutions by the locality: Currently, most communes have applied several measures to
encourage people to develop aquaculture and created favorably legal conditions to establish
sustainable aquaculture zones and enhance environment management capacity. To implement
these guidelines, many households, namely Lien's, Muoi's, Lan's and others in Vuong Loc
have exchanged fields to each other to expand aquaculture area to larger scale.

    3.6. The poor access to fishery benefits:

Aquaculture, exploitation, service, and processing are actually diversified in terms of
employment, investment volume, and technical requirements, thus consideration are needed
to find the best for the poor to access.

  Typical aquaculture pattern in Thinh Loc commune

  There are 8 people in the family of Mr. Le Doan Due, 46 years old and Mrs. Nguyen Thi
  Nhu, 42 years old, in hamlet 4 Quang Trung, Thinh Loc commune, Can Loc district, Ha
  Tinh. Their family used to be a poor one, for three years now they have invested in fish
  farming, which helped them not only escape poverty but also become better-off. Many
  people mentioned this case as a typical pattern of business households. Mr. Due made a
  pond of 500m2 in their own garden for integrated production. They invest in food for cow
  and pig, and use waste of cow and pig to raise frog and fish. Below is our discussion:

  - In the current context of Thinh Loc commune, which career do you think may help people
  become better-off?

  - Only aquaculture.

  - Which species to be exact?

  - Frog may bring about high efficiency as the crop takes only 2.5-3 months, a stable
  market provided, we can get net profit of 5 million if we invested 10 million.

  - What problems do you often face in aquaculture?

  - Funding. Little fund results in small scale and total output is not enough for wholesale,
  so you often lose. However, I find myself lack of advanced technique and there is not
  sample pattern for us to draw experiences.

  - If given a chance, can you expand production scale?

  - I can definitely expand scale if I have more money.

  - How much do you need to develop?

  - About VND100 million .

  - Can many people in the hamlet promote like you?

  - Yes, many, particularly those having good conditions available..



    4. Recommendation:

    4.1.    Basic factors contributed to community income diversification:

    * Aquaculture development is one of various income generation activities for community
at large scale as almost all eco-regions of Can Loc district have potentials of fish farming,


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 91

particularly: (1) In Nghen riverside area people can do fish farming in field, pond and pen in
lake with traditional fish, then they can raise other kinds for export with high volume such as
acclimated tilapia, green lobster,... (2) In a half-mountain half-plain area: people can raise
traditional fish in field, pond or reservoir. Seed and fish can be raised on bamboo cages or
reservoirs. (3) Middle area: Traditional fish farming in field or pond; Can raise high value
kinds of frog or tortoise...

    * Combine aquaculture and exploitation and processing to diversify product items.

    * Expand fishery services in association with various commercial activities.

    * Organize tourism activities based on coastal area advantages

    * Afforestation in coastal areas for protection as well as to increase people's income.

    4.2.    Major factors to diversify income for the poor:

    * Only supported by community can the poor access stable income generation, including
supports from the better-off and counterparts. According to officials of Vuong Loc
commune, one solution for the poor is to establish volunteer networks in certain trade. They
themselves together organize a network and set their own regulations to support each other.



  Funding for the poor should be taken into thorough consideration. If the fund is too big,
  repayment may be difficult, even with unsatisfactory efficiency. A sufficient fund can on
  one hand make investor feel secure, and on the other hand facilitate the poor to improve
  income and escape poverty. However, there should be supervision mechanism so that the
  poor make efforts in production as well. In aquaculture projects, the poor can be
  divided in groups composing rich households, medium and poor ones as well. Initial
  bases should be covered by commune or district so that the poor are given positive
  supports in farming and husbandry. (official group of Vuong Loc commune)

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs 93

    5.1. Freshwater aquaculture development is one of activities directly affect mitigation
pressure on coastal fishery benefits.

    5.2 In addition to central projects with a wide range of products for export, it is essential
to establish a pattern of production to serve local markets in longer period.

    5.3. Investment should neither be too broad in many areas which limits the scale nor
inconsistent funding. Training should be in combination with piloting and implementation.
Investment should be focused on a close process to develop good pilot that can be reapplied.

    5.4. Concerning the poor: Besides direct forms of support, assistance via community may
be introduced to help them escape poverty in a sustainable manner.

I. SOCIO-ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND FISHERSY
RESOURCES OF HA TINH PROVINCE

1. Ha Tinh province
Ha Tinh province is situated from 17o53'36" - 18o46'24" North and 105o10'48" - 106o29'30"
East, share border with Nghe An province in the North, Quang Binh province in the South,
Laos DPR in the West and Tonkin Gulf and China Sea in the East.
Total province's area is approximately 605,574 ha, accounting for 1.825% of total inland
area of Vietnam. Agricultural land 96,804 ha, forest land accounts for 207,888 ha, special-
use land 37,160 ha, residential land 6,823.55 ha and bare land or unused land 256,895.80 ha.
Ha Tinh province includes 8 districts and 2 towns. Two districts (Huong Son and Huong
Khe) and Hong Linh town are in mountainous areas, Duc Tho district have both hilly and flat
area, and remain districts (Thach Ha, Nghi Xuan, Can Loc, Cam Xuyen and Ky Anh) are
coastal, flat land, hilly and mountainous areas. Mountainous areas accounts for 79.25% of
total province's area. Natural resources of the province are very diverse. The province has
two natural protected areas namely Ke Go and Vu Quang.
Climate of Ha Tinh province is a typical monsoon tropical climate which is characterized by
a fairly long dry season with hot and dry winds blowing from Laos DPR and a fairly long
rainy season with rains, storms and floods. Followed by rainy times in an interval of two
seasons is cold time. Storms occur every year. In all three seasons, there are floods that result
in serious crop loss

Ecological and agricultural areas
Ha Tinh has 4 key ecological and agricultural areas, each area has its own typical
geographical, cropping pattern and socio-economic features.
Hilly region

Hilly area is an intermediary area between a flat area and a moderate steep mountainous area,
30,036.47 ha (4.96% of total province's area). Hilly area is a potential area for development
of cropping, husbandry, agriculture and forestry. Key crops here are potatoes and sweet
potatoes, cassava, soybean and maize. Fruit trees are increasingly grew in this area (e.g.
orange, grapefruit, mandarin orange, custard apple, etc.)
Mountainous region
Most the mountainous region is situated in the Western part of the province with an area of
approximately 479,977 ha (or 79.25% of total province's area). There are the Rao Co
mountain range with highest peak of 2,235 m in Huong Khe district and other mountain
ranges with altitude ranging from 1,290 ­ 1,407 m. Arable soil layer here is very thin and
poor. There are only 45,691.93 ha (9.51%) of mountainous area that can be used for
agricultural purposes. So far this area has not yet been accessible by roads. However, path

access are available and forest is exhaustedly exploited.
Flat area

This area is situated in between coastal area and hilly area, stretching from valleys and
alongside river's banks, accounts for approximately 54,259.43 ha (8.95% of total province's
area). This is considered as a key rice basket area of the province, in which two rice crops per
year can be cultivated in Most its area. Population populate densily. Rice productivity may be
high, especially where two crops per year can be cultivated. But in some areas, due to lack of
irrigation works, it is impossible to cultvate two rice crops per year like other parts of the
region.
Sandry coastal strip of land
Ha Tinh's coastal line is 137 km long and its water areas are 41,300.15 ha (accounts for
6.81% of total province's area). Arable land is often saline. There are 4 big river mouths that
create wetland potential for aquaculture and convenient water ways, particulalry Vung Ang
(in Ky Anh), where a big sea port can be built.

Infrastructural settings

Irrigation system is degraded, particularly Linh Cam water pumping station and irrigation
channels of of this system and Ke Go water reservoir. Existing irriagation system is unable
to to provide enough water for agricultural production. Due to a poor and degraded irrigation
sytem many areas in Ha Tinh suffer drought and have no possibility for 2 cropping patterns.
Coastal areas of Nghi Xuan, Can Loc, Thach Ha districts are saline and lack of fresh water
not only for cultivation but also for livestock.

 During the period of 1996- 2004, Ha Tinh had mobilized a significant investment for
 development of socio-economic infrastructural. The province invested in expanding
 transport systems, sea ports, and industrial zones. So far infrastructure of Ha Tinh is
 considered relatively better than that of other provinces. However, in order to respond to
 development demands for coming time, current infrastructure is still short in terms of
 quantity and insynchornic.

In recent years, agricultural sub-sector is a key player, contributed to stabilize livelihoods of
the province. In 2004, agricultural sub-sector contributed 5,233 billions VND to GDP of
province, accounts for 45.9%. In the period of 2001-2004, crop productivity had increased
rapidly to more than 10% per crop and an increase in crop and plantation productivity
accounts for 63% of total agriculture.

Livestock husbandry is an important income source, in 2004, it accounted to 33.25% of total
production values of whole agriculture sector ­ that is a relatively high proportion compared
with other provinces in the country. However, husbandry productivity is still low because of
diseases, poor quality strains, and lack of capitals. In recent times, some districts of Ha Tinh
are encouraged to raise hybrid Sind bulls and pigs for meat due to high economic values.

At present, the province does not have smoketack industry. Industry and handicraft industry
are very small and still at early stage of development. There are some small-scaled
agricultural and fishery processing units. However, it is difficult for them to improve and
upgrade their production due to lack of capitals. In 2004, there are 12,037 industrial
production units that are employing 3.9% of total work force in different economic sectors of
the province. According to orientations and objectivies for development, it is planned that the
province is going to exploit a metal mine in Thach Khe and establish a metallurgy complex
there.

Province's trading centers are being formed and rural markets are relatively developed
satisfying needs for goods exchange of local people. In 2004, total labourers working in
trading and services industries accounts for 5.56% of total labour force in other industries of
Ha Tinh.

Assessment on poverty situation

Ha Tinh has 262 communes, 37 of which are poor communes and 23 others are extremely
poor. Until now, poverty reduction has achieved significant results, many poverty reduction
measures have been implemented and yielding good results. Poor people's living standards
have been improved.

 In addition to benifit from National Target Program for Poverty Reduction and Job Creation
 of the Government, the province has benefits from other international -funded projects to
 support a comprehensive socio-economic development in rural areas, creating great change
 in quality of life of Ha Tinh people. In the past 5 years, the province has generate more than
 142,000 jobs for labourers. Poverty rate has reduced significantly, from 28.8% in 2000, to
 10% in 2004 (according to old poverty standards). However, according to new poverty
 standards, poverty rate of Ha Tinh remains high, approximately 30%, as high as that of

 Northern Central region. Therefore, poverty reduction is still one of the most important goals
 of the province in coming time.

Capture fishery and aquaculture

Ha Tinh can exploit a 137km-long coastal line with more than 20 small and big rivers
running into the sea through 4 river mouths can be used for aquaculture and plantation of
mangrove forest. This area has 18,337 ha, of which 6.850 ha are brackish and fresh water
surface (brackish water surface is 2,850 ha and and fresh water surface is 4,000ha) are used
for aquaculture, mainly shrimp and crab raising. Total shirmp raising areas are 2,650 ha with
total output of 2,330 tones in 2005. Most of these areas belong to districts of Ky Anh, Cam
Xuyen, Thach Ha, Can Loc and Nghi Xuan. Aquaculture has been developing in recent years
(since 1992) thank to credit support programs. Coastal areas have approximately 1,243 ha
with potentials for intensive shrimp raising. Productivity of intensive shrimp raising can
reach at 60-200 kg per ha per year.

In 2005, total labors involved in production and business operations of fishery sector are
44,000 people, labors involved in capture fishery are 12,000 people, in aquaculture: 24.500
people, in fishery processing: 5,400 people, and in boat repair services: 2,100 people.

According to Department of Fisheries of Ha Tinh province, the province's natural resources
 for sustainable aquaculture development are as follows:

    -   Sea waters have various kinds of fisheries (According to figures of Institute of
        Seafood Studies: there are 60 kinds and 20 kinds of high-economic value fish and
        shrimp respectively in Ha Tinh's sea waters);

    -   Large area for aquaculture (23,000 ha), abundant supply of labours, convenient or
        easily-accessible transportation network, and support from local and provincial
        authorities through resolutions for fishery development and promotion (Directive No.
        04 CT/UB issued by Provincial People Committee on promotion and intensification
        of economic transformation and aquaculture development dated 14th March, 2005;
        Decision No. 633 QD/UB- NL2 on approval of a Program for Protection and
        Development of aquatic resources of Ha Tinh province until 2010 dated 8th April,
        2005; Decision No. 77/2005/QD-UBND dated 7th September, 2005 promulgating on
        some support policies for aquaculture development for the period of 2005-2010) are
        important basis for protection and exploitation of aquatic resources and livelihood
        improvement for local people.

    -   Beside, people have been practicing capture fishery industry for many generations
        and markets for aquatic products are relatively stable. A movement for promotion of
        fresh water fish raising has been growing strongly in some localities like Duc Tho,
        Can Loc, Nghi Xuan, and Hong Linh town. In 2005, areas for brackish aquaculture
        were 2,850 ha, 2 times higher than that in 2001, areas for fresh water fish raising were


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs103

       3,300 ha, increasing 1,100 ha. Especially a combined fish raising: fish raising and rice
       cultivation, or fish and duck raising are being practiced widely. Some fishery
       extension models have proven effective, contributing to promotion and wider
       application of production models like mono-sexual tilapia or intensive shrimp raising
       (an industrial, intensive shrimp raising area in Ky Nam has been invested with tens
       billion dong and located in an area of 85 ha. So far 12 ha of this work has been put
       into operation since 2004 and producing good results), turtle, frog, common tiger
       prawn, etc.

However, aquaculture and capture fishery is facing with some big difficulties as follows:

    -  Great weather fluctuation (sudden sunshine, rain, or flood, etc.);

    -  Because people have low educational background and are still very poor, they do not
       have enough investments in boats or ships for capture fishery or aquaculture either;

    -  Capture fishery is still fragmented. Total machined boats with capacity of less than 20
       CV (horse power) still remain about 90%; Values of products of capture fishery are
       not high.        Offshore capture fishery program is not carried out and managed
       effectively (at present Ha Tinh has 15 poorly-equipped offshore capture fishery fleets
       such as lacking of fish-searching equipment and facilities to seek for new fishing
       grounds, etc.). Most fish-catching forces of the province are exploiting fish in inshore,
       shallow waters and using some environmentally or ecologically-harmful methods
       (e.g. using mines, electrical gears, or heavy light, etc.) that is a worrisome issue of
       competent authorities involved in protection of aquatic resources.

    -  Infrastructure of aquaculture areas is still underdeveloped; disease control system and
       facilities and expenses for disease prevention are very limited. Some shrimp raising
       areas have low effectiveness because outbreak of disease of shrimp always happens.

    -   Production and services supply system for fresh and salt water fishery strains is
       considered weak because it can satisfy 30-40% of the province's demands only,
       particularly; supply of common tiger pawn strains is suffering some difficulties.

    -  Though it is considered as an important economic sector of the province, in which
       aquaculture is considered as a breakthrough, the province had had aquaculture
       extension policies, in fact the province's budget to support for this sector is very
       limited, far from enough to assist and promote a very weak sector. Therefore,
       Department of Fisheries proposes following solutions: provide preferential credits for
       poor households, improve capacity for fisher folks, develop investment projects for
       infrastructure, issue policies to stimulate production and establishment of
       cooperatives or production units, and construction of fish markets and sea ports for
       fishing boats and ships to shelter from storms, and develop some pilot models for
       experience exchange and learning among people.

2. Thach Ha District

 Thach Ha district is situated at the centre of Ha Tinh province, borders districts of Can Loc,
 Cam Xuyen and Huong Khe. Across the district are roads such as National Highway No.1A,
 provincial roads like 15A, 2, 3... and waterways routes like Nghen river, Giam river and Do
 Diem river. Some ports are located in the district, namely Cua Sot port, Ho Do port, etc.

       Terrain of the district is classified into three separate regions: mountainous area in the
 South West, delta in the district centre at average altitude of 5m above the sea level, and
 coastal area including communes of Thach Hai, Thach Van, Thach Kim, Thach Tri and
 Thach Ban.

      Thach Ha is situated in monsoon tropical region with an annual average rainfall of
 2,500mm, an average temperature of 23OC, and annual average humidity of over 80%.
 hydrographical system of the district is influenced by rivers like Do Diem river, Cua Sot
 river, Nghen river and Cay river with a total valley area of 800 square km. At present, water
 sources for irrigation and daily life of people are mainly from Ke Go Lake and rain-water.
 Underground water source in the district is rather large in reserve but depth of this source is
 shallow and affected by alum.

      Mineral resources in the district include Thach Khe iron-mine with a 540-ton reserve,
 and Emenit mine in Thach Hoi and Thach Ban.

      Thach Ha has a coast of 27km and Cua Sot ­ one of the 4 largest fishing grounds in Ha
 Tinh province. Annual capture yield is from 3,500 to 4,000 tons. Area for salt production in
 the district is about 350 ha with an annual output of 2,200-2,500 tons. In the district, coastal
 area of Thach Hai has great tourism potential.

       Total population of Thach Ha district is over 18,000 people. There are 37 communes
 including five mountainous communes in program 135 of the government and 16 coastal
 communes (of which 6-7 communes are specialized in fish raising).

       Total area in the district is 38,894.54ha, in which area for aquaculture is 998.46ha, area
 of used rivers, streams and water surface is 3889.25ha, and unused flat area is 3,683.53ha
 (this is an important resource exploitable and useable for development of aquaculture or
 other industries in the district). Area for agriculture is 1,410ha, in which areas of brackish
 water and fresh water are about 910ha and 500ha correspondingly (in 2005 only shrimp
 breeding area of about 453ha). Area for aquaculture has been double due to shifting from
 rice cultivation to aquaculture and about 200ha of cultivable land has been transformed to
 land for aquaculture. In the next 5-6 years, it is planned to use another 1000ha of
 uncultivable land for aquaculture production.

      Aquaculture economics development in the district

    -  Capture fishery: yield in 2005 was 4,500 tons including 450 tons of cuttle-fish, 50
       tons of shrimps, 800 tons of fish for export and 3,200 tons of fish of all kinds.
       Communes with large yield of aquatic products are Thach Kim, Thach Hai, Thach
       Bang, Thach Long, Thach Lac; total number of boats is 720 with a total capacity of
       13,600CV. Logistic services for capture fishery have been developed: some boat and
       ship building establishments have been started, fishing equipment providers and ice
       making plants have been in operation; Cua Sot fish port is being built in an area of
       3ha with an investment budget of VND 33 billion.

    -  Fishery processing: processed products in 2005 included 300 tons of fresh and dried
       cluttle-fish, 250 tons of shrimps, 500 tons of salty paste, 500 tons of salted fish and
       400 tons of dried products of all kinds. Processing of aquatic products mainly carried
       out according to traditional methods to serve domestic market. Besides, in the district
       there is Do Diem aquatic product export - import enterprise (Thach Son) and three
       private processing businesses in Thach Kim, Thach Bang...

    -  Aquaculture: Aquaculture has taken advantage and well exploited uncultivated water
       surface, changed some low productivity salt-marsh and rice farms to aquaculture area.
       Mollusc breeding, especially oyster and mussel breeding, has been developed,
       generating a significant income source for coastal fisherfolks with an annual
       productivity of 10-20 tons/ha and a total yield of thousands of tons, satisfying
       domestic consumption and export to China and Laos... Fresh water aquaculture has
       achieved some significant changes: in the past fish was bred in traditional ways in
       which popular kinds of fish such as black carps, carps, mud carps, and tench
       breams... were kept in ponds, swamps and lakes to make the best of water surface.
       Since 2003 model of fish raising and rice cultivation combination to improve
       production efficiency in an area has been welcomed by many farmers, so that 150ha
       of rice fields has been used to develop fish production and other goods. In 2005, total
       area of aquaculture in the district was 1,210ha (excluding 200ha for industrial shrimp
       breeding of Viet My company in Thach Tri commune), including:

       + Brackish water aquaculture: 701ha (570ha for common tiger prawn and crab
       breeding, 140ha for mollusk breeding)

       + Fresh water aquaculture: 350ha

       + Combined fish raising and rice cultivation models: 150ha

       + Total output of aquaculture and domestic exploitation is 2,500 tons


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs108

        + Area for semi-intensive and intensive fish farming is 100ha; the rest is for extensive
        farming.

        Up to now the district's fishery sector has created 10,200 jobs with 4,500 in capture
        fishery, 1,200 in fishery processing, 2,000 in aquaculture and the rest number in
        aquaculture services

        Economic development situations in Thach Ha district

      Even though Thanh Ha is located close to a town, its economic development is at an
 average level (below a half) of Ha Tinh province. Poverty rate of the district is 39.2%
 (according to new poverty standard).               District economic structure is agriculture led.
 Agriculture, forestry and fishery contribute 75% GDP of the district while industry,
 handicraft industry and construction account for 20% and services take 5%.

 Ranking from top down of district income generating industries is as follows:

      1. Agricultural production (cultivation and livestock husbandry)

      2. Aquatic products (capture fishery, aquaculture and fishery processing)

      3. Services for small scale industries

      4. Afforestation and forestry product exploitation

      5. Labour export, ore exploitation and other industries

      6. Salt production

      In terms of two key livelihoods that create most incomes for the district as agricultural
      and aquatic production, the district has met with following difficulties:

              Difficulties in agricultural production

              - market

              - weather

              - Material inputs (high price of fertilizer and agricultural material inputs)

              - Weak infrastructure (inner-field roads)

              - Inequitably intellectual standards of people, lack of science and technology
                   knowledge and lack of market information

              - short of capital

              - Impoverished soil and sophisticated topography

              - Small scale production practices remained

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs109

              Difficulties in aquaculture

              - Aquatic resources is becoming exhausted

              - Ponds and lakes have not been planned synchronically

              - Lack of capital, aquaculture is totally funded by state budget and mainly for
                   operations of staff apparatus. Purchasing of boats and rafts and construction
                   of aquaculture infrastructure are entirely paid by people (except offshore
                   fishing program that is inefficient).

              - Sources of seeds and breeds are not available in the district (they are bought
                   from other provinces such as Hue, Da Nang, etc...)

              - Backward capture techniques and facilities with majority of 18CV boats;
                   undiversified sources of fish, capture is mainly based on floating fish and
                   fish deep in the water have not been exploited.

              - In short of science and technology knowledge on aquaculture

              - Processing is mainly by hand

              - Diseases

              - Natural disasters

              - People's attitudes towards environment and fishing ground protection are
                   limited (mine and electrical gear are still used for fishing)

              - Processing technology is unavailable

              - Weak saline prevention dykes

              - Unstable output markets

              - Anchorages for capture fishery are unavailable (to shelter from storms)

    Besides, the district has many advantages for production activities that increase incomes
    as follows:

              - Plentiful labor forces

              - Industrial plants have been developed

              - Convenient transportation (roads and waterways, except inner region
              transportation system)

              - Having orientations for planning of crops and livestock until 2010

              - Diversified and rich fishing ground

              - Aquaculture has been determined as a core sector

              - Strong and stable political system

              - Bays and fish ports are under construction.

By current time, Thach Ha has enjoyed available supports as follows:

    - Irrigation system have been constructed by 50-60%

    - Models for cultivation and livestock husbandry established by development programs
        such as IFAD, Belgium OXFAM, etc... are available

    - Rural markets have been invested and constructed

    - Cross-breeding with Sind bulls

    - Aquaculture support systems are available

    - Offshore fishing is funded by state budget but inefficient.

    At present, hunger elimination and poverty reduction strategy of the district focuses on
    core targets as follows:

    1. Concentrate to economic sector, adequate zoning and diversification of local
        industries

    2. Focus on drawing up cultivation models and process of post harvest preservation and
        processing.

    3. Strengthen livestock husbandry and freshwater fish raising

    4. For aquatic products: concentrate on aquaculture based on                     innovated extensive
        farming, improve management of aquaculture ponds according to planning and
        manage water supply and drainage systems

    5. Attach special importance to secondary jobs and develop labor exports

    6. Promote trade and services

Environmental sustainability of income generating industries remains low. Pesticide
utilization in agricultural activities have impacted environment and environmental hygiene
and fishing by using mine, electrical gear and heavy lighting has influenced significantly on
environment and aquatic resources. Some small scaled industries such as rock exploitation,
brick kiln or fishery processing plant have been polluted even though insignificantly.


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs111

Orientations of priority investment in coming time are:

    1. Agriculture (investment in irrigation, seeds, breeds and science and technology
        transfer)

    2. Aquaculture (investment in improvement of infrastructure serving boats and
        ships and aquaculture areas)

    3. Investment in aquaculture and agricultural processing

    4. Investment in developing crops: eucalyptus, casuarinas, Acacia, cajuput, etc... in
        coastal idle sandy areas.

3. Thach Hai commune

Thach Hai is a coastal commune that situated in the north east of Thach Ha district: its east-
side borders the sea, west-side borders Thach Ban, Thach Dinh and Thach Khe communes
and south-side borders Thach Lac commune. Thach Hai commune has 1,391ha of coastal
areas in total, 10 ha of natural ponds and lakes, and 40ha of wetland areas. commune possess
about 70 fishing boats with capacity of 18-22 horsepower (serving for nghe te ­ a type of fish
capture using electric gear).

Commune total population is 3,500 people. There are 5 villages in which one village is a
purely agriculture-based village, two specialize in fishery and other two are mixed of
agriculture and capture fishery. This commune specializes in capture fishery with fishery
outputs in 2005 was 1,300tons, decreased by 300 tons in compared with 2004. In addition,
this commune has tourism potential thanks to its beautiful coastline. However, these tourism
potential are threatened by mining plan in Thach Khe commune. Investors are concerned that
mining activities shall impact the environment and coastal landscape therefore they
temporarily stop constructing tourist areas.

Infrastructure system: transportation roads are fairly good except some inter-village roads.
The commune is constructing asphalted inner-village roads linking Thuong Hai ­ Nam Hai.
Irrigation system is almost unavailable.

Agricultural areas are 241.89 ha in total. Being an impoverished coastal land area and lack of
water, the commune has transferred its crop structure from rice cultivation to peanut
cultivation that can create higher productivity. Arable land for peanut is 115 ha, for rice is
41ha, for sweet potato is 70ha and the remaining are for others.

Livestock husbandry specializes on cows (2,000 cows), goats (2,000 goats) and pigs (3,500
pigs, mainly are sows)

Forestry: tree planting for regeneration bare land and denuded hills in 30ha


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs112

In commune income structure, agro-forestry and livestock husbandry contribute 40%, fishery
accounts for 30% and tourism services and labor exports take 30%.

Being a poor commune in the district, its household poverty rate is 52% (based on new
poverty standards)

In terms of fishing, the commune has main advantages and difficulties as follows:

Advantages:

    - Being near the sea with many natural ponds and lakes and wetland is advantageous
       for aquaculture.

    - Fairly good infrastructure, especially good transportation roads, is convenient for
       traveling and goods exchanges.

    - Abundance of labors after harvesting time. People are skillful and rich in experience
       in fishing. Capture facilities and fishing industry have been developed.

    - Experiences on fishery processing even household-based fishery processing level
       only.

Difficulties:

    - Profitability from seafood resources run risk of being exhausted, lack of capital,
       fishing boats have no anchorage (their anchorages are 8km far from the commune so
       that they hamper product preservation and processing as well as fisherman traveling)

    - Lack of equipment to exploit deep water fish. commune has not been equipped with
       new capture techniques

    - Market branding is in short or less developed. Lack of product preserving facilities
       and techniques. According to commune staff, in a fishing reason, its fisherman fish
       1,500 tons of seafood, in which only 500 tons are sold and the other 1,000 tons are
       used for shrimp paste.

    - However, the most serious barrier for seafood development now is no support policy
       such as tax exemption or reduction to encourage aquaculture development. Fishery
       extension has not been considered.

       -   In terms of general situation, there are many redundant labors in Thach Hai, while
    income generating industries have not developed here.

 Thach Hai people's committee has proposed key industries as follows:

       1. Invest to shifting occupational structure into off-farm sectors (aquaculture,
            processing industry, etc...)

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs113

        2. Create fish market

        3. Field reclamation (unproductive rice field are changed to aquaculture one), ensure
            irrigation

        4. Upgrade equipments; carry out multi-industries in a boat (exploitation of fish,
            shrimp, tiny shrimp, deep water fish, etc...)

        5. Improve awareness about aquaculture, seafood capture and environment
            protection techniques.

Main income resources of people in Thach Hai commune are ranked as follows:

    1. Fishery: males are in charge of capture activities, females specialize in product
        processing and marketing. This industry is at risks from natural disasters, unsafe (due
        to explosive utilization), etc...

    2. Livestock husbandry: mainly taken by females. This industry often faces risks such
        as diseases, unstable market price (outputs), weak breeds, etc...

    3. Agriculture: mainly taken by females. Its main risks are bad weather, pestilent
        insects, sandy land (unsuitable), low productivity, led by one season crops, etc...

4. Tuong Son commune

Located in the south east of Ha Tinh province, the commune is an inland area in coastal line
of Thach Ha district. The commune total area is 823.19ha, in which cultivation area is 334ha
(area for 2 rice crops per year is 119ha, for other cash crops is 130ha), potential area for
aquaculture is 165ha (planned areas for aquaculture is 74ha brackish and salty water and
34ha freshwater). In the last 3 years, the commune has intensified rice cultivation and fish
raising to create higher economic efficiency.

 The commune's river dyke is 9km long and often infected by salt. It is a purely agriculture-
based commune with terraced fields, impoverished soil and lack of water. Agricultural
income contributes 70% of total incomes, husbandry accounts for 10% and fisheries, and
other industries make up 20%.

Infrastructure: inter-village roads are earthen, in which there are only 5km of asphalted roads
and 5km of concrete channels in the end of Ke Go irrigation project.

There are 10 villages in the commune with total population of 4,389 people/ 967 households.
According to new poverty standards, there are 412 poor households' accounts for 42.6%.

Given such natural conditions, the commune meets advantages and difficulties in sustainable
fishery development as follows:


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs114

Advantages:

       - There are 9km of river dykes and a river for water regulation

       - Areas for aquaculture is extendable

       - A clear and easy-accessible credit regime

       - 1,600 labors are redundant

       - Hardworking people

       - Driven by a resolution on aquaculture development

Nevertheless, people here face with difficulties as:

       - Flood-tide influences

       - Lack of investment capital

       - Diseases

       - A plan for ponds and lakes and for transforming low productive rice fields into
            areas for aquaculture is unavailable

       - Market is absent (or price is driven by private traders)

       - Lack of seeds and breeds

       - Abundant idle time and unemployment

       - Support from projects is unavailable

       - Due to severe weather conditions, aquaculture can last for only 4 months in a year

       - Less developed aquaculture infrastructure that requires large investment.
            Nevertheless, people here are lack of capital and afraid of risks so that investment
            has not been significantly carried out.

       - Polluted water sources (as a consequence of the province's dumping ground)

       - Cultivation, husbandry and aquaculture techniques are unavailable

II. MAIN FINDINGS FROM COMMUNITY ANALYSIS

1. Livelihood means, risks, and impacts on the poor and sustainable development

In general for coastal areas, people are more likely to diversify their income sources with
different livelihood means. Characteristics of terrain and natural climate in coastal areas
allow development of various industries: agriculture, industrial crops in sand-banks, marine


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs115

tourism and eco-tourism... and especially exploiting source of seafood and brackish-water
and fresh-water aquaculture. However, it can be seen that while natural conditions bring
about many income sources for people in coastal area, they also affect their livelihood means
(i.e. changeable weather and climate, storms, floods, low quality land or saline infected and
infertile soil...). On the other hand, exploitation of natural resources must consider
sustainable development - exploiting together with preserving, maintaining and developing
natural resources. For this reason, when consider and evaluate livelihood means, research
group used many criteria, especially such criteria as possibility of income generating for the
poor, possible risks, sustainability (pollution and environmental ruin) and supports from the
Government, local government as well as international organizations...

 Two surveyed communes are Thach Hai (a coastal commune) and Tuong Son (an inland
commune). Their conditions of terrain and climate are different, so their possibility of
exploiting natural income sources to develop livelihood means is not the same. Therefore, in
our analysis, evaluation and classification according to priorities of livelihood means, we will
consider communes separately.

    · For Thach Hai, as a coastal commune, inshore capture fishery is livelihood means,
which generates highest income for the commune's people. Nearly 100% males in working
age use this livelihood means and have an average monthly income of VND 1 million per
household. This livelihood means brings about a stable income source for poor people in
coastal area. However, people here live on fish catching only in fishing season of about 5-6
months. For the rest of the year they must look for other jobs. Despite being a largest income
source, due to poor fishing equipment (mainly fishing net, small-mesh net to scoop up marine
tiny shrimps; small boats of 18-22 horsepower unable to go offshore fishing), sometimes
people here must use destructive means of fishing (fishing using mines, electrical gears,
heavy lighting...) harmful to people life and have bad effects on marine ecological
environment.

On the other hand, inshore capture fishery often bears many risks, especially weather: sudden
storm, flood are often seen in the central region. Wrong and abusive capture has made
resource of aquatic products become exhausted. In the opinion of local people, in recent
years resource of aquatic products in sea has dramatically reduced.

Livelihood means of second largest income source in Thach Hai is fishery processing (fish
source, shrimp paste, dry fish, dry small shrimp and small shrimp paste). 90% of females in
commune take part in this livelihood means and get an average annual income of about VND
3 million per household. Although fishery processing in Thach Hai manual and mainly in
households, this livelihood means is highly appreciated by community because it helps to


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs116

create jobs for most women and has potential for future development. For the time being,
some women in the commune get loans from Oxfam Britain fund, supports women with an
interest rate of 1.5% (first loan of VND 300,000-500,000, second loan of VND 1-1.5 million,
interest is paid by installments in 18 months). Besides, Women Union forms saving groups of
13-15 people, each contributing VND 200,000 without interest rate to lend to group members
on a rotational basis. With this source of loans, women in Nam Hai village have founded four
models of fishery processing to provide seafood for market inside and outside the province.
For this livelihood means, many women in the commune think that it is necessary to develop
fishery processing models and they wish to get more loans to build fishery processing groups
in the commune. However, this livelihood means will have negative effect on the
environment unless there are good means of preservation and processing.

Due to lack of modern equipment and facilities to preserve and process caught fishes,
spoiling fish may pollute the environment.

The third livelihood means is agriculture. Despite coastal area where soil is infertile with
mainly sand and lack of water (rain-fed fields and no irrigation canal) which enables only
one crop a year, all households in this area have agricultural land and produce mainly to
subsistence due to old thought: `farmers must have land for cultivation'. Although there has
been a change in crop structure (changing from rice cultivation to peanut and sweet potato
cultivation), agricultural production has brought about a very low income source (about VND
200,000 per year per household for farming and about VND500,000 per year per household
for livestock husbandry) due to high cost inputs. In addition, use of fertilizer and insecticides
for cultivation causes bad effects on the environment.

The fourth livelihood means is freshwater fish rising. At present there are 15 ponds and lakes
in Nam Hai village to raise fish of all kinds, call for tender every three years, mainly
including: catfish, butterfish, carp, African carp, and pike and trench bream. However,
freshwater fish rising in Thach Hai is under-developed, spontaneous, and little invested as
people there only buy a small amount of breeding fish and make use of available sources of
residual food for fish. As a result productivity is very low. Average income of freshwater fish
raising households is VND 500,000 per year per household. Fish products are consumed
mainly by household themselves and local people in village and commune. In the opinion of
local people, if they have money to invest in high-quality fish breeds and concentrate feed for
fish, productivity will be much higher and, of course, generate 5 times higher income than
that from agricultural production. Therefore, in the future this will be one of livelihood
means helping the poor to diversify their income source because it does little harm to the
environment and brings about a significant income source for local people in coastal area.



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs117

However, this livelihood means can only meet demand of the commune and the district,
because freshwater fish is popular and can be bred in other regions.

 The fifth livelihood means is small business (groceries in market and hamlet...), which is
used by several households generating an all year-round job with an average income of VND
200,000-300,000 per month. This kind of small business has few chances to develop due to
the poor demand of local people.

In Tuong Son commune as an inland commune in coastal area, major livelihood means of
local people include:

First is agricultural production. This livelihood means accounts for 70% of total income of
people. It is a traditional way of income generation for rural people. However, for coastal
people, agricultural production and rice cultivation often face many difficulties: weather:
prolonged rains (water-logged soil and miss of cropping seasons resulting in low
productivity; high temperature and drought resulting in lack of water for irrigation
(particularly at the end of canal) ­ in 2005 the commune completely lost 45ha of rice fields
due to lack of water); bad quality seeds, insects... In order to overcome such difficulties, the
commune has had three water pumping stations built; seed fields grown; saline prevention
dyke repaired and supplied concrete guidance in rice cultivation technique according to
cropping schedule and season... As a result agricultural production has been improved. On
the other hand, too high input costs lead to low productivity of agricultural production.
Additionally, utilization of fertilizers and insecticides does harm to the environment.

As for livestock husbandry, households often raise pigs, cattle, and poultry. There is no big
cattle herd. Commonly-observed difficulties in livestock husbandry includes epidemic
diseases because the poor have little money to invest in standard livestock husbandry
facilities, there is no market for product consumption and the commune has not had new
animal breeds such as porker, hybrid Sind bulls, and lack of feed and fodder for cattle. On the
other hand, with an unhygienic system of livestock husbandry facilities, livestock husbandry
also does harm to the environment.

 Second livelihood means is aquaculture. At present in Tuong Son commune, model of
combined fish-rice rising is developing as it brings about high economic returns. With fish-
rice rising, little investment is needed as local people only need to leave fish in rice field and
make use of available feed sources and it is harmless to the environment. This livelihood
means may develop in the future as it is suitable with coastal conditions and generates
income for the poor.

Currently, aquaculture (shrimp, crab, turtle...) has started to develop in Tuong Son. In Bac
Binh village, for instance, there are 68 aquaculture-based households. Local government has

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs118

certain supports such as tax extension and yearly training courses for aquaculture-based
households. However, this livelihood means requires much investment and have high risks
due to lack of experience and aquaculture techniques. Local people cannot access market
and are forced to sell at a low price to private traders (their price for common tiger prawn is
only half of market price). In addition, risks of natural calamity and diseases are also
obstacles for development of this livelihood means. On the other hand, it is not easy for poor
people to access aquaculture because it requires big investment and scientific techniques
knowledge.

 Third livelihood means is secondary jobs: construction workers, hired laborers after harvest.
This livelihood means is unstable in terms of jobs and income, but it is a significant income
source for the poor.

Based on surveys in Thach Hai and Tuong Son communes, we have made comments as
follows:

    -   Diversification of income sources in two communes is different due to their different
land natures and natural conditions as well as capacity to access and exploit coastal sources.

                   Thach Hai                                                 Tuong Son

    - Major income source is inshore                         - Major income source is from
       capture fishery                                             agriculture even though productivity

    - Limited possibility for aquaculture                          is low (mainly based on rice

       development                                                 cultivation while livestock husbandry
                                                                   has not been developed)
    - Fishery processing has been initially
       carried out but mainly manual and                     - There are many possibilities for

       taken place in households                                   aquaculture development that
                                                                   generate higher incomes than
    - Limited incomes form agriculture due                         agriculture does, especially combined
       to impoverished soil and lack of                            methods of fish raising and rice
       water                                                       cultivation
    - Less influenced by market                              - Non-agricultural production has not
    - Influenced by weather and climate                            yet been developed
       conditions                                            - Largely influenced by the market and
                                                                   price is influenced by private traders

                                                             - Significantly influenced by
                                                                   unexpected weather conditions


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs119

   -   According to general analysis on impacts on individual livelihood of various factors
(income level, environmental sustainability and availability of supports) in two communes,
livelihoods are ranked by priority orders as follows:

    +     Aquaculture, especially freshwater fish raising and combination of fish raising and
    rice cultivation

    +    Rice and other cash crop cultivation and livestock husbandry

    +    Capture fishery

    +    Fishery processing

    +    Other industries (hired laborers, tourism services, labor export, etc...)

       -   Exploitation of aquatic resources in Tuong Son commune is more sustainable than
    Thach Hai because it does not destroy marine environment as Thach Hai does.
    Freshwater fish raising and combined fish raising and rice cultivation not only make use
    of available food but also create high economic returns. However, aquaculture here meets
    with many risks such as changeable weather (rain, flood, drought, etc...); diseases and
    people are in short of fishery extension knowledge and aquaculture experiences.

       -      Given that agricultural production (rice and other cash crop cultivation and
    livestock husbandry) in these two coastal communes creates low incomes (particularly in
    Thach Hai commune), it is farmers' traditional livelihood so that they want to maintain it.
    Agricultural production in coastal communes always meet with difficulties such as: lack
    of water, impoverished and salty soil, etc... This livelihood importantly impacts the
    environment due to unsafe fertilizer and pesticide utilization and husbandry hygiene.

       -   Aquaculture exploitation and processing generate large incomes for the poor.
    However, this livelihood also runs risks of changeable weather and decline in inshore
    aquatic resources. In addition, use of mine, electrical gear and heavy lighting for fishing
    are seriously threatening marine environment in Ha Tinh province.

2. Market and its impacts on income diversification of local people in coastal area.

    Market is a factor having great impact on those livelihood means products. In area of
survey, market (both input and output) also have great impacts on income diversification of
local people, especially aquaculture and fishery processing. In Thach Ha commune, both
input market (breed, feed, insecticide...) and output market are under no control but driven
by private traders. There has been no control and inspection about input quality and support
from local government in forming channels of distribution. In recent years, strong
development of aquaculture leads to higher demand for breed, feed and epidemic disease


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs120

preventive medicine for this livelihood means. System of production and breeding service
supply for both salt water and fresh water aquaculture is insufficient, meeting only 30-40%
demand for breed in shrimp and crab rising... Meanwhile, flow of breeds and materials from
other places to the market is becoming bigger. (For example, common tiger prawn from Da
Nang, Khanh Hoa, other neighboring provinces and China, frog and turtle from northern
provinces..., feed from southern provinces and Thailand...). On the other hand, the district
has not had a centre for quality examination of breed and material for aquaculture, so local
people have to buy breeds and materials from private businesses with uncontrollable quality,
exposing too many risks and epidemic diseases. At present, the province has invested in
construction of common tiger prawn breeding farm to satisfy demand for breeds of local
people in the province.

    Output market for aquatic products and processed seafood is large, within the province,
in the country and in China. However, the district has not organized a system of outlets for
aquatic products, farmers are often forced to sell to private businesses at a low price,
normally a half of market price. Therefore, in order to develop this livelihood means, market
information as well as necessary support in distribution is essential and should be provided to
producers in coming time.

3. Supports from organizations for the poor to develop aquaculture

    Policy to make aquaculture a key economic industry in coming years has received much
attention of Ha Tinh province and Thach Ha district with a series of legal documents
facilitating development of aquaculture. Ha Tinh province has been and will be carrying out
many programs and projects to promote aquaculture industry such as: Brackish water and
freshwater aquaculture development program; Program of aquaculture in the sea and on sand;
Aquaculture breed development program; projects of irrrigation system construction for
brackishwater aquaculture; projects of building fish ports, fish markets, sheltering and
anchorage areas, and fishery processing villages... However, those projects are in initial
stages, so their supports are not clearly observed.

    Policy of transforming low productivity agricultural land areas into areas for aquaculture
of the province and the district is judicious and in the hope of local people. However,
although there has been encourage policy, there has been no specific mechanism and policy,
so there are some troubles in implementation in many communes. In two surveyed
communes,       transformation is very slow because local government cannot ensure a
fundamental infrustructure for aquaculture such as: concretization of                    system of saline
prevention dykes, system of irrigation canals and drainage... (Tuong Son commune); lack of
fishery extention support: providing scientific technical knowledge about aquaculture,


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs121

epidemic diseases, capture fishery, buidling a pilot model, providing information about
markets for breeds, feed and distribution... because investment in aquaculture mainly relies
on limited budgets.

     Support for this livelihood means from international organizations is limited. Beside
small loans from Women Union to process aquatic products (in Thach Hai), local people
borrow money from Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development to invest though loans,
which are small in comparison with need for investment due to high risks in aquaculture.

4. Poor's accessibility to aquatic resources:

    For the poor people in coastal area, exploiting available sources of aquatic products
(inshore capture fishery, natural fish capture, mollusk farming on                    mainland and rice
cultivation combined with fish raising) is an important livelihood means for the poor because
it requires little investment but generates a higher income. Although destructive methods of
fishing are used in marine capture fishery in Ha Tinh province, destroying seriously the
environment, the poor has no other choice as they have to care about their existence. "We
know that our present exploitation will put a burden on our children's generation due to
destruction to marine environment, but we will die now if we do not do that" (said male
group in Nam Hai village of Thach Hai commune). Therefore, orientation that Thach Ha
district is striving for in the coming years is financing for poor households to help them to be
equipped with better boats, or establish fishing cooperatives for the poor to take part in and
transform occupational structure of coastal households to livelihood means that exploit
aquatic resources in a more sustainable manner. Plan for shifting from low productivity
agricultural land areas into areas for aquaculture is a good goal taking the poor in coastal area
out of poverty. However, the fact in surveyed places shows that the reason why poor
households cannot move to aquaculture model is lack of initial investment. In surveyed
communes, only medium and better-off or rich households are capable of investment in
aquaculture. On the other hand, these models have not been developed due to big investment,
high risks and lack of necessary scientific technical knowledge and experience of local
people.

III. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROPOSALS FOR MODEL SELECTION

     Survey in two communes of Thach Ha district shows that local people in coastal area
have many opportunities to diversify their sources of income through development of
different livelihood strategies. However, obstacle is that the poor people are poor in both
capital and knowledge, so while financing for the poor to develop any livelihood means, it is
necessary to help them with both capital and knowledge.



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs122

    With model of coastal communes, it can be invested in different fields to diversify
sources of income for the poor: aquaculture + capture fishery + agriculture + aquatic product
and agricultural produce processing industry and + tree plantation (eucalyptus, casuarinas,
acacia aneura...) on sandy land in coastal area.

    - However, every commune has their own strengths with different proposed investment
priorities. In Tuong Son for example, investment in infrastructure for swamps to raise
shrimps and fish will get good effects in return and create many jobs for local people.
Swamps are private-owned but their repair requires a great number of 50-60 labors. On the
other hand, the development of aquaculture will lead to development of other services (breed
supply, feed supply, product distribution, semi-processing...) which attract much labor.
Nevertheless, investment in aquaculture requires a large amount of capital (for example, it
costs VND 250 million to invest in a 3-ha swamp for extensive farming including
infrastructure construction, swamp building, water regulation, breed, feed...) while risks are
high due to changeable weather and lack of raising techniques. Fish-raising and rice
cultivation is a model which is multiplied and initially has brought about obvious effects for
people of Tuong Son commune.

    - In communes like Thach Hai, financing for poor fisher folks to catch aquatic products is
also a livelihood means generating a stable income source for the poor. At present in Ha Tinh
province, yield of capture fishery represents a large proportion in total output of aquatic
products of the province. Although yield of aquaculture has been quickly increasing in recent
years but it is only one-third of total seafood output (see graph 2 in part I). As a result, this is
still an important livelihood means of the poor who live in wetland, to exploit sources of
income in coastal area. However, there should be financial support for fisher folks to
purchase better facilities that enable them to catch more kinds of fish and avoid using present
destructive methods. Investment can be made in form of establishing fishing groups or
cooperatives to enhance strengths and avoid risks for fisher folks.

    - Agricultural production in coastal communes often has low productivity due to poor soil
which is exhausted and much affected by the weather, yet it is still an indispensable
livelihood means of farmers. Hence, it should be maintained to generate more income for
local people in coastal area. Additionally, cattle raising is also an effective way.

    - Model of fishery processing in form of cooperative or enterprise also needs financial
support in coming time. This livelihood means attracts many poor female people and also
generates a significant income source for the poor in coastal area.

    - Model of planting eucalyptus, casuarinas, and acacia aneura... in coastal sand banks is
also a livelihood means generating income for local people in coastal area in the future. Now

Thach Ha district have received orders for products from those planted. However, the district
is facing with difficulties in capital during their implementation of land use planning for such
plantation because the district is poor and their budget is limited. As a result, this model has
not been given priority to develop. However, in the future provided that there is enough
investment capital, this will be a means to diversify sources of income for local people in
coastal area.

In order to settle difficulties in livelihood activities, people here have proposed some
necessary supports as follows:

       - Change plant varieties (rice and sweet potato varieties)

       - Arable areas need to be planned and concentrated
       - Insurance for fisherman is available
       - Investment in offshore fishing (fishery facilities: handy short-waved
            communication tool, fish-searching machine, etc.)

       - Investment in science and technology : technical staff who are able to use new
            tools

       - Apply science and technology in processing
       - Investment in fishery processing warehouse or factories

Re-planning, if areas cannot afford agricultural production, they shall be transferred to
aquaculture.

V. SUMMARY ON SURVEY FINDINGS

1. Overview of Ninh Thuan province

1.1    Natural resources

Ninh Thuan province is in the southern extreme of the Central region, bordered on the north
by Khanh Hoa, on the south by Binh Thuan, on the west by Lam Dong, on the east by the
sea. The province is located in a transport key position of Highway 1A with North - South
railway and Highway 27 to the Central Highland. The province's town is Phan Rang - Thap
Cham, 350 km away from Ho Chi Minh City, 110 km from Da Lat, 105 km from Nha Trang,
and 1,388 km from Hanoi.
The province covers a total natural area of 3,360.06 km2, in which high mountains account
for 63.2%, hilly area: 14.4%, and plain: 22.4%. Ninh Thuan is surrounded by mountains in
three directions and by sea in one direction. The western high mountains border Lam Dong;
two mountain ranges in the north and south are towards the sea. The terrain slopes down
from West to East and from West to South-East.

There are several rivers and streams in the province, and the largest is CAI River. Taken into
account its all sub-branches of Me Lam, Sat, Ong, Cha, Lu, and Quao rivers, Cai river system
is 246 km long. Besides, Ninh Thuan has some other rivers such as Trau, Quan The, Ba
Rau... with total length of 184 km.

The climate is typical tropical monsoon with little rain and the driest and hottest in the
country; dry and windy weather makes water evaporate from 1,670-1,827mm/year. The
annual average temperature is 27oC with separate seasons: rainy season from September to
November and dry season from December to next August.
Ninh Thuan has a coastline of 105 km and water territory of 18,000 km2, which is one of the
four key fishing grounds of Vietnam with three sea mouths of Dong Hai, Ca Na and Khanh
Hai. Total fishery stock is 120,000 tones/year, of which seabed fish is 70,000-80,000
tones/year, and surface fish is 30,000-40,000 tones/year. Annual exploitation capacity comes
up to 50,000-60,000 tones. There are more than 500 types of fish, many of them are of high
economic value such as red snapper, tuna, groper, codfish, lobster, cuttle fish, squid, bigfin
reef squid, in which cuttle fish accounts for most with the catching capacity of over 3,500
tones.

Ninh Thuan sea has several potentials to develop tourism and mineral exploration with
beautiful beaches of Ninh Chu, Ca Na in association with Cham cultural works. A series of
hotels and restaurants and people's hospitability also contribute to tourism development.

Moreover, many shores, lagoons, and lakes of total area of more than 3,000 ha provide
favorable conditions for salt production and large-scaled aquaculture in Dam Nai, Ca Na,
Vinh Hy, Son Hai, Phu Tho,...

Situated in hot region with high radiation intensity, Ninh Thuan is ideal for industrial salt
production. Salt field area may potentially increase to 1,000 ha with annual capacity of
130,000-135,000 tones, mainly in Dam Vua, Ca Na and the coastal area of Khanh Hai town.

1.2    Social condition

Ninh Thuan is among the poorest provinces of Vietnam with total population of 564,700 in
2005 (of which, men: 278,900 and women: 285,800). Population density is 168 people/km2.

In present, Ninh Thuan has only 6 administration units at rural district level which are Phan
Rang-Thap Cham town and 5 rural districts: Thuan Bac, Ninh Son, Bac Ai, Ninh Hai and
Ninh Phuoc with 59 communes, wards and town lets.

There are 28 ethnic groups in the province, most crowded groups are Kinh, Cham and Ra
Grai. Many Cham and Ra Grai people live in Ninh Thuan. According to census made in 1
April 1999, Ninh Thuan has 57,100 Cham people, accounting for 11.3% of the province's
population and making up for 43% of total Cham people in the country; 47,600 Ra Grai
people, 9.4% of the province's population and 49.1% of the country's total Ra Grai.

In general, science and technique cadre force remains little, only 22 per 1,000 people on
average. The province lacks of science and technique officials in almost all economic sectors
and key production units, and is in shortage of leading expertise in all areas.


1.3     Economic features

In 2005, Production value of agriculture sector was 769 billion VND, decreasing by 12.9%
compared to 2004. Internal economic structure of the sector has positively changed:
husbandry accounted for 34.2%; cultivation: 57.2%; and services: 8.6%.

Area for rice growing tends to narrow due to drought whereas area for dry plantation or hay
is increasing. In 2005, total rice farming area was 17,000 ha, only 50.3% compared to 2004.
Area for tobacco was 551 ha (increased by 8.6%), sugar cane: 1.480 ha (increased by 6.5%),
mixed maize: 9,525 ha (increased by 31.6%). Capacity of all plants raised, that of rice: 48.2
quintals/ha (up by 1.6 quintals); maize: 27.3 quintals/ha (up by 4.8 quintals), vegetable and
bean of all kinds: 81.1 quintals/ha (up by 12.3 quintals). Grape is considered crucial plant
with total plantation area of 1,890 ha and total output of 26,000 tones (increased by 14%
compared to that of 2004). Furthermore, area of cashew comes up to as much as 6,500 ha,
3,500 ha of which is in harvest with output of 1,225 tones.

In 2005, there are 219,700 heads of cattle altogether, in which 112,300 were cows and
buffaloes and 107,400 were sheep and goats. Due to drought, number of cattle tends to be
stable. In 2005, there were 41,490 sheep, increased by 6,160 compared to 2004. Sheep
raising has better advantages than other kinds of cattle as sheep can suffer drought better and
enjoy diversified food sources.

Concerning forestry, to 2005, the province had progressively implemented afforestation plan
of around 2,100 ha. Dry plants of high value is being studied to grow in large areas, namely
trom (241 ha), neem (702 ha), transplant cashew (282 ha), and gio bau (35 ha).

2.3. Impacts of market on community livelihoods:

In the context of Thuong Diem and Vinh Truong hamlets in particular, Phuoc Diem an Phuoc
Dinh commune in general, elements of market has not affect livelihoods of communities,
especially poor fishermen. Some above mentioned key livelihoods such as kappaphycus
alveresii farming are affected by elements of market. Till now, there has not been any
noticeable issue of market share and selling price. However, market has great impacts on
income from breeding cattle (such as sheep, cow, sheep). While breeding sheep, cow and
goat is currently considered as an advantage of Ninh Phuoc province in general, selling price
is irregular, leading to the fact that many households have to change selling price of seeds.

2.4. Support organizations for poor households in communities

a) Thuong Diem hamlet:

Outputs of Discussion Group and meeting with habitants in Thuong Diem hamlet show that
till now local people have not benefited from any hunger eradication and poverty alleviation
project for only poor fishermen in the hamlet. Some projects relating to community (Phuoc
Diem commune in general ) that local people know are as follows:

     - Project of fishing ports expansion (invested by the Government and investment from
       MOFI VND 30 billion);

       USD. This project is in process of survey without appraisal.

b) Vinh Truong hamlet:

Outputs of Discussion Group and meeting with habitants in Vinh Truong hamlet show that
currently Vinh Truong hamlet has benefited from one project that local people know.
Particularly:
     - Project of Action Aid Viet nam (AAV) with its objective of supporting poor
       households through such activities as: (i) Food Security including encouraging
       agricultural expansion through training on technics of kappaphycus alveresii
       aquaculture, fishery aquaculture (shrimp, fish); organizing clubs of agricultural
       extension on breeding and planting; credit activities such as establishment of credit
       fund in commune, supporting fund, etc; (ii) Education: support through providing
       scholarship, rewarding and establishment of common bookcases to poor pupils; (iii)

    -  Community Based Infrastructure Project (Project CBRIP) with total capital of VND
       900 million for the commune from 2005 to 2007. The main objective is to support to
       small infrastructure for the commune with 5% local contributution, participation of

       million . And one medical clinic of the commune will be built with total cost of VND
       407 million .

2.5. Possibility for the poor to access fishery benefits

a) Thuong Diem hamlet:

Findings from group discussion in Thuong Diem hamlet reflected limited possibilities for the
poor to access fishery benefits.

    -  For offshore catching: Require high investment, no person in the hamlet becomes
       owner of offshore boat, poor people only work for others.

    -  For onshore catching: Only 16/398 households in Thuong Diem can afford small
       boats and onshore catching tools. However, this source is not encouraged according
       to Law on Fishery.

    -  For salt production: Though Thuong Diem is the foundation of industrial salt
       manufacture (raw salt) with large area of salt fields, this benefit source is currently
       exploited by State factory. About 165 laborers of Thuong Diem are employed by the
       factory. Yet, the poor cannot access this benefit, even indirectly.

    -  Aquaculture: Thuong Diem does not have great potential of surface area for
       aquaculture. Some households, including the poor, have access this benefit, but they
       do not have actual ownership of water surface as State Salt Factory does.
    -  Other benefits: The poor in Thuong Diem cannot access grazing field as well as area
       for aquaculture.

b) Vinh Truong hamlet:

Findings from group discussion in Vinh Truong hamlet, like in Thuong Diem, reflected
limited possibilities for the poor to access fishery benefits.

    -  For offshore catching: Require high investment, no person in the hamlet becomes
       owner of offshore boat, some work for other hamlets or for Phuoc Diem commune.

    -  For onshore catching: Most households can afford coracles and onshore catching
       tools. However, this source is not encouraged according to Law on Fisheries.

    -  Aquaculture: The hamlet has rather great potential of surface area for aquaculture. It
       is estaimated that Vinh Truong has more than 100 ha for aquaculture and
       Kappaphycus alvaresii farming. However, it has not been exploited thoroughly in


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs153

       Vinh Truong. Few households have access to raise Kappaphycus alvaresii, but at very
       small scale and failed as fish eat Kappaphycus alvaresii.

    -  Other benefits: The poor cannot afford to raise cattle as it requires high investment.

3. Conclusion and Recommendation:

    -  It is reasonable to select Ninh Thuan for prefeasibility study for poor fishermen
       support project.

    -  It is also reasonable to select Ninh Phuoc, one of two poor coastal districts in Ninh
       Thuan. However, if more fund provided, the survey should cover also Ninh Hai
       district, a poor district, in which Vinh Hai is a coastal commune with several
       difficulties.

    -  Of Phuoc Diem and Phuoc Dinh communes: only Phuoc Dinh is among 157 coastal
       poor communes according to poverty line. However, if limited survey selection to one
       district (with 2 communes), it becomes unsatisfactory as the third coastal commune of
       An Hai has obmitted its coastal benefits which are occupied by State factories and
       companies.

    -  Of two selected hamlets Thuong Diem and Vinh Truong: these are actually very poor
       hamlets (though Thuong Diem is not in a poor commune). Findings showed that
       feasibility study could be continued for project formulation.

    -  Based on analysis as well as observation by fishermen communities and officials on
       direct and indirect issue in fishery management, a number of activities may be further
       studied to incorporated in project proposal, namely: (i) Management capacity
       strengthening for fishery officials at provincial and district level (through trainings to
       improve management capacity and techniques); (ii) Raising awareness for fisherman
       community about livelihoods, Law on Fisheries, State guidelines on fishery
       development and some techniques and knowledge concerning exploitation and
       aquaculture (through trainings); (iii) Support to pilot demonstration of Kappaphycus
       alvaresii farming in cages (see attached pilot report) in surveyed hamlets (most
       feasible in Vinh Truong); (iv) further study on raising sheep, goat, and cow in Thuong
       Diem hamlet; (v) Further study on support to poor group in Thuong Diem with grace
       credit to purchase catching tools in cooperation form.

I. INTRODUCTION OF RESEARCH
1. Objectives:
    -   Assess financial resource to develop aquaculture in Tra Vinh province.
    -   Identify sustainable livelihoods of fishers, especially poor ones.
    -   Identify solutions to develop aquaculture and preserve the environment, creating
        employment ­ stable incomes for fishers.
2. Methodology and research site


       Organised semi-oriented seminar with all-level authorities and related agencies.

        Data used in this research included primary data collected directly through seminars,
group discussions, community consultation with people's participation. Secondary data is
collected from statistics, synthesized reports on economic development of the
province/district/commune in 2001- 2005, report on HEPR programme, planning for
aquaculture development in 2006 ­2010.

        Research team conducted survey in 2 communes in Cau Ngang district, which is one
of the poorest ones of Tra Vinh province. Two selected communes are My Long Nam and
Hiep My Dong which are poor, located in coastal area with a great number of Khmer ethnic
people. In each commune, seminars were carried out with authorities and such mass
organisations as Famers' Union, Women's Union. Two group dicussions were organised in 2
villages of each commune, in the first village 10-12 poor women were selected, in the 2nd
village 10-12 households were selected to represent for 3 groups of poor, average and rich
and both male and female.

        In each selected village, discussion was in coordination with village leaders and
women union. In order to ensure objective information collection, poor households were
random selected maximize people's participation in discussions, people were allowed to raise
their voices and propose solutions. During dicussions, people analyzed household economy
and study in-depth the causes of obstacles in different livelihood aspects.

1.6. Agriculture production (including aquatic product and forestry) plays the most important
role in the province's economy, counted for more than 50% of the GDP. The value of
agriculture and forestry in 2004 was 3,902 billion VND (in which, agricultural was 3,843
billion VND, forestry was 59 billion VND), increased by 2,066 billion VND in comparison
with that of 1992. The average annual growth rate in the period of 1992 - 2004 in agriculture
was 6.48%, forestry was 7.07%.

1.7. Fishery and aquatic products:

The average output value of Fishery sector of Tra Vinh increases by 13.69% per annum.
Aquaculture is strongly developed in sea water zone; area used for aquaculture increased
15,000 ha; production qualification improved; models of effectively raising sugpo and green
clawed shrimps developed. Aquaculture revenue in 2000 was estimated to grow by 2.7 times
more than 1995's. About 7000 - 8000 households involved in raising shrimps. Aquaculture
service was much improved. The province invested in upgrade and building new cultivating
camps for breeding shrimps and fish, attraction and transfer of technique. They were
successful in experimentally cultivating varieties of sugpo shrimps, clawed shrimps, unisex
tilapias, gobies, etc. Tra Vinh is developing the service of supplying industrial fresh food for
shrimps and craps; expanding the service of fixing water pumps and dredging pods and lakes
for raising shrimps.

1.8. Industry and construction:

The share of industry and construction rose from 16% in 2000 to 25% in 2005. Industrial
production revenue growth rate is rather high during the period of 2000 - 2005. Main
industry is manufacturing, especially aquatic, sea products and chemical manufacturing.

1.9. Trade and tourism has evident changes.
 The social market has been expanded; the merchandise circulation has met the production
and social life demands more. Total retail revenue is continuously raised over the years. In
1999, it reached 612.44 billion VND; 1995 1,564.36 billion VND; 1996 2,103 billion VND;
2003 3,115 billion, accomplished 97.34% of year's target, and increased by 12.01% as
compared to 2002. Main force in retailing circulation is non-state sector and private workers,
making up 94-96% of the total volume of merchandise retailing circulation.

1.10. The export revenue in past years has not been adequate to the province's potential.
The reason is that exports of the province are mainly preliminarily manufactured
commodities and undiversified. 2003 export revenue was USD 39.512 million, expected to
reach USD 46 million in 2004. Beside main commodities as various kinds of rice, frozen
aquatic and sea products, coconut ladle, other exported goods were fishes, oysters, fired
fishes, dry-scraped coconut boiled rice. Export value was estimated to be 6.5 million USD,
fulfilled the given plan, and increased by 78.92%. Besides, main imports were devices for
production and raw materials for medicine production. Enterprises have always been
interested in export markets. At present, the merchandise of Tra Vinh are exported to such
countries as: the United States of American, Japan, China, Australia, Korea, Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Poland, Switzerland, People Democratic Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, France,
Cambodia, Singapore, the Republic of Czech, Sweden, etc

* Poverty features: After nearly 20 years of doi moi process, incomes and living standard of
most people has improved, thus, poverty features has changed as well, in the past food
shortage(needs for food and warmth) has basically been solved, at the current time and in
coming years, it is the non-food poverty ( need for housing, healthcare, education, transport

and communication); the widening gap between the rich and the poor, access to
achievements of development remain unequal between the rich and the poor.

* Variety of poverty in the province:

        - Unsettled housing (about 16,311 HHs), without durable assets, no or low-value
furniture. Assets of most people from Khmer ethnic group are less than 2 million VND.

        - Lack of electricity and clean water.

        - Lack of farming land and building land (according to survey results in Aug 2004,in
the whole province, 12,348 HHs have no land for production, 1,427 HHs have less than
1,000m2 farming land, 4,508 HHs have between 1,000 and 3,000m2 farming land)

        - Lack of conditions for production such as manual tools, capital, and no market
survey for products.
        - Lack of production knowledge (over 70% of poor HHs) due to poor education or
illiteracy, no technical level (about 86.32% of poor HHs), mainly in agriculture, forestry and
aquaculture.
        - Children have to drop out of school early (most children do not complete primary
school) especially girls, sickness without medical care, out-of-date production and living.
        - Besides, group of marginalized poor people like isolated the old, the disabled is out
of HEPR programme.


Causes of poverty
Objective causes:

        - Due to the fact that the province is in the remote area with the system of interlacing
rivers and canals, separated from roads, underdeveloped economy, the majority of farming
lands are aluminiferous or salty, production is merely in agriculture with low productivity,
underdeveloped infrastructure, regularly faced with natural diseases and epidemics, resulting
in consecutive crop failure.

        - Merchandise market supplied the inputs and outputs are often changeable towards
the adverse tendency for those who rely on agricultural production. Especially unstable
prices of farm produce and foodstuff, aquatic products cause serious loss to producers,
particularly the poor

        - Population growth rate remains high, unemployment and underemployment pressure
is increasing, untrained laborers occupies over 90% of total work force.

        - Awareness of local authorities on hunger eradication and poverty reduction are not
profound. They have not entirely seen the importance of hunger eradication and poverty
reduction as well as job creation in the process of socio - economic development at localities.
Therefore, there is lack of active directions.

        - Low - interest rate credit provision are among the important resources helping poor
households but they have limited access to these credit because most of them lack of
knowledge, afraid of difficulty and the control of credit organizations over capital use. Social
high interest rate credit is the main resource used by the poor because of its accessibility.


 Above data is poor Khmer households

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs162

Subjective causes:

    - Low education, insufficient production knowledge and experience, lack of technical and
scientific information, land, awareness of self-better in life, seriously relying on helps
government and community subsidy. Drawback customs also make an adverse impact on
production and life resulting in waste in production and consumption, laziness, risks and
incapability to work due to illness and diseases.

    - Lack of production land.

    - Lack of capital to invest in household economic development

    - Large number of children, few laborers, large number of interdependent people.

    - Lack of laborers.

    - Lack of production knowledge and experience.

    - Accidents, risks, often suffering from illness and diseases.

    - Member of the family are social evil incidences

    - Unavoidable causes


Poverty trend

Poverty mainly in rural areas: Among the total number of poor HHs in the province, 93.11%
were from 7 districts, only 6.88% in towns. Only in 4 districts of Trà Cú, Cu Ngang, Châu
Thành, Càng Long (agricultural, harsh natural conditions, underdeveloped economy),
number of poor HHs in 2005 is 53,646 HHs, counted for 63.74% the provincial number.


Particularly 2 districts of Trà Cú, Cu Ngang have the highest poverty rate in the province.
In 1998, poverty rates of Cu Ngang, Trà Cú are respectively 26.2 ­ 31.1%/ 24.44% (of the
province); in 2001: 28.8 ­ 27.1/22,4% (of the province) and in 2005: 41.00%-
41.32%/35.89% (of the province) , in which Trà Cú district have the highest number of poor
HHs and the highest poverty rate in the province; in 2005 on the whole district, there are
15,651 poor HHs, accounted for nearly 18.59% poor HHs in the province.


Poverty mainly in areas of great Khmer ethnic population: due to old customs, Khmer people
often live alongside pagodas, along the sandy-banks, where benefits in cultivation and
breeding is poor, low income from production, thus, people's life is always in difficult.
According to 2003 survey , rate of Khmer HHs is 31.8% of the provincial total number, but
number of poor HHs among Khmer ethnic is responsible for 38.8%; in all districts, Khmer
HHs poverty rate is higher than the average poverty rate in the district, like Cu Kè, rate of
Khmer HHs is 31.4% of the total number, but rate of Khmer poor HHs is 62.9%. Similarly,
in Tiu Cn district it is respectively 32% and 38%, Trà Cú: 59.3% and 68.6%, Duyên Hi:
16.9% and 34.56% etc. Trà Cú as mentioned above is the district has the highest poverty rate
in the province, and also where most of Khmer ppopulation lived (20,955 HHs counted for
32% Khmer population in the area).



Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs163

Poverty incidence are common in extremely poor communes: There are 102 communes and
towns in the whole province, 38 of which are extremely poor communes (Trà Cú alone 10
communes) eligible for 135 Programme, counted for 40% communes and wards in the
province, however, number of poor HHs in 2003 (according to statistical report of Provincial
Ethnic Committee) accounts for 62% the poor HHs in the whole province (24,677 HHs in
which Khmer ethnic have 14,673 HHs, counted for about 60% of poor HHs in extremely
communes). On the average, rate of poor HHs in this area is 26.7%, which is nearly 7%
higher than average rate of poor HHs on the whole province (17.45%). In which, number of
communes with poverty rate less than 30% is 7 communes, between 30-40%: 9 communes
and over 40%: 2 communes (Trng Th, Cu Ngang have poverty rate of 44.5% and a
Lc, Châu Thành: 46.5%). Hence, nearly two third of poor HHs in the area are in extremely
poor commune.

Results of HEPR programmes


From 2001-2005 135 Programme built 343 infrastructure works for 42 poor communes,
funded houses for 24,132 poor HHs, pooling VND 76,318 million from community and
inside ­ outside organisations, provided 35,114 credits without interest for poor participants;

    1. Geographic location
    - Located in South east of Tra Vinh province, on the side of Co Chien river and Cung
        Hau seaport.
    - border with Chau Thanh district and Ben Tre province in the East,.
    - border with Tra Cu district and Duyen Hai district in the South
    - border with Chau Thanh and Tra Cu districts in the West
    - border with Chau Thanh district in the North
    - There are 13 communes and 2 towns in the whole district.
    - Total natural area is 32,548.39 ha, district center is 24km away from province centre,
        along with national road No. 53. Population is 36,000 people, Khmer people
        accounted for 30%,
    The district locates in an advantage position for communication, socio-economy
    development. However, located in coastal plain, it suffers tides of Pacific Ocean from Co
    Chien river, trespass of sea water in dry season resulting in limited agricultural land area.

    2. Natural conditions

    Cau Ngang lies in the coastal monsoon tropical area, with 2 obvious seasons in a year.
    Most farming land become salt-marsh in dry season, requiring salt removal before
    growing, so fresh water time is so short, affecting agricultural production. Cau Ngang is
    an area of brackish, fresh or salty water by season.
    In general, land is suitable for rice growing, however, most area is saltilized, and
    disadvantaged for production, moreover, most farming area are often lack of fresh water
    for irrigation in dry season, ineffective agricultural production.

    3. Real situation of socio-economy

    Cau Ngang is a district with the second poverty rate in the province (34.67%), there are
    6/15 communes eligible for 135 programme and coastal communes (134). About 10% of
    HHs has no farming land.
    Key production: rice growing, cereals and cattle rising, poultry and aquaculture with of
    sea shrimp raising semi-intensively and intensively models, oysters raising.

                      My Long Nam is a coastal commune, considered an "island-coastal
                      commune" by the Government. It is located in the South of Cau Ngang
    My Long           district, with natural area of 4,867 ha, 5 villages, 1,255 HHs, including
                      5.636 people, average population density is 116 heads / km2. In the
    Nam               commune, there are 3,478 labourers, counted for 61.7 % of total
                      population. 292 poor HHs, taking 23.34%.
                      Cottages make up 50% sparsely in the commune. Average income per
                      capita is about 4.5 million/ year. Traffic system is very poor, irrigation

                      system meets only 70% of production needs, underdeveloped trade and
                      services.
                              People rely on agricultural production and aquaculture, contributing
                      91.2 % common economic structure of the commune. Agricultural land
                      area is 1,894 ha, counted for 38.9% of natural land area, 610 ha for
                      aquaculture, making up 32.2 % of agricultural land area.
                      Some international organisations, like Cida Canada, Oxfam, has assisted
                      people in aquaculture, cattle raising, etc.

IV. KEY FINDINGS

1. Aqua cultural development potential of Tra Vinh province26
1.1. Natural resources

Coastline of Tra Vinh lasts 65 km, water territory has diverse resources with high value, sea
product exploitation with reserve of 1.2 million tons, exploit capacity of 630,000 tons/ year.
Canal system is thick, abundant aquatic products resource, with 3 large seaports of Co Chien,
Cung Hau, Dinh An, nearby main grounds of fishing, shrimp, cuttle-fish of South East, it is
impossible to move fishing grounds by seasons to the sea in South West, this helps Tra Vinh
to exploit aquatic products all the year with stable productivity between 50.000 - 55.000
tons/year. Natural valley area is 21.265 ha and about 98.597 ha under water in 3 to 5 months
/ year, interior reserves is estimated at 3.000 - 4.000 tons, exploited constantly from 2.000 -
2.500 tons.

Aquatic source in coastal area of Tra Vinh includes seaport, salty forest and coastal water
area with 30 - 40 m in-depth. Fish along the coastline have 40 groups, 78 varieties and 150
species including sea fish inshore, brackish fish and migratory fish. Reserve of fish in Tra
Vinh seaport counted in area of net in 1994 was 62 tons (in seaports only), 274 tons floating-
class and medium-class fish; area of sea and brackish water: 9.063 tons, 63.470 tons floating-
class and medium-class fish. Total reserve in seaport area, inshore 72.869 tons, exploits
capacity (50%) 36.434 tons.
 + Tra Vinh has natural water surface area of nearly 23.000 ha, diverse resource, stable
exploitation, good natural varieties.
+ Salty-infected forests have 24.000 ha potential area to raise shrimp (especially prawn).

1.2. Potential of aqua culture area:

Land: Tra Vinh has 3 kinds of soil: (i) sandy farming soil occupies 6.65%, (ii) alluvial soil
occupies 58.29%, (iii) alkaline soil occupies 24.44%, and the rest is water surface. Due to the

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs167

natural features, Tra Vinh has ecological zones and fresh water alluvial zones in Cau Ke,
Cang Long, Tieu Can Districts of 74,900 ha in area. Original sea water soil zone is 120,600
ha in area including Duyen Hai District, a part of Tra Vinh Town, Chau Thanh, Tra Cu and
Cau Ngang Districts and coastal river-mouth region, out of the defending dyke of Nam Mang
Thit project, whose area is about 27,000 ha, is suitable for afforestation and aquaculture. The
soil and climate of Tra Vinh are suitable for rice growing, industrial trees, and various kinds
of fruit trees, vegetables and crops, cattle raising and aquaculture.
Basing on areas of different land types in the province, area of water surface, suitable for
aquaculture, shows that aquaculture potential of Tra Vinh is very high, about 99.404 ha is
possible for aquaculture (specializing, rotational cultivation)27

 Human resource: Technical staffs capacity of the province has improved, at present about
21,660 staffs has intermediate and higher level (1 Ph.D, 76 MAs, 6.793 BAs and college
graduates, 14.790 secondary technical graduates), increasing 1.5 times compared to 2001; 16
institutions (350 people) work in technology and science.

1.3. Investment in aquaculture infrastructure

In 5 recent years, aquaculture of Tra Vinh has focused in infrastructural investment for
aquaculture: in 3 sectors: fishing, raising and processing
    - Focus on building fishing ports, fishing stations
    - Focus in some projects to raise industrial shrimp, molluses, combine afforestation and
        natural aquaculture
    - Project of building irrigation works for aquaculture, centers of variety supplying
    - Projects of building, improving factories for processing exported frozen aquatic
        products
    - Capacity building for fishing offshore

1.4. Aqua cultural extension and protection of aquatic resources
    - Center of aqua cultural extension supported in capacity building and equipment to
        ensure quality of variety, quarantine system, promote technical training, etc.
    - Developed 49 models of aquaculture and expansion for people.
    -   Strengthened aquatic resources preservation: strengthen propaganda of regulations on
        protecting aquatic resources, fishing-boat registration, flood prevention, veterinary
        health and food safety
    - Improved checking, controlling, dealing with violations - illegal fishing, use
        forbidden chemical substances, etc.
    - Facilitated fishers, enterprises to participate in annual traditional days of fishing,
        breeding prawn into the sea.

2. Advantages and disadvantages in aqua cultural development Tra Vinh province

    2.1. Advantages
    - Policy to improve aquaculture as a key industry, many projects call for investment
        from economic sectors in 3 production sectors: exploitation, raising and aquatic
        products processing for exports.


27Tra Vinh aquaculture planning scheme by 2010

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs168

    - Banks, international organizations provided opportunities, credits for aquaculture and
        offshore exploitation.
    - System of state management in aquaculture, aqua cultural extension established to
        district level and in each area. Aqua cultural extension is focused.
    - Close co-ordination between authorities and fishers' participations in seasoning
        calendar have proven high efficiency.
    - The province issued some specific policies to encourage the development of aquatic
        varieties farming economy centers in order to favor aquaculture development
    - Formation of Collectives, application of raising industrial and semi-industrial prawn
        models according to floating ponds with methods that hardly change water and using
        biological products.
    - Experiences in raising and aquaculture development: deforestation leads to failure in
        raising shrimp. More forestation, more aquatic resources improvements. Sea-crabs
        raising model in salty forest is an evidence of benefits of salty forest protection.


      Box 1 Mr. P. (Department of Aquaculture) said that within 10 years (1988- 1998)
      from 25.000 ha exploited, only 11ha left. But at present it no longer happens, people
      are "very worried" because raising shrimp is too risky, so they afforest actively.
      Protection forests (mangrove) under regeneration grows well.
      Buffer zone:30% aquaculture + 70% forest (defending trees, food crops)
      At present, programme of "separate shrimp from forest" is implemented.


2.2. Advantages

    - Aquaculture development required larger capital, high technical labor force, high
        benefit but risky. 70% need satisfied, investment attraction; skilled labor force for
        offshore exploitation and industrial aquaculture is limited.
    - Bad weather, disaster climate seriously affected exploitation and raising aquaculture
    - Raising areas expansion is spontaneous, unplanned, inadequate irrigation
        infrastructure, causing poor efficiency.
    - Technology investment after harvest remains poor. Product competitiveness in the
        market is not strong enough; suffer pressure from commercial and non-commercial
        barriers in export.
    - Production skill in offshore exploitation, raising aquatic products among fishers is
        poor, little technical laborers, no cooperatively economic models development.
    - Salty forests are illegally destroyed, causing aquatic resources loss
    - Livelihood activities of coastal inhabitants

3.1 Aqua cultural development for the poor
Main livelihood activity of inhabitants in Tra Vinh province is agricultural productions and
aqua cultural exploitation. But aquaculture by poor and non-poor groups is different in scale
& characteristics.

Through discussion, the poor have many difficulties in aquaculture activities
    - Lack of capital, limited capacity of offshore fishing and large investment
    - Lack of technical knowledge, do not follow crop calendar, technical procedures,
       causing epidemic diseases
    - Self-awareness, assistance within community remains limited, "shrimp thief"& "fish
       thief" are quite popular.
    - The poor have no chance to participate in long-lasting proje

3.2. Livelihood activity of inhabitants in Cau Ngang district

Cau Ngang is a district of major brackish area, fresh ­ salty by season, including 5 small
ecological region, but inhabitants spontaneously change cropping structure, and they
eliminated fields to raise shrimp, then raising shrimp-fish monoculturally, due to limited
techniques, unplanned, resulting in high risks, low efficiency. Main production is rice
growing and cattle, poultry raising, aquaculture accounted for only 50%.

Box 2 Mr. L. in Centre of Aquaculture Extension told some experiences in fish raising models
In the beginning, poor HHs participate enthusiatically, project supported an average of 3-4
million dong/ hh, providing variety +capital + food + techniques.
Consequently, only 50% of HHs implemented correctly and follow till the end of the project
The rest moved to another job or harvested the fish halfway of the project.

According to assessment from participants in discussions, there 3 sustainable livelihood
models for the poor, in provision of authorities supports
- Cow raising: eligible for the poor with little or no land and labor force. This model has
been implemented in 8/15 communes of the district "Support Project for cow raising by poor
HHs ­ disadvantaged ethnic groups ­ Tra Vinh province"
- Oyster raising: apply to 3 groups of rich ­ average and poor in coastal area
    - Supported by Oxfam: general poverty reduction in this area
    - Approach: Form Collectives to allocate land to people, subsidy to buying breeds (7
    million dong/ hh)
    - HHs contribute monthly guarding fees based on allocated land
- Afforestation of salty region combines with natural aquatic products raising
    - Rich aquatic resources of alluvial grounds
    - Project funded by WB has supported to afforest salty zones

* Listed in descending order1, 2, 3..... for example, 1 is the highest income generation
activities
According to survey results in community, model of 1 rice +1 shrimp is the most effective
one, then cow raising, peanut growing, water melon growing also highly apreciated.
However, this model has not been plotted, so it is impossible to affirm the effect. It is thought
that this model is not sustainable and the poor can hardly access. The highest consensus
reached in cow raising and peanut growing models. Cow raising is considered a sustainable
livelihood, with high effect suitable to natural conditions and the poor.
In commune, people develop agricultural production model, community-based management
approach applied.
- Industrial shrimp Raising model­Thang Loi Collective­ My Long Nam commune,
established on 17/2/2005
+ By "don dien, doi thua" programme, the collective has now 84 members with the area of
20.83 ha including raising ponds, integrated ponds, waste ponds and drainage.
+ The collective is directly under District People's committee
+ Selling stocks for members: 1.000.000dong/ stock

+ Organization: Administrative board, Monitoring board
+ Technical board: 3 graduates from university in aquaculture
+ Supply of breed, techniques: center of aqua cultural extension
+ Total mobilizing capital: 3 billion dong
+ Fixed capital: 9 ha land with contributions from share holders (1.3 billion dong)
+ Market for products: Tra Vinh Aqua culture Company
Effect: Despite all advantages, due to price changes and mass harvest at the same time,
effectiveness is not high. Price from 98,000dong/ kg goes down 68,000dong/kg in risk of
loss.
Beside, according to assessment from representatives of line agencies, this model has some
problems: inevident management, inadequate democracy & managerial skills and technical
knowledge. If there is no timely solutions, these models can not be sustainable.
- Model of oyster raising­ Thanh Cong Collective- My Long Nam commune: Applied for
3 groups of rich, average and poor in coastal area.
    - Funded by Oxfam: basically poverty reduction in the area
    - Approach: Form Collectives to allocate land to people, subsidy to buy breed (7 million
    dong/ hh)
    - HHs contribute monthly guarding fees based on allocated land
The project has just started, it is impossible to assess its effectiveness. However, in the first
period, it can be seen that the Poor's participation is very limited due to pooling capitals
(they have to contribute about 50.000- 100.000 dong a month), which is a challenge to poor
HHs with instable income.
Group-based agricultural extension are established with voluntary members with high
responsibilities and detailed purposed: group "60million dong/ ha of peanuts", Group
"Determination" to implement models, extends models of cow raising.
Various Inter-group and inter-village activities: technical training, cross -visit, share
experiences, support HHs in risk. High self-awareness and discipline ensure usual activities.

  Box 3. Group Determination
  The group has 29 members, without notice, at 14h on 27th every month, members all come
  to the leader's house; contribute 2000dong/ month to spend for meeting, the remain money
  is saved.
  The group always developed new models, extended typical ones, guide people to follow.
  Members have chance to take part in training courses, visits, and share experiences with
  neighbour areas inside and outside the province.
  The group is trusted and highly appreciated by local people.

3.3.1.Livelihood activities ­ impact on the poor and sustainable development
In costal areas, livelihood is often various, mainly depend on natural resources. Hence,
livelihood, which easily benefit to local people, often have certain impacts on the
environment. Findings in surveyed regions also presented this.

3.3.1.1 Inshore and interior fishing

- In the past, in coastal area of Tra Vinh province, inshore and interior fishing developed
dramatically. Inshore fishing is only in My Long Nam commune, because Hiep My Dong
commune does not have coastline. However, interior fishing developed in both communes.
Due to abundant aquatic resources, large reserves, most of coastal inhabitants have boats,
shrunk for their fishing inshore and interior. Fishers' boats are small; working inshore,
inshore fishing is really an essential livelihood to them. In the past, inshore and interior
fishing is main income source of many families. Fishing productivity is not only for self-
sufficient but also for sale. Some HHs rely on inshore and interior fishing. Inshore fishing not
only plays an important role in diversifying economic structure and incomes in coastal zone
but also contributes to economic growth, becoming an effective solution to local poverty
reduction.

However, because of extended fishing, lack of strict management, the environment is
polluted; salty forests are exploited illegally, causing decreases in aquatic resources,
seriously impact life of many HHs. Hence, Inshore and interior fishing is no longer an
important livelihood to coastal inhabitants, because income from these activities is very low.
This makes number of HHs of inshore and interior fishing decrease in recent years. Rate of
HHs having boats for inshore and interior fishing is inconsiderable. In the past, most people
in village 4 of My Long Nam commune have their own boats, fishing nets for fishing but
now, only some. These changes occurs in coastal area of Tra Vinh province, where aquatic
resources has decreased, income from Inshore and interior fishing is not enough for people to
live, it is only a nutrition for HHs. Fishing capacity are very little, mainly for family meals.
On the average, people earn VND 10.000 - 15.000 per day from offshore fishing, but in case
of bad weather, they have a deficit. Income from inshore and interior fishing is low and
instable; give reasons for shifting to offshore fishing or other industries of all people (both
rich and poor fishers).

HHs has moved to building big ships for offshore fishing. However, fishers fishing offshore
also have many difficulties, because of increasing input price (like gasoline, ice, net), but
productivity reduces and price of products is low due to competition with raising products

and other reasons. Many fishing HHs do not continue with offshore fishing, there are ships
for sale.

Some poor fishers had to move to other industry in very difficult situation. To the poor, it
becomes more difficult when they are compulsory to move to another industry, because they
are lack of capital, technique. Many HHs are inevitably in danger of poverty. Some poor HHs
go on with inshore and interior fishing due to their passion or resigning themselves to the
requirement of changing job (Box ).


Box 4            The poor want to change occupation but powerless
My family has a traditional trade of fishing. My granparents, parents all have boats for inshore
and interior fishing. When I grow up, I continued the inherited trade, but now, polluted
environment and decreasing aquatic resource, I often have fail fishing. Many people give up
and move to other trade of high and stable income. I also want to change my occupation to cow
raising, or sea-product raising or business, but I have no capital. If I change my trade, I will
still do sailing sometimes because I love this Occupation.

In coming years, inshore and interior fishing will become underdeveloped. Poor community
and mixed rich and poor groups often do not highly appreciate inshore and interior fishing in
coastal livelihood. However, in the future, they still exist as a sub-activity in economy of
people, subsidy income and make use of spare time of HHs.

3.3.1.2 Aquaculture
 Aquaculture is a livelihood activity that greatly effect coastal community life in Tra Vinh. In
 2 surveyed communes, despite recent developed, aquaculture has become key livelihood for
 people. Most HHs, including poor HHs, raise aquatic product regardless of risks, expected to
 escape from poverty. Aquatic products raised include prawn, green clawed clayfish, and
 oyster. While oyster, green clawed clayfish raising have not expanded, prawn raising has
 developed in these 2 communes. Most of commune resources are invested in prawn raising.
 Prawn raising have basic advantages beside challenges (table 9).

 Situation in 2 surveyed communes show that prawn raising is not a suitable livelihood to the
poor, because it requires large capital, high investment, large area, skilled laborers, but the
poor have low educational level, little or no land, so they have many trouble in raising prawn.
Most of the poor in Dong Co village, Hiep My Dong village fail in prawn raising, economy
goes down, and they are unable to repay loans to banks, facing difficult life.


Box 5 Failure prawn raising
When I married, my parents gave us 18 ha land for rice growing . In 2002, shrimp raising rised in
the commune, seeing other benefit from shrimp, we decided to borrow 100,000 million dong from
bank to raise prawn. In 3 years, we fail in prawn raising, prawn died after abour 2 weeks. In
particular, money for buying breed, each year we lost dozens million dong. Now our family life
faces many difficulties, we no longer raise prawn, we worked for others, my wife does small
business in local market.

Among shrimp raising HHs, many of them do not raise voluntarily but compulsory. They are
in "unavoidable" cases because all areas move from rice growing to shrimp raising,
neighboring plots are used for shrimp raising, they have to change compulsorily.
To the poor, shrimp is becoming more distant.

Oyster raising models: In assessment of the poor, access capacity in this model is limited
Funded with 5-7 million dong/ hh (investing in variety, food, infrastructure)
Challenges:
- Every month, people have to contribute guarding cost of 50-100.000 dong- the poor have
no money to contribute, so they do not want to participate.
- Protect oyster is very important, it is can easily be stolen

3.3.1. 3. Cultivation

Cultivation originated a long time ago for people in the two communes of My Long Nam and
Hiep My Dong. This is one of the basic livelihoods of coastal inhabitants. However, in the
region (both salty crop and fresh crop) and sandy land is the main types of land so crop
structure is not diversified, productivity is low. Crop structure include: rice, peanut, water
melon, vegetable, in which rice is the key crop. Crops have different strength, weakness,
advantages and disadvantages. Table 10 analysis some key crops in Tra Vinh.

According to assessment of community, some eligible crops in coastal area, possibly to
develop are peanuts, vegetable, water melon. Especially, people preferred peanuts, because it
has high value, and easily to grow. However, difficulty to peanuts is shortage of irrigation.
Peanuts needs a lot of water, wet land, fresh water irrigation. Due to alum-infected land,
people have to drill well to get underground water for irrigation, thus, input cost become
high. Difficulty for the poor in growing peanuts is capital shortage.

Rice, which is though the traditional crop, is very important to people, but affected by salty,
alum land, rice productivity is low and instable. In 2005, Rice crop of Dong Co village, Cai
Gia Ben village failed, many fields are underdeveloped, impossibly to harvest. The most
difficulty in rice growing is incomplete irrigation system, not meet with irrigation

requirements of rice. Although, nowadays, rice is grown largely, but it does not play an
important role in income of coastal people.

3.3.1.4 Breeding
In coastal area, structure of animals includes: cow, pig, chicken, swan, goose, in which cows
is newly raised in recent years. The strongest point of cow herds is high value. A household
invests about 8 - 10 million dong to buy a cow. After a year , the cow can bear a calf. At
present, cow raising is becoming a sustainable and effective means of poverty riddance for
people. In both communes, some HHs raise 10 ­ 20cows, overcoming poverty and becoming
rich.

Nowadays, pig raising remain a livelihood of coastal inhabitants in Tra Vinh, though this
industry sometimes is unimportant to many HHs where many new effective industries such
as shrimp raising arises. Pig raising does not have very high profits, but this is a saving
method. After some period of time, people can have a large amount of money to re-invest in
new industry or consumption: education fees for children, healthcare, furniture. However, pig
raising is not very meaningful in poverty reduction. To poor HHs, pig raising is difficult
because it requires capital, especially money for food from beginning to the end of a raising
procedure. Sow raising give high profit but requiring good care and higher investment. So
only some rich people with capital and techniques can raise sows, the poor cannot access,
same as production, business of shrimp, fish. The following analysis will present
opportunities and challenges of cow raising, pig raising and poultry raising (see table 11).

    3.3.2 Diversifying income generation and poverty riddance
    - Some more findings show that diversifying incomes can ensure sustainable poverty
        riddance for the poor in coastal area and do not destroy the environment and aquatic
        resources. And land is really their sustainable means.
    *The poor have little or no land ( from 0- 2 plots)
        - Mainly rice growing (spring and summer crops), growing fruit, vegetables and
        cereals (peanut, bean, water melon, pumpkin, vegetables, etc.) combined with pigs,
        chickens, ducks raising in small scale to make use of available food.
        - HHs without land mainly rely on seasonal employement by other HHs in the area,
        like harvesting, working the soil, fertilizing, etc. But such work decreases, some HHs
        let children work far from home, in other province such as Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai,
        Binh Duong...
        - Hiring wage by seasons of labourers is average of 20.000- 25.000dong/day to male
        and 15.000- 20.000dong/day to female. Total time of employment in a year is
        estimated to be 3-3.5 months.
    - In discussions, people said that if they are funded, they can do livestock production in
        large scale such as cow raising, fishing, fruit and vegetables growing to make
        products for sale. Even many people need money, 500.000 dong to 1.000.000 dong at
        the beginning of the crops to buy fertiliser, variety, but they have no money, and they
        have to purchase on credit with high interest (10%). If they have money, they can get
        more profit in agricultural production. People can immediately answer the question
        on how much they need and what they will do. Buying cows, raising sows, growing
        cereals are activities are selected by many people and they affirm that they can easily
        find market for their products. Livelihood activities are very plentiful.
        Analyzing some livelihoods activities of some poor women in Cai Gia Ben village
        shows flexibility of the poor, they try to improve their living condition by changing
        strategies of livelihood. There are 3 stategies for lielihood: maintain, promote and
        change.
    · Strategy of "maintain" relates to maintenance of current liviving standard.
    · Strategy of "promote" to improve livelihood by building current assets and activities
        which are supported by these assets.
    · Strategy of "change" to building up assets to access another activity to create higher
        benefits.
     Most HHs implement strategy of maintaining their current lives, they have no long term
     livelihood strategy
     This is a long and preferential to every one in surveyed communes. Farmers, whose life
     are very difficult, have to struggle for survival. Their incomes are not enough for self-
     sufficient, debts are always their trouble and they have no capital for production or
     business though they can see opportunities.
     To some other HHs, by saving, borrow money, they face risks and follow the strategy of
     "promote" in the direction of expand livestock production or in other field with higher
     profit. However, they have great difficulty in capital and market for products.
     Many HHs with livestock keeping in small scale said that they will be successful if they
     have capital to expand their livestock to larger scale (to raising cows, pigs) or move to

Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs183

     shrimp, fish raising, growing annual industrial crops. But they have difficulty in capital,
     and to many HHs who have livestock keeping with large scale, it is difficult to find
     market for their products.
     To HHs mainly live on income from aquatic products exploitation, or live on inshore
     sandy-beaches, they follow strategy of "retreating".
     In the first time, they let their children work for larger fishing ships, industrial zones,
they expect to save money to move to the trade.
     Though they choose any strategy, diversifying income with spirit of overcoming
difficulty is still the main problem in poverty riddance.

  Ms. Ngo Thi Lien, whose family has 5 main labourers and 2 small children. Up to 2001 they
  own only 0,5 plot to grow vegetables, mainly hiring, so they get enough for 6 months. In 2001
  they borrowed 3 million to buy a cow, after 12 months, it gave birth to a calf, which was sold at
  2,5 million dong, they used this money for sufficiency and grow fruits. In 2004 they sold both
  cow and calf, getting 8 million dong for repaying loans and redeeming a plot (1,5 million
  dong), building well and irrigation tools (2 million dong), improving fruit and rice growing,
  getting average of 500- 700.000 dong/ month. Contracting shrimp and fish ponds (1 plot) and
  they get out of poverty

From 2 typical stories, it can be seen that capital and land for the poor are really troublesome
and also the means for them to get out of poverty.
Sustainable livelihood acivities selected by the poor
- Through discussion of groups of poor women in 2 surveyed communes give similar results
as ideas of district and communal staffs about sustainable livelihood for the poor. That is a
model of cow raising with funded capital.
Cow raising model for the poor has been chosen by the poor. According to them, cows have
more advantages than sows and it will be successful with community-based management

V. SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STABLE LIVELIHOOD ACTIVITIES IN
COASTAL AREA IN TRA VINH PROVINCE


1. Solution to stabilize diversified incomes:

In fact, the process of traditional agriculture in general and rice cultivation in particular does
not bring much profit to Tra Vinh people. But they have to lean on rice regarding it as the
staple to ensure food and avoiding shocks because of the fact that they can not find an
alternative source of income. Rice and peanut tree are main crops to farmers in Tra vinh
province.

Besides such traditional ones, the local government and community has selected some
sources of livelihood that are appropriate to ecological features of territorial water such as:
mangrove forest's cultivation in combination with natural aquaculture and specialized
aquaculture, extensive farming in low-productivity agriculture soil, rice and farm produce in
sandy soil, cultivation in bare bank to improve income.


 It cannot be denied that applying these means, people have to accept unexpected natural
 risks as well as limited resources. To ensure the stability and efficiency of these means,
 comprehensive solutions that minimize cost for local people, especially the poor who take
 part in cultivating aquaculture and other kinds of stable means of livelihood should be
 worked out.

*Subsidy policy from the government:

- Gather intensive sources to carry out irrigation projects on specialized and extensive
aquaculture.

- Solutions for irrigation for dry areas such as: slope and sandy soil .

- Strengthen administration and apply technical process to variety production, food prosess,
food preservation and consumption.

-Establish seed plants and centres to test quality of seed in local communes and districts.

- Establish an information centre to provide aquaculture knowledge and techniques

- Strengthen training in aquaculture cultivation knowledge, focusing on practicing and setting
up models (cooperation, aquaculture cooperative) and strengthen models supervision and
management to ensure efficiency and stability.

- Reinforce specialised staff for local organisations. Establish network of to support fisher
family like the one in My Long Nam village.

- After crops, concentrate on science and technique, develop factories producing frozen
products.

- Carry out insurance policy to limit disadvantages.


Financial solutions (loans/credit):

*Aquaculture cultivation:


Engagement of poor fishing communities in the identification of resource management and investment needs187

    -Mangrove forest: loan period is more than 5 years, which is enough to cultivate 1 ha of
    forest; aquaculture variety and others appropriate creatures.

* Cultivation area :

  -Loan period is 2 years, preferential interest; average loan level is 10 per house hold which
  is enough for 1 ha of area cultivation.

  -Loan period is 18 months, preferential interest; average loan level is 10 per household
  which is enough for initial investment of 2 parts of rice and peanut cultivation.

  -The focus is on farmers' commitments to their loans because the poor are in fact not good
  at capital management

  -Method of lending: Through associations (especially the role of women's society), group
  of cooperation to strengthen the administration of community and support each other
  whenever there is any disaster.


Market solution:

- Establishing supportive system for agriculture, aquaculture at communes, districts to ensure
the quality of input price like variety, food, materials, fertilizer, technical services and
insecticide.

- Establish firm association among 3 and 4 households, among enterprises and cultivators to
guarantee mutual benefit.

2. Selected model:

2.1. The project manager:

With the aim to increase the capacity for management, community administration and
assisting the poor in sources of subsistence, the appointed leader of project is of communal
level, working under the control of district government.

2.2. Project area and beneficiary:

-In 2006-2010, the stable area of pro- poor aquaculture development is the one which is
under by district govenrment program.

- small ecological -diversified areas to carry out the project aming at diversifying income.

-   Based on the result of communal seminar, the group of consultans has reached an
agreement that Cau Ngang district is the appropriate area for running support project for the
poor in coastal area.

- According to drawn experience from communal                       models, it is essential to have the
percentage of about 25% of better-off and wealthy households who can share experience and
support in technique for the newcomers, besides, the better-off and wealthy ones also acted
as mirror for the new ones to overcome difficulties.

2.3. The selected means of livelihood:

 -Due to the fact that infrastructures for aquaculture are limited, it is difficult to build a
specialized manufacturing area (focus on aquatic product and seafood). The continuation of
one-crop time is essential to poor farm areas in Cau Ngang district to ensure firm source of
food supply. If poor poeple are only subject to traditional agricultural methods, it is difficult

to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty regardless of                        highly-potential aquaculture
development .

 -According to detail programme in consultant with local government and boards, the
 consultants have conducted some means of firm livelihoods that based on suitable resources
 and assist solutions enclosed. People will benefit from the results that they recognise the
 importance of sea resources. As a result, they will limit means of subsistence which are
 harmful to the environment and stable development such as: illegally and coastally
 aquaculture, deforestation, break programme etc that exhausted coastal sea resources).
