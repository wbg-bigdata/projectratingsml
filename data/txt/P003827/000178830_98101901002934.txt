I. THE WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND SANITATION SECTOR
A. Country Background
1.01      Indonesia has a total land area of about 1.9 million sq km, spread
out over a large archipelago, extending about 5,000 km from west to east, and
2,000 km from north to south. Its population of over 150 million is growing
at an estimated annual rate of about 2.3%, and population density is about
80 inhabitants per sq km. The island of Java has one of the highest
population densities in the world at close to 700 persons per sq km. About
20% of the population lives in urban areas, where the urban population is
growing at an annual rate of about 3.7% or 1.2 million persons per annum.
Jakarta and Surabaya, the two largest cities in Indonesia, absorb about 40% of
total urban growth.
1.02      Indonesia is divided administratively into 27 provinces, which are
subdivided into 246 districts (Kabupatens), which in turn are further
subdivided into about 3,300 subdistricts (Kecamatens). There are 54 self-
governing cities (Kotamadyas), about 3,300 district towns (Ibukota
Kecamatens), and about 65,000 villages (Desas). Jakarta, the largest city in
Indonesia, is the capital.
1.03      Indonesia-s economy is generally based on agriculture, but oil and
gas are also important natural resources. Economic growth has been substan-
tial. Despite the world economic recession and the surplus of oil in the
international market, Indonesia has achieved a relatively high economic growth
rate estimated at 7.8% in 1981. The inflation rate has declined from 17% in
1980 to about 7% in 1981. Indonesia's economy has been less affected than
that of other developing countries by the present international economic
situation.
1.04      As measured by standard indices, health conditions in Indonesia
lag behind those in other countries at a similar stage of economic develop-
ment. At the end of the 1970s, life expectancy in Indonesia was 53 years,
while the average for other low- and middle-income countries was 57 and
61 years, respectively. The average infant mortality rate was estimated at
about 100 per 1,000 births compared to about 55 in the Philippines and
Thailand, and 32 in Malaysia. Infant mortality rates as high as 200 per
1,000 births have been reported in some areas. Endemic diseases, caused
principally by a lack of safe drinking water and adequate sewerage and
sanitation are major factors behind these statistics. Diarrheal diseases
are a principal cause of morbidity and infant mortality. In 1974; the
latest year for which comprehensive statistics are available, Indonesia
exceeded all other countries in the number of cases and deaths from cholera.
In Jakarta alone the reported cases of cholera and typhoid fever exceeded
1,000 per annum.

B. Sector Service levels
1.05      It is estimated that 40% of the urban population had access to some
form of reticulated water supply in 1981. Most of this water supply suffers
from contamination, low pressure, and intermittent supply. A considerable
portion of the urban population does not have access to public water supply
and is dependent on water from vendors or from wells, streams or rivers at
considerable health risks.  Only about 20% of the urban population has
satisfactory sanitation facilities.
1.06      Of the rural population, only about 18% had access to potable water
from either reticulated water supply systems, tubewells with handpumps,
central rainwater collectors or protected springs in 1981. The remaining 82%
obtain water from unprotected streams, springs or wells. Only 24% of the
rural population is estimated to have satisfactory sanitation facilities.
1.07      While the present situation is still very unsatisfactory, there has
been considerable improvement over the last decade. The increase in water
supply and sanitation service levels between 1970 and 1981, in both the urban
and rural areas is shown in Table 1.1. The public water supply service level
of the total population rose from 2.5% in 1970 to 23% in 1981. However, the
absolute number of people without access to safe water remained almost the
same at 118 million in 1970 as against 117 million in 1981. The proportion of
the population served by sanitary facilities in the country has increased
from about 15% in 1970 to 23% in 1981, but the population not served also
increased, i.e., from 103 million to 117 million, with the urban areas
particularly falling behind.

C. Sector Organization
1.08       Three ministries of the Government of Indonesia (GOI) are princi-
pally responsible for the water supply, sewerage and sanitation sector. The
Ministry of Public Works is responsible for development in urban areas, the
Ministry of Health for rural areas, and the Ministry of Home Affairs,
indirectly, for overseeing operations (see para. 1.11). Other government
agencies with a role in the sector include the National Development Planning
Board (BAPPENAS) which allocates funds for development projects, and the
Ministry of Finance which disburses funds to the executing agencies and
establishes the terms under which such funds are provided.
1.09       Within the Ministry of Public Works, the Directorate General of
Housing, Building, Planning and Urban Development (Cipta Karya), among other
duties, is responsible for planning, design and implementation of water
supply, sewerage and sanitation projects funded by the central government.
In addition, it provides technical and managerial assistance to water supply
and sewerage utilities. (See paras. 2.02 and 2.03.)
1.10       The Ministry of Health, through its Directorate of Hygiene and
Sanitation (DHS) is responsible for rural water supply and sanitation. DHS,
funded by the central government, supervises design and construction, and
assists in operation and maintenance. The construction of locally-funded
rural water supply and sanitation works are undertaken by the Public Works
Departments of individual provinces.
1.11       The Ministry of Home Affairs, by virtue of its responsibility for
local government, indirectly has purview over the operations of water
supply and sewerage systems and the management of sanitation facilities.
Local governments provide these services either through specific departments
(Dinas) or semi-autonomous public utilities.
D. Sector Development
1.12       During the period covered by GOI's First Five-Year Development
Plan (REPELITA I, covering 1969-74), total capital investment in the sector
was close to Rp 16 billion. About 80% of this amount was contributed by
GOI, and included the funds provided by external assistance agencies; the
balance was obtained from various local sources including provincial bud-
gets. The initial emphasis was on water supply; production capacity
increased from 9,000 liters per second (lps) to 15,000 lps during the
period. Investment during the next five-year plan, i.e., REPELITA II
(1974-79), amounted to Rp 166 billion, of which Rp 140 billion was invested
in urban projects and Rp 26 billion in rural projects. Productive capacity
increased from 15,000 lps to 21,000 lps during this period.



- 4 -
1.13      Towards the end of REPELITA II, i.e., by 1979, it was recognized
that the pace of development needed to be further accelerated, and that in
particular the smaller cities and towns, many of which were without public
water supplies or sanitation facilities, must be accorded urgent priority.
Therefore, under REPELITA III (1979-1984) the Government embarked upon a
"basic needs" approach which was defined as the supply of 60 liters per
capita per day (lcpd) to 60% of the population in the cities and towns
included in the current and successive Plans. Under the impetus of the
International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade (IDWSD), overall service
level targets were set by GOI in 1981 for 1990 as follows:  urban and rural
water supply to serve 75% and 60% of the total population, respectively; and
urban and rural sanitation to serve 60% and 40% of the total population,
respectively. Two major programs for meeting the targets for urban water
supply in the 1980s are the basic-needs program for cities and larger towns,
and the Ibukota Kecamaten (IKK) program for small towns (see para. 1.19).
1.14      In respect of sewerage and sanitation, GOI has also taken several
initiatives. Included in the Kampung Improvement Program (KIP), which was
started in the early 1970s, are the provision of public facilities (MCKs) -
which provide washing and toilet facilities and public water taps, and solid
waste disposal projects (see para. 1.20). Pilot urban sewerage projects
were initiated, with asistance by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), in
Bandung (1979) and in Medan (1981). GOI has now proposed a first Jakarta
Sewerage and Sanitation Project (JSSP).
1.15      In 1981/82 the Government invested about Rp 65 billion in water
supply and sanitation projects, amounting to about 1% of the development
budget. In addition about Rp 7 billion were provided from local government
earnings, direct borrowing by the water utilities, and local contributions to
capital costs. The average annual investment program implied by the target
for the 1980s is Rp 318 billion or US$570 million (in constant 1981/82
prices); this would represent a more than four-fold increase. Its achieve-
ment is dependent on substantial and continuing improvements in implementation
capacity, and GOI's ability to raise substantial funds from central and
local sources, and obtain adequate financial assistance from external finance
and aid agencies. While the setting of high targets may contribute to
additional effort and achievement, GOI's program appears overambitious.
1.16      During the last ten years, multilateral finance agencies and bila-
teral aid donors have provided Indonesia with about US$300 million equivalent
in capital and technical assistance related to this sector. Among multi-
lateral agencies, the World Bank, ADB, the World Health Organization (WHO)
and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have been most active.
The Bank and ADB are active in urban water supply and sanitation, while WHO,
UNDP and UNICEF are supporting smaller systems in rural areas.  The
Governments of the Netherlands and Japan are the major bilateral donors. The
Japanese assistance has been exclusively applied over the past several years
to Jakarta's water supply development. The thrust of the Dutch aid has been



along the same lines as that of the Bank and ADB; it maintains a close
dialogue with both banks on sector policies, institutional development, and
manpower training for the sector.
E. The Bank's Previous Involvement
1.17      The Bank's objectives, which are consistent with those of the
Indonesian Government, in the water supply, sewerage and sanitation sector
are:
(a) Physical. The provision of basic water supply, sewerage and
sanitation facilities, in accordance with technology appropriate
to the local situation, in a cost-effective manner, and with
particular emphasis on the needs of low-income groups.
(b) Institutional. The development of new, and the strengthening of
existing, central and local institutions - including water supply
and sewerage public utilities - to improve their ability in
planning, implementing and delivering basic services.
(c) Financial. The creation of financially viable public utilities,
which can provide the various services at tariff levels which the
community can afford, and with a tariff structure which allows
for a degree of cross-subsidization so that, in total, such
utilities can cover operations and maintenance costs and recover
an appropriate proportion of the capital cost.
1.18      The Bank's first loan in the water supply, sewerage and sanitation
sector was made in 1975. The First Water Supply Project (1049-IND), in the
amount of US$14.5 million equivalent, was provided to: (a) increase and
improve the water supply and the distribution network in five cities, i.e.,
Malang, Purwokerto and Banyuwangi in Java, Jambi in Sumatra, and Samarinda in
Kalimantan; (b) train the staff required for the management of the beneficiary
water supply utilities; and (c) develop staff training programs, at the
national government level, in the areas of preparation and management of
national water supply programs.
1.19      A second loan (1709-IND), in the amount of US$36 million equivalent,
provided for a further water supply project and became effective in February
1980. This project provides for (a) expansion and improvement of existing
water supply and distribution systems in the cities of Tangerang and Surabaya
in Java, Jember in Sumatra, Pare-Pare in Sulawesi and Ambon in Molukai, and
(b) the construction of new water supply systems in Klaten and Purwakarta in
Java.  After initial delays most of the procurement contracts for the
supply of pipes and materials through international competitive-bidding (ICB)
were let. The execution of civil works in the project cities has commenced.
The management training of the staff for the water supply public utilities



- 6 -
has been underway since September 1981. Good progress has been made in the
training of staff in the project cities. A third water supply project, in
support of the basic-needs and IKK programs, is currently being prepared by
the Bank.
1.20       Substantial improvements have been made in sanitation through KIP
projects covered under the four Bank-assisted urban development projects. The
first loan was provided in 1974 (Loan 1040-IND), in the amount of US$25 mil-
lion equivalent, and covered a KIP project for Jakarta. The Second Urban
Development Project (Loan 1336-IND) was granted in 1976, in the amount of
US$52.5 million equivalent, and covered further Kampung improvement in Jakarta
as well as in Surabaya. The third and fourth projects (Loans 1653-IND and
1972-IND) approved in 1979 and 1981, in the amounts of US$54 million and US$43
million equivalent, respectively, continued to support the existing program
and extended it further to include other cities and towns. A fifth project is
currently being prepared by the Bank.
1.21       The Bank had a significant involvement in the formulation of the
development strategy for the Jakarta metropolitan area through the funding
(under Loan No. 1336-IND) of the preparation of the Jakarta Metropolitan
Development Plan (JMDP), which was completed in 1981. This plan covers in
detail the objectives and development strategies for land development,
housing, roads and railways, and the water supply, sewerage and sanitation
sectors. The proposed Jakarta Sewerage and Sanitation Project is consistent
with the JMDP.

2.01       In respect of the proposed project, GOI would be the borrower and
the proceeds would be allocated to Cipta Karya which, in cooperation with the
City Government of Jakarta, would implement the proposed project. It is
further proposed that on completion, the operation and management of the
project would be undertaken by either a new entity or be entrusted to PAM
Jaya - Jakarta's public water supply utility.
B. Cipta Karya
2.02       Cipta Karya, with a staff of about 5,000, is composed of five
Directorates, i.e., Building Development, Building Research, Housing, Urban
and Rural Development, and Sanitary Engineering. The Directorate of Sanitary
Engineering (DSE) - the directorate responsible for water supply, sewerage
and sanitation, with a staff of about 1,600, is composed of four operating



- 7 -
subdirectorates covering planning, construction, development and logistics and
an administration division. DSE also has regional project offices in 20 of
the 27 provinces; these offices normally execute projects outside Jakarta.
For large projects, including those receiving foreign assistance, DSE appoints
specific project managers, who work under the general supervision of the
Director of DSE.
2.03      About 400 of DSE's staff are employed at the headquarters in
Jakarta.  Of the total central staff about 200 are directly engaged on central
planning, development and construction activities. Most of the staff growth
took place over the last several years, in keeping with the growth in sector
programs. Wfhile the growth in staff has been reasonably satisfactory, DSE
has still some manpower constraints. For this reason DSE is making
increasing use of its Regional Project offices, and cooperates with local
government, including that for Jakarta, in the implementation of projects
(see paras. 4.01 to 4.04 for implementation arrangements for the proposed
project). Cipta Karya and DSE are also receiving considerable technical
assistance. The Bank is financing the services of a full-time expatriate
Management Advisor to the Director of Sanitary Engineering. The Australian
Government has provided six senior engineering advisors to DSE, and the
Dutch Government has provided an economist and an engineer to assist the
Planning Division in Cipta Karya's Secretariat (see Chart 1 for the
organization of the Ministry of Public Works and Cipta Karya, and Chart 2
for the organization of DSE).
C. DKI-Jakarta
2.04      The City Government of Jakarta (Daerah Khusus Ibukota or DKI),
under the Ministry' of Home Affairs, is responsible for the local government
functions, including the operation and management of water supply, sewerage
and sanitation in Jakarta. The legislative branch comprises the largely
elected Metropolitan Council. The executive branch of city government is
headed by a Governor, who is appointed by the central government. The
Development Planning Board (BAPPEDA - DKI), attached to the Governor's
Office, provides a significant input into the formulation and implementation
of the Jakarta development plans. DKI has a staff of about 58,000, of which
about 3,500 are employed in the Public Works Department (PWD). This
Department, which would assist Cipta Karya with implementation of the
proposed project, is responsible for construction and maintenance of roads,
municipal buildings, sports fields, parks and schools; it also is in charge
of the planning and execution of development projects (see Chart 3 for
organization of DKI-Jakarta).
D.  PAM Jaya
2.05      PAM Jaya (Perusahaan Air Minum - Jaya), Jakarta's public water
supply utility, is a semi-autonomous entity of DKI Jakarta. It is responsible
for the operation and maintenance, and augmentation of Jakarta's water supply.



- 8 -
A committee of Deputy Governors and DKI directors reviews PA's operating
budgets. Water rate increases must be approved by the Governor. In the
absence of a sewerage system, there is at present no specific entity of DKI
in existence which is responsible for the operation and management of the
future sewerage service. PAM Jaya - as an existing sector agency, would be
considered for this task.
2.06      During project preparation a review was carried out of PAM Jaya's
financial management, and its technical operations were assessed under the
JMDP.  This work lead to the conclusion that, at this stage, PAM Jaya is not
i.n the position to assume any new responsibilities. It provides water to
only about 50% of Jakarta's population. Unaccounted-for water is about 50%,
billing and collection efficiency is low, and it does not have a satisfactory
accounting system. PAM Jaya's procedures and performance need to be
substantially improved, both to improve water supply in Jakarta, and to
provide a sound basis for the operation, and future augmentation, of the
proposed new sewerage system - should it eventually be entrusted with this
additional responsibility (see para. 5.02).
III. THE PROJECT
A&. Project Genesis
3.01      In 1972, GOI undertook the preparation of a master plan for sewage
disposal in Jakarta which was to take account of the interrelationship between
sewerage, water supply, drainage and solid waste disposal. UNDP provided
funds for this purpose, and WHO became the executing agency. The consulting
firm Nihon Suido of Japan was appointed, and completed the preparation of the
master plan in 1977.
3.02      The master plan recommended the phased construction of a convenr-
tional water-borne sewerage system, discharging the untreated sewage into the
Java Sea. The total cost was estimated at US$500 million (in 1976 prices).
In subsequent reviews by GOI this cost estimate was considered very much
understated. The first phase would serve about 900,000 people in the Setia
Budi and Gambir areas in Jakarta, at a cost of about US$100 million. This
master plan was not implemented because of its extraordinarily high cost and
the apparent lack of justification for the construction of a conventional
waterborne sewerage system in many areas where lower cost solutions appeared
feasible.
3.03      In 1979, GOI and the Bank agreed to a different approach.  It was
decided that the technological approach should be a combination of sewerage,
drainage and sanitation works, including a reliance on the continued use of
septic tanks, pit privies and other low cost measures to improve sanitation.
It was also agreed that initially a small pilot project would be undertaken
to gain experience, which could be used to replicate the approach elsewhere
in Jakarta. GOI selected the Setia Budi area for the pilot project (see
paras. 3.04-3.08 for a description of the project area). The consulting
firm Alpinconsult of Switzerland was selected to carry out the feasibility
and engineering studies. The consultants, financed from an existing urban
loan, commenced work in July 1981.



-9-
B. Project Area
3.04      Jakarta's population is about 6.5 million and during the 1980s is
expected to grow at a rate approaching 4.5% p.a. or about 300,000 persons per
year. The city is relatively affluent with per capita earnings about 85%
higher than the national average. Nevertheless, the city has large pockets of
low-income population who live in very poor housing and environmental
conditions. It is estimated that about 45% of Kampung residents in Jakarta in
1980 had household incomes below the relative poverty level./l
3.05      Water supply in Jakarta is poor, only about 50% of the population
has direct access to reticulated water provided by PAM Jaya. The remainder
of the population, mostly low-income groups, buy water from vendors - often
at a cost in excess of 10% of household income - or obtain it from unprotec-
ted rivers, springs or private wells. PAM Jaya cannot readily improve the
quality and quantity of water produced and distributed because of an inade-
quate raw water supply, and poor treatment and distribution facilities and
operations. The water supply, whether reticulated, bought from vendors, or
obtained from other sources, is often contaminated. Raw water supplied to the
main water treatment plant is also heavily polluted (see Table 1 and Map IBRD
16659). Improvements in water supply are needed to achieve the full public
health benefits of the proposed project and of the various urban improvement
projects currently being implemented. Studies for the development of an
overall water supply master plan and for improvements in water supply
operations and management have been included under the project (see
para. 3.19 (d) and (e)). These studies would provide the basis for specific
action.
3.06      There is no sewerage system in Jakarta.  High-income residential and
business areas are normally served by septic tanks or leaching pits, which in
some locations work satisfactorily. However, sewage and liquid wastes from
other areas, and often the overflows of septic tanks and leaching pits, drain
into rivers and open channels, one of which is the Banjir Canal from which
water is drawn for Jakarta's main water treatment plant.
3.07      Because of the flat topography and low rainfall, there is little
flow in rivers, canals and drains in summer, leading to stagnation, while
during the monsoon period high rainfall and the inadequate drainage system
result in serious flooding - much of it contaminated by sewage. Important
improvements to the drainage system are in progress in some parts of the city,
including the projects referred to as Pluit polder and the Cenkareng Drain.
However, more needs to be done. Improvements in the drainage system will also
accrue from the solid waste disposal component included in the Bank-assisted
Third Urban Development Project (Loan 1653-IND), which should reduce the
amount of solid waste disposed of in open drains.
/1 The relative urban poverty level is defined as one third of the national
average income adjusted by the urban/national cost of living ratio.



- 10 -
3.08      The area of Jakarta selected for the proposed project covers Setia
Budi and Tebet; the latter area was subsequently included to cater for a
larger proportion of the urban poor. It is bounded by the Banjir Canal to the
north, the Ciliwung River in the east and the Jalans (roads) Haryono, Subroto
and Sudirman to the South and West. It covers about 2,000 ha, and has a
population of about 450,000 persons or about 7% of Jakarta's population. The
area has a mix of high, middle and low income areas, the latter being
predominant.  Its population density is higher than the average for Jakarta
(see Map IBRD 16658). It has substantial existing and projected commercial
and industrial development, a large railway yard in Manggarai, and some high
quality housing (see Map IBRD 16660). The area lends itself well for the
proposed project, as it will include different methods for sewerage and
sanitation improvements, serve different categories of customers, and with
cross-subsidization generate revenues adequate to cover operating and
maintenance costs and recover an appropriate share of capital costs.
C.  Project Objectives
:3.09     The principal project objectives are to:
(a) improve the environmental conditions and public health in the
project area to serve an estimated population of about 450,000;
(b) establish appropriate institutional arrangements for the operation
and management, and eventual augmentation, of the sewerage system;
(c) demonstrate the practical feasibility of low-cost and appropriate
technologies for improved sanitation; and
(d) contribute to the improvement of the technical operations and
management of Jakarta-s water supply.
3.10      The pilot project would also provide the catalyst for further
improvements in sewage disposal and sanitation through its eventual replica-
tion in Jakarta. It further acts as an incentive for a thorough review of the
water supply situation in Jakarta. The project is consistent with the objec-
tives of the Jakarta Metropolitan Development Plan.
i. Technological Approach
1.11      During the formulation of the earlier Bank-financed KIP projects
in Jakarta, it was recognized that the provision of the basic infrastructure
in the most needy areas, which these projects were to serve, would represent
a first and minimum level of improvement in environmental conditions. It
was envisaged that a second level of improvement providing better standards
in water supply, waste disposal and sanitation would follow. Accordingly,
under KIP about 9,000 ha of Kampung areas were improved to a minimum standard.
The proposed JSSP represents a start on the next level of urban betterment.
3.12      The studies leading to the JMDP (see para. 1.21) identified the
need for increased recognition of the close linkages between water supply,



- 11 -
sewerage, sanitation and solid waste disposal, and further proposed a zonal
approach, i.e., one based on natural boundaries, to urban improvements in the
Jakarta region.
3.13      The technological approach to JSSP has therefore been to analyze the
project area, and assess which solution appeared appropriate in each subarea
for each subsector, given the existing environmental conditions, population
characteristics and financial capabilities. Through this approach, it was
decided that the predominantly commercial areas, which have an adequate water
supply and have finiancial strength, could be served with a water-borne
sewerage system providing direct connections. Affluent kampungs, usually
located on higher ground, could often continue to be served with septic tanks,
while high-density lower-income kampungs could be served through the
collection of liquid wastes in drains connecting to major sewers.
3.14      On the basis of a survey of the sanitation situation in the
project area, the consultants concluded that in some areas other low-cost
improvements were possible through the provision of more leaching pits, the
provision of facilities for the desludging of septic tanks, the construction
of additional MCKs, and provision of additional public water taps. It was
also obvious that flooding from stormwater, mixed with sewage, was a serious
problem in some areas and that improvements were needed to the major (macro)
and minor (micro) drainage systems in the project area. The project
proposals were finalized by the consultants in June 1982, and provided the
basis for the appraisal of the proposed project.
E. Project Description
3.15      The project would include the construction of a sewerage system,
drainage works, sanitation improvements, training, and consultant services
covering engineering, institutional, technical and financial aspects.
3.16      The sewerage system iLncludes the components described briefly
below, and described in detail in Annex 1 and shown on Map IBRD 16657:
(a)  primary (interceptor) sewers in Setia Budi, including the lower
part of sewer A /1 and sewers B, C and F totalling about 7 km,
and related secondary and tertiary sewers totalling about
50 km;
(b)  primary sewers J, K, and M (collectively referred to as the
Manggarai extension) of about 12 km long. The primary sewers
would not at this stage have secondary or tertiary sewers; they
would intercept Kampung drains and convey wastes to the treatment
ponds;
/1 The upper part of sewer A will be constructed in about 1985 as part of
the upgrading of Jalan Subroto.



- 12 -
(c) a sewage pumping station;
(d) works to transform the Setia Budi and Melati flood control ponds
into combined sewage treatment (aerated oxidation) ponds and flood
control reservoirs; and
(e)  land acquisition.
3.17      The drainage component would cover macro-drainage improvements of
about 4 km of canal and river beds, and the construction of a new culvert
under the Manggarai Railway yard, which would relieve an area of Tebet which
is often flooded by monsoon flows from the Kali Bata (Bata River). This
component would also include micro-drainage improvements covering in total the
rehabilitation of about 177 km of drains, and the construction of 24 km of new
drains.
3.18        The sanitation component would include the following items:
(a)  the construction of about 3,000 leaching pits;
(b)  provision of desludging facilities and sludge transportation
equipment, construction of a sludge thickening station,
acquisition and preparation of a sludge disposal area;
(c)  the construction of about 30 new public washing and toilet
facilities, i.e., MCKs, together with connections to water supply
and provision for sewage and other liquid waste disposal;
(d)  the rehabilitation and provision of about 100 public water taps,
including the laying of about 12 km of pipes to connect existing
and new water taps to a water source; and
(e)  land acquisition.
3.19        The project includes consulting services and training as
follows:
(a)  construction supervision, including assistance with preparation
and review of tender documents, bid evaluation and procurement,
and the detailed design of drainage and sanitation facilities;
(b)  the preparation of feasibility studies for future water supply,
sewerage and sanitation projects;



- 13 -
(c)  the establishment of technical, administrative and financial
manuals and procedures, the establishment of a cost recovery
mechanism, and the drafting of appropriate regulations governing
the use of the sewerage system;
(d)  studies of the administrative structure and procedures, and
technical and financial operations of PAM Jaya and other agencies
which may operate the future sewerage systems;
(e)  technical assistance to review Jakarta's water supply, including
raw water supply, raw water transmission, treatment, distribution,
bulk and individual metering, and illegal connections and water loss
detection, and prepare feasibility studies for projects covering
immediate remedial improvements and a first phase project; and
(f)  staff training and fellowships for the design, operation and
management of sewerage systems.
3.20      The sewerage component would, when completed in early 1987, serve
an equivalent population /1 of about 260,000 persons, of which 190,000 would
be served by direct connections and about 70,000 would be served indirectly
through the collection of sewage and other liquid wastes through open
drains. Of those directly served, about 150,000 are the transient popula-
tion, including the work force and others involved in the daily commercial
and industrial activity in the project area; these people do not necessarily
reside in the project area. The primary and secondary sewers provided under
the project have been sized to cope with progressive intensification of the
sewerage network, and are projected to serve in excess of 700,000 persons by
1996, of which 540,000 would be served by direct connections and the
remainder being served indirectly.
3.21      The total area which would benefit from the drainage improvements
includes the low-lying areas in Tebet subject to flooding and occupied pre-
dominantly by low-income households. The sanitation component would also
primarily benefit the families living in the low-income kampungs. The bene-
fits of most of the public facilities to be provided would accrue to those
households which have not received the full benefits of earlier KIP projects
F. Cost Estimates
3.22      The total cost of the project, including physical and price con-
tingencies, but excluding duties and taxes, is estimated at US$37.2 million
equivalent, including a foreign exchange cost of US$19.4 million equivalent,
or about 52% of the total cost. A summary of the cost estimates is provided
in Table 3.1 below, and detailed project cost estimates are provided in
Annexes 2 and 3.
/1 Equivalent population served includes nonresidents who spend part of
their time in the project area, e.g., as workers in offices and
factories.

3.23      The cost estimates for the sewerage component are based on the
eletailed engineering design of the Setia Budi sewerage system, current price
lists maintained by Cipta Karya and DKI in respect of civil works contracts
recently let, and quotations by pipe and equipment suppliers. Cost estimates
for the drainage and sanitation works are based on contracts for similar KIP



1) 
works. The base costs are expressed at end-1982 prices. Physical contin-
gencies have been estimated at 15%l for sewerage, and 25% for drainage and
sanitation wcrks.  The higher percentage for the latter two components has
been selected because of their less advanced stage of preparation. Price
contingencies for local costs were estimated at 12% for 1983 and thereafter at
10% p.a., and for foreign costs at 8% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985,
and 6% for 1986 and 1987.  Thle price contingencies add 20% to the sum of the
base cost and pyh sical  contingencies.
3.24      The cost of consultants and training has been estimated at US$4.1
millior. equivalent, aE.cluding contingencies. For engineering, this comprises
about 5% of the cost o-f civil works, plant and equipment i.e., US$1.1 million
equivalent, and US$3.0 million equivalent has been provided for institutional
developmentX the preparation of future water supply, sewerage and sanitation
projects, and stiaff training and fellowships to study the design, operation
and management of serage systemsc  The consultants input corresponds to
about 480 man-months and about 270 man-months for local and foreign
consultants, respectively. This estimate is based on an average total cost
per man-month of US$2,500 equivalent for local consultants and US$10,500
equivalent for foreign consultants (at 1982 prices), including allowances for
international travel and subsistence.
3.25      GOI is also considering using bilateral technical assistance funds
from Japan for the review of Jakarta's existing water supply, since the
Japanese have an ongoing technical and financial assistance program for this
purpose. GOL has already approached the Japanese International Cooperation
Agency (JICA), and JIGA has indicated its agreement in principle. GOI expects
to have a firm commitment from JICA by early 1983. Because of the close
interdependence between water supply, and sewerage and sanitation, GOI has
agreed with the Bank that the Bank would review the Terms of Reference, review
progress and exchange views with GOI and JICA on any studies financed by JICA,
to ensure that the fullest possible coordination be maintained. Overall,
priority wo7uld be successively given to the institutional development for the
operation of the future sewerage system, the preparation of feasibility
studies for future water supply, sewerage and sanitation projects, and the
study of technical and instictutional aspects of Jakarta water supply, and if
GOI and the Bank agree, on the detailed design of the future sewerage and
sanitation projects in areas contiguous to the current project area (see Annex
4 for a summary of items to be covered by the Terms of Reference.) Agreement
was reached during negotiations that:
(a) the institutional studies required for the future sewerage
service, and stud4.es of the technical and financial operations of
PAIi Jaya and othe,- agencies which may operate the sewerage system,
be carried out by consultants in accordance with Terms of Reference
approved by the Bank; and
(b) such studies be zompleted by December 31, 1984, discussions be held
by June 30, 1985 on the recommendations resulting from these
studies and agreemnent be reached on an appropriate agency for
the operation of the sewerage system, and such agency to be
established by .April 1, 1986 to operate the sewerage system.

G. Project Financing
3.26       A Bank loan to GOI of US$22.4 million equivalent would finance the
foreign exchange cost of the project of US$19.4 million equivalent, local
currency financing of about US$2.8 million, and the Bank's capitalized
front-end fee of about US$200,000, covering about 60% of the total cost. The
loan would be for a period of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years,
at the standard variable rate of interest applied by the Bank. GOI would
provide the balance of about Rp 9.8 billion (US$14.9 million equivalent) from
its own resources as Daftar Isian Proyek (DIP) Funds - i.e., development
budget funds - to Cipta Karya, by way of annual budgetary appropriations.
3.27       The financing plan is as shown in Table 3.2 below.

:3.28      The completed project would be handed over by Cipta Karya to DKI-
Jakarta, by way of grant. GOI decided on this approach following detailed
consideration by BAPPENAS, the Ministry of Finance, Cipta Karya and DKI. It
was decided by GOI that this pilot project should be considered as a 'seed
project'; DKI would be expected to finance future expansion works from its own
resources. The beneficiaries of this project would nevertheless pay for the
recovery of the capital cost, which would be used for future expansion (see
para. 6.04). The mission discussed the advantages and disadvantages of this



- 17 -
approach with GOI, and has accepted it because of the pilot nature of the
proposed project. GOI does not regard it as setting a precedent for the
funding of subsequent projects of this nature.
H. Environmental Aspects
3.29      The project would result in substantial net environmental improve-
ments in the project area. Sewage and other liquid wastes, and sludge from
septic tanks, would be disposed of in a sanitary manner, and the provision of
additional MCKs and leaching pits would improve sanitary conditions
generally. The partial treatment of sewage through oxidation, and its
disposal into Kali Cideng, would result in a marginal improvement in the
quality of raw water at the intake for the Pejompongan Water Treatment Plant
in Banjir Canal, which currently receives untreated sewage flows. There
could be occasional minor problems with the operation of the sewage
treatment ponds, depending on the quantity of non-biodegradable detergents
carried by sewage flows, which would result in foaming; odors are not
expected to reach unacceptable levels. If any such problems arose, they
would be addressed during the initial stage of operations.
IV. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Management
4.01      In accordance with GOI-s policy for the decentralization of central
government responsibilities, and Cipta Karya's responsibility to provide
technical and managerial assistance to water supply and sewerage utilities,
the project will be implemented by Cipta Karya in cooperation with DKI-
Jakarta. To formalize this arrangement a Memorandum of Agreement was
executed between Cipta Karya and DKI which specifies their respective
responsibilities.
4.02      Under this arrangement Cipta Karya would have the overall responsi-
bility to implement the project but would delegate its responsibilities to
DKI. Cipta Karya has recently established a branch office (KANWIL) within
DKI, which would be used as the Project Management Unit (PMU); it would
primarily be responsible for coordination, and reports to Cipta Karya and the
Governor of DKI. The PWD of DKI would act as the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU), and would be responsible for the day-today implementation of the
project. Cipta Karya and the Governor of DKI jointly would appoint a Project
Manager, within the KANWIL, and a Project Director to head the PIU.
4.03      It is proposed that the Project Director be the current Chief of the
Sanitation Section within DKI's PWD. The PIU would be supported by staff
seconded from Cipta Karya's DSE, and by foreign and local consultants for
detailed design, construction supervision, preparation of tender documents,
bid evaluation, and reporting and monitoring. The staff to be deployed by DKI
would include several from DKI's KIP unit, which has considerable experience



- 18 -
in the implementation of Bank-assisted projects. Steering and Technical
Conmittees would be established to assist the PIU in project implementation.
4.04       The proposed project is in an advanced stage of preparation.  The
detailed design for the primarv sewerage system for Setia Budi and the
Manggarai extension have been completed.  Tender documents for the sewerage
component would be prepared, prequalification of civil works contractors
completed, and bids would be called for the supplv of pipes and equipment by
earlv 1983. The detailed design of remaining secondarv and tertiary sewers
will be carried out under the control of DKI. The design of the drainage and
sanitation component would be carried out bv local consultants in conjunction
with DKI, under the supervision of an expatriate consultant. A proposal for
construction supervision has alreadv been submitted to GOI.
B. Implementation Schedule
4.05       The physical implementation of the project would start at the com-
mencement of GOT's 1983/84 fiscal vear, i.e., April 1, 1983.  As preparation
for the calling of tenders and subsequent tender evaulation would be comple-
ted by then, award of the first contracts for project construction can be
made in earlv 1983. Project implementation has been scheduled over a period
of four vears, i.e., April 1983 to M1arch 1987.
4.06       The sanitation component, because of its relatively small scale, is
scheduled to be implemented during the first two years, i.e., 1983 and 1984;
the drainage component will be implemented during 1984 and 1985, and the
sewerage component over the full four-year period. The technical,
institutional and financial studies will be progressively carried out (see
para. 3.25). An implementation schedule is given in Annex 5.
C. Procurement
4.07      Works.  All contracts of Si million or more, which includes the
construction of major sewerage, macro-drainage, and sludge-thickening station
civil works, totalling about USS13.0 million equivalent including contingen-
cies, would be procured by ICB in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
There would be about four bidding packages of four to six individual contracts
each, which would be awarded jointly or separately to yield minimum evaluated
cost packages. The balance of construction to be financed under the project,
particularly the large number of small contracts for the sanitation and
micro-drainage components, totalling about USS2.0 million equivalent including
contingencies, which are not likely to attract foreign bidders, would be
procured by local competitive bidding (LCB) following GOI procedures. This
was confirmed at negotiations.
4.08       Goods.  All contracts of $100,000 or more would be procured by ICB
in accordance with Bank guidelines. Pipes, plant and equipment and other
goods, totalling USS11.0 million equivalent including contingencies, would be
grouped in bidding packages of not less than USS2.0 million equivalent each,
and be procured by ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. Pipes for sewers



- 19 -
would be procured under a bulk supply contract; other materials are expected
to be mainly included in civil works contracts. Qualifying domestic manufac-
turers would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15% or the import duty,
whichever is lower. Miscellaneous minor items in packages of less than
US$100,000 equivalent and totalling about US$2.0 equivalent, would be
procured under LCB procedures.
4.09      Contract Review.  All bidding packages for civil works estimated
to cost over US$2.0 million equivalent and bidding packages for goods over
US$500,000 equivalent would be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procurement documentation. These reviews would cover about 85% of the total
estimated value of civil works contracts and about 85% of the contracts for
plant and equipment. The balance of contracts would be subject to review by
the Bank after contract award.
D. Disbursements
4.10      Disbursements would be made against the listed expenditure cate-
gories as follows:
(a)  100% of the CIF cost of directly imported goods, and 65% of
locally procured imported goods;
(b)  95% of ex-factory costs of locally manufactured goods
procured through ICB;
(c)  40% of the costs of civil works contracts
(d)  100% of the costs of foreign and local consulting services
and training; and
(e)  Front-end fee - the amount due.
4.11      The historical disbursement profiles for Indonesia indicate signi-
ficant time overruns, particularly in settling final disbursements. The
disbursement period of the proposed project is projected over a five-year
period from 1984 to 1988. This shorter period is justified given the
advanced state of project preparation and the relatively small size of the
project. The closing date would be March 31, 1988. (See Table 2 for the
Disbursement Schedule, and Table 3 for the Allocation of Loan Proceeds.)
E. Project Accounts, Auditing and Monitoring Indicators
4.12      Project accounts would be maintained by Cipta Karya and will be
audited by GOI's State Auditor. Cipta Karya has an established system of
project accounting, which is satisfactory. During loan negotiations agree-
ment was reached that project accounts be maintained, that these be audited
by auditors satisfactory to the Bank, and that these accounts together with
audit reports be made available to the Bank within six months of the end of
each fiscal year. The PIU, through Cipta Karya, would send quarterly
reports to the Bank covering project implementation, including



- 20 -
achievement of performance standards set by the monitoring indicators. Not
later than twelve months after the closing date Cipta Karya would prepare
and submit a project completion report, satisfactory to the Bank, describing
project implementation including its physical and financial achievements.
Implementation will be monitored on the basis of the monitoring indicators
listed in Annex 6.
V. OPERATION
A. Sewerage Service
5.01      The legal responsibility for the operation of a sewerage service
rests with DKI-Jakarta. As sewerage would be a new service, there is a need
to make the necessary institutional arrangements for operations and mainr-
tenance, and for financial administration and accounting. The main technical
activity would be the operation and maintenance of pumps and sewage treatment
facilities. In addition to the normal maintenance of the system, regular
attention would be required to ensure that the intakes into which sewage
from open drains is diverted, are functioning properly. The main administra-
tive activity would be the billing and collection of sewerage charges.
5.02      GOI is tending towards a policy of combining the operation of new
sewerage systems with that of existing water supply public utilities;
accordingly, it would be GOI's intention that a study be carried out to
assess whether the proposed new sewerage service, on the completion of
construction, could be operated by PAM Jaya. PAM Jaya's performance was
reviewed during project preparation; the need for improvement was apparent
(see para. 2.06). Accordingly, consultancy services are provided under the
project for the review of PAM Jaya's technical, administrative and
accounting procedures so as to improve its water supply operations and
assess which improvements are necessary and which steps should be taken
before it could assume responsibility for sewerage operations (see para.
3.19(d)).
5.03      Consultants would also review the possibility of establishing
either a separate sewerage public utility or a seperate sewerage department
(Dinas) within DKI. Any of the alternatives for the operation of the
sewerage service would be acceptable provided (a) the authority and
accountability for the new service can be clearly established, (b) it can
operate as a semi-autonomous and financially viable entity having its own
accounting system and bank account, and (c) is able to offer conditions of
service would enable it to recruit and retain well-qualified staff.  The
sewerage service would be temporarily operated, and any preventive
maintenance carried out, by DKI's existing operating and maintenance
departments pending the formal establishment of an entity to assume the
responsibility for sewerage operations. These existing departments are
capable to satisfactorily carry out these technical functions.



- 21 -
5.04      The operation of the sewerage system to be constructed under the
project would require the use of the Setia Budi and Melati flood control
ponds as sewage treatment (aeration) ponds. At present the ponds are
maintained by the Directorate General of Water Resources Development.
During loan negotiations agreement was reached that a formal agreement for
the joint use of the ponds be executed not later than June 30, 1983.
B. Drainage and Sanitation
5.05      The operation and maintenance of the proposed drainage and sanita-
tion components can be absorbed into the existing departments of DKI, which
are already responsible for these services. Presently, the DKI Cleansing
Department is responsible for the desludging of septic tanks and leaching
pits; it would be provided with additional equipment under the project. The
drainage and sanitation components are relatively small as compared with
earlier KIP projects; it is therefore proposed that the operation and
maintenance of these components should be on the same basis as for these
earlier projects.
C. Administration, Accounting and Auditing
5.06      The consulting services included under the project (see
para. 3.19 (c)) would define the duties, powers and rights of the entity to
be responsible for the operation, maintenance and administration of the
sewerage system, and cover the drafting of an appropriate regulation. This
should include the appointment of officers and staff, conditions of service,
and accounting and audit requirements. In particular it would cover the
compulsory connection of permanent residences and other buildings to the
sewerage system, and the legal powers which apply in the case of illegal
connections, refusal to connect and to prosecute defaulting customers.
5.07      Administrative manuals would also be prepared by consultants to
define the internal operations of the sewerage entity, its organizational
structure, job descriptions, and other internal matters. An accounting
manual should be prepared for the operation of a full accrual accounting
system, inclusive of billing and collection procedures. Adequate internal
and external audit procedures would also be established. During loan
negotiations, agreement was reached that financial statements for the
sewerage service be prepared annually, commencing from the first year of
operations, and audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and that such
financial statements together with the Auditor's Report be submitted to the
Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year.

VI. COST RECOVERY
A. Cost Recovery Level
6.01      The principal financial objective is to ensure financial viability
of the project. Additional objectives are to establish a sound pricing
policy, and achieve appropriate levels of cost recovery and cross-
subsidization. Therefore, a revenue covenant should aim to ensure that
sufficient internally generated cash will be available to operate and
maintain the project facilities, meet debt service requirements, and - if
appropriate - provide a reasonable proportion of the funds required for
future investment. In the case of the proposed project, consisting largely
of sewerage works, and relatively minor drainage and sanitation components,
there are practical limits on what the community served can afford to pay.
There are also significant social benefits derived by the community which
cannot be readily recaptured by the agencies which would provide the
services. Hence, the ability to contribute to future investment is limited.
6.02      A financial projection has been prepared to test the financial
viability of the sewerage service. The projection covers a 5-year period
following the completion of the project in early 1987. The projection is
based on the following assumptions: (a) that additional connections will be
made during the projection period to utilize the reserve capacity of the
primary sewers installed under the project, (b) that cost recovery will be
through a user charge, and (c) that the tariff structure will provide for a
degree of cross-subsidization. Under such cross-subsidization (i) commercial
customers would pay twice as much, and industrial customers would pay three
times as much per person as would residential households with direct
connections, and (ii) a charge would not be imposed on that part of the
population, generally the very low-income households, who benefit only
indirectly from the sewerage service through the collection of their wastes
through open drains.
6.03      The financial projection, prepared on the basis of the above
assumptions, and the projected growth in the number of residential, commer-
cial, and industrial connections, shows that operation and maintenance
costs can be covered, that debt service requirements can be met, and that a
small contribution can be made to the funding of future investments. This
level of performance can be reached through a number of successive annual
increases in tariffs. An affordability test shows that the estimated
average sewerage bill for a household would amount to about Rp 1,400
(US$2.12) per month by 1987, increasing to about Rp 2,200 (US$3.33) by 1991.
In real terms, it would however remain fairly constant at no more than
Rp 900 (US$1.36) per month in 1982 prices.  This tariff level would
represent about 1.4% of the household income of a family with a household
income at the 50th percentile in 1987; which should be considered as
affordable (see Annexes 7 to 11 for details of financial projections and
related statistics).



- 23 -
6.04      While the projected financial performance would be satisfactory
for this project, it could well be that it would be harder to achieve for
similar sewerage projects in other areas of Jakarta or elsewhere in
Indonesia, which might have lower concentrations of commercial and
industrial activity. Nevertheless, it should be set for the proposed
project as a target to establish the principle of financial viability.
During loan negotiations agreement was reached that sewerage charges would
be set at levels so that sufficient revenues would be internally generated
to cover operation and maintenance costs, and meet depreciation or debt
service requirements - whichever is the greater. These charges would be
implemented when the system becomes operational; this is expected to be in
1987. The level and structure of charges would be reviewed at intervals of
not less than two years to ensure that the required level of financial
performance is achieved and that, through cross-subsidization, the charges
are affordable to low-income earners. It was further agreed during
negotiations that any surplus funds will be applied to the augmentation of
the sewerage and sanitation system.
B. Cost Recovery Mechanism
6.05      Since sewerage is a new service, there is presently no mechanism
which can be readily used for the recovery of operation and maintenance, and
capital costs. Accordingly, there is a need to establish an appropriate
mechanism for the recovery of costs, as well as a tariff structure, and
billing, collection and control procedures. GOI wishes to engage consultants
to review the various forms of taxes and user charges which might be
available to recover costs, taking account of economic efficiency and equity
criteria, ease of billing and collection, and customer acceptance.
Accordingly, the formulation of an appropriate cost recovery mechanism is
included in the scope of the consulting services defined in para. 3.19 (c).
6.06      A number of alternative taxes and user charges have been discussed,
each having advantages and disadvantages. The main alternatives which could
be considered include the following:
(a) A surcharge on water bills, as an indirect user charge, would
normally be easy to implement, and if tied to a proper tariff
structure would meet economic efficiency and equity criteria. It
would be appropriate if the majority of customers who benefit
from the sewerage service, are also customers of the water
supply public utility.  This is, however, not the case with the
proposed project, as many customers at this stage obtain water
from private wells and other sources. If PAM Jaya eventually
extends its area of operations and more uniformly serves,
through direct connections, the population in project areas, a
surcharge on water bills would be a viable option.



- 24 -
(b) Property taxation could also be used as a method to meet
sewerage operation, maintenance and capital costs. Indonesia
does have a national property tax, called IPEDA, which is
administered by the central government. The bulk of IPEDA
collections are returned by the national to the local govern-
ments. However, local government bodies, including DKI-Jakarta,
have little direct control over the magnitude and incidence of
this tax. It is also imposed citywide, and if used as a method
for cost recovery, would have the effect of having the population
in unsewered areas subsidize the people in the sewered areas.
(c) DKI-Jakarta has an urban betterment tax, called Pajak Khusus.
This tax provides for the recovery of up to 60% of the capital
cost of urban improvement works from direct beneficiaries over a
period of three years. This tax has been imposed in the past
but, with a collection efficiency of only 24%, 1has been
unsuccessful. It is also thought that the imposition of this
immediate and large tax, or for that matter the charging of a
connection fee, would lead to resistance by potential customers
to connect to the system. Apart from improving the collection
efficiency, other improvements would be required before this tax
could be considered as a mechanism for the partial recovery of
the capital cost of the proposed sewerage works. In addition,
another supplementary tax or user charge would be needed to
recover the operation and maintenance costs and remainder of the
capital cost.
(d) It would appear that a direct user charge would be the most
appropriate mechanism for the recovery of operation and
maintenance and capital costs. The tariff could be based on
(a) the estimated number of users per connection, which would
distribute cost in accordance to potential benefits, (b) the type
of effluent, e.g., household or industrial, which would put a
loading on the tariff in accordance with the degree of treatment
required, and (c) customer categories, which through
cross-subsidization would distribute cost in relation to each
customer category's ability to pay, differentiating among
residential, commercial and industrial customers.
6.07      In respect of the drainage and sanitation components, the cost
recovery policy and procedures were established under earlier Bank-assisted
KIP projects. Related costs are recovered through general taxes with some
minor user charges for direct services, such as, water supplied from public
taps, and desludging of septic tanks and leaching pits. It is proposed that
these established procedures should be continued. The drainage and sanitation
components would make little or no impact on DKI's finances (see Annex 12 for
a projection of DKI's revenues and expenditures).

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Justification
7.01      In the evolution of successive five-year development plans, GOI
initially gave priority in the sector to the increase in production and
distribution of potable water. Attention was also given to improving public
health through the successive KIP projects, which included substantial
sanitation components. More recently, attention was given to the development
of the first phase of sewerage systems in a few selected cities. These
development priorities and new initiatives should be seen against the still
unsatisfactory sanitary conditions in Indonesia, evidenced by high infant
mortality rates, and a very high incidence of water-borne diseases including
cholera, typhoid fever and intestinal diseases.
7.02      The proposed Jakarta Sewerage and Sanitation Project would be the
first modest step in the development of a sewerage system in Jakarta, and
would complement earlier Kampung Improvement projects. The project would
improve environmental conditions and public health of the population in the
project area. It would benefit to varying degrees about 450,000 people, of
which about 45% would be the urban poor. The project would contribute to
institutional development, and the formulation of appropriate financial
policies and practices to achieve financial viability of the sewerage service.
It would establish the regulations governing the use of the sewerage system.
7.03      The social and economic benefits accruing from a sewage collection
and disposal system, and the other sanitary improvements in the proposed
project are difficult to quantify satisfactorily. In assessing these
benefits, the reduction in the incidence of water-borne diseases and of infant
mortality, the enhancement in the quality of life, and prospects for greater
economic activity are all important factors. Taking the projected sewerage
charges as a rough proxy for project benefits, shows that the financial inter-
nal rate of return (FIRR), which provides a very conservative estimate of
project benefits as related to project cost, amounts to about 5.4%. Taking
account of the substantial additional social and economic benefits accruing,
particularly to the urban poor, this is regarded as satisfactory (see Annex 13
for the calculation of the FIRR).
7.04      The affordability test shows that, with an appropriate tariff struc-
ture, households will be able to afford the payment of the sewerage charges.
The average monthly sewerage charge in 1987 for a household with a direct
connection, which would normally be a middle- or higher-income household,
would be in the order of Rp 1,400 (US$2.12), which is about 1.4% of the
household income of families at the 50th percentile in the distribution of
household incomes. Furthermore, through the progressively increasing
utilization of the system, i.e., by providing more connections to the main
sewers provided under the project, average sewerage rates will remain fairly
constant in real terms over time.



- 26 -
B. Project Risks
7.05      There are no major risks regarding the physical implementation of
the project. However, the subsequent successful operation of the project
awaits the establishment of a capable institution that can operate and
maintain the sewerage service. The form and manner by which such an
institution would be established would depend on the recommendations arising
from various institutional studies to be carried out during project implemen-
tation. The ability of the Government to implement the recommendations
would influence the ultimate success of the project. Another risk is the
inherent difficulty in predicting the pace and extent at which customers
would be connected to the system. In recognition of the risks, the Bank
decided to pursue a relatively small pilot project. Experience with this
project would be used in defining the future development of a sewerage
system for Jakarta.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached with GOI that it
will cause:
(a) institutional, technical and financial studies to be carried out
by consultants in accordance with Terms of Reference approved by
the Bank, these studies to be completed by December 31, 1984,
agreement to be reached by June 30, 1985 on an appropriate
agency for the operation of the sewerage system, and such
agency to be established by April 1, 1986 (para. 3.25);
(b) the agreement for the joint use of the Setia Budi and Melati
ponds to be formalized not later than June 30, 1983 (para. 5.04);
(c) financial statements to be prepared for the operation of the
sewerage service, and have these audited and submitted to the Bank
within six months of the end of each fiscal year (para. 5.07); and
(d) sewerage charges to be set at levels so that sufficient revenues
would be internally generated to cover operation and maintenance
costs, and meet depreciation or debt service requirements -
whichever is the greater, charges to be reviewed at intervals
not to exceed two years, and any surplus funds to be applied to
the augmentation of the sewerage and sanitation system
(para. 6.04).
8.03      Subject to the above, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$22.4 million equivalent, for a term of 20 years including a grace period
of 5 years.

ANNEX I
Page 1 of 3
INDONESIA
JAKARTA SEWERAGE ATND SANITATION PROJECT
Project Description and Design Criteria
1.        The sewer system, including the interceptors, and the related
secondary and tertiary sewers to be constructed under the project have been
selected in order to serve a maximum number of customers, whether resident
or transient, with a minimum development of the sewer reticulation network.
It is located close to the downstream north-west end of the project area and
the Setia Budi ponds. The land use plan (see Map 4) indicates that the
area to be sewered includes most of the existing and projected commercial and
industrial sites with large commercial/offices developments and high rise
buildings (of up to 24 stories high, along the major roads) at the western
edge of the project area. This implies that further development of the
sewerage system elsewhere in the city may have to proceed in less affluent
areas, which would affect, for example, cost recovery. The interceptor B
(and in the future interceptor A as well) will catch the sewage of the
watersheds in which they are laid, beyond the border of the project area as
originally defined (see Map. 2).
2.        The number of potential resident customers to be served has been
determined on the basis of the statistics published by DKI for 1980,
detailing the population in the Kelurahans (subdistricts), and projected to
the year 2000 in accordance with the assumptions contained in the JMDP.
These data were expressed in terms of the population density per hectare.
Water consumption and waste water to be discharged into the sewerage system
are also based on JMDP estimates.  For commercial/industrial buildings, the
estimated "equivalent population" was estimated on the basis of the land
area in hectares, and waste water flows were estimated accordingly. The
populations served, particularly the "equivalent" population in all non-
residential buildings, are approximations only of the number of customers -
present and projected - which are used in projecting the number of connec-
tions and in testing the level of cost recovery. Actual rate of connections
and cost recovery levels will be based on different and more accurate
variables (e.g., type of connection, number of appurtenances serviced, or
property frontage, etc.)
3.        The Manggarai extension will intercept all remaining discharges,
including Kampung inlets, from the project area and thus prevent it flowing
into the Banjir canal. This would also improve the operation of the drainage
system in the populous northern and northeastern parts of the project area.
4.        All discharges from the project area now going into the Banjir
canal, including some flow from areas beyond the project's southern limits,

will be diverted through the Setia Budi ponds to the Kali Cideng, thereby
bypassing and no longer polluting the Pejompongan Water Treatment Plant
intake.
5.        Electrically operated aerators will be installed in the Setia
Bundi ponds and the Melati pond, the latter located north of the Banjir
canal. During the dry period of the year these flood reservoirs will
operate as oxidation ponds.  The ponds will need to be deepened.  The total
available area is however limited, and therefore the limited retention time
will not allow these ponds to remove more than an estimated 60% of the BOD
load from the discharges they will receive. Without such treatment and the
disposal of pond effluent through the syphon under the Kalicideng, the
pollution of the Banjir canal, and consequently of all the areas of the city
downstream of Setia Budi, would have worsened by the project; the sewer sys-
tem would have diverted more sewage to the Banjir canal than the drainage
system does at present. The quality of the water at the origin of the
Banjir canal will remain, however, heavily polluted (see Table 1), and
therefore the beneficial effect on Jakarta water supply provided by the JSSP
is marginal only.
6.        While the earlier KIP considered the need of individual kampungs,
the proposed JSSP covers a large area of Jakarta, and includes 37 kampungs
and other areas not included within kampungs.
7.        The sanitation survey shows that at present the major problem in
the kampungs is the inadequate water supply. A number of public water taps
and several MCKs constructed in the area, with supply pipes concreted in the
paths, have never been connected to a main or a deep well. Water meters and
taps have in some cases been removed or have never been installed. This
appears to be due to the reluctance of PAM to connect or supply outlets
wlhich bring in little, if any, revenues, and because of its inefficiencies
in water production and distribution. These taps should be rehabilitated
and connected to a water source. There is also a need for about 100 addi-
tional public taps, so that people can fetch the water they need and hence
do not have to rely on water vendors. Twelve km of pipes will be laid and
connected to new and rehabilitated standpipes, and a few deep wells will be
constructed.
8.        There are currently 24 MCKs at present in the area.  Three are out
of operation (due reportedly to lack of money for desludging the septic
tanks and paying the operators). The level of maintenance depends to a
large extent on the availability of water.  Results appear best where there
is self-help maintenance, collection of fees for septic tank desludging
(about every 1-1/2 years), and where there is no direct charge. The rehab-
ilitation of the existing MCKs, by putting a roof on those which have none
(most of them), connecting them to a source of water, and the construction
of 31 new MCKs together with leaching pits or septic tanks, is needed to
serve adequately the lower income areas.

9.        There are an estimated 32,000 leaching pits in the project area,
serving mainly middle-income groups. They were constructed by local labor
(about 50%), self help (40%) and a few as part of KIP projects. Most of
them work well, needing desludging about once each year. Some of them,
because of poor construction (too small and shallow), poor leaching capacity
of the soil, and because of lack of adequate desludging are clogged. An
estimated 3,000 new leaching pits are needed, and should be constructed by
residents. Because some of the latter may not have the cash needed, low
interest funds should be made available to them, which should be repaid in
installments. The allocations of such funds should be left to the discretion
of the RTs and their people, but public health requires that waste be dis-
posed of everywhere; therefore there are areas where construction of leach-
ing pits should be mandatory./l It is further planned to develop improved
construction standards for leaching pits, on the basis of 40 test pits, dug
into different soils, in areas where there are probelms now and funded under
the project.
10.       There are also an estimated 34,000 septic tanks in the project area.
They are usually in higher income areas, where little improvement, if any, is
planned.
11.       CD desludging equipment needs to be improved and increased in
number to maintain the present level of service in the city, and adequately
serve the project area. Five vacuum trucks with 80 m long suction pipes to
reach deep within the kampungs are required as are two vacuum trailers (of
modified design) to reach the least accessible dwellings, and a large tanker
for transportation and ultimate disposal of the thickened sludges. They
will be provided by the project. A transfer and thickening station will be
constructed close to the Setia Bundi ponds. This should, together with the
above transportation equipment, prevent further unsanitary discharge of
collected sludges into waterways or unapproved locations.
12.       Substantial draining improvements are necessary to rehabilitate
existing drains and construct new ones, including an urgently needed canal/
culvert on the Kali Barat, in the area of the Manggarai railway yard.
/_ Estimated construction cost: Rp 250,000 (about US$400)

ANNEX 11

JAKARTA SEWERAGE AND SANITATION PROJECT
Assumptions Used in the Financial Projections
Income Statement
1.        Revenues earned are based on the demand projections for the
various categories of connections as shown on Annex 10, weighted by the
average number of persons served per connection, and tariff weightings under
which commercial customers pay twice as much and industrial customers three
times as much as do residential customers per person per connection.
High rise connections mainly cover multistorey office buildings.
2.        Doubtful Debts, i.e., that part of revenues which is uncollect-
able, is assumed to amount to 15% in 1987, 12.5% in 1988, 10% in 1989, 8% in
1990, 6% in 1991 and 4% per annum thereafter.
3.        Expenditures are expressed in current prices and are based on an
assumed annual rate of inflation of 10%.
4.        Operating Income, being the difference between Operating Revenues
and Expenditures, is sufficient to cover operation and maintenance and debt
service requirements.
5.        Performance indicators are computed as follows:
(a) Rate of Return = Operating Income X 100
Average Rate Base /1
(b) Operating Ratio = Operating Expenditures
Net Operating Revenue
Cash Flow Statement
6.        Net revenues earned in each year are assumed to be received over
two years, i.e., the bulk in the first year and the balance in the second
year; percentages received in the first years are assumed to be: 75% in
1987, 82% in 1988, 85% in 1989, and 90% per annum thereafter.
/1 Average rate base equals the average of the opening and closing balances
