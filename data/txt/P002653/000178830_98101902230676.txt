INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND
FOR A WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Kingdom of Swaziland for the equivalent of US$3.5 million to
help finance a project for water supply and sewerage. The loan would have
a term of 25 years, including four years of grace, with interest at eight
percent per annum.. The proceeds of the loan would be relent on the same
terms to the Water and Sewerage Board (WSB) of the Ministry of Works, Power
and Communication.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Memorandum on Recent
Economic Developments and Prospects of Swaziland" (AE-25), was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 1, 1972 (R72-91). The principal findings
and conclusions of that report, brought up to date, are summarized below.
An updating economic mission is scheduled to visit Swaziland in February
1975. Country data are summarized in Annex I.
3.        Swaziland, which became independent in 1968, is one of the smallest
countries on the African continent. Located in southern Africa, it is complete-
ly surrounded by the Republic of South Africa and Mozambique. In 1973 its pop-
ulation was estimated at 493,000, with approximately 30,000 citizens living
abroad, mainly as migrant workers in South Africa. The country is well endowed
with natural resources. It has a variety of mineral deposits, and its soil and
climate are favorable for a diversified agricultural production. Almost half
of the land is owned by foreigners, and foreign companies hold substantial
mining concessions.    The 1950s saw a rapid development of modern economic
activities on foreign-owned land. Several mines (asbestos, iron ore and coal)
were opened up, and foreign companies established substantial plantations
(forestry, sugar, citrus, pineapple), which in turn gave rise to industries,
such as a pulp mill, saw mills, sugar mills, fruit processing plants and var-
ious secondary industries. During the period from 1953 to 1962, when these
industries were established, real GDP grew at more than 12 percent a year.
Apart from tourism enterprises, no major new industries were established after
1963, but expansion of existing enterprises and the establishment of a number
of smaller industries led to a well-sustained real growth in GDP of about
seven percent a year between 1963 and 1972. GNP per capita was estimated at
about $260 in 1972.
4.        Swaziland's sustained economic growth has been a result of vigorous
private investment activity. Over the past three years, gross private invest-
ment averaged about 19 percent of GDP. Government capital expenditures were



on the, average no more than five percent of GDP. These developments have led
to a clistinct dualism in Swazi society and the economy. As Swazi entrepreneur-
ship was, and still is, virtually non-existent, all modern activities have
been c:arried out by foreign companies, under fore[gn management, and with
foreign capital. The foreign-owned modern sector now contributes about 70
percernt of GDP, 80 percent of wage employment and 90 percent of direct taxes.
The traditional rural sector, which has remained stagnant over the years,
contributes no more than 10 percent of GDP, and recently has been losing
significance in terms of numbers of people dependent on it. Wage employment
within Swaziland grew by about 10 percent a year between 1960 and 1972, which
was enough to absorb the natural increase in the labor force and the drift
from the land. In addition, the growth in wage labor made possible a reduction
in the number of Swazi working in South Africa. In 1972, it was estimated
that employment in the modern sector was in excess of 60,000 persons, about
40 percent of the estimated total labor force. Projections of the likely
increase in wage employment, based on existing trends in output and investment
in the different sectors, indicate that at least 15,000 new jobs will be
created by 1978. There is already a serious shortage of skilled Swazis to
work in the modern sector, and this situation is not expected to improve
before the early 1980s.
5.        Agriculture accounted for 35 percent of GDP in 1971/72 with almost
70 percent originating in the modern, foreign-owned sector. The majority of
this output came from estate production of cash crops such as sugar cane,
fruit and vegetables, for export after processing. In addition, a number of
large forestry plantations produced raw materials for saw mills and a pulp
mill. Approximately 40 percent of total wage employment in Swaziland is pro-
vided by the modern agricultural sector. Some 80 percent of the total pop-
ulation live in rural areas and have some land for grazing and the cultivation
of crops. Many men, however, commute to the centers of modern economic activ-
ity which are all within easy reach. Traditional agriculture is to a large
extent carried on by women, children and old men. Mining contributed about 10
percent of GDP in 1971/72, largely due to the extraction and export of iron
ore, asbestos and coal. Manufacturing in 1971/72 accounted for 13 percent of
GDP and employed about 7,000 people.
6.        Together with Botswana, South Africa and Lesotho, Swaziland belongs
to the rand monetary area and the Southern Africa Customs Union. Swaziland
receives a proportion of the total customs and excise revenue of the whole
customs area, related to her total imports. Movement of goods and funds with-
in the area is virtually free. In September 1974, Swaziland issued its own
national currency, the lilangeni (plural - emalangeni). The lilangeni has the
same par value as the rand and both currencies are legal tender in Swaziland.
The Government, with the assistance of the IMF, has established a Monetary
Authority to operate Swaziland's new financial system.    In order to remain in
the rand monetary area and be able to continue drawing on the foreign exchange
reserves of South Africa, Swaziland has agreed to maintain 100 percent of the
value of the emalangeni in circulation in a rand account in the South African
Reserve Bank. This requirement limits the Monetary Authority's implementation
of an independent monetary policy as the Authority does not have control over
domestic credit creation.



7.        In 1969 the Customs Union Agreement among the four countries was
re-negotiated and this provided Swaziland with substantially increased revenues.
These together with additional revenues generated by better tax collection and
the introduction of new taxes, have enabled Government recurrent revenue to
increase steadily from E9.5 million in 1968 to E24.3 million in 1973. At
the same time recurrent expenditures were controlled, increasing from E12
million in 1968 to E21.4 million in 1973. As a result, budget deficits (E2.5
million in 1968) turned into surpluses (E2.9 million in 1973). The recent
budget surpluses are expected to continue and this should make it possible for
the Government to finance almost 50 percent of future public investment. To
complement the finance from domestic sources, new commitments of external aid
will be necessary in the medium-term, increasing from about E7 million in 1975
to E15 million in 1980. Part of the public sector investment program cannot
be translated into projects that would attract external financing. To provide
sufficient support for the investment program the external assistance agencies
would, therefore, need to finance about 75 percent of the cost of the projects.
This would include local cost financing, especially for agricultural and educa-
tional projects, where external costs constitute a small proportion of the
total cost.
8.        Given Swaziland's membership within the rand monetary area and access
to South Africa's exchange reserves, the conventional concepts of foreign ex-
change costs and balance of payments position are not of much significance.
Swaziland's exports increased from E39 million in 1968 to E76 million in 1973.
At the same time, imports rose from E34 million to E63 million. As Swaziland
sells most of its exports overseas, and imports from South Africa account for
about 90 percent of total imports, Swaziland is a substantial net earner of
foreign exchange for the rand monetary area.
9.        Swaziland's National Development Plan (1973-77) emphasizes four
objectives: (1) to create the conditions for a sustained further growth of
the private sector; (2) to promote the transformation of traditional agri-
culture to commercial farming; (3) to improve the relevance and usefulness
of education; and (4) to provide better housing and health conditions for
low-income families in urban and rural areas. The Government realizes that
most of the momentum in the economy will come from the modern sector, and
much of Swaziland's development plan is geared to improving productive capa-
city of the country's modern economy. At the same time, a significant per-
centage of the population remains in traditional agriculture and will continue
in that activity through the next decade. One of the major constraints to the
development of traditional agriculture is the fact that prospects for agri-
cultural earnings do not compare favorably with incomes in the modern sector
in Swaziland or in various sectors in South Africa, and thus there is a lack
of male labor.
10.       Until 1970 the United Kingdom provided funds to cover Swaziland's
budget deficits as well as grants and long-term interest-free loans for devel-
opment purposes. During the last few years, Swaziland has sought to diversify
its sources of foreign assistance. As a result, in addition to the UK, several
bilateral agencies have begun to make contributions to the financing of
Swaziland's capital budget. Because of the slow build-up of absorptive



- 4 -
capacity, the utilization of foreign assistance has been sluggish. Recent
experience suggests that the country's absorptive capacity is improving, as
the l'ocal staff benefit from training and experience.
11.       On December 31, 1973, Swaziland's external public debt (including
undisbursed) stood at US$46 million, and total debt service obligations
amounted to US$6 million, or five percent of the exports of goods. Swaziland's
future external pulblic debt (including undisbursed) is expected to increase
to US$291 million by 1985 and total debt service obligations to US$15 million,
or three percent of exports. Since the Government is able to draw on the
foreign exchange earnings of the rand monetary area, the debt service ratio
expressed as a percentage of exports is mainly an indication of what Swaziland's
external debt carrying capacity would be if the country became independent of
the rand monetary area. A more useful indicator of the Government's current
debt service capacity at present is the ratio of debt service payments to
government revenue. In 1973, servicing of existing public debt represented
4.5 percent of current government revenue; by 1985 we estimate this will have
increased to six percent.
12.       As a result of favorable export and public revenue prospects, Swazi-
land's ability to service debt on conventional terms has improved considerably
and the country is now considered creditworthy for limited amounts of Bank lend-
ing. Except for the education project being presented to you along with this
proposed loan, no additional IDA credits are planned for Swaziland, but this
situation will be reviewed after we hiave received the report of the upcoming
economic mission.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SWAZILAND
13.       The Bank Group has so far had three operations in Swaziland.   An
IDA credit of $2.8 million, approved in 1962, helped finance the construction
of an all-weather road across the country; the construction was completed in
1964. Thereafter, two loans (guaranteed by the IJK) were made to assist the
Swaziland Electricity Board (SEB) in the development of the power sector.
The first, a $4.2 million loan made in 1963, enabled SEB to carry out the
Edwaleni hydroelectric project; the second, a $2.75 million loan in 1967,
financed the extension of the same project and the provision of an additional
diesel plant. All three are fully disbursed. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Swaziland.
14.       In our proposed operations we are aiming to support the Government's
priorities as spelled out in the National Development Plan (see para. 9).
While assisting in the development of the modern sector, we will also attempt
to stimulate growth in the traditional rural sector which, despite its dimin-
ishing size and importance, will continue to support a significant percentage
of the population. The Bank Group has not financed a project in Swaziland
since 1967. This is partly due to a concentration of our effort on preparing
one major project, the Maphobeni irrigation project. Unfortunately, the
Maphooeni project was found, on appraisal, to be uneconomic. The capital
costs and overhead costs proved to be much higher, and the amount of irrigable



- 5 -
land much less than suggested by the feasibility study. We have, thereafter,
intensified our preparatory work in other areas and, as a result, expect to
present three projects for your consideration in FY75. In addition to this
water supply and sewerage project, an education project, which is being sub-
mitted to the Board along with this project, would assist in the development
and reshaping of Swaziland's educational system. A second roads project,
which has been appraised, consists of the construction of two priority roads
linking up areas of major agricultural production with the country's main
commercial centers and transportation routes. Preparatory work is underway
on several other projects. We are attempting to identify a development
finance company project to help promote Swazi enterprise in the industrial
sector. In addition, we are in the early stages of identifying a rural
development project which would focus on improving livestock and crop produc-
tion through the introduction of grazing controls and conservation methods,
and the provision of inputs such as credit and extension services.
15.       As a result of the substantial increase proposed in Bank Group
operations, debt to the Bank Group as a percentage of total debt is projected
to increase from its current level of 10.6 percent to about 21 percent in 1985.
The Bank Group's share in total external public debt service woul increase from
11.4 percent at present to about 34 percent in 1985.
PART III - WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE IN SWAZILAND
16.       The water supply and sewerage facilities in Swaziland are in an
early stage of development. Prior to 1960 Swaziland had no towns with
more than 15,000 inhabitants and the available water supply and sewerage
systems provided services on a very limited basis. During the 1960s
Swaziland experienced a rate of urban growth averaging eight percent per
annum. By 1973 the population of Mbabane, the capital, was estimated at
25,000, and Manzini, the major industrial center, at 26,000. The growth
experienced by Mbabane and Manzini in the last decade has necessitated
piecemeal improvements to their existing water supply and sewerage systems,
which were originally designed for much smaller populations. The original
water treatment plant in Mbabane was constructed in 1953 and the first
sewerage system in 1960. Similar systems were constructed during the same
period in M4anzini. In 1973 the Government estimated that 51 percent of the
Mbabane and Manzini populations were served with water through house connec-
tions, 27 percent received water from standpipes and 22 percent did not have
reasonable access to the public system. At the same time, the Government
estimated that 15 percent of the Mbabane and Manzini populations had connec-
tions to the public sewerage system.
17.       The only public sewerage systems in Swaziland are in the Mbabane
and Manzini areas. A number of company towns operate private water supply
and sewerage facilities in conjunction with their commercial operations.
Although recent government investments have expanded the water collection,
storage and treatment facilities as well as the sewerage treatment facilities



-- 6 -
in Mb.bane and Manzini, expansion of the distribution network is necessary
to allow a larger proportion of the population to benefit from these investments.
18.       Until early 1974 the Ministry of Works, Power and Communication
(MWPC), through the Water Branch of its Public Works Department, was largely
responsible for water and sewerage operations. Following the recommendations
of a study financed by the British Government and with the encouragement of
the World Bank, the MWPC was reorganized in early 1974. The responsibility for
water supply and sewerage services in the country was transferred to a new or-
ganizational unit, the Water and Sewerage Board (WSB) (see para. 22). The
Water Resources Section within the MWPC was assigned responsibility for pollution
control, water usage control, and hydrological and meteorological studies.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
19.       The project is the outcome of the aforementioned British-financed
study of Swaziland's water supply and sewerage facilities undertaken in 1972
by Brian Colquhoun and Partners, London, England.    A Bank mission appraised
the proposed project in February 1974. The report of the appraisal mission
entitled "Swaziland Water Supply and Sewerage Project" (Report No. 509a-SW)
is being circulated separately. A loan and project summary is attached as
Annex III. Negotiations were held in Washington from September 13 to 19,
1974, with a delegation led by Mr. V.E. Sikhondze, Undersecretary of the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.
Project: Description
2().      The proposed project would cover approximately 55 percent of WSB's
estimated total construction program between 1975 and 1978. The principal
elements include the expansion of the existing water supply and sewerage
network in M4babane township and the Manzini area, and the construction of
new water supply facilities in Nhlangano. The new Mbabane and Manzini facil-
ities would enable the WSB to obtain fuller utilization of recent capital
investments in this sector. The water facilities in Nhlangano are required
to prevent a water shortage, which otherwise is predicted for 1976, and to
provide water for the expanding population and a new textile mill which is
shortly to be established in the town. The project would strengthen the WSB
institutionally by providing technical assistance both for accounting services
to establish a commercially oriented financial and statistical information
system and for foreign technicians to train WSB staff in operation and mainten-
ance techniques. Funds would be provided to permit post-graduate training
abroad of three engineers and two accountants and for purchasing two fully
equipped maintenance trucks, a meter testing bench and small items of equipment.
21.       The proposed water supply facilities for Mbabane include construction
of a pumping station on the Black Mbuluzi River and its connection by force
main to the Woodlands treatment plant, enabling the full use of the treatment



- 7 -
plant capacity. About 9.5 km of pipewould be added to the existing distri-
bution network. The sewerage reticulation system in Mbabane would be extended
and the western outfall would be completed to permit eventual sewer reticulation
of all the residential areas on the Mbabane River watershed. As a result,
between 4,000 and 6,000 Mbabane residents wouldbe added to the town's water
and sewerage system. In Manzini, the project provides for the construction
of 6 km of water mains and 19 km of extensions to the distribution network.
Manzini's sewerage system is presently polluting the Mzimnene River due to
chronic overloading of the oxidation ponds. The project would improve the
oxidation ponds by recirculating the effluents and by the addition of mechani-
cal aerators with some deepening of the ponds where this can be done at low
cost. About 15 km of collecting sewers would be laid in Kwaluseni, a high
density satellite town of Manzini, and the water distribution network extended
to a larger segment of the population. About 7,000 residents of Manzini/Kwaluseni
would benefit from the proposed project. In Nhlangano, a town of 2,700, the
existing water supply system cannot be economically extended and a new source
is required to meet the expanding needs of the town and to supply a new textile
mill. The project includes the construction of the new treatment plant, a
9 km long force main and the addition of 6.5 km to the town's distribution
system. The proposed works are consistent with the master town plans for the
Mbabane-Manzini area.
22.       The project would be executed by the Water and Sewerage Board (WSB),
a new, semi-autonomous organizational unit within the MWPC which the Govern-
ment envisages wouldeventually be transformed into a public corporation. The
WSB is controlled by a six-man board made up of four senior civil servants,
and two other persons appointed by the Minister of Works, Power and Communica-
tions. The chairman of the board is MWPCs Permanent Secretary; WSB's Direc-
tor is the Secretary. The Government has recruited WSB's Director and Finan-
cial Controller from abroad until qualified Swazi become available. The Gov-
ernment has agreed that future appointments to the two positions wouldbe made
after consultation with the Bank (see Section 4.04 of the draft Loan Agreement).
There is a severe shortage of Swazi engineers and accountants and it seems
unlikely that WSB wouldbe able to attract local men with sufficient qualifications
and Axperience for some years to come. WSB wouldrequire assistance initially
to establish commercially oriented policies and procedures, and provision
for consultants' services is included in the proposed loan. The accounting
consultants also wouldhelp train WSB's staff in proper commercial procedures
as well as train the senior staff in the use of management reports. Employment
of acceptable accounting consultants was made a condition of loan effective-
ness (see Section 6.01b of the draft Loan Agreement).
23.       It is expected that final engineering plans wouldbe completed by
early 1975 and that the bulk of the construction would be undertaken in 1976
and 1977. Completion of the construction is scheduled for September 1977.
Project Costs
24.       The total cost of the project, excluding interest during construc-
tion, is estimated at US$4.5 million equivalent. Of this amount, about US$3.0



- 8 -
million, or 67 percent, would be for expenditures on goods and services from
outside Swaziland. In addition, interest during construction on the proposed
Bank loan would require about US$0.5 million. These estimates include physical
contingencies to cover materials and civil wtrks of 15 percent for Mbabane and
Manzini and 20 percent for Nhlangano.    The cost estimates are based on prices
prevailing in February 1974. The price contingencies were estimated at 18
percent for civil works and 14 percent for equipment and materials in 1974,
15 percent and 11 percent respectively in 1975 and 12 percent and 7.5 percent
per annum thereafter. These physical and price contingency allowances are
considered appropriate for the type of civil works, equipment and material
involved in this project.
Project Financing
25.       The proposed Bank loan of US$3.5 million would finance about 67 per-
cent of the total cost of the project and would cover the foreign costs and
the interest on the loan during construction estimated at US$0.5 million.
The local project costs are estimated to be US$1.5 million, of which US$1.3
million would come from WSB's internal cash generation with the remaining
US$0.2 million coming from government loans. WSB's total capital requirements
during the project construction period FY 1975 to FY 1978 are estimated at
US$8 3 million.   Of this amount, 42 percent would be financed by the proposed
Bank loan, 42 percent by government loans and 16 percent by WSB's own resources.
The Government and WSB would enter into a financial arrangement through which
the (Government would relend the proceeds of the Bank loan to the WSB at its
borrowing terms, eight percent interest over 25 years with a grace period of four
years.
Financial Position of WSB
26.       When the WSB became operational on April 1, 1974, the Government
transferred to it fixed assets in the form of water supply and sewerage
facilities at an agreed value of US$4.2 million, as well as the related cur-
rent assets and liabilities. In return for the net value of assets transferred
to it, WSB assumed a debt to the Government of US$2.4 million, repayable over
25 yetars at eight percent interest including a grace period of four years.
The remaining value of the net assets transferred by the Government to WSB
will be treated as a Government capital contribution. Since WSB was established
along commercial lines with the intention of earning a reasonable rate of return
on capital employed, new tariffs have been adopted. The new water and sewerage
tariffs are substantially higher than previous rates which varied from area to
area. The new tariffs are structured so that larger users Day higher unit costs.
The Ministry of Local Administrationwould pay WSB for standpipe water consump-
tion and, if considered practical,collect the revenues from the communities
concerned.  Residential coinections wouldbe charged rates that increase with
the amount of monthly consumption. This wouldcenable lower income residential
users to obtain minimal water requirements for drinking and sanitary purposes
at a moderate cost. The Swaziland Governmentwould pay WSB at commercial rates
for government use of water and sewerage services.



- 9 -
27.       The Government agreed that in order for WSB to make an adequate
contribution toward its capital expenditure program during the project con-
struction period, WSB should maintain tariff levels to provide an operating
ratio of not more than 55 between FY1976-1978 (see Section 4.05 of the
draft Loan Agreement). After the construction period, the Government agreed
that WSB would maintain tariffs at a level necessary to enable WSB to obtain
a rate of return on the combined average of WSB's water supply and sewerage
net fixed assets in operation of four percent in 1979, five percent in 1980,
six percent in 1981, and seven percent thereafter (see Section 4.06 of the
draft Loan Agreement). We have estimated that the rate of return on WSB's
net fixed assetswould increase from four percent in 1979, when the project
becomes operational, to seven percent by FY 1982 as the project facilities
and earlier capital expenditures become more fully utilized. For the purpose
of the rate of return calculations, fixed assetswouldbe revalued annually
in accordance with a price index to be agreed on between the Borrower and the
Bank. Given the cost increases and asset revaluations assumed for the con-
struction period FY1975 to FY1978, a 20 percent tariff increase would be
necessary in FY1979 to achieve these rates of return, and such an increase
has been assumed in the financial projections.
28.       Between FY 1975 and FY 1982, WSB's net revenues from water sales and
sewerage services are expected to increase almost 150 percent from EO.90 mil-
lion in FY 1975 to E2.10 million in FY 1982. Financial projections suggest
that WSB's debt service coverage ratio would improve from 1.4 in FY 1979 to a
level of 2.0 by FY 1982. The Government has agreed that WSBwouldnot incur
further debt without Bank approval unless it can maintain a minimum debt
service ratio of 1.50 after the incurrence of such debt (see Section 4.07 of
the draft Loan Agreement).
Procurement
29.       All pipe and equipment supply and civil works contracts would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. There is at present no local pipe
manufacturing, and it is expected that all the pipe and equipment required
for the project would be procured from foreign suppliers. The construction
contracts would be combined as far as practicable, but bids would also be
invited for components of the packages. Most of the civil works contracts
are likely to be won by locally based foreign contractors. A seven and one-
half percent margin of preference for suitably qualified domestic contractors
would be allowed in comparing bids for civil works contracts (Swaziland's GDP
per capita was less than US$200 in 1971).
Disbursement
30.       The proposed loan would be disbursed over four years.   Disbursement
would be made against the following expenditures which represent the foreign
expenditure costs of the project:
(a) 100 percent of foreign or 90 percent of local expenditures for
pipe, vehicles equipment, and spare parts;



- 10 -
(b) 33 percent of the cost of civil works;
(c) 100 percent of the foreign cost and 90 percent of local
expenditures for consulting engineering services for
preparing final plans, specifications and bidding documents
and supervision of the work, and for consultant services
to provide accounting assistance and technical training;
(d) 100 percent of the cost of postgraduate training abroad; and
(e) interest and other charges on the loan accrued on or before
December 31, 1977.
31.       The Bank loan would provide retroactive financing up to US$150,000
incurred after July 1, 1974 for the services of consultant engineers who
are preparing the final plans and on expenditures for accounting assistance.
Project Justification
32.       The preparation of the project has prompted a reorganization of the
institutional arrangements for the management of sewerage and water supplies
in Swaziland. The implementation of the project would enable the WSB to be
properly established with the capability of managing the water supply and
sewerage needs not only in the project area but throughout Swaziland. Guide-
lines for a Project Monitoring System were discussed with WSB's Director at
negotiations. The monitoring indicators would be quantified in consultation
with the Bank and would be looked upon as targets for operating efficiency.
33.       The creation of the WSB, bolstered by accounting services and other
technical assistance which would be provided, would help Swaziland to build up
a cadre of indigenous water supply and sewerage technicians, and to achieve
a balanced growth of water and sewerage services in the future. The previous
patchwork of water and sewerage facilities and tariffs constrained the poten-
tial development of Swaziland's modern sector.   The proposed investment in
water supply and sewerage is needed to meet the existing demand and the
estimated growth in urban demand and facilitate investment in new industries.
34.       The project would provide a number of ecological and public health
benefits. The new water collection, storage and treatment facilities in
2Thlangano would enable an inmprovement in the quality and the quantity of water
consumption, and would avert a water shortage which is predicted to occur in
1976. The increase in the water supply network and the sewerage treatment
and distribution facilities in the more densely populated urban areas of
Mbabane and Manzini, besides greatly improving the availability of treated
water to the inhabitants, would remove much of the polluting matter which
has been affecting these water svstems. Sewers are required in these areas
because the subsoil is not suitable for septic tanks except in low density
developments. The expansion of sewer reticulation to residential areas would
markedly improve the environment by removing liquid wastes to the sewerage
treatment works, thereby reducing the seepage of raw effluent from overloaded

septic tanks. This is a particularly important reason for the new sewer works
at Kwaluseni where the overflow sewerage is currently discharged into the Little
Usutu River, a short distance upstream of the intake for the Manzini water sys-
tem. The improvement of the Manzini sewerage treatment works would decrease
pollution of the Mzimnene River.
35.       The new tariff schedules, which are graduated on the basis of con-
sumption, wouldgenerate the necessary revenues in an economically sound
manner while allowing residential consumers to pay a lower rate for consumption
up to 6,000 Ig per month, and standpipe users, if they are charged, to pay
only a nominal rate. The project would extend new water supply and sewerage
services to between 10,000 and 15,000 inhabitants of Mbabane, Manzini and
Nhlangano, about 25 percent of their populations. The project is the least
cost solution for providing expanded water supply and sewerage services in
Mbabane and Hlanzini, and a new water supply system in Nlhlangano. If the demand
for water supply and sewerage services grows as forecast, the project would
have a financial return on investment of about 12 percent. An increase in
project costs of 10 percent would reduce the return to approximately 11 percent,
while a 1() percent lower growth in water sales would also reduce the return to
about 11 percent. A combination of both these factors would produce a return
of about 10 percent. The rate of return is only marginally sensitive to varia-
tions in operating costs.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUTMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Kingdom of Swaziland and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
37.       Certain distinctive features of the draft Loan Agreement, which in
general follows the usual pattern of loans for projects in the water supply
and sewerage sector, are referred to in paragraphs 22, 27 and 28 of this Report.
Additionally, a condition of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement is that the
execution and delivery of the Financial Undertaking on behalf of the Kingdom
of Swaziland and WSB have been duly authorized or ratified by all necessary
administrative and governmental action.
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOtMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
