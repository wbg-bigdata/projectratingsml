REPUBLIC OF  OE
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT - LOAN 2392-FO-
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summarv
Obiectives
The objective of the Highway Sector Project was to assist the Republic
of Korea to increase economic efficiency in the highway sector by financing a
part of the total expenditure to be incurred in a three-year time slice of the
Government's Highway Investment Program (Overview Tables 6A and 6B), which
formed part of the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1982-86) (FFYP), and by
supporting improvements in investment planning, transport regulation and
pricing, and energy conservation (Overview para 2.1). The specific objectives
of the FFYP relating to the highway sector were to:
(a) expand and widen expressways near some major urban areas;
(b) continue improving and paving national and major provincial roads
and strengthen maintenance;
(c) increase and modernize the vehicle fleet and develop safety
measures;
(d) improve the efficiency of road transport operators by expanding
terminal facilities and encouraging larger scale transport firms;
and
(e) expand and improve tne transportation network in remote areas to
reach all villages with 100 or more households.
Implementation Experience
The Highway Sector Project was appraised in May 1983 and the loan
became effective in August 1984. The Bank Loan (2392-KO) for the project, as
signed, was US$230.0 million; a total of US$14.997 million was cancelled; the
final net loan amounted to US$215.003 million.
All the civil works contracts progressed well and were completed on
schedule (Overview para 4.1), although there were initial problems with quality
control as the contractors, all Korean, were not used to working strictly to a
specification, and the local consultants were not used to enforcing it.
Supervision of construction was progressively strengthened during the project
implementation as weak points emerged and the final quality of the work was good
(Overview para 5.4g).
Definitions:
Project: In this PCR, "project" refers to the civil works, equipment and
technical assistance which were financed from the proceeds of the Highway Sector
Loan, Loan 2392-KO.
Program: Similarly, "program" refers to the highway investment program of the
Republic of Korea during the years 1984-86, -s appraised, and during 1984-88,
being the actual period during which the project was supporting the investment
program.



- vi -
Because of the prevailing international contracting situation, low bids
were received for the civil works contracts which enabLed a further 84 km of
national and provincial roads and 133.9 km of provincial and county roads to be
improved (Overview para 4.1c). In order to give time for these works to be
cotplel-ed the loan closing date was extended by one year.
There was some delay in the procurement of the road maintenance
equipment because of problems with the tender documents, but all items were
eventually delivered (Overview para 4.2). The implementation of the road
maintenance management system went well and the equipment was procured in a
timely manner.
Improvements were carried out at 65 locations identified as accident
black spots, resulting in a reduction in the accident rate of 40% at these
locations (Overview para 4.3).
In the field of energy conservation, a greater appreciation of the
problems and possible solutions was gained through overseas training (Overview
Para 4.4).
All technical assistance components went well (Overview para 4.5).
Positive results have been achieved through changes in the laws governing road
user charges and in the setting up of a maintenance management system (Overview
paras 4.5c and d).
Results
Overall, the project was a success (Overview paras 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3).
From the physical aspect, it more than achieved its objectives and its results
had a noticeable impact in the intended areas. A significant proportion (5%) of
the primary, secondary and tertiary road networks was improved under the
project, with a consequent reduction in transport costs and improvement in
maintenance capability. Other aspects of the transport sector will show
improvements resulting from the project when the recommendations of the various
studies are fully implemented.
The overall economic rates of return, estimated in advance of
construction to be 42% for the national and provincial roads and 23% for the
county roads, ended up at 38% and 25%, respectively. Lower than expected bid
prices and more rapid traffic growth were, in some instances, offset by the
increased cost of design changes necessitated by technical difficulties
encountered during construction. It is expected that the final rates of return
will be better, because traffic is increasing faster than forecast.
Sustainabilitv
With traffic increasing faster than forecast and with the introduction
of pavement management on national and provincial roads and of a proper
maintenance system for county roads, it is expected that the road improvement
components of the project will maintain or even exceed the forecast level of net
benefits throughout their economic life. The eventual success of the
construction component depends on the continued growth of the Korean economy
providing a spur to the growth of traffic and on the timely and adequate
provision of maintenance funds to keep the roads in good condition (Overview
para 6).



- vii -
The success of the studies depends on the continued implemeiitation of
the recommendations made.
Findings and LAsaons
The main objectives of the Highway Sector Project were achieved in an
efficient and timely fashion (Overview paras 5.1, 5.2, .3 and 5.4).
The Bank learned some valuable lessons (Overview para 7.2), i.e.
a.   when deciding upon the growth rate for traffic in a country with a
rapidly expanding economy like Korea, it is easy to be too modest
and to underestimate the rate; and
b.   in order to obtain the best return on a successful project,
flexibility in the design of a project, as well as a readiness to
be flexible over enlarging the content of a project, are important
ingredients.
The Borrower also learned useful lessons (Overview para 8.3), i.e.
a.   the use of experienced supervisors to implement high standards of
quality control, particularly of compaction of the base and sub-
base, is an important element in ensuring the dural'ility of the
road during its 'ife; and
b.   the improvement of inter-agency coordination is an important aim
that should be continually sought after.

REPUBLIC O    REA
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT- LOAN 2392-KO
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
OVE£RVIESW
1.       Backgtround
1.1      For the two decades preceding the appraisal of this project in 1983,
the transport system in the Republic of Korea (ROK) was strained by the demands
of rapid growth and required massive public sector investments in infrastructure.
The Government allocated up to 23% of its total capital expenditure to expand
and modernize transport infrastructure from 1967 to 1977, tapering down to about
15% in the Fourth (1977-81) and Fifth Plans (1982-86). The Sixth Plan (1987-
91) allocation for transport sector investments is at about the same level.
Investments have tended to be concentrated on the Seoul-Busan axis where most
industrial development is taking place and in other corridors serving the
northeastern and southwestern parts of Korea.
1.2      Substantial changes in the modal distribution of traffic for the period
from 1966 to 1985 can be illustrated by traffic statistics.  The previously
dominant role of the railways (82% of ton-km in 1966) was replaced by a more
balanced distribution of traffic among rail, coastal shipping and road for
freight and among road and rail for passenger transport. During this period,
for freight traffic, the road and coastal shipping shares of total ton-km
increased from 8% to 40% and from 10% to 29%, respectively, while movements by
rail, although showing growth in absolute terms, fell to 31% of total ton-km.
These changes reflect both the economic advantages of the various modes and the
different growth rates of the industries served, as rail and coastal shipping
became concentrated on long distance traffic and bulk cargo.   For passenger
traffic, rapidly expanding personal incomes generated large increases in personal
travel, mainly by public transport such as express trains and buses, but also
by private car. About half of all passenger traffic was in urban areas. High
taxation of private cars and gasoline limited car ownership to a level
significantly below that of other countries with comparable income levels, but
did not deter rapid growth in road transport. Between 1966 and 1985, the rail
snare of total passenger-km fell from 43% to 25% while the road share increased
from 56% to 73%.
1.3      ROK's basic objective in the past had been to increase and modernize
the capacity of the transport system in line with the projected traffic growth
and to avoid major bottlenecks. This objective had been largely achieved. The
system was reasonably balanced and traffic was in general allocated economically
among the various modes. Another objective of the investments in transport has
been to pursue broader concerns in ROK's spatial and economic planning.
Considerable efforts have been made to develop new industrial complexes in
coastal areas, to take advantage of Korea's natural potential in harbors and to



-ix-
exploit low-cost coastal shipping while avoiding excessive congestion on road
and rail. Projects are now better designed, construction quality has improved
with the rapid expansion of the construction industry, and maintenance systems
have been established for the road network and have been strengthened for the
railways.
1.4      In its efforts to ensure that appropriate development priorities were
reflected in the allocation of scarce transport resources, the Government in
the past tightly regulated the sector, with a restrictive licensing system for
operators in road transport and shipping, and regulated pricing for all transport
activities.  Korea's vehicle fleet was kept small due to the policy of high
taxation of cars and high prices for gasoline.
1.5      The large investments in transportation infrastructure were complemented
by a considerable effort to improve the efficiency of the transport system,
through the establishment and strengthening of institutions to plan, construct,
maintain and operate the facilities and services.   In the public sector,
institutions such as the Korean National Railroad (KNR), the Bureau of Public
Roads (BPR) in the Ministry of Construction (MOC), the Korea Highway Corporation
(KHC), and the Korea Maritime and Port Administration (KMPA) were established
or strengthened in many instances with increasing financial and managerial
responsibility as semi-autonomous public corporations. In the private sector,
a highly efficient contractor system evolved for civil works.   The system
reflected both the policy of competitive bidding in the award of contracts, and
the large volume of construction that was carried out in Korea during more than
20 years. By 1985 there were well over 500 firms capable of handling a broad
range of public works. Furthermore, with Government encouragement, the major
construction firms successfully expanded their construction activities overseas.
1.6      The Bank has played an active role in advising and assisting the Korean
authorities in pursuing their transport objectives (see Table 1).   Despite
considerable efforts, spatial planning of the transportation system was, in 1982,
still hindered by generally inadequate interagency coordination, a comparatively
limited expertise in planning and economic appraisal techniques, and the capacity
to undertake appropriate longer-term pre-investment studies.   Projects which
started during the years immediately before this project improved this situation
but there was still some way to go. The Bank provided, through various projects,
active support and finance for technical assistance for a range of feasibility
and planning studies relating to national transport development, urban
transportation needs and inter-modal alternatives along major traffic axes in
addition to more conventional engineering design work for proposed projects.
1.7      Pricing policy and the regulatory framework have been a feature of
Bank-Government dialogue for many years. In the 1970s, emphasis was given to
supporting Government's efforts in establishing agencies such as KNR and KMPA
on sound financial bases, with investment planning linked to appropriate tariffs
and charges in regard to rail transport and ports. The Bank also assisted the
government in the review of transport and traffic regulation, notably in regard
to licensing of common carriers, road vehicle taxation, axle loading and similar
issues relating to road transport. The recently completed Provincial and County
Roads Project (Loan 2228-KO), which starced shortly before this project, deepened
and broadened the Bank's involvement in the road subsector by extending



assistance, for the first time, to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), which
deals with the maintenance of provincial roads and the maintenance and
improvement of county roads. This new involvement also provided the Bank with
an opportunity to improve coordination of road planning between MOC and MOHA,
and strengthened the basis for this Fighway Sector Project (Loan 2392-KO).
2.       ObJectLvs and Project Description
2.1      Objectives of the Highway Investment Program
a.    The Government's Highway Investment Program was designed to
achieve the goals relating to the highway sector outlined in the
Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1982-86) (FFYP). These goals
aimed to:
i.    selectively increase capacity by modernizing equipment and
optimizing investments;
ii.   enhance  efficiency  by  improving  intermodal  traffic
allocation and conserving energy; and
iii.  strengthen maintenance activities.
b.    The specific objectives of the program were to:
i.    expand and widen expressways near some major urban areas;
ii.   continue improving and paving national and major provincial
roads and strengthen maintenance;
iii.  increase and modernize the vehicle fleet and develop safety
measures;
iv.   improve the efficiency of road transport operators by
expanding terminal facilities and encouraging larger scale
transport firms; and
v.    expand and improve the transportation network in remote
areas to reach all villages with 100 or more households.
2.2      Project Objectives
a.    Based on the overall goals of the FFYP as they related to the
highway sector, the objectives of the project were:
i.    to deal directly with policy and institutional issues; and



-xi-
ii.   more specifically, to:
(a)   assist ROK to increase economic efficiency in the
sector through improvements in investment planning,
transport regulation and pricing, and energy
conservation; and
(b)   improve the road network to meet the increasing
traffic demand, improve maintenance of paved roads
and reduce the high rate of road traffic accidents.
2.3      Proiect DescriRtion
a.    To achieve the above objectives, the following Action Plan (see
Table 2) was carried out:
i.    highway investment Rlanning - to establish a system under
which all highway construction and maintenance investments
are nlanned and funded on an integrated and sound economic
basis;
ii.   energy  conservatio   -  to  expand  and  improve  the
effectiveness of a Government program to increase energy
efficiency in the transport sector;
iii.  transgort regulation and pricing -
(a)   to study the impact of the present regulatory system
on the cost of transport services with a view to the
identification and removal of unnecessary regulations;
(b)   to study and identify the most appropriate method of
apportioning highway costs among users; and
(c)   to study the use of freight terminals to improve road
transport efficiency.
b.    In addition, the loan funds were to finance part of a three-year
time-slice, 1984-86, of the highway investment program, which was
designed to meet the increasing traffic demand by improving access
to rural areas, upgrading and paving roads, enhancing highway
maintenance and reducing traffic accident rates.
3.       Project Design and Oreanization
3.1      The project was designed to address as many of the perceived needs of
the highway sector as could be funded from the resources available. The total
capital expenditures (or program cost) for the whole of the highway sector for
the period 1984-86 on ongoing and new commitments, as estimated at appraisal
(SAR page ii, para 5.05 and Table 5.9(a)), was, at constant 1983 prices, US$1,605
million or US$1,440 million excluding taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange



-xii.
element of US$805 million. The equivalent cost, at current prices, of these
expenditures was estimated at US$1,789 (Table 6A and SAR Table 4.9(b)). The Bank
loan of US$230 million was therefore apportioned, to support the following
components, totalling about US$462 million (the estimated project cost) from this
three-year time-slice of the highway investment program:
a.    Paving of national and provincial roads and the procurement of
maintenance equipment by MOC;
b.    Paving of provincial and county roads by MOHA;
c.    Road Safety Program to be carried out jointly by MOHA, MOC and
the Ministry of Transport (MOT);
d.    Workshops, seminars, training, studies and experts for enegy
conservation in transport to be carried out jointly by the
Ministry of Energy and Resources (MOER), MOT and the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry (MCI); and
e.    Miscellaneous studies and technical assistance including:
i.    a study on Trucking Industry Regulations;
ii.   a study on Freight Terminals and Related Services;
iii. a study on Road User Charges;
iv.   preparation of road projects - feasibility and engineering;
v.    technical assistance to BPR for maintenance management;
vi.   supervision of construction; and
vii. detailed engineering for investments in the Seoul-Busan
corridor and the Kyonggi regional transport stue-J.
3.2      The project was based on a clear conceptual understanding of the
requirements by all parties and was well designed by the Borrower and the Bank.
While not greatly innovative, the scope and scale of the project were appropriate
and it was well timed in relation to the needs of the highway sector and the
expanding economy of Korea. A large number of institutions were involved in the
project, but their roles and responsibilities were clearly set out in order to
forestall problems that might have arisen on account of the traditional lack of
communication between Korean Government agencies. The Economic Planning Bureau
(EPB) took on the responsibility of overseeing the carrying out, by the relevant
agencies, of the Action Plan related to sector issues.
3.3      A considerable amount of effort went into the preparation of this
project and this is reflected in the successful outcome.



-xiii-
4.       Prgolct Implementation
4.1      Road Conltl-tion and Improvement.
a.    The two parts of this component handled by HOC and MOHA went very
well.   The improvement work carried out by NOC under the
government's National and Provincial Roads Project had been
planned for some time and MOC already had a wealth of experience
to draw on to successfully execute such work;
b.    The improvement work carried out by MOHA under the Highway Sector
Project (Loan 2392-KO) was an extension of similar work carried
out under the Provincial and County Roads Project (Loan 2228-KO),
which started shortly before and ran almost concurrently with this
project; all the contracts ran smoothly;
c.    As in the case of the Provincial and County Roads Project (Loan
2228-KO), low bid prices enabled both HOC and HOHA to carry out
more work than had been planned at appraisal, 445.7 km against
361.7 km and 1326.6 km against 1192.7 km, respectively; these
increases could not have been foreseen as they were caused by an
unexpected downturn in international construction activity, in
which Korean contractors were heavily involved.
4.2      Road Maintenance
a.    MOC purchased 372 items of highway maintenance equipment at a
cost of US$ 10.91 million; the procurement process was delayed
because the tender documents produced by the Office of Supply,
Republic of Korea (OSROK) were inconsistent with the Bank's
procurement guidelines and much time was consumed in correcting
them;
b.    MOC received some technical assistance in the formulation of a
maintenance management plan; this component was successfully
completed and implemented together with the procurement of
essential items of testing equipment.
4.3      Traffic Safety
a.    As a result of the recommendatl, - made by the Traffic Safety
Study carried out under the Provincial and County Roads Project
(Loan 2228-KO), HOHA carried out improvements at 65 locations
which had been identified as accident black spots;
b.    After monitoring the accident records at 52 of these locations
it has emerged that the effect of the works bI- been to reduce
the number of accidents at these places by 40% .nd the fatalities
and injuries by 39%; the 6-month benefit of the accide 5 reduction
is estimated at about US$20,000 per location, representing an
average IRR of 68%.



-xiv-
c.    Despite local successes, the national accident figures paint a
bleak picture, having one of the highest rates in the world,
particularly in Kyonggi Province and amongst old people.
4.4      Energy Conservation
a.    Using funds provided under the project, six people were sent on
overseas training courses in order to further improve MOER's
knowledge of energy conservation matters;
b.    The formulation of energy policies has benefitted from the
training received over a wide range of energy applications
together with an improvement of skills in the fields of
transportation energy analysis and energy conservation and
forecasting techniques.
4.5      Studio
a.    The Trucking Industry Study was completed in May 1985 by the
Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) with
the assistance of UNDP under the sponsorship of MOT.   It
recommended significant changes in the current laws and MOT is
now pursuing an active policy to deregulate the road transport
industry.
b.    The Freight Terminals and Related Services Study was completed
in November 1986 by the Korea Transport Institute (KTI) together
with foreign and domestic consultants under the sponsorship of
MOT. Based on the recommendations of the study, MOT has carried
out detailed feasibility and engineering studies for the
establishment of the proposed freight terminals, even though the
study did not make a sound economic case for them. An Intermodal
Freight Transport Facilitation Seminar was held in October 1986.
C.    The Study of Road User Charges was completed in December 1985 by
the Korea Research Institute for Human Settlements (KRIHS) under
the sponsorship of MOC. It recommended several changes in the
taxation structure. HOC has met with considerable success in
obtaining Government consensus for implementing the changes
recommended. The Specific Road Fund Law, which covered some tax
reform including the adjustment of gasoline and car registration
taxes, was passed in December 1988;
d.    The Highway Maintenance Management Study was completed in December
1987 by foreign and local consultants under the sponsorship of
HOC. As a result of the recommendations made, MOC has purchased
the necessary equipment for pavement evaluation to enable the
creation of a road inventory, and is training its staff in the
maintenance of the data bank and in the operation of the pavement
management system.



-xv.
4.6      The main variances between planned and actual implementation were: (a)
delays of up to a year in the construction contracts because of technical
difficulties and a shortage of counterpart funds; (b) a delay of about one year
in the procurement of equipment because of problems with the documents; and (c)
delays of up to a year in the completion of some of the studies and the actions
arising from them because of a shortage of counterpart funds.
4.7      Several significant decisions, wvich assisted project implementation,
were taken. These included:
a.    use of foreign consultant firms as the lead firms for construction
supervision on the road works to provide opportunity for Korean
firms to gain valuable experience, and in turn to enable them to
design and supervise the additional road improvement works without
the assistance of foreign consultants during the latter part of
the project;
b.    use of surplus loan funds for the improvement of additional
lengths of national, provincial and county roads, hence increasing
the physical achievement of the project 'oy about 20%;
c.    the use of International Competitive Bidding for the initial list
of road contracts, which contribated towards low bid prices; and
d.    insistence on the production of high quality maintenance equipment
bidding documents, which, though delaying the procurement process
somewhat in the early stages, paved the way towards a better
understanding by OSROK of the Bank's views on fair and acceptable
bidding documents.
4.8      On the other hand, the relatively early request, in 1986, by MOC to
cancel US$10 million of the loan, due to lack of a matching local budget
allocation, reduced somewhat the potential physical achievements of the project.
5.       Proiect Results
5.1      Overall, the project has been a success.  While some of the policy
objectives have not yet been achieved because of a lack of consensus to effect
the necessary changes, the project made a substantial contribution towards
achieving the Governments's goals for the improvement of the highway sector.
Apart from the 1,772 km of national, provincial and county roads that were
improved (5% of total non-urban roads) and the injection of valuable experience
into the consulting and contracting industries, the project brought about
fundamental changes in the operation of the trucking industry, the improvement
of traffic safety and the introduction of a maintenance management system.
5.2      From the physical aspect,  the project has more than achieved its
objectives and its results have had a noticeable impact in the intended areas.
A significant proportion (5%) of the primary, secondary and tertiary road
networks was improved, with a consequent reduction in transport costs and
improvement in maintenance capability. Other aspects of the transport sector



-xvi-
will improve when the recommendations of the various studies are fully
implemented. The objectives of the project did not change during implementation
in that they fully supported the established goals of the highway investment
program of the Government.
5.3      The economic rates of return for the civil works components, estimated
in advance of construction to be 42% for t;.d national and provincial roads, 23%
for the county roads and 33% overall, were 38%, 25% and 32% respectively at the
time of completion of the projectY. Lower than expected bid prices and a more
rapid rate of traffic growth were, in some instances, offset by the increased
cost of design changes necessitated by technical difficulties encountered during
construction. It is expected that the rates of return will improve with time,
because traffic is increasing faster than forecast.
5.4      The final cost of the project components carried out in support of the
Highway Investment Program was US$505 million (Table 3). This is a little higher
than the very approximate estimate of project cost that can be obtained from the
SAR of US$462 million. This increase can be attributed in part to the extension
of the project by a year, although the loan was underdisbursed by US$15 million.
5.5      The project impact includes:
a.    the introduction of integrated highway investment planning as a
result of recommendations made during the Provincial and County
Roads Project (Loan 2228-KO);
b.    the development of a traffic safety program;
c.    changes in the trucking industry regulations to promote more
competition and reduce transport costs;
d.    the planned introduction of additional freight terminals;
e.    changes to road user charge structure;
f.    the introduction of a highway maintenance management system
together with the taking of road inventories and establishment
of a data bank;
g.    further strengthening of the construction industry through the
experience gained by consultants in evaluation, design and
supervision, and by contractors in carrying out work to a strict
specification;
h.    improvement of the physical environment by paving county roads
to reduce the polluting and damaging effects of dust and mud,
' The IRRs for the HOC and MOHA components and for the overall project
were derived from Table 4 of the MOC section of this PCR and from Table 1 of
the MOHA section.

and the economic costs and discomfort of travelling over rough
roads;
i.    development of the technological skills of the construction
industry by the introduction of Double Bituminous Surface
Treatment (DBST) as a low-cost paving method, by the use of modern
materials testing equipment and by the use of appropriate
construction plant;
j.    improvement of access for farmers and rural communities to
markets;
k.    development of the capability within MOHA at both national and
provincial levels to manage projects of this type and to carry
out effective maintenance of their road inventories.
6.       Prolect Sustainability
6.1      With traffic increasing faster than forecast and the introduction of
pavement management on national and provincial roads and of a proper maintenance
system for county roads, it is expected that the road improvement components of
the project will maintain or even exceed the forecast level of net benefits
throughout their economic life. The final success of the construction component
depends on the continued growth of the Korean economy providing a spur to the
growth of traffic and on the timely and adequate provision of maintenance funds
to keep the roads in good condition.
6.2      The success of the studies depends on the continued implementation of
the recommendations made and an awareness by Government that changes in and
deregulation of the transport industry are essential ingredients to achieving
reductions in economic costs, though it is realised that these changes may take
time to materialize because of the temporary distortions that they produce in
the economy.
6.3      There is a decided risk that maintenance funds would be reduced if
there is a downturn in the economy. This issue has been addressed in the most
recent highway projectV, which includes a major road maintenance component based
on the Highway Maintenance Management Study which was completed in December 1987
under this Highway Sector Project (Loan 2392-KO).
7.       Bank Performance
7.1      The overall success of the project can be attributed in part to the
good performance by Bank staff during the whole project cycle.   Supervision
missions were sent to Korea on a regular basis and staff changes were kept to
a minimum, thus enabling good relationships to be built up over the period of
the project.
Y Korea - Road Improvement Project (Loan 3061-KO), approved on May 16, 1989.



-xviii-
7.2      The main lessons to be learnt by the Bank are:
a.   when deciding upon the growth rate for traffic in a country with
a rapidly expanding economy like Korea, it is easy to be too
modest and to underestimate the rate (para 5.3); and
b.    in order to obtain the best return on a successful project,
flexibility in the design of a project, as well as a readiness
to be flexible over enlarging the content of a project, are
important ingredients (para 5.5b).
8.       Borrower Performancj
8.1      The Borrower and its implementing agencies performed well during the
project. They eased the task of project preparation by readily providing the
information requested and their performances during implementation improved
steadily. At first the agencies had some difficulty in adequately supervising
the construction contracts and in maintaining the necessary standards of quality
control, but as they gained experience, the contract management improved.
8.2      Government staff resources were generally over-stretched and therefore
much use was made of consultants, both foreign and Korean. The agencies worked
closely with their consultants and relied heavily on them, generally following
their advice, but not always.
8.3      The main lessons to be learnt by the Borrower are:
a.    the use of experienced supervisors to implement high standards
of quality control, particularly of compaction of the base and
sub-base, is an important element in ensuring the durability of
the road during its life (paras 5.5a and 6.4g); and
b.    the improvement of inter-agency coordination is an important aim
that should be continually sought after (paras 4.1c and d, 4.2
and 6.4a).
9.       Proiect Relationship
9.1      The excellent relationship that has existed between the staffs of the
Borrower and the Bank, during both preparation and implementation phases, has
been one of the factors which has contributed towards the success of the project.
It created good teamwork, in which each party displayed the flexibility to accede
to the other, when necessary, for the good of the end product.



-xix-
10.      Consilting Services and Contractors
10.1     On the advice of the Bank, the Borrower employed foreign consultants
in the lead roles initially, thus enabling the Korean consultants, who were
working with the foreign consultants, to gain experience in designing and
supervising road works, and eventually to successfully carry out these tasis on
their own. The consultants all performed satisfactorily.
10.2     For the studies, Korean organizations played a major role, with the
support of local and foreign consulants. Despite some misgivings at various
stages of the project, the studies were ca:ried out in an efficient and
professional manner.
10.3     Contractors and suppliers also played a major part in the implementation
of the project.   All the civil works contractors were Korean, even though
procurement was by International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Initially, while
both contractors and local consultants were becoming used to working to a
specification under the overall supervision of foreign consultants, standards
of workmanship varied greatly, but as the work progressed, quality control
improved and, by the later stages of the project, standards were good. Equipment
suppliers, who were both Korean and foreign, generally performed satisfactorily
and thus equipment was procured and delivered in good time.
10.4     This project, like the Provincial and County Roads Project (Loan 2228-
KO), was useful to the Korean consultants and contractors, who learnt much about
working to an acceptable international standard of quality control.   The
introduction of new techniques, notably DBST, were of benefit not only to the
firms that took part, but also to the whole construction industry in Korea.
11.      Project Documentation and Data
11.1     The covenants contained in the loan agreement were reasonable and the
Borrower complied with them.
11.2     The Staff Appraisal Report provided a useful reference framework during
the implementation of the project.
11.3     The well kept records of the implementing agencies and the information
provided by the Bank helped MOC and MOHA to prepare completion reports for their
own components of the project.   These have been included in this Project
Completion Report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
A. PROVINCIAL AND COUNTY ROAD DEVELOPMENT BY MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS
PREAMBLE
The Government of Korea represented by the Ministry of Rome Affairs
(MOHA) has requested the IBRD assistance in the financing of a program to
improve some 1,000Km long provincial and county roads network throughout
the country.   Major components of the project maybe summarized as below:
(a) Improvement of about 1,000Km long provincial and county roads
networks which were among 2,000Km long rural roads selected as
priority rated group for improvement through priority screening
studies performed by the MOHA(1979. 9 - 1981. 2), under Loan No.
1640 - KO.   The first 1,00OKm long package of provincial and
county roads have been implemented under Provincial and County
Roads Project (LN. 2228 - KO) from April 1983 through June 1989
and PCR had been prepared and submitted to the IBRD under separate
heading of PCR for LN. 2228 - KO.   A detailed engineering stuidies
of the second 1,000Km long provincial and county road networks
have been completed under LN. 2228 - KO from August 1983 thirough
August 1984.
(b) Consultant services for supervision of the improvement works for
the second 1,000Km long networks of provincial and county roads.
(c) Implementation of the road safety countermeasures recommended by
the road safety studies which had been jointly carried out by
Road Traffic Safety Association(RTSA) and Ross-Silcock during the
period of June 1983 through April 1984.
The project for the improvement of provincial and county roads has been
commenced in March 1985 and completed in June 1989.   On the occasion of
completing the project the MOHA, in compliance with the Loan Agreement,
intends to turnish to the IBRD the Project Completion Report(PCR).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PROVINCIAL AND COUNTY ROADS DEVELOPMENT
LOAN NO. 2392 - KO
I.  INTRODUCTION
A.  Improvement of  rovincial and count  roads
1.01   The objective of the  roject is to support Government's policy
of promoting economic development in rural area by the reduction of
transport costs through the improvement of the provincial and county roads
network which have been neglected till the end of the Fourth Five Year
Economic Development Plan (1977 - 1981).   The project aims to better
the transport means between the county centers and populated town areas
with the primary and secondary road networks, consequently reducing the
transport costs of the farm products and promoting off-farm income
opportunities for the rural population by providing inexpensive access
to secondary urban centers.   The project is rated as high priority
among Fifth Five Year Plan and project roads are located throughout in
all 9 provincies.
B. Consultant Services
1.02   Consultant services have been provided for (i) the supervision
of provincial and county roads improvement works, (ii) providing the MORA
with the second stage DBST training course and (iii) assistance in
identifying traffic safety black-spots and recommending appropriate
traffic safety counter-measures.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRA'SAL
Improvement of Provincial and County Roads
2.01   Orlln, Preparation and Appraisal
In order to support Government Policy of Promoting economic development
in rural areas by means of reduction of transport costs through the
improvement of the provincial and county roads network, MORA has undertaken
feasibility studies on rui?al roads, aiming to select priority roads
network for ifprovement financed under Fourth Highway Project(1979 - 1981).
Through this study approximately 2,000Km provincial and county roads
networks have been selected as priority improvement roads.   Of these 2,000Km
rural roads, a detailed engineering studies for the first 1,000Km package of
rural roads have been completed (1981. 9 - 1982. 9) as a part of tasks of
the Fourth Highway Project (LN. 1640 - KO), which subsequently have been
implemented financed under Provincial and County Roads Project(LN. 2228 - KO).
For the second 1,00OKm package of provincial and county roads improvement,
MOHA enployed consu>ants (Ingeroute, France and 14 local consulting firms)
to perform the detailed engineering studies (1983. 8 - 1984. 8), implementation



-3-
of which is the main target of the Highway Sector Project (LN. 2392 - KO).
The final output of the studies was 1,033Km provincial (689Km) and county
(344Km) roads in 127 road sections (grouped to 117 contract sections),
consisting of asphaltic concrete surfacing(745Km0, DBST surfacing(263Km)
and gravel surfacing(25Km).   The project st"ly was appraised by the IBRD
and implemented under Highway Sector Project(LN. 2392 - KO)., all but 8
contract sections (9OKm) which were implemented under Provincial and County
Road Project(LN. 2228 - KO).
2.02   In August 1985, while improvement works of the provincial and
county roads financed under Highway Sector Loan (LN. 2392 - KO) were
in progress, it was agreed among MOHA and the Bank that additional works
be added to the project.   Additional works consisted of extensions to the
ongoing project road sections by 89Km(25 road sections) and 30 new road
sections(l9ORm).   An additional consultant team was added to the construction
supervision consultant in order to carry out the detailed engineering
for the improvement.   Major part of the field surveys and engineering
studies were subcontracted to eight local consulting firms selected by
MOHA.   Engineering studies commenced in late August 1985 for four-month
period, completing the services in late December 1985, with submission of
contract and tender documents (Ref. Consultants Final Report, December 1985).
Road Safety Implementation
2.03   Based on the Action Plan and recommendations derived from the Traffic
Safety Study(1983. 6 - 1984. 4) pcrformed jointly by RTSA and Ross-Silcock,
-OHA employed RTSA to perform detailed engineering studies for implementation
of traffic safety countermeasures preceded by identification of the most
critical traffic safety black spots. Detailed engineering studies were
carried out from April through September 1987, identifying 68 black-spot
locations consisting of improvement works in 50 locations and installation
of safety facilities in 62 locations.
2.04   Targets and Goals
The project was the second package of the MOHA's long-term development
program for the improvement of provincial and county road networks.   It is
emphasized that the project is one of the high priority program of the Fifth
Five-year Development Plan of the country for the regional economic promotion
and development.   The key assumptions made in the forecasts of the project
was traffic volume on the road sections to be improved, which turned out to
be quite realistic in terms of the increase in traffic volume which is
considered to be generates by improvement of the roads.

11..  I.MPLEMENTATION
Original 1,033Km of provincial and county roads
3.01   As stated in paragraph 2.01, a total of 943Km roads in 109 contract
sections out of 1,033Km (117 contract sections) were to be implemented
under Highway Sector Project(LN. 2392 - KO), 90Km of roads(8 contract sections)
being transferred to be implemented under LN. 2228 - KO.   Nevertheless.
scope of the consultants' supervision services were to include supervision
of the works for these 8 contract sections as well as 27 road sections(343Km)
carried over from LN. 2228 - KO project, making a total project work-load
to 1,376Km of roads(144 contract sections).   It is noted here that 27 road
sections(343Km) carried over from LN. 2228 - KO was caused by additional
work-loads(extensions of road stretches and new bridges) added to 27 road
sections in November 1984 by agreement among MOHA and IBRD, about one month
before the contract closing time of LN. 2228 - KO Project (Ref. PCR for
LN. 2228 - KO prepared by MOHA. June 19893.   The intention was solely to
improve more of the roads with funds made available by under-runs of bids
of LN. 2228 - KO Project.   Bids for original 1,033Km roads(117 contract
sections) were accepted and opened from September 18 through September 21,
1984 in all 9 provinces(by international competitive bidding procedures)
and construction contracts were concluded on November 24 through December
3, 1984 after review and agreement by the IBRD of Bids Evaluation Report
(October 1984) prepared by the Consultant.   The works for all contract
sections commenced between March-April 1985 and were completed by the end
of December 1986, all but 8 road sections where further additional works
were added, nevertheless completing about 96X of the total value.   These
8 road sections were completed by the end of September 1987, completing
the whole of the project road sections(109 contract sections).
Additional roads
3.02   Of the additional 279Km roads, 89Km road stretches were extensions
to 25 project road sections which were included into the contracts by means
of variation orders(Ref. Para 2.02).   Bids opening for 190Km road sections
took place between February 24 through 27, 1986 in 9 provinces.   Construction
contracts for these 32 contract sections were concluded on April 3-18, 1986,
after review and agreement by IBRD of Bids Evaluation Reports(March 14, 1986)
prepared by the Consultant.   Works for these 32 sections commenced immediately
following the contracts were made, completing the works in 18 sections by the
end of Deceuber 1986 and remaining 14 sections by the end of September 1987.
In July and September 1988 additional works to 11 new road Sections were added
to the project by agreement among MO*& and IBRD, thus, making the project
work-loads to 1,326Km roads in 152 contract sections.   Project was completed
in June 1989. 1
ReportinR
3.03   Throughout the construction period monthly progress report was
prepared stating construction activities. quality control of the works
carried out, recommendations issued by the consultants aiming to improve
works procedures and financial statement of the relevant month.   These
reports were extremely benefitial to the supervisory personnel to watch
over contractors' working procedures and improving quality of the works.

Procurement
3.04   All biddings were executed following international competitive
bidding procedures, but no foreign contractors participated in bidding.
Although international competitive bidding procedures caused some delays
in implementing the works because of the time required for the contractors
prequalification notice and bid announcement, the procedures helped in
reducing the contract costs.   For the improvement of provincial and county
roads, consultants were emnployed.   The consultants teams were jointly formed
with foreign and local consulting firms, which were formed by mutual agreement
among MOHA and IBRD.   Foreign consultants were selected on the basis of
their experiences in Korea in the similar tasks and remunerations were set on
the basis of international levels.   Local consultants were selected among
leading firms in the country with wide range experience in the similar tasks.
Costs
3.05   Actual costs of the project roads were closely monitored by means
of variation orders which were computated and verified upon occurrence of
all variations in the contract amounts, therefore, the costs actually
incurred were quite correct.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01   The purpose of the present final evaluation is to determine the
economic returns of the project, using actual investment costs and traffic
volumes.   The road by road evaluation is made through the "with-without"
approach as was in the case of original evaluation at appraisal time.
The only differences at this final stage would be that the evaluations are
made using actual costs and traffic while the original evaluations were
made on the basis of estimated costs and traffic.   Table 3 shows actual
traffic volumes on each road section and original' and final estimates of
economic rate of return are shown in Table 1 and actual and forecast
estimates of project costs are shown in Table 2.
V.   CONCLUSIONS
6.01   As stated previously (para. 2.04) the project was rated as top-priority
among the Fifth Five Year Plan and the resultant project in the light of
Sixth Five Year Plan more than justifies the project.   Although the scope
of the project exceeded the original intention by more than 1411, the size
of the project was not overly burdensome to MORA, considering the project
times involved.   In concl\ison the project was well designed, implemented
within the capacity of the provinces.   Throughout the duration of the
project, Mission from IBRD made periodic visits to Korea to review the works
and management of the project.   Number of visits by the IBRD ranged between
two to four times per year, depending on the work load under progress.
The Mission's visits were timely and its reviews of the project was quite
helpfull.

PROJECT CO0PLETICI REPORT
HICHWAY ?ROJECTf 23924-KO)
B. PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL ROAD I MeROVEMENT BY MINISTRY OF CONSTRUCTION
1. INTRODUCTION
The project originally consisted of twenty construction sections(lots as are
comsonly ealled)with a total length of 385 Km.
Later in 1986, six more lots were added to the project bringing the total
number of lots to 26 with a total length of 445.7 Km.
Among the 26 lots, 9 lots, total length of 114.4 Km. included widening and
reconstruction existing two lane paved roads to four lane highways while the others
involved improving  and  paving the existinig gravel roads  to  standard two  lane
paving road.
The work sites were widely spread over the country located in most of provinces,
and the work areas were under the jurisdiction of the Regional Constructio.. tffice
(RCO) of MOC.
2. M.O.C(B.P.R)
Within the government, the bureLu of public roads(B.P.R) was responsible for
budgetary matters including the supply or allocation of funds for payments of
works as well as technical matters involving substantial changes on project design
for which its approval was solicited, while the regional construction office(RCO)
was in charge of the supervision of works and the payment of work to the contractors.



-21-
In construction field, supervisor under the director general of the RCO were
charged in each sub-project including technical matters involving design modifications,
administration matters, land acquisition, and all kinds of civil affairs as well so
that they had to pay soaewhat limited attention to solve technical matters in
detail.
'n this regard, the consultants was very helpful and had good opportunity to offer
technical assistance to RCOs at every stage of the supervision, although their
recoumendations,(aore advance or reasonable methed they thougut) were not accepted
because of account regulation and economic reasons, occasionally.
In the near future, the government is going to consider that all responsibilties
for a particular portion or project (the consultant's resident engineer replace
the RCO's and - irectly responsible for supervision of works) would be given to
the consultants after reforming or revising present rules and regulations.
In such case, consultants could have enforcement to execute new technical methed
under their own risk.
3. CONSULTANTS TEAM
The consultants' field services were rendered with the project divided into
three work areas with offices at Seoul, Cheonan and Eagu.
Each of the office was consisted of three or four engineers and laboratory
technicians, respectively.
They were assigned to eacl. work areas and responsible for three or four lots
at the same tise.



-22-
Some of them had good experience in corns1i. tion highwals from other project or
overseas so that they could introduce and r.conriend new construction methods relatively,
such as;
o The method of asphalt base coarse placement and its compaction, i.e, the placing of
asphalt base coarse(originally two layer of 5cm and compacted each layer by using
in sequence of macadam roller, tire roller and tandam roller) was changed into
one layer 10ca and compacted by using only tire roller in a proper method.
o Placement of 15cm lean concrete slab in concrete pavement without expansion joint
through the whole length.
o The design mix of asphalt concrete for wearing coarse with the proportion of natural
sand limited 10%, so asphalt content was reduced to around 6.0% from around 6.3%
in the past.
o Must be used crushing material for subbase coarse on heavy traffic sections.
o Must be used crushing materia- riverbed or quarry rock)for concrete pavemtnt, etc.
Among the above, some recomendations were accepted by M.O.C and adopted as
standard in specification of road construction project from 1988 through the trial
implementation of pavement.
On the other hand, despite of those wonderful achievements, it was very difficult
to keep up with qualified engineers, since they were hired by the consultants temporarily.
They had to movc another jobs before the end of this period whenever better
chances were offered to them.



-23-
4. CONTRACTORS
Most of construction and their field staffs had also good experiences in road
construction project fror overseas, from 10 years to a couple of years. however,
those useful experiences were not fully demonstrated in soae cases unfortunately.
The reasons mainly might be:
o The difference of construction cost between domestic and overseas (domestic
costs were far behind overseas in sone lots.)
o The difference of supervising and financial aspects(when contractors reduced
their cost by using other method, contract amount would be reduced in some
cases.)
Cenerally, it is thought that contractors had achived in qua.ity control
and done a significant improvement compare to previous loan project.
S. THE BANK
During the implementing project, the Bank established effective and good relations
with the Borrower and helped in solving both financial and technical problems that
emerged. Arrangements for preparing and implementing the project have always been
agreed in a realistic and flexible nanner, involving both the Bank, consultants
and B.P.R(M.O.C).
The Bank's encouragesent and agreement to use domestic consulting firms gave
more opportunity to the development of an engineering consulting capacity in Korea.
