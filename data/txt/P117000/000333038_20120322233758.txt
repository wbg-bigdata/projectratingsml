F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
1) Improve public sector governance and economic management, by supporting reforms to
increase the efficiency of tax collection, improve public service delivery, enhance debt
management, reduce waste in the provision of public services, and help cope with the adverse
consequences of the global economic downturn.


                                                    2
  2) Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets, by supporting efforts to
develop objective beneficiary selection criteria and transparent targeting mechanisms and
prioritize social spending to vulnerable groups.

  3) Promote financial sector stability and improve the business environment, through measures
aimed at strengthening the financial sector regulatory environment, mitigating regional contagion
risks, promoting investments, and substantially lowering the existing barriers to registering
companies and properties.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Grenada is a small, highly vulnerable open economy. Like most small Caribbean
economies, Grenada is limited in its capacity to diversify production and exports, and hence is
highly vulnerable to economic shocks and natural disasters. First, Grenada suffers from the
myriad disadvantages of limited scale. Second and related, Grenada has a strong degree of
openness and is subject to commodity booms and busts, which compound the challenges of
macroeconomic management and create uncertain growth paths. Third, Grenada along with its
OECS neighbors, consistently rank in the top ten in the world in terms of their exposure to
natural disasters. Fourth, Grenada has accumulated high debt overhang and is amongst the most
indebted countries in the world. Fifth, Grenada has not benefited much from international aid for
years, in part due to its middle-income status. Overall, Grenada is much more sensitive to
external shocks than most other countries in the world, and has only limited capacity to respond
to downturns with counter cyclical policies. Thus, Grenada faces increasingly difficult policy
choices, especially in the wake of the current global financial crisis.

2.     Annual GDP grew on average by just 1.3 percent per year in 2000-09 due to several
external shocks, which affected both local production as well as tourism to the island
(September 11, 2001; tropical storm Lili in 2002, hurricane Ivan in 2004, hurricane Emily in
2005; the food and energy price spikes in 2007-08; and the ongoing global financial crisis). The
economy mostly relies on remittances, tourism, financial and educational services and FDI, all of
which were hit by the recession in the United States and Europe. Almost all FDI-financed
tourism investment projects were put on hold in 2009. Consequently, real GDP growth slowed
from 4.9 percent in 2007 to 2.2 percent in 2008, and to negative 7.6 percent in 2009 (Table 1).

                                                 6
Unemployment rose to an estimated 30 percent in 2009. At the same time, the failure of the CL
Financial Group in Trinidad and Tobago, with extensive operations in the OECS countries, hit
Grenada hard and exposed vulnerabilities in its financial system. Grenada was among the most
affected countries as it held about 20% of BAICO’s liabilities.

3.      The overall fiscal balance of the public sector deteriorated from a small surplus of 0.4
percent of GDP in 2005 to a deficit of 8.1 percent of GDP in 2007 and 6.6 percent of GDP in
2009 due to lower revenues, increased transfers to vulnerable groups, and secular pressures on
the wage bill (which grew from 11 percent of GDP in 2006 to 13 percent in 2008). The
government financed these deficits with arrears, a drawdown of deposits, and new debt. The
total public debt to GDP ratio doubled between 2000 and 2002, reaching 102 percent, and further
increased to 120.9 percent by the end of 2004. In September 2005, the government launched a
successful commercial debt exchange offer for half of the total public debt. Following the
restructuring, Standard and Poor’s upgraded Grenada’s new bonds (20-year maturity) to B-minus
from the 2004 default status. The debt to GDP ratio declined to 102.2 percent by end-2008
before rising again in 2009 due to the severe impact of the global recession.

4.      As a result of the slow economic growth, the percentage of poor people increased
from 32 percent in 1998/99 to 37.7 percent in 2007/08. Indigent rates, however, dropped
significantly from 1998 to 2008. An additional one-sixth of the population was at risk of falling
into poverty in case unanticipated events—such as natural disaster or an economic shock— were
to occur. The steep increase in unemployment rates hit hardest the poor and most vulnerable –
particularly youth and females.
5.      The new government that came into office in July 2008 took immediate measures to
reduce the fiscal deficit. It sharply reduced capital expenditure, reinstated the EC$3 per gallon
fuel tax and full pass-through of global oil prices to domestic fuel prices (October 2008), and
committed to resolving a failed bank with limited direct fiscal costs. The government also
committed itself to wage moderation and began negotiating with labor unions and social partners
on maintaining a sustainable wage bill.

6.       In response to the global crisis, the government took measures both on the revenue
and expenditure side to mitigate the impact on economic activity. To support employment
and tourism, the government granted tax relief to hotels and guest houses. This measure is
estimated to have cost 0.2 percent of GDP, partly because not all potential recipients met
eligibility conditions, such as no dismissal of staff. The government also cut capital spending by
27 percent and wage expenditure by 5 percent while protecting social spending. As a result, the
primary deficit excluding grants widened by 0.6 percent of GDP in 2009.

7.     On April 2, 2010, the IMF approved a three year Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
for Grenada with access to SDR 8.775 million (75 percent of quota). The ECF follows a PRGF,
which was approved in April 2006 and was successfully completed in April 2010.1

  The last review (fifth) under the PRGF program was approved by the Board of Executive Directors of the IMF on
April 2, 2010. All but two quantitative performance criteria for end-November 2009 were met. The primary balance
excluding grants target was missed by 3.3 percent of GDP due primarily to higher-than-expected external

disbursements on donor-financed capital projects and some overruns on current spending. The target on
accumulation of external official arrears was breached in several cases due to the late arrival of external budgetary
support, systems upgrades, and procedural weaknesses. The structural benchmark on introducing a Value Added
Tax (VAT) was met, but establishing a Public Procurement Authority was delayed until September 2010 to allow
time to revise the Public Procurement Act in line with international best practices, with TA from the OECD.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Program Development Objectives were the following:

      Improve public sector governance and economic management, by supporting reforms to
       increase the efficiency of tax collection, improve public service delivery, enhance debt
       management, reduce waste in the provision of public services, and help cope with the
       adverse consequences of the global economic downturn.
      Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets, by supporting efforts to
       develop objective beneficiary selection criteria and transparent targeting mechanisms and
       prioritize social spending to vulnerable groups.
      Promote financial sector stability and improve the business environment, through
       measures aimed at strengthening the financial sector regulatory environment, mitigating
       regional contagion risks, promoting investments, and substantially lowering the existing
       barriers to registering companies and properties.


The Key Outcome Indicators, expected to be met by June 2011, were as follows:

      Government’s indirect tax collection (inland revenue and customs) improved by 1.0
       percent of GDP (Baseline: 7.7 percent of GDP in 2009);
      Debt management activities are consolidated in one unit, sufficient full time staff is
       allocated to this Debt Management Unit and quarterly debt and risk management reports
       are produced to inform decision making (Baseline in 2008: 2 separate units responsible
       for domestic and external debt; only 2 staff in charge of debt management; and no report
       on debt and risk management);
      Quarterly reports are prepared and submitted to the Minister of Finance by the Waste
       Reduction Unit showing number of miles driven by government vehicles and expenditure
       on fuel by each ministry, with the objective of reducing cost of fuel consumption and
       maintenance of government vehicles by 10 percent (Baseline no reports and no
       benchmark exist in 2009);
      Legislation is in place requiring basic solvency margins (capital requirements) for life
       insurance companies and annuity definitions are tightened to ensure that products offered
       are clearly covered as insurance products and that they are also covered under the
       relevant regulations (Baseline: no capital requirements and annuity products included
       deposit type products in 2009);
      The number of days needed to register property deeds at the Deeds & Land Registry has
       decreased by 50 percent, lowering the overall number of days to register property by 39
       percent (Baseline: 60 days to register property deeds, and 77 days to complete all
       property registration activities as of June 1, 2009);
      An action plan for reforming the social safety nets has been developed and is being
       implemented (Baseline 2009: no action plan or strategy).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

N/A

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

8.     The ES DPL/DPC supported policies and reforms for improving
macroeconomic and social conditions in Grenada. The overall goal of the program was to
help the country manage the global crisis, while accelerating the structural transformation of
the economy to improve public service delivery, enhance the country’s competitive position
and better manage the inherent vulnerability of a small and open economy. It was consistent
with the Government program, supporting measures to help: (i) improve public sector
governance and economic management; (ii) strengthen social safety nets; and (iii) promote
financial sector stability and improve business environment.

1.4.1   Component 1: Improving Governance and Public Sector Efficiency

9.      The proposed ES DPL/DPC supported government efforts to: (i) exercise a sound
fiscal policy; and (ii) set the basis of a more efficient public sector. In February 2010, the
government introduced a VAT, replacing several indirect taxes. Although designed to be revenue
neutral, the VAT has a broader coverage and is more efficient than the General Consumption
Tax (GCT), helping to stabilize and increase government revenue. In early 2010, the government
took steps for improving debt management, including the establishment of the Debt Management
Unit (DMU) and strengthening the front office debt management function. Establishment of the
DMU addressed one of the weaknesses in debt management identified in the DeMPA study. The
government has also established a Waste Reduction Unit to curb wasteful spending and a
Division of Economic Management and Planning to sharpen the analytical underpinnings of the
policy framework. Finally, the government viewed keeping the wage bill sustainable as essential
for restoring fiscal balance. To this end, the Cabinet decided to carry out staffing and
expenditure reviews of all established, non established and contractual positions in the public
sector to assess the number of public sector staff which is necessary to carry out core service
delivery functions with the ultimate objective of improving service delivery and the allocation
and use of available public resources. The reform of the public administration and the civil
service requires a long term effort. The ES DPL/DPC focuses on the early steps of this process.

10.     The prior actions under this component included enactment and regulation of the VAT
Act, staffing and expenditures reviews at public sector institutions, appointment of the Head of
the Integrity Unit, restructuring the Department of Economic Affairs at the Ministry of Finance,
and establishment of a Waste Reduction Unit at that Ministry to promote cutting costs of
operating government vehicles (Table 2).

1.4.2   Component 2: Improving Social Safety Nets

11.    The ES DPL/DPC aimed at improving the social safety nets’ response capacity in
times of crisis and strengthening the outcomes of social assistance programs over the longer
term. The prior actions supported under this component were based on the results of the Grenada

                                              10
Social Safety Nets Assessment (SSNA) and on international best practices. Specifically, the ES
DPL/DPC supported government efforts to improve the social safety nets through consolidation
of the three cash transfers programs in the country, which are key social safety net interventions.
In the medium-term, the social safety nets actions supported under this ES DPL/DPC were
expected to contribute to the creation of a safety net system with clearly defined selection criteria
for beneficiaries and effective functional targeting mechanisms. In coordination with the
implementation of the ES DPL/DPC, the Bank provided Non-lending Technical Assistance
(NLTA) to the Government of Grenada and other OECS countries in social safety net reform.

12.     The prior actions in this component represented critical first steps for reforming the
social safety nets in Grenada. They include completion of a Social Safety Net Assessment,
establishment of a Steering Committee for reform of social programs and elaboration of an
Action Plan for its implementation, and launching a stimulus package of selected priority
investment projects to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the poorest and most vulnerable (Table

1.4.3   Component 3: Promoting Financial Sector Stability and Improving Business
        environment

13.      This component supported measures to: (i) provide a fiscally prudent resolution to
the BAICO collapse, while at the same time establishing a sounder regulatory environment
for the insurance sector; (ii) put in place a transparent set of rules for new investments that
provide a level playing field to investors; and (iii) create separate registries for companies
and property. The new rules for investment were complementary with other actions, such as the
introduction of the VAT, which shifted the burden of taxation towards consumption. Ease in
creation and registration of new enterprises is complementary to customs reforms and trade
facilitation. These actions were also complementary with other efforts of the government to
facilitate the creation of new firms, develop valuate chains and improve standards.

14.    Consistent with these objectives, the ES DPL/DPC prior actions under this
component included appointment of a judicial manager for BAICO, implementation of a new
Insurance Act and an Investment Promotion Act, and separation of the Deeds and Land Registry
and the Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property from the office of the Registrar of the High
Court (Table 2).

  2.1 Program Performance

  15.     All the policy measures supported by this DPL were conditions for Board
  presentation, and thus were deemed to be met prior to approval of the Loan. Table 2 reports on
  the status of these outcomes as of September 2011, when the ICR mission visited Grenada. 

  16.     The Government made substantial progress in its reform program, although
  implementation of several measures was slower than expected (Table 2). In particular, apart
  from preparing the consolidation of payments of the three main cash transfer programs, reform
  of the social protection safety net is still work in progress. On the other hand, most
  targets/objectives regarding financial sector stability and improving the business environment
  were achieved, and the majority of measures/targets in public sector management were achieved
  or partially achieved.

  2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

  17.     Several factors affected implementation of the Program. First, the scope of the
  Program was wide, covering reforms in three complex areas with numerous prior actions and
  expected outcomes. In particular, reforms in the public sector and of social sector programs take
  substantial time to design and even more time to implement. Second, in conjunction with the
  first point, the time span of the Program (12 months) proved to be too short mainly due to
  constrained public sector capacity. Also, in cases when Parliament approval of measures is
  involved, a one-year implementation period was proven too short. Third, the supervision mission
  visited Grenada only 2-3 months before the closing date due to the government’s busy schedule.
  An earlier visit by the Bank team could have pointed out areas where more action was needed,
  helping the government to focus on those areas. Last, but not least, major factors affecting

                                                          16
implementation were budgetary constraints on the government part and limited capacity of
implementation in the public sector. While Government was able to increase revenues and cut
expenditures in 2010, the persistent primary and overall deficits limited its freedom of action.
The Bank helped mitigate those constraints through technical assistance in areas covered by the
Program, including the “Grenada Public Sector Modernization Technical Assistance Credit?
(2005) and the “Grenada Safety Net Advancement Project? (2011). 

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
 
18.      Design. The Ministry of Finance, Planning, Economic Development, Energy and Foreign
Trade was responsible for coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies.
A number of other agencies were involved in the implementation of the reform program being
supported by this ES DPL/DPC, including the Ministry of Social Development, the Ecclesiastical
Affairs & Labor, the Ministry of Education & Human Resources, Customs Administration and
GARFIN. As part of the preparation of the DPL/DPC, the Bank discussed with all relevant
institutions the development of an M&E process to ensure adequate feedback to policy-makers.
The government and the Bank agreed on a results framework with a number of processes,
outputs and outcome indicators to be assessed in June 2011 - the closing date of the Program.
Those were the agreed benchmarks for evaluation of the program supported by the ES
DPL/DPC.  
 
19.      Implementation and Utilization. M&E is traditionally a weak area in the small island
economies including Grenada, but there is strong understanding of the need to strengthen such
mechanisms. The Bank carried out an implementation support mission in April 2011, when
meetings with the Ministry of Finance and other agencies were held in order to assess progress in
the implementation of the program. The mission reviewed all outcome indicators, and a joint
Aide-Memoire summarized the findings of the mission. In particular, the Aide-Memoire
identified elements of the program which were not yet completed and where additional action by
the government was needed to meet the development objectives of the program by the closing
date.  

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

20.     Government has expressed an interest in a follow-up DPL, to support the next stage of
the reform process. The Loan would also provide additional financing to the country as the
international financial crisis is far from over. The request is now under consideration at the
Bank. 

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
 
21.      The objectives of the ES DPL/DPC program remain relevant to date as they were
when the operation was appraised. Grenada is highly vulnerable to external shocks because of
its size and location, and continues to be affected by the international financial crisis. In fact, it
now seems that the recovery of the US economy will take many years, and the financial

                                                 17
instability in Europe became more acute in the first half of 2011. Thus, both the structural as
well as the temporary external conditions are problematic and are likely to remain so for the
foreseeable future. That means that Grenada has to use its limited resources more efficiently,
including in the public sector, to become more competitive and enhance economic growth, as
well as to improve the effectiveness of its social safety net. 
 
22.       The Grenada ES DPL/DPC is consistent with the objectives of Bank engagement
with the OECS countries under the Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) FY10-14, which
was approved by the Board of Directors in June 2010. The RPS rests on two pillars: (i)
building resilience and (ii) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating sustainable growth. In
practical terms, the RPS focuses on achieving improved fiscal and debt sustainability, increasing
efficiency and transparency of public spending and service delivery, sustaining macroeconomic
and financial stability, strengthening policy coordination and economic management,
rationalizing social safety net programs and improving the targeting system. These objectives
were fully reflected in the Program Development Objectives of the ES DPL/DPC, which was
designed to strengthen Grenada’s ability to respond to exogenous shocks and for enhancing its
medium term growth prospects. The ES DPL/DPC was also consistent with the government’s
objectives as set forth in the 2010 Budget Speech presented by the Honourable V. Nazim Burke,
Minister of Finance to the House of Representatives on January 15, 2010. 

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

23.     The Program Document of the ES PDPL/DPC states that this operation was “envisaged
in the FY10-14 RPS as a single tranche operation and was viewed as the beginning of a multi-
year engagement? (para. 5). Consequently, while this DPL/DPC was approved as a self standing
operation, the last column of its policy matrix describes the Second Phase of Government
Reforms (Annex 1). Thus, in order to evaluate the achievement is this DPL/DPC’s PDOs it’s
necessary to have a broader perspective of the various policy measures included in the Program.  

3.2.1   Component 1: Improving Governance and Public Sector Efficiency. Moderately
        Satisfactory.

24.     As mentioned above, the first component of the ES DPL/DPC supported Government
measures to: (i) enhance indirect tax collections, which was challenging given the recent
introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT) and the slowdown in economic activity; (ii) assess
the needs and available human resources in the civil service to improve its efficiency and contain
growth of the wage bill; (iii) improve governance in the public sector; and (iv) enhance
operational efficiency at the Ministry of Finance. 
  
25.     The VAT was introduced in February 2010, and it has been performing
satisfactorily. The VAT has four rates: the standard rate of 15%, 0% on basic food items, 10%
on tourism, and 20% on mobile communications. In 2010, a temporary rate of 7.5% (half the
standard rate) was awarded to 4 construction materials as a stimulus to the construction industry,
which was hit hard by the crisis. The VAT replaced the General Consumption Tax, which had
several rates up to 55%. Altogether, indirect tax revenues increased by 22% in 2010.
Collection by the Inland Revenue Department and Customs Administration (Consumption Duty,

                                               18
Value Added Tax and Import Duty) was EC$166.4 million in 2009 and EC$203.5 million in
2010. Those numbers represent 7.95% and 9.62% of GDP at market values respectively,
thereby surpassing the target of an increase of 1% of GDP.  

26.      A pilot of 5 Human Resources (HR) Audits in selected public sector institutions was
launched in September 2010, with support of an IDF grant. The objective of these audits
was to get a full picture of employment in those institutions and compare it with their needs, as a
first step towards reform. As of September 2011, 2 draft audits were completed (Supreme Court
and Legal Affairs) and the other 3 were expected to be completed by end-2011 (Agriculture,
Education, and Health). Meanwhile, Government declared a freeze in hiring in the public sector.
Government intends to start implementing reforms once the pilot is completed, without waiting
for the audits of the remaining 8 institutions.  

27.     In addition, Government put special emphasis on enhancing ethics and
transparency in the civil service. A Code of Conduct for Public Officers and a Manual of
Cabinet Procedures were drafted and circulated for comments. The drafts were revised and are
now pending final approval by cabinet. Both the Code and the Manual are expected to become
effective in January 2012. Meanwhile, 30 performance agreements are scheduled to be
signed with senior civil service managers in October 2011. Those agreements will be based on
the corporate plans of each Ministry. 

28.     The Ministry of Finance underwent an organizational restructuring aimed at
enhancing its operational efficiency. Three new Units were created: the Debt Management
Unit, the Macroeconomic Policy Unit and the Waste Reduction Unit. Two separate units
dealing with domestic and foreign debt were merged in 2010. The new Debt Management Unit
has a staff of 4 people, including its manager. The Unit prepares monthly reports for the
Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Finance on the outlook of forthcoming amortization and
interest payments, and it plans to prepare also quarterly debt and risk management reports. The
Macroeconomic Policy Unit was established in 2010. It has a staff of 3, including its manager.
The Unit prepares quarterly reviews of economic performance and analytical notes on specific
policy issues to support decision making at the Ministry of Finance and the Cabinet.  

29.     The Waste Reduction Unit was established in late 2010, with the objective of
reducing costs and improving efficiency in government operations, but it lacks staff to
perform its duties. The first report prepared by the Unit was submitted to the Permanent
Secretary at the Ministry of Finance in July 2011. The report indicates that instead of
decreasing, the cost of fuel consumption by government vehicles went up by nearly 50%, from
EC$1.5 million in 2009 to EC$2.2 million in 2010. No data was available on the number of
miles driven. However, since the price of petrol increased by only 15%, the quantity of fuel used
in 2010 was larger, and thus probably also the number of miles driven. Maintenance
expenditures increased too, from EC$1.67 million in 2009 to EC$1.86 million in 2010. The Unit
lacks staff, and there are no incentives for employees to save on the use of government vehicles.

3.2.2   Component 2: Improving Social Safety Nets. Moderately Satisfactory.

30.     Currently, there are 16-18 social protection programs in Grenada, managed by
different government agencies. While there are duplications and overlaps among the programs,
they seem not to cover all the potentially eligible beneficiaries. Support is being provided based
on referrals by school and community officials, social workers, etc., but there are poor people
who fall between the cracks. Thus the need for an overhaul of the social protection system in
the country, and for development of objective criteria for selection of beneficiaries and
functional targeting mechanism for social programs. 
 
31.     A Social Safety Net Assessment (SSNA) was completed in August 2009.
Consultations with external stakeholders were held during preparation of the SSNA, and after
completion it was discussed within cabinet. Following the Assessment, a Central Beneficiary
Registry is being developed. Government plans to introduce proxy means test as the targeting
mechanism for the social protection programs. Critical information exists to allow developing
objective selection criteria for beneficiaries and functional targeting mechanisms for social
programs became partially available through a Targeting Workshop in June 2010, through a
consolidated beneficiary list, through the submission to Cabinet of a Targeting Brief, as well as
the MIS system, where the first phase has been completed (additional modules will be added to
the MIS once the proxy means test (PMT) is introduced) which will facilitate the implementation
of PMT, which will be the objective instrument for selecting beneficiaries next year. The
“critical information? encompasses these factors and not merely the data necessary to run the
PMTs, which is not yet available. After the household survey is completed, Government plans to
introduce proxy means test as the targeting mechanism for the social protection programs. 

32.     The Steering Committee Action Plan for reforming the social safety net was
completed in early 2010. Its first action was the consolidation of the country’s three cash
transfer programs: Necessitous, School Transportation, and Public Assistance. These three
programs were consolidated before the closing date of the DPL (June 30, 2011) into the Support
for Education, Empowerment and Development Program (SEED), which issued its first
payments in October 2011. The SEED program targets households, not individuals. 

33.    In 2009, Government selected a list of priority projects taking into account
employment generation and geographical distribution, as part of a stimulus package to
mitigate the impact of the crisis. Government estimates that the stimulus package generated
about 1,500 permanent jobs. As a proxy indicator, data from the National Insurance Scheme
(NIS), shows that the number of newly registered employees was 738 in June 2010 and 835 in
June 2011.  
        

3.2.3   Component 3: Promoting Financial Sector Stability and Improving Business
        environment. Satisfactory.

34.    As all OECS countries, Grenada is highly vulnerable to external shocks, and it was
hit hard by the international financial crisis. Further, it also suffered from the trouble at

                                               20
the CL financial group, parent of two large insurance companies – the British American
Insurance Company (BAICO) and the Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO). Thus,
restoring stability to the financial sector and improving the business environment are essential to
support the current recovery as well as to enhance resilience of the economy to withstand future
external shocks. 
 
35.     Caribbean countries were hard hit by the collapse of BAICO and CLICO in early
2009. Both companies sold “executive flexible premium annuities?, which were in fact
investment products yielding 8.5% for 2 to 5 years, and invested the proceeds in real estate in the
United States. As result of the US real estate market downturn, the companies could not meet
their commitments. The collapse of both companies, which were very prestigious in the
Caribbean, revealed the weakness of the regulatory environment in the islands and the fact that
existing regulations were not properly enforced.  

36.     In April 2009, Caribbean governments agreed on a regional plan to address the
BAICO problem. The plan called the establishment of a new company, with contributions of
US$100 million from Trinidad and Tobago and US$5 million from Barbados. In December
2010, however, that plan collapsed when the new government of Trinidad and Tobago decided
not to participate with funds, and BAICO refused to create a new company.  

37.     A “Plan B? was developed to resolve the BAICO problem, whereby the company
would be liquidated using both the petroleum fund at ECCB (about US$50 million) and funds
obtained from the sale of the traditional insurance part of the business. The new plan includes 4
stages: (i) selling the property portfolio, which was completed in October 2010; (ii) creating a
Health Fund to pay off health insurance claims, which is currently being implemented; (iii)
recapitalizing and selling by tender the life insurance portfolio (22,000 policies in the OECS),
expected by end 2011; and (iv) paying off outstanding annuities. The hair cut in the annuities
will depend on the available funds, but holders are likely to receive around 10 cents on the
dollar. Grenada participates actively in implementing the regional resolution as its
Permanent Secretary of Finance chairs the regional Core Committee, which does the
technical analysis of the plan.  

38.     AS for CLICO, a Judicial Manager was appointed in July 2011. There is progress in
negotiations with Barbados, where the company was based. The size of the problem has been
identified, and the expectation is that sufficient funds will be available to cover the traditional
portfolio of life insurance and to pay back holders of annuities at a discount of about 50 cents on
the dollar. 
 
39.     The new Insurance Act became effective in April 2010. For general insurance, the Act
mandates that each company should have assets equal to unpaid claims plus unearned premiums.
For life insurance policies, assets should cover 100% of their actuarian valuation. In September
2011, companies had accumulated assets equivalent to 93% of liabilities. The new Act increases
capital requirements to EC$2 million for local companies, and to EC$5 million for foreign
companies, while solvency margins are increased to EC$500,000 or 20% of net premium income
(Section 53, page 120). The new Act also tightens the definition of annuities to ensure that the


                                                21
products offered by insurance companies are clearly insurance products and not deposit type
products (Sections 151 and 219-K, page 181). 

40.     The Investment Promotion Act has been approved by Parliament, but it’s not
effective yet. In particular, the Act has not been regulated and the schedule of incentives
has not been established. The Grenada Investment Development Corporation is working on a
draft of the incentives schedule. Meanwhile, Cabinet has approved the Investment Promotion
Strategy. 

41.     Available data shows that gross capital formation by the private sector dropped by
25.8% in 2009 and declined further by 13.8% in 2010 (in nominal terms), probably as a
result of the ongoing financial crisis. In any case, it is not feasible to estimate changes in the
long term rate of growth in such a short period of time, particularly given the current recession,
and if there were any changes, they could hardly be attributed to this operation. 

42.     The Doing Business 2011 ranks Grenada 92 in the overall “Ease of Doing Business?
(out of 183 economies), up from 98 in 2010. The Report indicates that the time required to
open a business in Grenada was 15 days, 5 of which were needed to register and receive
company certificate, register with Internal Revenue and National Insurance Scheme (the rank
improved from 54 in 2010 to 49 in 2011). The Corporate and Intellectual Property Registry was
established as an independent agency in October 2009. It incorporated 142 firms in 2010, and 97
firms in January-August 2011. In September 2011, the Registry had 9 staff, who were
undergoing training towards a shift to online registration. The Report also indicates that the time
required to register property was on average 47 days, 30 of which were required for registration
of the deed (improvement in rank from 163 in 2010 to 145 in 2011). The Deeds and Land
Registry has 6 staff and it’s still under the Supreme Court. 

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

43.     The objectives of the ES DPL/DPC remain relevant, and substantial progress was
made in implementation of key parts of the Program, particularly the successful
implementation of the VAT, restructuring at the Ministry of Finance, drafting of ethic guidelines
for the civil service, enacting the new Insurance Act, improving the business environment, and
consolidating payments of the cash transfer programs. However, there were moderate
shortcomings in the achievement of other Program objectives. As of September 2011, the Waste
Reduction Unit at the Ministry of Finance was just starting its operations and there was no
reduction in the costs of fuel and maintenance of government vehicles. Also, there was some,
but not sufficient, new specific information for the selection of beneficiaries of the social
protection programs, and the pilot of 5 HR audits was not completed, so there was no data
available for designing and implementing HR reforms. However, the pilot was scheduled to be
completed by end-2011, and Government intends to start implementing reforms in the public
sector immediately thereafter. Finally, a 10 percent increase in the long-term rate of growth of
real gross private investment was not achieved either, but changes in private investment are
affected by many variables that are totally out of control of the authorities, such as the ongoing
international financial crisis, and cannot be attributed to any one policy or operation. 

                                                22
3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

44.     There were no gender aspects in this operation, and given the short period covered
by the Program, it’s not possible to attribute any specific poverty impact to the ES
DPL/DPC. However, the measures supported under the governance and public sector efficiency
component are expected to enhance macro stability, reduce the debt burden, improve
prioritization and efficiency of public expenditures, and enhance the efficiency and fairness of
the tax system. In doing so, they will expand the envelope of resources available for social
spending and allow the government to deliver more and better services to vulnerable groups. In
addition, the new VAT, which substituted the higher rate GCT, is expected to reduce the tax
burden of the poor. In addition, the VAT has a zero rate for basic food items, which are largely
consumed by the poor. Finally, ongoing reform of the social safety nets supported under the ES
DPL/DPC is expected to benefit the poor by increasing the efficiency, coverage and targeting of
social spending. 

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

45.     The ES DPL/DPC is contributing in various ways to strengthen institutions in
Grenada. First, the operations and staffing reviews being carried out in the public sector would
help improve the performance and efficiency of public institutions. Second, the Code of Conduct
for Public Officers and the Manual of Cabinet Procedures would enhance transparency and
accountability in the civil service. Third, the formation of the social safety net committee to
spearhead reforms, supported under the ES DPL/DPC, will help ensure that the
recommendations of the SSNA continue to be implemented. In particular, consolidation and
rationalization of the three cash transfer programs will enable Government to use scarce
resources more effectively, and will streamline the payment process. In addition, establishment
of a central beneficiary registry will improve the monitoring and evaluation of social protection
programs.

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

46.     The risks that development outcomes will not be fully achieved and/or maintained
are rated Moderate for the following reasons: on the positive side, the government already
implemented important policy measures and has restated its commitment to the reform program.
In particular, the VAT was implemented and is performing well, indirect tax collections have

                                               23
increased, notwithstanding the new tax system and the slowdown in economic activity, the new
Insurance Act is in place, three cash transfers payments will be consolidated shortly, etc.
Further, while the HR audits in the public sector are moving slower than expected, government
intends to start implementing reforms once the pilot of 5 audits is completed, without waiting for
the other 8 reports. However, on the negative side, several factors could slow down the
reform process: (i) the protracted recovery of developed countries from the international
financial crisis could dampen tourism to Grenada for a long period of time; (ii) fiscal pressures
and the heavy debt burden, coupled with capacity constraints in the public sector, could slow
down implementation of reforms; and (iii) the risk of natural disasters is high. In September
2004, Hurricane Ivan damaged about half of all houses in Grenada and destroyed nearly 90
percent of nutmeg trees, which provided an important source of exports and foreign exchange.
New nutmeg trees take 7 years to bear fruit, so production has only now started to recover.
While Grenada participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and
major private enterprises are partly covered by their own insurance, the costs of a major natural
disaster to the economy would be high and could derail implementation of the reform program.  

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

47.     Bank performance during identification, preparation and appraisal is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank took some time to respond to the initial request by
government, but once the identification mission arrived in Grenada, the process moved
expeditiously. That was particularly important for the country given the international financial
crisis, which led to a 7.6% contraction in GDP and an increase in the rate of unemployment to
about 30 percent in 2009. The components of the Program were designed to increase the
resilience of the economy to external shocks, to enhance its longer term growth potential and to
mitigate the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable segments of the population. However,
while the Program Document discusses good practice principles on conditionality (Box 4, page
42), there are many prior actions and expected outcomes, and not all of them appear to conform
to the principles of Criticality and Transparency and Predictability. Also, the “critical
information needed to develop objective selection criteria for beneficiaries and functional
targeting mechanisms for social protection programs? was not particularly clearly defined to also
include non-data critical information. Further, a 10% increase in the long term rate of growth of
private investment, which is affected by many variables outside government control, cannot be
expected to be achieved in one year. Overall, however, the Bank team worked very well with
government counterparts and produced an operation that was important and useful for Grenada
in the short and medium term. The design and implementation proved too complex given the
capacity of the public sector and the lack of experience with DPLs on the government’s side. 




                                               24
(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

48.    The quality of supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Shortly after Board
approval, there was a change of Task Team Leader, and there was a gap in the follow-up by the
Bank of program implementation. The Bank proposed to carry out an Implementation Support
mission before end-2010, but Government asked to postpone due to their busy schedule, and the
mission was held in April 2011. The mission reviewed thoroughly both the sustainability of the
Prior Actions as well as progress in reaching the expected outcomes of the Program. As the
mission ended, it agreed on a detailed Aide Memoire with the authorities. The Aide Memoire
was somewhat sanguine and over-optimistic, but it spelled out in detail the additional actions that
were needed to reach the targets of the Outcome Indicators and meet the Program Development
Objectives.  

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

49.      Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Program contained
issues that were and remain relevant for Grenada’s economic and social development. The
Program Document was very thorough and comprehensive, but the Policy Matrix included many
prior actions and expected outcomes, and it could have been clearer and more selective overall.
The Implementation Support mission might have been more effective had it visited Grenada
earlier, but its review was thorough and comprehensive, and it pointed out the additional actions
that were needed to meet the targets of the Program. 

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50.      The Government had full ownership of the ES DPL/DPC program and remains
committed to its implementation. While trying to mitigate the impact of the international
financial crisis, government maintained a supportive macroeconomic framework and pursued
institutional reforms with the view of enhancing efficiency in the public sector, improving the
business climate, and consolidating the social safety net. Substantial progress was made in key
parts of the Program. However, as mentioned above, there were shortcomings in implementation
of other elements of the DPL/DPC, particularly in reform of the social safety net. At the same
time, Government is staying the course in implementing the Program components, and it has
restated its intention to achieve its Development Objectives in full. 

(b) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

51.    As described above, substantial progress was made in implementation of key parts of the
Program. However, there were moderate shortcomings in meeting the targets of several Outcome
Indicators due to budgetary constraints and weak implementation capacity in the public sector. 

                                                25
6. Lessons Learned

   A programmatic approach, which supports a multi-stage program with a longer term
    horizon, is superior to a stand-alone one year program. At the Regional Operations
    Committee meeting of this DPL/DPL held in December 2009, both peer reviewers of this
    operation as well as comments by other participants strongly supported a programmatic
    approach. Eventually, a stand-alone operation was favored because of the high uncertainty
    and debt risk of Grenada at that point in time. With hindsight, a programmatic operation
    could have had stronger development impact and, by presenting a schedule of possible future
    financial support, also mitigate the risks mentioned above.

   In small states, policy based programs need to be relatively simple and straightforward.
    Since generally only one policy based operation is prepared in a multi-year period, both the
    Government and the Bank tend to include many activities in the program. However,
    implementation capacity is usually not strong in these countries. Thus, in order to increase
    the likelihood that programs are fully implemented, it would be useful to design highly
    selective and relatively simple programs. In addition, following up with intensive technical
    assistance and country dialogue that builds local capacity would help during implementation
    and also enhance sustainability of the reform program in the medium term.

   The Program Policy Matrix needs to be concise, with few measures and outcome
    indicators that are clearly defined, critical for the performance of the Program, and
    that are within control of the government.
