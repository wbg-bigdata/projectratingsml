MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOrMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND PILOT EXTENSION PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation for a proposed loan to
Algeria for US$32.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would be for 15 years including a 5 year grace period with interest at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate and will help finance an Agricultural
Research and Pilot Extension Project.
2.    Background.  While agriculture's contribution to GDP has declined since
independence, it remains one of the main sectors in the economy; about half of
Algeria's population lives in rural areas and about 25% of the labor force is
employed in agriculture. The growth of the sector over the past 20 years at
about 3.2% p.a. has been insufficient to keep pace with the growing demand for
food. Some 70% of basic food needs are now imported compared to only 25% in
the 1966/70 period. The value of agricultural exports has also fallen by
almost 90% between 1972 and 1983, and they now represent less than 1% of total
exports. The productivity of the sector has remained well below potential due
largely to the poor performance of the now defunct state farms on which yields
had stagnated or declined for 20 years.
3.    Recognizing the importance of agriculture with its potential to create
employment, stem migration from the rural areas and reduce Algeria's
dependence on food imports, Government embarked in the early eighties on an
ambitious reform program. The principal reforms were: (a) the liberalization
of the marketing arrangements and pricing of most fruits and vegetables; (b)
the decentralization and restructuring of the cooperative agencies responsible
for the provision of inputE and marketing; and (c) the creation of the
Agricultural Credit Bank, BADR, to channel resources to agriculture.
4.    In 1987/88 Government undertook the most profound reform to date, the
breakup of the state farms into private voluntary cooperatives (Entreprises
Agricoles Collectives - EAC) containing groups of private farmers, and into
private individual farms (Entreprises Agricoles Individuelles - EAI), thereby
creating a farm management structure that acts as a much greater incentive for
farmers to increase production and yields. At the same time, in order to
ensure longer-term growth of productivity and produztion in agriculture, steps
have been taken to build sound research and extension systems. The research
structure has been reorganized to better define the role and responsibility of
the "Institut de la Recherche Agronomique d'Algerie" (INRA), which handles
basic research, and the commodity specific research institutes; and in 1985, a
new national extension policy ana structure was launched to improve the
technical content of the extension system and farmer/extension/research links.
In support of the reorganization of extension, FAO/UIiDP is assisting the
"Centre National de Pedagogie Agricole" (CNPA) to develop an extension
methodology and to trair. extension staff. The proposed project would finance
a 5-year program to help develop improved research and a pilot program to



2
develop and testL a nationial program of extension to support the private
fariners in Algeria and develop methodologies tor replication nationwide.
5.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The reform program underway in Algeria
needs both financial assistance and technical support in order for the
institutional changes to succeed. Priorities for Bank support aimed at
helping the Goverinent's sector reforms work are defined in a Sector Report
as: (i) the provision of better input distribution, extension and research;
(ii) improved irrigation planning, infrastructure and maintenance; and (iii)
agricultural credit. Bank involvement in the proposed project is justified by
the positive impact it would be expected to have on the development of
research and extension institutions, on the execution of priority research
programs, on developing extension services for the new EACs and EAIs as well
as the existing private sector farmers, and on production in the 20 districts
covered by the project extension services. The project would also complement
other ongoing Bank projects by providing extension advice in the Cheliff and
Mitidja irrigated areas and to farmers and EACs taking credit from the
Agricultural Credit Bank. The project would also provide a vehicle for
coordinating donor support to agricultural research and, ultimately, for
establishing a coherent extension system.
6.    Project Objectives.  The overall objective of this project is to help
the Government develop strong and responsive research and extension services
in order to increase agricultural production and reduce dependence on imported
foodstuffs. The project would help Government to: (a) strengthen the national
system for agricultural research and direct resources towards olearly
identified priorities; (b) test new extension structures and methodology for
servicing private farmers and improving links with research; and (c) develop
follow-up programs.
7.    Project Description.  The project would comprise a five-year program to
help the Government develop improved national research and development
systems. The research sub-project would include: (a) strengthening of INRA
for coordinating programs and carrying out basic research; (b) implementing
throuigh INRA and specialized research institutes (ITGC, INPV and ITEBO) five
priority research themes including wheat and barley, legummes, forage crops,
red meat production and cereal/livestock farming system; (c) application of
programming by objectives to research implementation; (d) upgrading five
experimental farms to regional research centers, decentralization of station
management and establishment of research/development units in each regional
research center; (e) staff training and technical assistance. The extension
sub-project would comprise a pilot program to test approaches for developing a
national extension service and would include: (a) introduction of improved
extension organization and methods in 20 districts located in siy WilnvYate and
containing about 160,000 farms; (b) provision of improved research-extension-
farmer linkage through the research/development approach; (c) strengthening of
five extension training centers (CFVA) for training and retraining of staff;
(d) reinforcing CNPA for the production of audio-visual material and
coordinating project activiLies; (e) establishment of monitoring and
evaluation units at CNPA and in the Wilayate; (f) training, technical
assistance and fellowships.

8.    Proiect Costs and Financin>. The proiect would provide funds for civil
works, equipment, vehicles, training and technical assistance. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$74.9 million including taxes and duties,
with a foreign exchange component of US$22.1 million (29%). The Loan would
cover 100% of foreign exchange costs and 24% of locai costs.  A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A, amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. Cofinancing possibilities for the training and technical
assistance components are currently being considered by the Government.
However, given that Government has not yet received any firm commitments, full
financing for these components has been included in the proposed loan. The
respective amounts would be cancelled once firm commitments have been
received. A timetable of key project processing events and the Status of Bank
Group Operations in Algeria are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A
map is also attached, as is the Staff Appraisal Report No. 8214-AL, dated
May 11, 1990.
9.    Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the following key actions:
(a) INRA would be vested with the necessary powers to confirm its coordination
role for the national research program by June 30, 1991; (b) the structure of
salaries and employment benefits of research scientists at INRA, ITGC, INTEBO,
INPV would be realigned with those applied in higher education and the
universities by December 31, 1991; (c) appropriate budgetary, financial and
accounting procedures for the research program would be put in place by June
30, 1992; (d) research and extension structures would be reviewed by the
Government and the Bank after three years and national programs prepared; (e)
recruitment of technical assistance for the research program would occur by
June 30, 1992 and of management consultants to work on the research managernent
system by June 30, 1991; (f) as conditions of effectiveness, the national and
regional programming commissions would be established for planning and
preparation of research programs, the training program for research staff
would be agreed and the project management coordination units would be
established in INRA and CNPA.
10.   Benefits.   A revitalization of research services and development of
effective extension services to meet the needs of the EACs and individual
farmers are crucial for raising the technical level and achievements of
Algeria's agriculture. The research sub-project would lay the basis for
future production increases, while the extension sub-project would provide the
basis for increased production from better uptake of existing technolc ,y.
11.   Environment.  The proposed project would promote the more efficient use
of land and water resources and farm inputs, and would be expected to have a
positive effect on the environment. The project would test and uitimately
extend a series of improved cultural practices to prevent land erosion. The
research component would initiate work on water saving techniques for field
crops and on development of more efficient use of fertilizer and crop
protection chemicals.
12.   Risks.   The main risks relate to possible delays in transferring the
required numbers of trained staff working in agricultural research and
extension; budget shortfall; and shortage of farm inputs which could nullify



4
the impact of the extension program. The risks relating to research staff
build up should be reduced through the launching of a training program prior
to project start-up, by bringing terms and conditions of employment closer to
those of university staff and by requiring trainees to work for the
institutions for a fixed time following completion of their training.
Extension services have lost many senior staff during the land reform. The
staff remaining are sometimes poorly trained and motivated. This deficiency
will be addressed under the project through the strengthening of CNPA and five
extension training centers (CFVA), the setting up of a technical assistance
and training program for all levels of extension staff, and development during
the life of the project of improved terms and conditions of employment for
extension staff. Funding risks will be minimized by inclusion of the project
in the core program of the five year plan. Availability of adequate
quantities of inputs is linked to the availabilcty of foreign exchange.
Government has declared that priority will be given to its allocation of
foreign exchange to agriculture.
13.   Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would complv
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
