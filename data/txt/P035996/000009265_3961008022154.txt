MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
ACTING AS TRUSTEE FOR THE TRUST FUND FOR GAZA
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
IN THE AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$20 MILLION
TO
THE PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC COUNCIL
FOR DEVELOPMENT AND RECONSTRUCTION
FOR AN EDUCATION AND HEALTH REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Trust Fund credit to the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR)
in the amount of US$20.0 million equivalent to help finance an Education and Health Rehabilitation
Project. The proposed Trust Fund credit would be on IDA terms, with 40 years maturity, including 10
years grace.
2.        Human resource development is a major factor in developing and sustaining economic growth.
Quality education and health care are essential for the development and maintenance of a stable social
environment and the formation of a society that can look optimistically to the future. The proposed
project aims to assist the people of the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) to realize these objectives.
3.        BACKGROUND. The Agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho Area signed in May 1994,
and the Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities, signed in August 1994 gave
full responsibility to the Palestinian Authorities (PA) for all public services in Gaza and the District of
Jericho, and for selected services, including education and health, in the West Bank. Since August 1994,
national programs have been developed by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) and
the Ministry of Health (MOH) and both Ministries are demonstrating commitment to the development of
leadership and technical skills in their respective sectors.
4.        The combined area of the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) is 6,000 square kilometers. The 1993
estimated combined population was about 2.3 million. More than 50 percent of the combined populations
are 15 years or younger and the population is increasing rapidly at the rate of 4% per annum. The West
Bank and Gaza differ in demographics, infrastructure and economic status. Most of the West Bank has a
population density of 227 persons per square kilometer, with 32 percent of its population registered as
refugees. The Gaza Strip, has a dense population of 2,225 persons per square kilometer. Registered
refugees are 72 percent. GNP per capita is significantly lower in Gaza. Gaza was previously
administered by Egypt, while the West Bank was part of Jordan. This has resulted in differences in
service provision, such as the use of different school curricula and materials.
5.        The Education Sector. There are 1,300 primary and secondary schools (1993) accommodating
close to 600,000 students (grades 1-12). About 80% of these schools are located in the West Bank and
20% in Gaza. About 25% of these schools offer secondary education. The PA operates about 73% of all
primary and secondary schools; UNRWA, 14%; and the private sector, the remaining 13%. The lack of
current census data by age makes it impossible to accurately estimate the percent of school-age children
enrolled at each level. It is estimated that close to 100% of the relevant age children are enrolled in the
earlier grades, but the percentage declines for grades 9 through 12.
6.        The main education sector issues are: Enrollments. Given the very young demographic
profile of the WBG population, each year an estimated 18,000 new student places need to be created'.
To keep expenditures at a manageable level, MEHE will in the near future need to consider policy
1/   Excluding UNRWA and private sector schools.



changes, such as double shifts that will optimize the use of its school facilities; Inadequate facilities and
maintenance. Locations of schools do not always match the residential catchment area of school children.
Many schools built in the 1950s-1960s were poorly designed, constructed and maintained. About 1,400
classrooms (17 percent) of 8,200 classrooms in West Bank are using rented houses, resulting in
uneconomically small classes, wasting teacher resources. Due to severe lack of maintenance, many of
these facilities are now dilapidated beyond repair and need to be replaced; Use of two curriculum
systems, inadequate teacher training, and shortage of reading materials. Two distinct curricula are being
used in the WBG. The West Bank using the Jordanian curriculum, and Gaza the Egyptian. In the 95/96
school year the new Jordanian curriculum and textbooks are being introduced in the West Bank for the
first time. In parallel, the new Egyptian curriculum and textbooks are also being introduced in Gaza.
However, teachers have not been trained to use either of these curricula which require different
pedagogical approaches and subject knowledge to the ones formerly used. Many teachers are teaching
subjects for which they were not trained. Schools also lack supplementary reading materials, libraries,
science equipment and laboratories and basic equipment such as globes, maps and other teaching aids;
Unmet needs for disadvantaged groups. There are several educationally disadvantaged groups with
differing needs including students still in school and school leavers whose learning was disrupted by the
Intifada; and Sector policy and management. Reliable data on which to base policy decisions are lacking,
and few staff have experience in education system management. In the long-term, MEHE will need to
prepare for merger with the UNRWA system, and address related issues, including the variation between
MEHE and UNRWA teacher salaries.
7.        The Health Sector. Following the assumption of complete responsibility for all public sector
health services in WBG, MOH has rapidly begun to operationalize essential policies outlined in the
National Health Plan. UNRWA (restricted to registered refugees), NGOs, and the private sector also
provide health care services. These agencies provide primary care as well as hospital care, directly
through their own facilities or through contracts. The public sector operates 205 primary health care
facilities, UNRWA operates 41, and NGOs, 192. Of the 22 hospitals in WBG, 14 are public, one is
operated by UNRWA, and seven are operated by NGOs. In 1991 while still under the Israeli Civil
Administration, health expenditures for Gaza and the West Bank represented approximately $US200
million2. Compared to other countries in the region, health care expenditures in WBG were relatively
high, but did not translate in higher health status. Life expectancy was 65 years; infant mortality rate was
estimated at 40-60 per 1,000 births. A factor for the comparatively low health indicators could be the
insufficient attention given to primary and preventive health care services. Moreover, resources were
unevenly distributed: Gaza and the most remote areas of the West Bank were and continue to be
disadvantaged in terms of health facilities and personnel.
8.        The main health sector issues are: Inadequate infrastructure. Infrastructure in the health sector
suffers from lack of investment and sub-standard buildings. Some health centers are operating in non
purpose-built facilities which are not suitable for use as health centers. The maintenance of some
facilities have been so neglected over the years that they now need to be replaced; Variation in quality
and availability of health care services. The quality of health care, measured by staffing, service volume
ratios, as well as the condition of facilities, varies substantially by geographic location and sponsor. In
addition, there is no standardization of services, supervision and management quality vary significantly,
and training opportunities for staff are limited. There are also shortages of para-professionals and nurses;
Sector management. There are few experienced health system administrators and available information
for planning and policy-making is inadequate and unreliable. Differences in regional priorities, the
geographical separation between the two areas and poor communications impede efficient management;
Special populations. A cross-cutting issue for the health sector is the further development and provision
of community mental health services to identify and treat those of all ages who have been adversely
affected by the recent upheavals, as well as provide appropriate long-term services to the general
population; and Sector policy. Investments in the sector are inconsistent with needs and health outcomes
2/   This represents about 7 percent of Gross National Product, or about 9 percent of Gross Domestic Product, a
per capita expenditure of about $US110.0 per year.



- 3 -
resulting in low efficiency. Factors contributing to the low efficiency include: (a) the proliferation of
very small hospitals (70 percent of hospitals have under 100 beds); (b) the provision of highly specialized
medical procedures in uneconomical units; (c) the insufficient attention given to preventive activities
particularly for women and children.
9.        PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION. The proposed project is designed within
the framework of a three-year program of priority needs for education and health in the West Bank and
Gaza as established by the PA. The program is designed to ensure that essential health and education
services run without interruption in the short-term, and to assist both MEHE and MOH implement
sustainable sector strategies and establish themselves as effective institutions in the longer-term. Program
components for each sector are designed to: (a) Upgrade Physical Infrastructure (US$51.2 million for
education, and US$43.0 million for health); (b) Imnrove Quality of Service (US$22.6 million for
education, and US$3.7 million for health); and (c) Develop Institutional Capacity (US$4.2 million for
education and US$1.8 million for health). The total estimated program costs of about US$126.8 million3
(mainly capital investments) would be financed by a credit out of the Trust Fund for Gaza (TFG) of
US$20.0 million (the Project), with co-financing in the amount of US$106.8 million. The Project scope
is limited exclusively to Gaza, as mandated by the provisions of the Resolutions of the Executive
Directors of the IBRD and IDA (Resolution No. 93-11 and Resolution No. 93-7) establishing the TFG,
and also to the US$20.0 million presently available in the TFG. However, it is expected that program
needs for Gaza not covered by the TFG, and those of the West Bank would be cofinanced by donors.
Extensive efforts have been made to contact potential co-financiers and a number have expressed interest.
Discussions are under way with the Arab Fund, ODA, EU, Italy, and Japan for an amount of about
US$45.0 million.
10.       PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION. The Project addresses urgent physical
needs, quality of service, and institutional development issues in education and health. Project
components have been identified as priorities by the PA in the light of analytical work carried out with
assistance from IDA and other agencies. The project would consist of the following components:
The Education Sector (US$12.0 million)
Upgrade Physical Infrastructure (US$12.0 million equivalent):
(a)  rehabilitate facilities, replace dangerous structures and substandard or undersized classrooms at
24 basic education schools, and replace or repair broken furniture; and
(b)  construct and furnish seven new basic education schools in under-served areas.
The Health Sector (US$8.0 million)
Upgrade Physical Infrastructure (US$4.5 million):
(a)  upgrade, expand, and furnish two Comprehensive Health Centers;
(b)  replace, and furnish four Comprehensive Health Centers; and
(c)  replace, and furnish four Health Centers.
Improve Quality of Service (US$2.0 million):
(a)  initiate a quality service improvement program in primary and secondary services through
technical assistance and training; and
(b)  support a health education program for schools.
3/   US$151.0 million equivalent, including the value of land donated by communities in the West Bank (US$3.6
million equivalent, for 15 new schools), and provided by the PA in Gaza (US$12.0 million equivalent, for
seven new schools under the TFG, and US$8.6 million equivalent, for six new schools to be funded by
donors).



- 4 -
Develop Institutional Capacity (US$1.5 million):
(a)  provide technical assistance to develop a five-year plan for the health sector;
(b)  conduct a feasibility study on communication links between Gaza and West Bank health
facilities to enable exchange of medical expertise and enhance the referral system; and
(c)  provide technical assistance, training and operational support for the health PCU.
11.       PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. The project would be implemented over a three-year
period, beginning in mid-1995. To expedite project implementation during the first twelve months,
PECDAR will help both Ministries in the procurement of major civil works and goods contracts. In this
respect, for contracts exceeding US$250,000, PECDAR will assist both Ministries through joint
committees to: (a) review technical aspects; (b) prepare designs, specifications and bidding documents; (c)
invite bids; (d) evaluate and award contracts; and (e) monitor progress and supervise contract execution.
After a period of twelve months, PECDAR and the two Ministries will review implementation
arrangements in consultation with IDA with the aim of devolving full responsibility for project
implementation to the two Ministries. Responsibility for planning and formulation of Annual Work Plans
and management and coordination of all project activities will rest with the Ministries. The project would
finance 100% of total costs on account of the Borrower's inability to provide counterpart funding at this
stage. To permit MEHE and MOH to proceed with advanced procurement associated with rehabilitation
of schools in Gaza, the health education program, and equipment for the PCUs, retroactive financing of
up to US$1.65 million equivalent would be provided for payments made against the above activities prior
to signing but after March 1, 1995.
12.       The Education and Health Ministries have been receiving assistance under the Technical
Assistance Trust Fund (TATF) and the Emergency Rehabilitation Project (ERP), and staff from both
Ministries have been and continue to be trained under arrangements with PECDAR. Each Ministry has
identified members of their staff to form the nucleus of the Project Coordination Units (PCUs) which
would be in charge of project implementation. Rehabilitation work for schools and health centers have
been identified through surveys at each site. Sites for 13 new schools in Gaza4 have been identified and
ownership of land is being transferred from the Ministry of Housing to MEHE. None of the MOH health
centers will require acquisition of new lands as they are all upgraded or expanded at existing sites. First
year activities for both sectors have been fully identified. Prototype designs would be developed in the
next few months by consultants to be hired under the TATF. Selection of architectural firms is being
initiated by PECDAR.
13.       The MEHE has developed proposals for project management and responsibilities for project
activities at central, district, municipal and school levels. These arrangements incorporate a balanced
degree of decentralization and appropriate participation from local communities and the schools
themselves. Furthermore, procurement arrangements for civil works have also been proposed, delegating
some responsibility for minor works (about 5-10% of civil works value) to be undertaken at the District
level. Construction supervision and coordination of activities would be shared by district and school level
staff to minimize overloading of MEHE staff. Private consultants would be used for the design and
supervision of new schools and for the larger works packages.
14.       The MOH has identified the implementation team members and is developing a training
program to further augment their project management skills. Design and supervision of health sector civil
works would be contracted out to private sector firms and would be managed by experienced engineering
staff of the MOH. Site engineers at the district level will also assist in supervision. Engineering and
maintenance staff are available at most hospital and major clinics.
15.       PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY. Sustainability would be assured by prioritizing investment
and recurrent costs and shifting priorities to more cost effective services. Proposed project components in
the health sector focus on cost effective primary health care activities. The longer term project goal
4/   Seven of which would be constructed under the project.

would assist both the MEHE and MOH to develop their capacity to rationalize their investments in light
of the resources available for their sectors. Recurrent cost implications of the project (particularly the
civil works component) should be minimal. Incremental costs generated by the establishment of new
clinics would be offset by reduced hospital expenditures and investments. This is part of a rationalization
exercise that favors lower cost services at the primary health care level. The MOH has made substantial
progress in initial steps towards cost recovery, including a health insurance scheme and the collection of
local taxes. In education, most civil works would be the repair or replacement of existing unsuitable
facilities. Although a few new schools would expand capacity to relieve overcrowding, most would be
replacing existing buildings which are too dilapidated to repair. The recurrent cost implications on the
human resource side would be relatively small. Education recovers some of its costs through school fees,
municipal taxes and local community contributions. Both sectors are actively seeking ways to become
financially viable.
16.       LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT. Due to
political and institutional issues, implementation of the ERP and WBG donor assistance program have
incurred delays. Border closures, fluctuations in the numbers of Palestinians working in Israel, as well as
the slow pace of capacity building in general, has led to difficulties in absorbing assistance. Recognizing
that successful project activities required close and intensive implementation assistance, the IBRD has
established a representative office which is currently delegated with the authority to manage all on-going
IBRD and IDA activities. Also, as experience has shown that frequent field supervision is essential for
successful implementation especially when dealing with new borrowers, resources for intensive
supervision efforts are being allocated, in conjunction with close follow-up by the representative office.
17.      RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT. The IBRD has been playing an important
role in the development of WBG starting in 1992 with the presentation of a policy and investments
framework under the study "Developing the Occupied Territories;" the establishment of the TFG in 1993;
and its administrator role in the operation of the TATF and the Holst Fund (HF) (the latter for recurrent
cost financing). The IBRD's strategy for WBG focuses on four priority areas: (i) restoring and further
developing basic and social infrastructures; (ii) building policy-making and institutional capabilities; (iii)
supporting the emergence of the private sector; and (iv) sustaining the financial viability of the PA. The
proposed project supports the objectives under items (i) and (ii) directly, and (iii) indirectly (for design
and supervision services which would be contracted out to the private sector, and the construction
activities). The project would also build on the ERP which in its education component focused on
rehabilitation and improvement of existing school plant and equipment, textbooks, and capacity building.
However, the available level of financing ($20.5 million), was adequate for meeting only a portion of the
education sector needs. Furthermore, ERP did not address the health sector. Finally, IDA's involvement
in the appraisal of the WBG Education and Health Rehabilitation Program, and in the financing of this
project would be expected to mobilize donor financing for the unfunded portions of the Program.
18.      AGREED ACTIONS. During negotiations, agreement with PECDAR was reached on: (a)
submission to IDA of annual work programs for project activities, joint IDA/PECDAR reviews of such
programs and plans, and their implementation in a manner satisfactory to IDA; (b) distribution of
responsibility among PECDAR, and the MEHE and MOH with respect to functions relating to
procurement, withdrawals, accounting and reporting requirements, and operation of the special accounts;
and (c) the creation of core Project Coordinating Units (PCUs), one in MEHE and one in MOH and the
recruitment and appointment of key staff.
19.      POVERTY CATEGORY. Program of Targeted Interventions. Specific project activities
with a poverty-reduction focus include: (a) rehabilitation of schools in the most dilapidated condition (and
therefore, likely to be in the poorest areas); and (b) upgrading of primary health care facilities which are
more accessible to the poor.
20.       ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS. The project has been given an environmental rating of
"B." Construction debris generated by project works, as well as medical and solid wastes from upgraded
clinics and hospitals, will be properly disposed of, and waste management procedures would be



- 6 -
introduced to mitigate any negative environmental impact of the proposed project. An environmental
analysis, carried out at pre-appraisal, recommended a comprehensive medical waste management study to
assure the development of a sustainable system for the collection and disposal of medical wastes. This
study is being financed through the TATF and will contain a survey of medical wastes, and
recommendations for awareness and training programs, and management alternatives, including private
sector participation in medical waste management. No resettlement activities are anticipated.
Construction would be carried out at existing sites. New schools would be constructed at vacant sites
owned by the PA or donated to the PA by local communities.
21.       PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES. The education component of the project would
benefit girls by: (a) providing appropriate and adequate sanitary facilities at school sites (frequently noted
as beneficial to keeping girls in school); (b) developing teaching materials free of gender bias; and (c)
increasing appropriate access to schools through the targeting of girls and co-educational schools. The
health component would address the needs of women and children by: (a) strengthening maternal/child
health care as part of primary health care services; (b) training and recruitment of women in professional
positions; and (c) health education targeted to the needs of women and girls. Gender disaggregated data
would be collected during project implementation.
22.       BENEFITS. Overall, the project is expected to improve the efficiency and equity of
educational and health services for a population of about one million people in Gaza. Specific potential
project benefits are: (a) improved education facilities to reduce overcrowding and its adverse effects on
teaching and learning; (b) improved health services through more appropriate facilities and trained health
personnel; (c) more efficient mental health services; (d) improved sectoral capacity to administer and
develop education and health programs essential for sustainable development in WBG; (e) increased
employment in the construction industry through the construction activities generated by the project; and
(f) increased economic activity in the local architectural and engineering firms who would be contracted
to provide design and supervision services. The project is also expected to increase the efficiency of
health and education expenditures through more rational resource allocations and better cost recovery
mechanisms. In addition, the project would serve as a catalyst to attract cofinancing for implementation
of the comprehensive Program. Finally, project activities would contribute to stabilizing the social
environment and creating an enabling environment for future growth in the region.
23.       RISKS. All projects in WBG face political risk. Project specific risks are also anticipated
due to: (a) the physical separation between the West Bank and Gaza and intermittent border closures; (b)
the significant variations in capacity and needs between the West Bank and Gaza, which are being
addressed through flexibility in project design, and the development of unified policies; (c) institutional
weaknesses in MEHE and MOH, which are being addressed through technical assistance from multiple
donors and international agencies as well as under this project; (d) possible lack of coordination between
PECDAR (the Borrower) and the Ministries (the implementing agencies), which would be minimized by
clarifying their respective roles and responsibilities. PECDAR, which has gained considerable experience
and expertise through ERP, would take the lead during the first 12 months of implementation to assist the
MEHE and MOH build their project management capabilities and familiarize themselves with Bank
procedures.
24.       RECOMMENDATION. I am satisfied that the proposed Trust Fund credit would comply
with the provision of the Resolutions of the Executive Directors of the IBRD and IDA (Resolution No.
93-11 and Resolution No. 93-7) establishing the TFG, and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
