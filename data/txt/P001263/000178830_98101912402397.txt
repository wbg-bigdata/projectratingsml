NAROK AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (PHASE 1)
I. BACKGROUND
A. Project Background
1.01      In December, 1977, the Government of Kenya requested that the Bank
Group and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) consider
financing an agricultural development project for Narok District. The proj-
ect proposal was prepared by the Planning Division of the Kenya Ministry of
Agriculture. It was in large part based on a series of studies of the develop-
ment potential for the Narok district, which began in 1968; CIDA has assisted
with many of these studies. The Bank Group provided assistance in preparing
a Narok District Development Plan in 1971-72; the proposed Project is also
based in part on that regional development plan.  In addition, the project
preparation team consulted extensively with provincial and district authori-
ties during project preparation. This report is based on the findings of
a joint IDA/CIDA appraisal mission in January-February, 1978, composed of
K. Marshall, J. Wijnand (IDA-Washington), R. Nelson (RMEA), N. Dyson-Hudson
(Consultant), G. Dion (CIDA), T. Body (Consultant to CIDA), J.P. Ruskowski
(Canadian High Commission, Nairobi), and S. S. Ole Surtan (Consultant to
CIDA). Messrs. N.T. Clark and A. Menkir (RMEA) also participated in the
appraisal. The principal modifications to the Government's proposal agreed
upon during the appraisal were: (a) the reduction of the Project period from
ten to five years; it was agreed that the Project would represent only the
first stage of a long term (10-20 year) development program; (b) the extension
of the Project area from five land adjudication sections, with a total area of
about 71,000 ha, to the entire Mau division of Narok District  which covers
about a third of the district's total area of about 18,500 km ; the total land
to be developed and target farm population were not materially altered, but
the broader definition of Project area should permit greater flexibility in
Project implementation; and (c) some reduction in Project scope to allow for
a more realistic implementation schedule.
B. The Agricultural Sector
General
1.02      Kenya is a country of enormous cont asts in topography, climate and
soils. In the total area of about 583,000 km , conditions range from a limited
high mountain zone in the center south to the tropical coastal strip, and from
near desert in the north to high rainfall forest in the south western high-
lands. Almost half the total area is near desert, with very limited agricul-
tural potential, while the fertile plateaus in Central Kenya include some of
the most fertile soils of Africa. Kenya has a rapidly growing population,



-2-
and considerable rural poverty. Population is estimated at 14.2 million (mid-
1978), and is growing at a rate of about 3.5% annually. About 90% of the
population is classified as rural and is mainly dependent on agriculture for
its livelihood. Kenya's GDP in current prices and at factor cost in 1977
was about K Sh 32.4 billion, or K Sh 2,260 (US$283) per capita. The average
annual per capita income of those living in rural areas is estimated at
K Sh 580 (US$70). Population densities vary widely from region to region;
there are about 150 to 200 persons per km , with holdings averaging 3 hectares,
in the highlands of the Central, Npanza and Western Provinces, with some locali-
ties as high as 500 persons per km and average holding of one hectare. In
many areas, however, densities are much lower, even in localities of high and
medium potential.  Extreme variations in population density are explained by
the fact that in most areas land is regarded as the exclusive domain of a par-
ticular tribe; in addition, the colonial heritage has influenced population
(and agricultural) patterns, as much land was alienated for large-scale expa-
triate farms or set aside as Government land. Na5ok district is an example of
an area where low population densities (10 per km ) are largely explained by
tribal heritage.
1.03      Kenya's agricultural sector is characterized by a wide variety
in systems of production which reflect the different ecological zones and
the patterns of land holding and population distribution. A broad distinc-
tion can be made between the large farming sector, including Government farms,
and the smallholder sector which employs the great majority of the rural
population. The Government defines small farms as 20 ha and below, and
there are about 1.2 million smallholdings in Kenya, of which about 50% are
less than 2 ha, and occupy less than 4% of cultivable land. Most smallhold-
ings are farmed by their owners; about 20% are considered experienced commer-
cial farmers, another 20% are in a transitional stage between subsistence and
commercial production, and the balance of some 60% are subsistence farmers.
Maize is the staple crop, but smallholders produce also beans, coffee, tea,
pyrethrum, cotton, oilseeds, livestock, milk, potatoes and fruit. Large and
medium-scale farms are those larger than 20 ha, and they occupy about 2.7
million ha (compared with 3.5 million ha occupied by small farms). There
are about 1,000 large farms with holdings in excess of 400 ha each, and
somewhat over 2,000 medium-scale farms of 20-400 ha each. Virtually all
production systems for these farms are oriented to commercial markets, pro-
ducing a wide range of crops; wheat, sisal and maize are the dominant crops,
and large ranches also occupy an important share of the total area. The pro-
posed Project would focus on medium-scale farms.
1.04      The share of the agricultural sector in total GDP declined from 40%
in 1964 to 28% in 1976 (in constant prices). This has principally resulted
from the fast expansion in other sectors, notably the manufacturing and supply
industries. Growth in agriculture as a whole remained below the 1964-73 rate
(4.5%), notwithstanding Government efforts to develop this sector; this is in
large part explained by unfavorable weather conditions since 1973. Even in
1976, which was generally a good year, difficult weather conditions in some
parts of the country had an overall depressing effect on the sector's per-
formance. The trend in agriculture's contribution to total GDP for the past
five years is as follows:

The encouraging growth of the contribution of monetary agriculture, estimated
at 19% between 1972 and 1977, was complemented by somewhat slower expansion in
non-monetary production (12.7%). At current prices, the value of marketed farm
produce rose from K Sh 1,524 million (US$191 million) in 1969 to K Sh 8,302
million (US$1,038 million) in 1977; of these amounts, the small and large farm
sectors contributed roughly equal amounts (50.7% and 49.3% of of the total
respectively). Quantitatively, over the period 1972-76, output of cereals
increased by 34% and output from industrial crops rose by about 9%. In com-
parison, production from livestock (1972-76) declined by 14%. These trends
reflect in large part good agricultural years in 1976 and 1977, and Kenya's
recovery from periods of drought and from the oil crisis. They also demon-
strate the response in cereal production to Government stimulus, principally
in increasing prices, and the tremendous impact of international demand on
Kenya's coffee and tea crops. Production of these latter crops is now expe-
riencing a considerable boost, in contrast to the stagnation of preceding
years.
1.05      Agricultural exports, always the single most important sectoral
contributor to total exports, increased to almost 60% of the total in 1976
(1975: 50%); they totalled K Sh 6,336 million (US$792 million) in 1977.
Quantitative exports of most agricultural commodities increased during the
year, but coffee prices had the dominant effect on the overall increase in the
value of exports (27% of total exports in 1976 versus 15% in 1975). Kenya's
principal agricultural exports include coffee, tea, sisal, pyrethrum, meat,
dairy products, hides and skins, cotton, wool, nuts, and animal feeds. Kenya
still imports significant quantities of agricultural products, notably wheat
and edible oils.

Livestock
1.06      The estimated total number of cattle, sheep and goats in Kenya
are: 9.7 million, 5.5 million and 6.3 million, respectively. Of these,
approximately 1.9 million cattle and 0.5 million sheep are grade animals.
Livestock development schemes have been designed to provide veterinary, up-
grading (by artificial insemination) and marketing (meat/milk) facilities,
particularly for cattle and in high potential areas. More recently, range
areas have been receiving special attention; in addition, sheep and goat
improvement centers are being developed, especially for marginal areas. To
improve livestock health further, the Department of Veterinary Services is
currently taking over direct responsibility for the construction and opera-
tion of dips throughout the country. The Government has also initiated a
national project for poultry improvement. The objectives of these policies
are to improve domestic meat/produce supplies and to develop the potential
for meat exports.
Natural Resources and Forests
2              2
1.07      Of Kenya's total land mass (583,000 Km ), 520,500 Km  is cate-
gorised as agricultural; in terms of its potential, 13% is classified as
"high", 6% as "mediux" and 81% "low". The reeainder is mainly categoriged
as forest (17,000 Km ), game parks (28,500 Km ) and townships (3,500 Km ).
With little high potential land remaining uncultivated, the growing population
is creating increasing pressure to develop lower potential areas and forests,
making action for effective resource conservation of paramount importance. To
achieve this, the Government is now emphasizing appropriate soil conservation
measures, especially in small farm areas, linked to reafforestation, long term
development planning for marginal areas, and specific schemes for ensuring the
further development of high potential land by appropriate farming systems.
Development Strategy
1.08      The Government's development objectives for agriculture have been
defined as follows: (a) to achieve self-sufficiency in agricultural products;
(b) to increase both the output and productivity of export commodities; (c) to
diversify output to spread the risks of price fluctuation; and (d) to develop,
through integrated programs, the social and physical infrastructure for both
cash and food crops, thereby raising incomes and living standards in the
poorer parts of the country. The reduction of rural-urban disparities and
general inequalities in incomes is a complementary long term objective of
the Government. The fourth Five-Year Development Plan for 1979-83 which was
recently completed places renewed emphasis on the alleviation of poverty by
offering income earning possibilities and providing for basic needs in nutri-
tion, health, education, housing, and other social services.
1.09      The Government's policy for self-sufficiency in essential food crops
is being emphasized by the Ministry of Agriculture. Notably, pricing policies
and small farm development projects since 1974 have encouraged surplus maize
production, ensuring a strategic reserve (now 180,000 tons) and developing
export capacity (1975/76: 200,000 tons, 1976/77: 250,000 tons and 1978/79;
est. 500,000 tons). In 1975, sugar and wheat were also selected for self-
sufficiency programs. In addition, in 1977 the Government decided to speed
up the drive for self-sufficiency in cotton, tobacco and edible oils.



1.10      The Government's agricultural development strategy addresses the
problems of both the large and small farm sectors; it is clear that both will
continue to play a significant role in contributing to the growth of produc-
tion for the foreseeable future. Services and projects thus aim to support
the development of and meet the needs of both sectors. The Integrated Agri-
cultural Development Programme (IADP), which is partly financed by an IDA
credit, was initiated as the main vehicle for supporting small farm develop-
ment, especially for farmers outside the cash economy. For more advanced
farmers, the Third Agricultural Credit Project is designed to assist both
small and medium scale farms and multi-owner farms may benefit from the Group
Farms Rehabilitation Project; the Bank Group also finances part of both
these projects. The Narok Agricultural Development Project aims to foster
the development of mixed farms in the middle range (20-100 ha) in a district
of high and largely unexploited potential.
C. The Sub-Sector - Wheat and Rapeseed
Wheat
1.11      Wheat and rapeseed are the two principal crops which would be pro-
*moted under the Project. Wheat is the second most important cereal crop in
Kenya after maize. It was introduced in Kenya by the early settlers soon
after the First World War and became one of the most important crops in the
large scale mixed farming areas. The production area expanded rapidly from
about 50,000 hectares in 1942 to 167,000 hectares in 1968; as production over-
took demand, it resulted in export surpluses in the late 1960's and early
1970's. In 1972 consumption once again overtook production, leading to sub-
stantial importation of wheat in the period 1972-75. In early 1975, wheat
consumer prices were increased by 25%; this led to reduced wheat flour sales,
which eliminated the need for imports in 1976. Wheat production and consump-
tion for 1968-77 are summarized below (tons):

-6-
1.12      The area under wheat reached a peak in 1968 when 167,000 hectares
were planted; from then on it gradually declined to a low of 104,000 hec-
tares in 1974. This long term decline is explained by three principal fac-
tors: (a) Fragmentation of large farms into small scale farming units with
reduced emphasis on mechanized farm enterprises; (b) Increasing lack of
capital on the remaining large farms to finance machinery necessary for
maintaining wheat production; and (c) Relatively low wheat producer prices
paid by the Wheat Board between 1969 and 1973. Largely as a result of the
increase in wheat producer prices, the wheat area increased in 1975 and the
expanding trend was maintained in 1976 and 1977. Most wheat in Kenya is
produced on medium to large scale farms; more than 90% of all wheat is pro-
duced on farms larger than 20 hectares.  It is grown principally in the
highlands in Uasin Gishu, Nakuru and Narok districts. The high potential
areas are Rongai, Timau and Mau Narok.
1.13      At present three significant national wheat promotion projects are
underway: the Third Agricultural Credit Project (Credit 692-KE/Loan 1390T-KE),
the Group Farms Rehabilitation Project (Credit 537-KE/Loan 1093-KE), and the
Wheat Board Scheme in Narok District. The Third Agricultural Credit Project
aims at supporting both small and large commercial farms in 31 districts by
supplying seasonal and medium term credit through the Agricultural Finance
Corporation. The incremental wheat output from that project is estimated at
11,000 tons by 1979-80. The Group Farms Rehabilitation Project was initiated
in 1975 and included an important wheat promoting component. Wheat production
on project-supported farms is expected to i--re-se by almost 10,000 tons at
project maturity. The credit scheme operated by the Wheat Board in Narok
District is projected to include approximately 2,000 ha of incremental wheat
land in 1977-78.
1.14      National wheat production (net-actual deliveries to Wheat Board
stores) is projected to increase only marginally from 175,000 tons in 1977
to 178,000 tons by 1980. The projected increase is expected to result prin-
cipally from the Third Credit Project and the Group Farms Rehabilitation
Project. Wheat hectarage in other areas is expected to decrease by 4% per
annum (average) as a result of further land fragmentation, which will be only
partly offset by increasing yields per hectare. Projected wheat production
for Kenya is summarized below:

1.15      Marketing.  The Wheat Board of Kenya (para. 1.28) has responsibility
for internal buying and selling, distribution and storage (including mainte-
nance of a strategic national reserve), and importing and exporting of wheat
grain and wheat products. The Wheat Board has appointed the Kenya Farmers
Association (KFA) as its sole agents for wheat grain purchase and transporta-
tion within Kenya. Thus, KFA handles internal wheat marketing throughout
Kenya, purchasing wheat directly from farmers. Transportation from farms to
railhead or Wheat Board stores is undertaken by farmers, contractors, and KFA,
the cost being paid by the producer. The Wheat Board owns or rents stores in
all major wheat producing areas and at milling centers like Nairobi, Nakuru
and Eldoret. Total storage capacity is about 150,000 tons of which approxi-
mately 30% consists of bulk stores. The wheat mills hold storage capacity
equivalent to six months milling capacity.
1.16      Processing.  The wheat milling industry currently comprises four
major milling companies. The total national wheat milling capacity is about
230,000 tons per annum, which is sufficient to satisfy projected annual demand
for wheat flour up to 1980. About 90% of all whole wheat processed is milled
into white flour; the remaining 10% is made up by various types of whole wheat
flours. Wheat f'lours for commercial use make up about 75% of total flour
production. Bread is the most important wheat product, followed by biscuits,
scones and pastry products. The baking industry is dominated by one large
company, which has over 50% of the market. This company's sales increased by
173% during the period 1965/66-1975/76. Bread sales have been increasing most
rapidly in rural areas, and rural sales represent over 50% of total bread sales.
1.17      Prices.  Wheat prices are authorized by the Government Price Con-
troller and wheat is one of the agricultural products subject to a statutory
annual price review. This review normally begins by September with an analy-
sis of relevant factors at a technical level. Proposals are submitted to the
Ministers and they normally make price decisions in December (in principle in
time to affect planting decisions). Wheat prices have been fixed at a rela-
tively low level, but, following an increase in the wheat price in September,
1976 and subsequent price adjustments, current wheat prices are roughly in
line with import parity levels.
Rapeseed
1.18      Production of oilseeds is confined mainly to the Rift Valley, Nyanza
and Western Provinces. The most important crops are sunflower, groundnuts,
castor oil seed and sim sim (sesame seed). Cultivation of rapeseed in Kenya
is increasing because of the present favorable returns. The area planted in
1975/76 was estimated at 1,800 ha. As many areas of Kenya are suited to oil
crop production, which is also an attractive cash crop, the Government has
formulated a policy aimed at promoting oil crop production at least to a level
of self-sufficiency. The strategy to achieve this includes:
(a) provision of seasonal credit for participating farmers
(through the IADP and the Third Agricultural Credit Project);
(b) assuring supplies of certified seeds and other inputs;
(c) provision of extension advice and training for farmers
in the main districts designated for production of each
type of oil crop;



- 8 -
(d)  provision of assured markets for farmers at planting
time at assured prices either direct by processors or
through the Maize and Produce Board, cooperatives and the
Kenya Farmers Association (KFA); and
(e)  regular review of producer prices to keep these in line
with world prices and import tariff adjustments to
prevent over supplies.
1.19      The present market for edible oils in Kenya is about 48,000 tons per
annum which is met by internal production (and processing) of 15,000 tons and
importation of about 33,000 tons. Until the recent development of processing
plants in Kenya, edible oil demand was met by importation and most locally
produced oil seed was exported. At present, however, available processing
capacity has increased, and some supplies of oilseeds have been imported from
neighboring countries for local processing or re-exportation (1,000 tons in
1976).   Current annual processing capacity in Kenya is about 75,000 tons
(divided among about 12 significant companies). Demand for edible oils and
fat has increased significantly in recent years but this has not been followed
by a significant rise in local production and as a result the shortfall has
had to be met by increased imports.
1.20      Prices for rapeseed are not regulated by the Government at present.
They are normally contracted ex-farmgate between growers and processors.
Buyers and processors normally collect rapeseed from farm stores. Average
oilseed prices increased by 115% between 1971/72 and 1977/78. In April 1975,
oilseed prices in some cases declined (castor seed, sunflower seed) but a
general price increase was again effected in 1976/77. Buying prices for
sunflower seeds have more than doubled and for castor and groundnuts prices
have nearly doubled. These price trends have encouraged farmers to increase
production of oil crops during the last two years, a trend which is now being
accelerated under the IADP, which aims to strengthen extension services, pro-
vide farm inputs and credit and improve infrastructure. Local oil processors
are also increasing their support to small scale oilseed growers in areas
like Western Province, Coast Province and Machakos District.
1.21      Rapeseed production is specifically promoted through the Third
Agricultural Credit Project which was initiated in 1977. This project sup-
ports production of rapeseed and sunflower on medium scale farms. Some
6,000 ha of rapeseed and 2,000 ha of sunflower are expected to be grown on
land to be brought into cultivation. Incremental production from 1978/79
is projected to reach 10,600 tons of oilseed yielding over 2,500 tons of
high quality edible oil.
D. Government Services
1.22      Government services to agriculture are delivered through five
ministries and 15 statutory production boards. The Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) has the primary responsibility for agricultural development and farmer



- 9 -
services. The Ministry of Cooperative Development (MCD) supervises coopera-
tive organizations and provides them with management advice. The Ministry
of Lands and Settlement is responsible for land adjudication, legal division
and consolidation of all farm land. The Ministry of Works and the Ministry
of Water Development provide and supervise crop extraction roads and rural
water supplies, respectively. The statutory boards involved in agriculture
are either general, as the Maize and Produce Board, which trades in most food
crops, or crop-specific, e.g. the Wheat Board. The initiation and implemen-
tation of development projects are being decentralized through the increased
use of the District Development Committees which approve and monitor devel-
opment projects at the district level.
1.23      The Ministry of Agriculture comprises three departments:  the
Department of Agriculture, the Department of Veterinary Services, and the
Administrative Services Department, which includes the Development Planning
Division. Chiefs are directly responsible to the Permanent Secretary. The
Department of Agriculture is responsible for implementing policy and promot-
*ing agricultural production throughout Kenya. The Department of Veterinary
Services concentrates on the provision of health and breeding facilities
for livestock. The Development Planning Division is a supporting organiza-
tion for the technical divisions; it is responsible for all economic and
development planning matters related to agriculture. The Department of
Agriculture includes eight technical divisions; each division head is re-
sponsible to the Director of Agriculture for the specific aspects of agri-
culture for which the division is concerned. The eight divisions are:
(i) Industrial Crops Production, (ii) Food Crop Production, (iii) Horticul-
tural Crop Production, (iv) Animal Production, (v) Range Management, (vi)
Livestock Marketing, (vii) Land and Farm Management, and (viii) Scientific
Research. A Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) was appointed in April
1976 to be responsible for planning and organization of extension services and
training. He liaises directly with the Provincial Directors of Agriculture
(PDA's), who have principal responsibility for extension services in their
area of jurisdiction.
1.24      Agricultural Extension Services.  Agricultural extension work in-
volves most of the Ministry's technical divisions. Ministry headquarters is
responsible for overall policy decisions and administration, but field opera-
tions are directed from a provincial level and are organized and coordinated
on a district basis, under the District Agricultural Officer (DAO). Within
limits set by Government policy, provincial extension services have a high
degree of autonomy. The Land and Farm Management Division is supposed to act
as a coordinator of extension efforts. Most extension staff have in the past
specialized in crop production. However, services were reorganized in 1976
and extension agents at farmer level now act as generalists; the emphasis is
on improved management of the farm as a whole. Current extension staff number
about 11,000 for Kenya; the average number of holdings per crop extension
officer is about 230. The principal problems of extension services in the
past have been poor communications, (notably transport), an unbalanced mix
of specialist skills, lack of in-service training, and limited continuity due
to frequent transfers of personnel. The recent reorganization of extension
services and several on-going development projects aim to address these prob-
lems and to make extension services a more effective vehicle for providing



- 10 -
support and supervision for farmers. Specifically, the Government aims to
increase extension coverage in key development areas, to provide better
transportation and allowances and to improve housing facilities in remote
areas for extension officers, to provide more information to farmers in
support of extension work, and to strengthen in-service training programs
for extension staff.
1.25      Staff Training is provided by a network of colleges and training
institutions. Senior agricultural staff are now mainly trained to university
degree level at the University of Nairobi. Intermediate level staff are
trained to diploma standard at the Egerton College, while junior staff obtain
their training (to certificate level) either at Embu or Bukura Institutes of
Agriculture. In 1972 MOA initiated a training scheme designed to update the
training of all extension officers, particularly in the technological aspects
of crop and animal production. In 1969 the Ministry created the Land and
Farm Mlanagement Division which has emphasized improvement of farm management
standards. Assisted by the Fourth Education Project (IDA), the MOA now in-
tends to expand the Faculty of Agriculture (to 180 BSc. per year) and Bukura
and Embu Institutes of Agriculture (to 350 diplomates each per year). The
numbers of trained staff for agricultural services is still far from adequate,
and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future; however, several active
programs are underway to expand the capacity of training institutions and to
make their programs more effective in support of national development efforts.
1.26      Farmer Training Centers (FTC's).  FTC's are designed to introduce
farmers to modern agriculture techniques through short residential courses;
FTC's also offer in-service training for extension staff. There are two
large-scale FTC's at Eldoret and Nyahururu, which concentrate on training
farmers, managers, and extension staff for large farms, and 31 smaller FTC's,
18 of which are operated directly by the Ministry of Agriculture and 13 by
the National Christian Council of Kenya. The Government hopes to establish
FTC's in each of Kenya's 42 districts. Capacity of FTC's ranges from 35-100
people per course. Each FTC has, in addition to farm employees, about eight
teaching and administrative staff. Each has a demonstration farm of 25-1,000
hectares to assist'with training courses. FTC's also work through model
farms and demonstration plots in their district. FTC's each offer 30-50
courses annually, reaching a maximum of about 5,000 farmers and extension
staff. In-service training for extension workers is provided on a regular
basis to update knowledge of animal and crop extension and farm management;
courses are normally two months long and are held at FTC's.
1.27      Agricultural research is the responsibility of a specific division
of MOA and is mainly conducted at 24 research stations situated throughout the
country and generally reflecting priority production of the area concerned.
Past research has emphasized crop production, e.g. the development of hybrid
maize varieties and adaptation of wheat varieties at the National Plant Breed-
ing Station, Njoro, and has thus played a significant role in increasing food
production since Independence.



- 11 -
1.28      The Wheat Board of Kenya (WBK) plays an important role in wheat
production, particularly in Narok District (para 1.15). A statutory board
established in 1952, the Board is principally concerned with wheat marketing
and with provision of general advice to the wheat industry. The Board's
headquarters are in Nairobi, but most operations are based in Nakuru, which
is strategic to the main wheat producing areas. The Wheat Board works closely
with the Ministry of Agriculture's extension staff, the research station at
Njoro on wheat research, and the Kenya Farmers Association (KFA), which acts
as the WBK's agent for domestic wheat marketing. Since 1974 the WBK has
organized a wheat promotion project for Narok District (para. 2.18).
E. Agricultural Credit
1.29      Agricultural credit in Kenya is available through a number of in-
stitutions in the organized credit market and individuals operating in an
informal market. Five types of credit institutions can be distinguished:
(a) commercial banks which provide working capital and development credit
channelled largely to medium or large-scale farmers; (b) the Agricultural
Finance Corporation (AFC) which gives loans to large as well as small-scale
farmers; (c) cooperative banks which provide development and seasonal loans
to their members; (d) parastatal organizations such as crop or produce boards
which provide seasonal loans or medium term loans mainly for the development
of cash crops; and (e) other credit institutions which provide suppliers
credit through institutions such as the Kenya Farmers' Association and the
Kenya Breweries. The Central Bank of Kenya controls the banking system which
includes a large commercial banking sector, and two principal parastatal
organizations: the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) and the Cooperative
Bank of Kenya, both of which are also operated on commercial lines. The
Central Bank sets the prime interest rate (currently 8% per annum) and the
minimum interest rates and volume of credit with which commercial banks can
lend for specific purposes. Of the total estimated credit of K Sh 820 million
available for agricultural production in 1975/76, over 50% was supplied by
commercial banks and nearly 10% by input suppliers mainly for large farm
operations. Approximately 20% each was supplied by AFC and the Cooperative
Bank of Kenya, the latter principally to small farmers. These credit funds
represent loans to 180,000 farm businesses or approximately 15% of the total
farms in Kenya.
1.30      Commercial banking is dominated by three large institutions:  The
Kenya Commercial Bank, the Barclays Bank Kenya (Ltd), and the Standard Bank
Ltd. These banks provide broad coverage through a network of branch offices
in important towns. The bulk of commercial bank lending to agriculture is
channelled to large-scale farms and farming companies, and to corporations
engaged in agro-industrial activities. Commercial banks also handle, however,
an estimated 10-12,000 loans to medium and small-scale farmers; small-scale
loans are normally short-term and are largely for on-farm developments rather
than working capital. Normally these loans take the form of a line of credit;
banks seldom perform analysis of farm development proposals and there is
virtually no follow-up of farm developments. The principal constraints to
increased commercial bank lending for small and medium size farms are the



- 12 -
high cost of making small loans and the lack of dependable farm management
services. At the end of 1975, total direct commercial bank lending to private
agriculture was K Sh 737 million, equivalent to about 16% of total advances
and 13% of deposits. An additional K Sh 184 million was outstanding to statu-
tory organizations dealing in agricultural produce and promoting agricultural
development.
1.31      The Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) (Chart 2) was established
in 1963 as a statutory board to assist in agricultural development by making
loans to individual farmers, cooperative societies, and companies. AFC is
the primary agricultural credit institution in Kenya and it is the only lender
serving the farm sector through a variety of lending programs for large and
small farms. It is the Government's policy to expand loan activities through
AFC particularly to more progressive small farmers, in addition to its service
to larger farmers. AFC is governed by a Board of Directors chaired by the
Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning. The Ministers of
Finance and Planning and of Agriculture jointly appoint the General Manager,
who is the chief executive of AFC, responsible for all day-to-day operations.
AFC headquarters are in Nairobi; the network of 33 branch offices, grouped
in five areas, provides broad coverage of Kenya's principal agricultural
districts. AFC staff numbered about 390 in 1977; about 45% are in head
office. AFC draws most of its senior staff from the civil service, direct
from universities and to a limited extent from the private sector. AFC has
to date attracted relatively high caliber staff but faces difficulties in
competing for staff with other parastatals and the private sector. AFC
operates large and small scale lending programs, which have been financed
by the Treasury, and by bilateral and multi-lateral sources. In 1975/76,
about K Sh 310 million, or 75% of outstanding loans were for the large-
scale sector and K Sh 102 million, or 25% for the small-scale sector. The
principal large-scale lending programs are land purchase and development
loans, a German-funded program for farm development, the Group Farms Rehabili-
tation Project, aimed at assisting run-down, group-owned coffee estates and
mixed farms, and ranch loans; about 40% of disbursements are for land purchase
and development loans, and 24% for ranch loans. Small-scale lending programs
include smallholder credits (largely assisted by IDA Lines of credit); a
German smallholder credit scheme for Kisii and Kericho districts, and a small
scheme financed by AFC itself. AFC also finances seasonal credit, largely
through the Guaranteed Minimum Return (GMR) scheme (para. 1.32), and through
the USAID-funded smallholder production, services and credit project. AFC
lends almost invariably against security, normally the title deed to a farmers'
land; exceptions are for ranch loans where chattel mortgages are taken, and
machinery loans, where machinery is taken as security. Repayment periods vary
from one year for seasonal credit, three to five years for medium-term loans,
ten years for ranching loans, to 20 years for land purchase loans. Interest
rates are currently 9-11% a year. AFC staff provide considerable direct
assistance to farmers both in preparation of loan applications and farm plans,
and in loan supervision; AFC itself work closely with agricultural extension
services in credit activities. Loans are normally approved by a District
Loans Advisory Committee, then by the branch manager (up to K Sh 20,000), or



- 13 -
by the general manager (up to K Sh 100,000). AFC's financial position is
generally satisfactory, and the arrears position for small-scale loans has
improved considerably over the last two years. AFC's total financial re-
sources as of March 31, 1977 were K Sh 492 million (US$61.5 million); a total
of K Sh 458 million was outstanding on loans to farmers.
1.32      GMR Scheme.  The GMR scheme provides crop insurance to growers of
maize and/or wheat with a minimum of 6 hectares under either crop. GMR was
introduced in 1942 as a war-time measure to encourage large-scale crop produc-
tion, and until 1966 it applied only to plots of at least 40 hectares under
specified crops. The program has gradually been reduced in scope for crops
covered, but has been expanded by lowering the minimum holding size eligible
for participation. Under GMR, the Government (through AFC), approves planting
of a certain acreage; this planting order entitles the farmer to compensation
in case of crop failure; the security provided by GMR creates the basis for
seasonal credit in the form of advances on GMR. GMR has been funded by the
Cereals and Sugar Finance Corporation and the sale of promissory notes by the
Central Bank.   AFC acts as agent for the Government for the disbursement and
collection of GMR. GMR provides crop insurance and seasonal credit up to a
maximum of K Sh 1,250 per hectare; interest is charged at 10% a year. The GMR
program has substantial arrears and operates inefficiently; AFC plans to phase
it out gradually over the next few years, replacing it with a direct AFC
seasonal credit program.
1.33      The Cooperative Bank was established in 1968 to provide medium and
seasonal finance to co-operative societies and to act as an outlet for socie-
ties' funds and members' savings. It does not deal with individuals but lends
to unions or societies who make loans to their members. The major lending
system of the Cooperative Bank is the Cooperative Production Credit Scheme
(CPCS) through which approximately 240,000 loans have been made since 1970.
It is Government policy to emphasize small farm loans through the Cooperative
Bank loan and savings schemes and through the IADP. This program is concen-
trated on developing systems for assisting less experienced small farmers.
Crop and produce boards provide seasonal credit and some medium term loans for
specific crops. The Wheat Board, for example, finances wheat production, and
in 1976/77, financed 722 growers, for a total amount of about K Sh 37 million;
funds for these programs are normally lines of credit from commercial banks.
The KFA provides credit to farmers through its payment terms, which are 60 to
90 days for members; since KFA markets wheat, they often serve as collection
agents for the Wheat Board. The Kenya Breweries extends seasonal credit for
barley production and is considering a program of tractor loans for barley
growers.
F. Commercial Services
1.34      Agricultural Inputs.  Most agricultural inputs are obtained by
farmers through several commercial organizations. Of these the Kenya Farmers
Association (Cooperative) Ltd. (KFA) is the largest, with 33 branches and



- 14 -
2,212 stockists throughout the country. In addition, the Kenya National
Federation of Cooperatives (KNFC) initiated a merchandising organization in
1975 to complement and expand the national coverage of input supplies to
farmers. In 1975 Government assumed responsibility for importing and dis-
tributing fertilizers to existing retail outlets; it also introduced uniform
fertilizer prices to farmers throughout the country. The Government plans
to develop a local fertilizer plant to satisfy local demand.
1.35      National seed requirements are mainly supplied by the Kenya Seed
Company (KSC), in which Government is a major shareholder. Spray chemicals
required for crop production are supplied by several commercial companies
through existing retail outlets (mainly KFA). Building materials and other
items required by the agricultural sector are generally manufactured in Kenya,
and are available through KFA and other suppliers. A range of farm machinery
is imported, assembled or manufactured by a variety of commercial companies
and retailed through outlets in strategic centers. However, supplies of
large machines, especially combine harvesters, have become limited due to
price escalation and restricted credit availability.
II. NAROK DISTRICT AND THE PROJECT AREA
A. Location and Physical Resources
2.01      Narok District, which is part of the Rift Valley Province, is
located in southwest Kenya, surrounded by Kajiado District in the east, Nakuru
and Kericho Districts in the northeast, north and north-west, Kisii and South
Nyanza Districts in the west and Tanzania in the south. The District covers
18,500 Km or about 3% of Kenya (see map 2). The district headquarters are
located at Narok town. There are at present three administrative divisions:
Mau, Kilgoris, and Osupuko (Loita plains), and a District officer is appointed
to each; the Government is considering dividing the Mau division into two in
the near future. There are 16 locations (administrative sub-divisions), each
headed by a chief who is appointed by the Government. The Project area, for
the first phase project, is defined as the current Mau Division of Narok
District. It is expected that the entire district will be included in future
development programs; in particular, the Kilgoris area and possibly the Loita
Hills offer excellent promise for mixed farming development.
2.02      Narok District has a complex ecology, with wide variation in topo-
graphy, soils, and climate; in fact, four of Kenya's major ecological cate-
gories are found in the district. The district is dominated by vast plains
in the center and south; these lie at 1,500-2,100 meters. They have tradi-
tionally been used for cattle grazing, and wildlife still occupy much of the
area, notably the Masai Mara game reserve. However, there are also three
higher altitude areas with higher rainfall and good soils; these are the Mau
area north and west of Narok Town, rising to about 3,000 meters, the Loita



- 15 -
Hills in the south-east, which rise to 2,670 m, and the Kilgoris region in
the west of the district. These three zones are considered as high potential
areas for agricultural development.
2.03      Climate:  Rainfall data is available for parts of the district,
notably for Narok Town, but detailed information on the higher altitude areas
of the Mau Division is limited. Mean annual rainfall varies from about 1,700
mm in the northeastern part of the Mau to 450 mm in the southeastern part of
the district. Rainfall varies considerably from year to year, with occasional
serious droughts; in one out of 10 years, rainfall is equal to or less than
about 1,400 mm in the northeastern part of the Mau and 250 mm in the south-
eastern part of the district.  The monthly and annual rainfall data demon-
strate a high variability and in many parts of the district the rain usually
comes in heavy showers.  With the exception of the high altitude areas in Mau
and Masai Siria (Kilgoris), the district has a one season rainfall pattern
with 85% being received from November to May.  Three major climatic zones are
represented in the Mau area (going from south to north): a semi arid zone, a
subhumid zone and a humid zone.  The Kilgoris area is characterized as subhumid.
2.04      Soils:  Most soils in Narok District are deep and well developed.
They have clay to clay loam textures, dark greyish brown to black colors, a
rather organic matter rich topsoil with a friable, crumbly structure. In
general, these soils have no surface sealing, rather rapid infiltration rate
and low susceptibility to soil erosion. However, on the steep slopes gully
erosion activity can be found with evident landslide hazard if the land is
left bare. Generally, the soils in the Mau area are derived from volcanic ash
and tuffs. They have medium to medium high organic matter content which may
extend to a depth of 70 cm or more. The copper extraction values are gener-
ally low and copper deficiencies may exist. The potential exists for four
types of erosion in the Mau area - sheet erosion, gully erosion, wind erosion
and landslides. Sheet erosion is no serious hazard, not even on rather steep
slopes, because of the high permeability and stability of the topsoil. On
steep slopes, gully erosion may set in because of the lower stability of the
topsoil and the absence of proper land preparation techniques, i.e. contour
ploughing. Wind erosion is only a problem in the lower altitude areas outside
the priority areas (south of the Narok-Kijabe road). In these areas, wind
erosion is a result of overgrazing combined with low rainfall and high eva-
poration rates. Landslides are apparent in the form of minor scarps, 10-50 m
long and 1-4 m high. However, these landslides largely occurred prior to
crop cultivation, as exemplified by sites where slided land still contains
stumps of trees.
B. Population and Land Tenure Systems
2.05      No reliable, up-to-date demographic data are available for Narok;
population estimates must be extrapolated from the 1969 Census (which is
considered an undercount) or from estimates of local officials. Extrapolating
from the census, a conservative estimate of 1978 population would be 213,000;



- 16 -
District officials put the figures at closer to 270,000, based on recent
surveys by location. Roughly 40% of the population is found in the high
potential areas of the District (15% in the Mau area, 24% in Kilgoris) and
the remaining 60% in the lower potential 2area of the central plains.  With
a total district area ol about 18,513 km , overall district population den-
sity is about 12 2er km (1969), and population/arable land rati2 is about
25 persons per km (1969). Densities range from 2 person per km to 26 per-
2
sons per km in different parts of Narok. The range of household size is
considerable: from one to 24 persons. Most households (70%) fall between
4 and 10 persons in size, with major clustering at 4-person households (15%)
and 6-person households (20%); average household size is 5 to 6 persons. About
30% of the adult males are family heads (which is consistent with late age
at first marriage). There is an even chance that a household will contain
more than one wife; that it will contain the parent (usually the mother) of
the household head; that it will also include a distant relative or unrelated
person. Two or three children per household is common, but the possibility
of a household containing grandchildren varies widely. All of these features
are consistent with different time stages of a simple domestic development
model well established for pastoral societies: adults marry (later for men,
sooner for women) rather than remain single; where their wealth will support
it, men establish multi-family groups by polygamy; where possible they keep
these groups together as herding labor pools, in extended family settlements
containing grown sons and their wives and children; and when the extended
family head dies and his inherited herds are dispersed, mothers find shelter
with their sons. The mean age at first marriage is 27 for men and almost 19
for women; overall, there is a 50-50 chance that a household head will even-
tually have an additional wife; the peak of fertility in women comes at about
age 29; and there is an average expectation of 5.56 children per woman, but a
26% chance of any infant dying before it is 2 years old. There are roughly
35 to 40,000 households in Narok District at present; almost a third are
headed by women.
2.06      Masai are the dominant ethnic group in Narok district.  In areas
bordering the district boundary and in rural centers, the population is less
homogenous. In Kilgoris, people from Kisii are represented and in the Mau
area Kikuyu people share the land with the Masai along the escarpment. Over
the years, the distinct features of each ethnic group have become less notice-
able as a result of intermarriage and adoption of Masai customs by many immi-
grants.
2.07      The land tenure situation in Narok District is quite complex, and
is in a state of transition; at present, several types of land tenure co-exist.
Formal land adjudication, leading to issue of title deeds to land, began in
the early 1960's in Narok District, but in practice it did not get underway



- 17 -
until 1967. The first land adjudication section was finalized in 1970 1/;
to date, registration has been completed in only about 30% of the District.
Elsewhere, land adjudication is in progress and it will take at least five
more years to complete; formal adjudication has not begun in about 45% of the
District. Map 3 summarizes the current status of registration. In areas
where adjudication has not been completed, traditional land rights continue
in force; this involves, in simplified terms, communal rights (extended family
or clan) to grazing land and individual or family rights to cultivated areas.
The introduction of large scale wheat and barley production in the Mau area
has led to a tenure system where landowners lease land to non-resident tenants
for farming. Leases are normally for short duration (one year) and must in
theory be approved by the County Council. Tenants have cleared and farmed
land, in many cases employing contractors for land development, preparation
and harvesting. Also in Mau Division, considerable areas have been allocated
on an individual basis to small farmers, most from outside the District.
These farmers have gained acceptance in the area, and normally have farms in
the range of one to five hectares. Most produce maize, potatoes, charcoal,
and other traditional smallholder crops.
2.08      For Narok, the Government has to date encouraged the group regis-
tration of lands, largely on the assumption that this reflected traditional
land tenure practices. Most of the lower altitude grazing areas are being
registered as group ranches, with the members incorporated. Registration in
arable areas has also been largely on a group basis; most groups represent
extended families but many involve even larger groupings in some areas.
However, as wheat production, in particular, has developed, there has been
a strong tendency to subdivide group holdings, and this has been accepted
in principle by the Government. The Government considers in general that
the adjudication process is the responsibility of the population concerned,
and does not intervene except to provide legal and technical assistance
and to settle complex disputes. Thus, the Government's ability to influence
size of holdings and other patterns of land allocation in areas such as Narok
is quite limited. Two tendencies have been marked in land adjudication in
the key wheat areas of Mau Division: the first that certain individuals and
families have obtained title to extensive land holdings, and have multiple
plots registered in their name; the second is the increasing desire of farmers
to subdivide group holdings. These factors make it difficult to determine
accurately average farm size; however, analysis of land adjudication regis-
ters in two land adjudication sections where wheat production is important
indicated that 40% of families recorded holdings below 20 hectares, 55% had
between 20 hectares and 50 hectares, and 5% had holdings above 50 hectares.
1/   The Ministry of Lands and Settlement is responsible for land adjudica-
tion, and acts through a District Land Adjudication Officer. The ad-
judication process involves the designation and declaration of sections
for adjudication, registration of land ownership claims by a committee
representing the local population, formal surveying and mapping of these
claims, an appeal and arbitration stage, culminated by final approval
by the Minister of Lands and Settlement and issue of title deeds to
registered owners.



- 18 -
Adjusting for multiple plot ownership and de facto or legal subdivision,
an estimated 30% of holdings are below 20 hectares, 55% are from 20 to
50 hectares (with the mode falling at 30 hectares), 10% are from 50 to
100 hectares, and 5% are above 100 hectares. Thus, although there is a
coiisiderable range in farm size, a substantial proportion of holdings are
between 20 and 50 hectares.
C. Agricultural and Livestock Production and Forests
Crop Production
2.09      The areas most suitable for crop production in Narok District -
based on soil suitability and rainfall considerations - are located in the
Mau area, where cultivation has been rapidly expanding during the last ten
years, the Kilgoris area in Masai Siria and (possibly) the Loita Hills in the
south. The major crops in the district are wheat, barley, maize and potatoes.
Wheat and barley are mainly grown in the upper part of the Mau area, while
maize and potatoes, being primarily subsistence crops, are produced in the
more densely populated areas along the Narok - Enangeperi road, in Kilgoris
and in the northern part of Mau escarpment. In the latter area, some potato
production is also geared to commercial marketing outside the district. The
estimated crop hectarage in the district is 43,000 hectares (1976/77), as
follows (ha):
Wheat         Barley         Rapeseed       Small scale Crops 1/
24,000         10,500            800              7,700
1/   Includes maize, potatoes, pyrethrum, vegetables, beans, millet
and sunflower.
Wheat yields in Narok District vary from 1,500 to 3,400 kg per hectare depend-
ing on climatic conditions and the level of crop husbandry.  Barley yields
are less widely distributed ranging between 1,800 and 2,700 kg per hectare.
Maize yields average 3,000 kg/ha while potato yields, with good husbandry
standards, easily reach 8,500 kg/ha.
2.10      Wheat production in Narok District has developed rapidly during the
last ten years. Area under wheat has increased from about 12,000 hectares in
1974-75 to about 29,000 hectares in 1977-78, and production from 21,000 tons
to an estimated 40,000 tons in the same period. Most wheat production is
currently concentrated in the highlands of the Mau Division, north and north-
west of Narok town; some efforts have been made to begin wheat production
in Kigoris, but these have not been successful largely because poor communi-
cations impede delivery of inputs and marketing of wheat. Substantial areas
have also been cultivated with wheat in lower lying areas west of Narok town
(Olololunga) in recent years. In the Mau area, wheat is grown largely on
ridges, where land has been cleared; an estimated 80-90% of wheat is at



- 19 -
present produced by tenant farmers, most of whom live outside the district
and operate through contractors (hence their designation as "telephone
farmers"). Recent soil surveys and aerial mapping suggest that additional
land available for cultivation in the Mau area is limited (perhaps 7%);
elsewhere, slopes are generally too steep for mechanical cultivation without
severe risk of soil erosion. Therefore, most increased production will in the
future be tied to increasing yields in existing wheat areas, with some limited
expansion into suitable new land. Improvement of roads in the key wheat areas
also should assist in increasing production by facilitating access to farms
and marketing of wheat. Rapeseed cultivation is relatively new in Narok
District, but gives good promise of expansion because of favorable returns.
Barley production has expanded rapidly, with the promotional efforts of the
Kenya Breweries; in 1978-79, an estimated 10,200 hectares were under barley
in Mau Division grown by about 900 farmers; this represented about 30% of
national barley hectarage.
2.11      Livestock.  The major part of Narok District receives less than
700 mm rainfall annually, making it more suitable for livestock than for
crop production. Current livestock production is concentrated in areas with
low rainfall but it also dominates in some higher potential areas like the
Loita Hills and the Kilgoris area. The majority of the Masai population in
Narok District depend on livestock for their livelihood. Animals are herded
in the traditional way but group ranches, directed towards commercial cattle
production, are gradually being established in the areas south and west of
Narok and in the Kilgoris area along Soit Ololol escarpment. Commercial
dairy production caters for the Narok township population only. Livestock
migration between lower and higher altitude areas following rainfall patterns,
which was a common practice in the past, is now more restricted as a result
of the expanding crop hectarage in the higher altitude areas.
2.12      Most farmers in the Project area own cattle, sheep and goats and
graze them on non-arable land, stubbles, fallow, and land that is being
spelled. Livestock are important to the owners but are secondary to crop
production. Grazing is uncontrolled and anyone can graze anywhere with
anything, except on grain crops. The area is quite seriously overstocked
and production per head is low. Livestock enterprises are not commercially
oriented and are used for subsistence purposes (milk) and as a source of cash
when required. There is no systematic production of say 10-month old lambs.
Cattle are almost entirely East African Zebu type and because of overstocking
and therefore under nutrition their condition is relatively poor; they are
mainly run to produce milk for local consumption.  Disease does not appear
to be a major problem, with the exception of internal parasites. Sheep are
mixed blood, mainly Corriedale upgraded from Red Masai sheep, with some
Hampshire and Romney Marsh sheep now being used. The existing sheep probably
contain less than one quarter Red Masai blood. Genetically the sheep are
probably well suited to the environment and the Masai appreciate that Red
Masai sheep are poorly adapted to the environment. The existing upgraded
sheep are favored relative to cattle and goats in the Project area. Sheep
are not milked but are used for meat production with wool a minor product.
Oestrus occurs throughout the year so it is physically possible to lamb



- 20 -
at any time, although traditionally the Masai encumber rams with a leather
apron to prevent mating and thus confine lambing to the long rain season.
The main sheep diseases appear to be internal parasites (liver fluke and
intestinal roundworms, particularly Haemonchus). Lice and Keds are said
to occur; ticks are not a serious problem. Foot diseases are also a problem.
All of these diseases and pests are difficult to control under the present
free communal grazing system that allows reinfestation. Clostridial diseases
probably also occur and despite reports to the contrary caprine pleuro
pneumonia may be a problem. Goats are less important in the Project area
as the environment is more suitable for sheep. Bushy gullies are an exception,
and some goats to utilize these areas and provide milk would be beneficial.
2.13      The principal constraints to increased animal production are:
(a) under-nutrition, due to overstocking and lack of productive pasture;
(b) disease effects, particularly internal parasites; (c) social factors that
result in livestock being considered non commercial subsistence enterprises;
and (d) the limited genetic milking ability in cattle. With the allocation of
land to individuals or family units it is probable that the grazing system
will slowly change and that each person will mainly graze his own land, with
communal grazing restricted to forest and other unallocated land. When this
happens the possibility for successful development of the livestock industry
will be enhanced. It is likely then that pasture development will be used to
increase animal productivity; the Project area has excellent potential for
high quality temperate pastures. The area of pasture will be restricted
because cash cropping will probably remain more profitable but there will be
small areas (say 10%) of arable land on each farm that could be placed under
pasture, including areas that have become heavily infested with weeds or have
been overcropped resulting in reduced yields. There is also potential for
aerial sowing the non-arable areas. The basic technology for establishing
these pastures is known, but will need adaptation to the environment; tem-
perate cultivars of Alfalfa, white clover, Kenya white clover, red clover,
perennial ryegrass, cocksfoot and tall fescue offer good promise. With the
change in grazing management and the enhanced nutritional status of livestock,
production systems will probably alter. The predominant livestock enterprise
is likely to be prime lamb production based on the existing upgraded sheep,
lambing three times in two years and producing six-month old lambs for the
Kenyan market. Cattle production is likely to be limited to either a few
upgraded dairy type cows for local consumption or to fattening steers bred
in the lower breeding areas. Management techniques will become more sophis-
ticated and infrastructure will be required for dips, footbaths, handling
and marketing facilities.
2.14      At present, livestock extension work for the District should focus
on promoting the long-term development of livestock as part of an integrated
farming system. Pasture improvement trials should be carried out to evaluate
the potential for improved pasture. Species, fertilizer and establishment
methods need evaluating on both arable and non-arable lands. Livestock exten-
sion services (including veterinary) should be strengthened with emphasis on
field contact between MOA staff and livestock owners. Extension workers
should assist the commercialization of livestock production and give advice



- 21 -
on grazing management, stocking rates, livestock nutrition, disease prevention
and treatment, increasing turnoff rate, etc. The need for and the value of
this extension will increase as farmers gain control of grazing on individual
areas of land. Farmer training should be associated with this extension
input. FAO/UNDP intends to establish a center at Narok which should be suffi-
cient at least as far as the sheep and goat industries are concerned. Sheep
improvement should continue but this may be adequately covered by the FAO/UNDP
project and by strengthening the Narok County Council sheep farm at Purko. In
future projects for Narok, programs could be initiated for credit for pasture
improvement, livestock handling infrastructure and some provision for upgrad-
ing dairy cattle.
2.15      Forest Resources.  The major forest areas in Narok District are
concentrated in Mau Division; a significant forest tract is also found in
the Loita area, with smaller areas in Kilgoris and Lolgorien in the west.
The major forest area in Mau Division is the 01 Posimoru forest; this forest
is part of the Mau catchment forest, which also includes an estimated 130,000
ha of forest immediately adjacent to Narok District (East Mau, West Mau, and
Transmara) (see Map 2). This forest area as a whole is of critical importance
for the catchment system of rivers tributary to Lake Victoria. Most of the
forest is gazetted and hence is protected by the national Forest Department.
The legal status of the forest lying within Narok District (01 Posimoru) is,
however, uncertain; it was gazetted in 1957, but the Narok County Council
still claims jurisdiction over the area, and much of it has been settled
by farmers over the past 20 years. The Government has recently acted to
clarify this situation, and agreement has been reached with the Narok County
Council on a new boundary for this forest. There are additional areas of
forest in the Mau Division, most along the steep slopes and in river valleys;
the Mau escarpment itself was forested until quite recently. None of these
forest areas are officially protected by the Government, as they are on
private land; in theory, the County Council has jurisdiction over all forest
areas in the District but their primary responsibility is control of licenses
for sawmills and charcoal, not basic conservation. In recent years, much of
the Mau escarpment forest has been cut down and settled, primarily by small-
scale farmers from outside Narok District; they grow maize, potatoes and
vegetables in the former forest areas, and sell charcoal. Ideally, the Mau
escarpment forest should have been carefully surveyed and critical areas
protected against encroachment, since it includes some catchment areas.
However, forest destruction is clearly irreversible in the area, and it is
unlikely that the disappearance of the forest will have a serious adverse
impact on the ecology of the area, since the catchment basin involved is of
quite limited extent. There is nevertheless a need to clarify which forest
areas should be preserved and protected for environmental reasons, and to
define precisely responsibilities for protection and administration of forest
areas. An interministerial committee on land use is preparing a land use
study of Narok District which may assist in defining the problem, and the
Government is reviewing the issue of definition of responsibilities (para
3.18).

D. Government Services, Credit and Infrastructure
Government Services
2.16      The senior government officer in Narok District is the District
Commissioner; appointed by the President, he is responsible for basic adminis-
tration and for coordination of the activities of Government services in the
District. The representatives of the various Government departments together
constitute the District Development Team, which has a general planning and
coordinating function. The elected body responsible for local Government
is the Narok County Council; this body includes 4 nominated members and 17
members elected by universal suffrage for a three-year period; Narok also has
three members of Parliament. The Government officers in the District and
local leaders together constitute the District Development Committee. In
its efforts to decentralize planning and administration of development pro-
grams, the Kenya Government seeks to expand the role of the District Develop-
ment Committee as a means of increasing local participation in development.
In Narok, the issue of local involvement in development is particularly
significant; it is widely believed that past development programs have been
imposed from above or outside, without consulting or involving the population,
and many Masai leaders and farmers are vocally suspicious of new programs
which have not been fully discussed within the District.
2.17      Most principal Government departments and agencies are represented
in Narok District, although in most instances officers are hindered by limited
staff and resources; relative to many other districts, Narok has suffered from
neglect, and experienced Government officers have seldom been posted to the
district. In particular, the Narok Roads Department has very limited capac-
ity, and agricultural services are generally weak. Agricultural services are
coordinated by the District Agricultral officer (DAO), who is responsible for
all Ministry of Agriculture staff in the District. At present, veterinary
service officers represent the largest contingent of staff, and crop extension
is particularly weak. The FTC in Narok offers a range of courses for farmers,
and its capacity is to be expanded during 1978-79. A District Agricultural
Committee under the District Commissioner considers general agricultural
policy issues, sets planting dates, and, through a sub-committee, reviews
applications for agricultural credit from AFC.
Agricultural Credit
2.18      Credit to Narok farmers is currently available from four principal
sources: AFC, the Wheat Board, the Kenya Breweries, and commercial banks.
At present, however, a high proportion of agricultural credit goes to non-
Masai farmers, the tenant "telephone" farmers who live outside the district.
AFC currently has a relatively small branch office in Narok, which is prin-
cipally concerned with the GMR program (para 1.32). The Branch has a staff
of 5, and was opened in 1964. AFC has about 900 GMR accounts in Narok; of
these, however, only about 200 are active borrowers, the remainder represent-
ing dead accounts, most in arrears. AFC has only 12 active small-scale loans
(under K Sh 20,000), 8 large-scale loans, and 7 group ranch loans in Narok



- 23 -
District. Thus, AFC's activities are limited in scope, dominated by the
GMR program which is beset by fundamental problems. Group ranch develop-
ment is an important activity, but is proceeding very slowly. The principal
obstacles to expansion of AFC activities in the past have been the slow
progress of land adjudication (para. 2.07), which has curtailed lending
since AFC normally requires title deeds as security, and the reluctance of
many Masai farmers to borrow, because of general suspicion of outside credit
institutions and fear of debt. The Wheat Board of Kenya has a special project
which provides seasonal credit for wheat production in Narok District; over
80% of borrowers from the Wheat Board are tenant farmers, most from outside
the District. In 1976/77, the Wheat Board financed about 725 growers in
Narok, for a total of about K Sh 37 million. The Wheat Board has financed
the Narok Project on a largely provisional basis in the past, through com-
mercial bank overdrafts, and this will continue in the 1978-79 growing season.
The future of the Wheat Board Scheme is, however, uncertain, as the Board
seeks to phase out the credit scheme, which is not considered central to its
normal operations. It is likely that this scheme will be gradually phased out
as other programs for seasonal and medium term credit (including that included
in the proposed Project) are developed. The Kenya Breweries finances barley
production; in 1978/79, seasonal credit was provided to about 900 farmers in
Narok District. The Breweries program is efficiently managed and has been
effective in increasing production of barley. It is expected that it will
continue in the future.
Rural Infrastructure
2.19      The population in Narok District is densest in the Mau area and in
Kilgoris; infrastructure and facilities are hence most developed in these
areas. The largest urban center is Narok Town, which serves as the District
headquarters. Its population is officially estimated as 6,000, but it may be
as large as 16,000; the town is in any case expanding rapidly. Other larger
rural centers are Kilgoris, Nairage Ngare, Enabelbel in the Mau area, Narosura
(east of the Loita Hills) and Mulot (west of Narok town). There are no major
industries in the district.
2.20      All major roads are classified as all-weather standard but only the
road connecting Narok with the main Nairobi - Nakuru road is bitumenized.
Therefore communications with Nairobi and Nakuru are excellent but communica-
tions within the district are difficult, particularly during the rainy season.
A network of minor roads has been constructed in the Mau area to serve the
expanding wheat and barley production. In 1975, the Ministry of Works in
conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Wheat Board, identified
500 km of roads in need of improvement to gravel standards. A major portion
of these roads were improved in the 1975/76 fiscal year. However, these
roads require further upgrading and additional feeder roads along the ridges.
For the Masai Siria area, the Government proposes to upgrade the road between
Kilgoris and Keroka to all-weather standard. Several major roads in Narok
District will be improved as part of the proposed Highway sector loan which
was recently appraised.



- 24 -
2.21      The district is served by six secondary schools with about 800
students, and about 100 primary schools, with a total enrollment of about
16,000 students (estimated at about 50% of the school-age population). There
are three hospitals in the district - at Narok (Government financed, 79 beds)
and at Kilgoris and Naikaria (mission hospitals), in addition to ten health
centers. Dispensaries are located at nine rural centers. The Agricultural
Finance Corporation maintains a branch office in Narok, and Barclays Bank
opened a branch in Narok early in 1978. In general, social infrastructure
is poorly developed in Narok compared with other districts of Kenya.
E. Development Problems and Potential
2.22      In general, Narok has been relatively neglected in Kenya's national
development programs and basic services and infrastructure in the District
remain very limited; officials admit that less qualified and competent staff
have been posted there. Development efforts have to date focussed on cattle,
largely involving promotion of group ranches, and on exploitation of potential
for wheat production in the Mau Narok area. Group ranch development (sup-
ported by the Second Livestock Project, Credit 477-KE) proceeds, but very
slowly. In the past development has been rather disorganized and initiated
almost entirely by entrepreneurs from outside the District and there has been
concern that tenant farmers have been "mining" the land, threatening to pro-
voke serious soil erosion. A continuing theme in discussions of development
schemes for Narok is the exploitation of the pastoralist Masai by outsiders.
Two wheat schemes previously organized for the Masai have been unsuccessful,
reportedly because of mismanagement and a lack of involvement of the local
people. Recent wheat development has been largely undertaken by farmers from
outside Narok District, many of them wealthy entrepreneurs and Government
officials from Nairobi who have leased land from the Masai. This has left a
legacy of suspicion of outside programs and influence which must be overcome
in future projects.
2.23      A new development plan is being prepared for Narok District, for
the period 1979-83; for the first time, a substantial effort is being made
to involve local officials actively in its preparation, and working groups
have been established for each sector. In line with Kenya's national objec-
tives, the plan emphasizes the alleviation of poverty and creation of jobs,
but in Narok special emphasis is being placed on basic needs - health ser-
vices, water supplies,schools and infrastructure. Narok's political leaders
and district officials emphasized that past programs had met with limited
success and that special efforts were required to achieve plan targets in the
future. Of prime importance is the active involvement of the local population
in the development effort.
2.24      The development of Narok District poses difficult administrative
and social problems. The transition from the traditional economy of the
Masai - a nomadic way of life where cropping was normally disdained - to a
more modern system of agriculture and general way of life is indubitably
occurring, in many instances with surprising rapidity. There are signifi-
cant numbers of energetic, shrewd Masai entrepreneurs who are growing wheat,



- 25 -
even while they expand their cattle herds in the plains area.  Local offi-
cials argue convincingly that the time has come for the Masai to reexert
control over their land and to take over wheat production, in particular,
from outsiders. This development will, however, occur gradually, and it
would be risky to force the pace of change too quickly, as it could foster
serious financial problems for Masai farmers who moved unprepared into new
agricultural enterprises. Further, wheat development should be more fully
integrated into the district's development plans than it has been in the past;
the links between ranching in the plains and wheat production in the higher
areas should be more clearly recognized in preparation of future development
schemes.  The issue of income distribution within the district is assuming
increasing importance as land adjudication introduces increasing rigidity
into traditional patterns of distribution of wealth, and as some Masai entre-
preneurs succeed in a spectacular way with agricultural and commercial enter-
prises. The proposed Project is therefore explicitly designed as the first
phase of a long-term development program, and the preparation of future
projects and basic studies of the district economy and society are an essen-
tial component.
III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The proposed Project would be the first stage of a long-term
(10-20 year) program for development of mixed farming in Narok District. The
Project area for the phase 1 project would be defined as the Mau Division.
The Project would comprise, over a five-year period, the following components:
(a) Development of improved extension services for crops
(with focus on wheat and rapeseed) and livestock (sheep,
goats, and cattle), and farmer training;
(b) Incremental staff and office facilities for AFC in
Narok to provide improved credit services for mixed
farming;
(c) Provision of seasonal credit for wheat and rapeseed
inputs and medium-term credit for farm machinery, soil
conservation measures, dams, stores, and land clearing;
(d) Development, upgrading and maintenance of access and
feeder roads in the principal wheat producing areas;
(e) Soil conservation measures and development of tree
nurseries to provide seedlings for reforestation
on farms;
(f) Wildlife control program to limit damage to crops by wild
animals; and



- 26 -
(g) Studies to establish baseline data on the district, monitor-
ing and evaluation of Project progress, staff training, and
studies and field trials to prepare projects for the future
development of Narok District.
3.02      The Project would be managed by the existing Narok District ser-
vices, as strengthened under the Project, and by AFC. The Land and Farm
Management Division of the Ministry of Agriculture would be responsible
for Project coordination and would provide support services as required.
3.03      The Project has two principal objectives:  to promote the development
of Narok District, an area of high potential which has been relatively neg-
lected in the past, and to increase production of wheat, an important commod-
ity which Kenya is now obliged to import. It would benefit almost exclusively
individuals with medium-scale farms (more than 20 ha), and would make little
impact on Kenya's problems of rural poverty, since the wheat production
techniques involved are ill-adapted for small-scale farms. The Project is
justified first, because it is well adapted in the social and economic cir-
cumstances of Narok district, where excellent land is still abundant and
only a few Masai farmers are keen to shift to crop cultivation, and second,
because it would make an important contribution to Kenya's overall economic
development through its increased production. It fits well with the Kenyan
Government's strategy for agricultural development which involves parallel,
complementary efforts to assist small scale farmers, and medium and large-
scale farms (para 1.10).
B. Detailed Features
Extension Services and Farmer Training
3.04      The Project would aim to strengthen existing extension services
for crops and livestock in the Mau Division of Narok District and to expand
the training programs of the existing Farmer Training Center (FTC), and
strengthen their links with extension. Extension methods used would involve
short training courses for farmers at the FTC, field days at test sites and
demonstrations on husbandry and tractor maintenance, and follow-up at farms
by extension workers for individual farm planning and budgeting assistance.
Extension workers would visit farmers on a regular schedule at appropriate
stages in the cropping cycle. The extension services would provide assistance
to an estimated 2,000 resident farm owners in the Project area; many would be
new farmers with limited experience of crop husbandry, machinery operation,
or budgeting and financial control. It is expected that the farm size of
most farmer participants would be in the range of 20-100 ha, as the technical
packages involved are most suited to farms of this size. The dominant activi-
ties of participating farmers would be wheat (50%), rapeseed (12%) and pasture
for goats and fat lambs; most farmers also own cattle herds. An estimated 360
farmers would benefit directly from the Project's credit program (para 3.06)
and would receive more intensive extension support. The proposed ratio of
farmers per extension worker would be 120:1 for farmers outside the credit
scheme and 60:1 for farmers who obtained development loans under the Project.
Supplementary livestock and veterinary service staff would be required to



- 27 -
strengthen extension on improved pasture management, animal disease control,
and use of improved rams. A limited number of cattle dips and AI runs would
be developed to supplement existing facilities. The FTC training program
would include courses on machinery maintenance, crop husbandry, animal hus-
bandry, farm planning and budgeting, and loan application procedures and
responsibilities; AFC would organize the training in credit operations. A
training program for women farmers would emphasize small livestock and vege-
table cultivation. The main investment items would include housing and
vehicles for extension staff, four-wheel drive vehicles and a bus for the FTC,
livestock infrastructure, incremental staff and operating costs for crop and
livestock extension services, and supplementary staff and operating costs for
the FTC.
AFC Agricultural Credit Services
3.05      AFC credit services in Narok district would be strengthened and
expanded, in order to serve better the needs of resident owner farmers pro-
ducing wheat, rapeseed and sheep. Current AFC lending is largely restricted
to GMR advances (paras 1.32 and 2.18), and a small number of medium to long
term loans; credit to Masai farmers who own land is presently very limited.
AFC would provide more intensive assistance for loan applications and loan
supervision in order to expand its lending for farm development by land own-
ers. The principal investment items would be incremental operating costs
for loan officers and support staff and other recurrent costs, vehicles,
housing and office construction, and purchase of offi-e eq-ipment.
Medium-Term and Seasonal Credit
3.06      An estimated 360 resident-owner farmers or groups of farmers would
obtain credit from AFC for farm development and operation in this first phase
Project. Farm developments would include clearing land for cropping, purchase
of farm machinery (tractors, drills, ploughs, and a small number of combine
harvesters), soil conservation measures (construction of cut-off drains and
laying of grass strips), construction of farm stores, and development of small
dams for livestock watering. Medium-term credit would support clearing of an
estimated 5,000 hectares, purchase of about 124 tractors and 14 combine har-
vesters and other farm development activities. Loans would range from about
K Sh 27,000 (US$3,375) for land development only, to about K Sh 180,000
(US$22,500) including machinery for a 30-hectare farm; for a 75-hectare farm,
a loan of about K Sh 218,000 would be required (US$27,250); the additional
loan required to purchase a combine harvester would be about US$32,000.
Seasonal credit would be extended for wheat, rapeseed and sheep and goat
production in conjunction with medium-term development loans. Seasonal credit
required would be about $3,600 for a 30-hectare farm and US$7,000 for a
75-hectare farm. Machinery purchases under the Project should allow the
resident farmer owners to cease reliance on large machinery contractors from
outside the district; not all farms would require machinery and farmers are
expected to share equipment on an internal contracting basis, which should
prove more efficient and economical than the existing system. Because of AFC
requirements for security, loans would not be available for tenant farmers
from outside the district (para 1.31).

Road Development
3.07      Road construction, improvement, and maintenance would be carried
out in the higher altitude wheat areas, north and north west of Narok town
(see map 2). The road component would continue and strengthen an on-going wheat
road scheme initiated in 1975, which has assisted in upgrading and opening
feeder roads in support of wheat development. The major investments would be:
(a) completion of gravel surfacing of about 25 km of the main wheat collector
road, and rehabilitation of about 23 km of already gravelled sections on the
same road, including improvement of horizontal alignment and gradients and
provision of minor drainage structures; (b) development of feeder roads to the
main collector road, including regrading of 55 km of existing earth feeder
road spurs and loops, opening up and extension of about 30 km of new earth
feeder roads, and construction of about 30 km of new earth roads with minor
drainage structures in Ololpilonito; (c) maintenance of existing and new wheat
collector roads and feeder roads, including regrading road surface, side
ditches, mitre drains, and repairs to drainage structures; and (d) engineering
and technical supervision by the Roads Department of the Ministry of Works or
by engineering consultants employed by that Ministry. For the collector road,
the road standard would be equivalent to gravel-standard to enable all-year
traffic and future reclassification to a class D road. Feeder roads would
generally run along ridges, and would be of earth construction. Engineering
required would be basic and simple. The major investments would be contracts
for road improvement and maintenance with local road contractors.
Soil and Water Conservation
3.08      The Narok District Soil Conservation Service (SCS) facilities would
be strengthened under the Project by supplementing existing equipment with six
additional crawler tractors for land clearing and conservation works. About
15 dams for public use (each each with a storage capacity of about 2,000 cubic
meters) would be constructed. District forestry services would be strengthened
by providing tree nurseries to provide plants for distribution to farmers, who
would plant trees on their land to retard soil erosion. These activites would
complement the basic Project extension, training and credit programs which
would have an important component aimed at promoting soil and water conserva-
tion (paras. 3.05-3.07). Projected on-farm developments would include con-
struction of cut-off drains, laying of grass strips and construction of small
dams for livestock watering, which would also have a conservation function.
Extension workers would promote proper rotation practices to reduce soil
erosion and would discourage cultivation of steep slopes. The main invest-
ment items for soil and water conservation would include equipment (crawler
tractors), civil works for dam construction, and establishment and recurrent
costs of four tree nurseries.
Wildlife Control
3.09      Damage to crops by wildlife (mainly buffalo and elephant) from
neighboring forest areas is a major problem for Mau Division wheat farmers.
The Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife disbursed an estimated K Sh 2 million
as compensation for crop damage in 1976/77; this probably represents total



- 29 -
damage equivalent to about K Sh 5 million (US$625,000) since only a proportion
of damage claims are reimbursed, and involves an estimated 10% of the total
wheat crop. Wildlife control programs for the Mau Division would be pursued
under the Project in order to reduce losses from wildlife damage. Additional
studies and field-scale comparison trials would be required to plan for the
control program and to evaluate alternative control methods. The principal
alternatives evaluated would be shooting of individual animals from a herd,
as a form of harassment, scaring of wildlife by patrols, protection of crop
areas with moats and fences, and expanded use of compensation for crop damage.
The control program would comprise a combination of these methods. The
principal investment items would include vehicles, staff, and operating costs
for game control units and an estimated 30 km of fencing of key crop areas
against livestock.
Technical Services
3.10      Baseline studies of population, ecology and resources of the Narok
District would be carried out, to assist in Project management and in subse-
quent monitoring and evaluation efforts, and to serve as a basis for planning
for future phases of the Narok District development plans. Project prepara-
tion work would focus on exploration of potential for development of areas
outside the Mau Division, notably Kilgoris and the Loita Hills area. CIDA
would finance most of these studies, but provision would be made for a small
component of the IDA credit to be allocated for special studies and for
training activities (such as short courses and visits) for staff involved
in Project implementation.
C. Project Costs
3.11      Total Project costs are estimated at K Sh 151 million (US$18.9
million), of which about US$10.5 million or 56% represent foreign exchange
costs. Details are summarized in the following table.

Project costs were estimated at prices as of August 1978.  A physical contin-
gency of 10% was applied to all Project items, except road development and
wildlife control, to reflect general uncertainty on the costs of Project
investments; a 20% contingency reflects the greater uncertainty for the latter
components. Price contingencies were applied following Bank/IDA guidelines
on a cumulative basis at the rate of 8.5% for 1978, 7.8% for 1979, and 7.1%
for 1980-83; these reflect a weighted average of estimates of price increases
for foreign and local costs (Table 1). Taxes and duties on Project goods are
estimated at K Sh 0.9 million, which represents import taxes and duties on
goods which would not be eligible for exemption from customs, and taxes on
fuel and other operating costs. The phasing of investments and details of
Project costs are summarized in Table 1.

D. Financing
3.12      The financing of Project costs would be shared as follows:
K Sh        US$          %
(million) (million)
Government of Kenya                    27.2         3.4          18
Farmers                                 7.9         1.0           5
CIDA                                   11.2         1.4           8
IDA                                   104.0        13.0          69
Total Costs (excluding taxes)         150.3        18.8         100
Taxes                                   0.9         0.1
Total Project Costs                   151.2        18.9
3.13      The proposed IDA Credit of US$13.0 million would be to the Govern-
ment of Kenya, on standard IDA terms. The credit would finance about 69% of
net Project costs, including 87% of foreign exchange costs and 47% of local
expenditures. CIDA has agreed to finance baseline studies costing an esti-
mated US$1.4 million equivalent, representing about 8% of total Project
costs, as a grant to the Government of Kenya. Farmers would finance an
estimated 5% of total Project costs, as down payments for medium-term loans
for purchase of equipment and machinery. The Government would finance about
18% of net Project costs.
3.14      Funds for farmer credit (medium and long term) would be onlent by
the Government to AFC at an annual interest rate of up to 5%, provided that
the spread to AFC is not less than 6%. These funds would not be repayable
to the Government, but would be used by AFC to finance. AFC's future farm
development lending for Narok District. Any repayments from loans would in
turn be relent to Narok District farmers, subject to continuing demand for
credit.   The Government would undertake to replenish the fund to the level
established under the Project if for any reason outside AFC's control, the
fund was drawn down, until the closing date for the proposed credit. AFC
would lend to ultimate borrowers at an interest rate of not less than 10%
per annum for medium term loans and 11% for seasonal credit; this is in line
with agreements reached for the Third Agricultural Credit Project. General
interest rate policies are currently being reviewed with the Kenyan Govern-
ment, and AFC's interest rate structure will be specifically reviewed as part
of the on-going preparation of a fourth agricultural credit project. Modifi-
cations to interest rates resulting from either the general review or from
negotiations for the fourth credit project should be applied also to AFC's
Narok District lending operations. Funds for development of more intensive
AFC credit services for Narok would be passed on to AFC as a grant as they
would represent technical assistance for development of an improved service
network for Narok District, which would not be financially viable in the short



- 32 -
term. This method of handling development of services is consistent with
provisions of previous projects involving AFC. General AFC lending policies
and terms will be further reviewed in conjunction with preparation of the
fourth agricultural credit project (currently underway). Signature of a
Subsidiary Financing Agreement between the Government and AFC, satisfactory to
IDA, would be a condition of credit effectiveness. Funds from the IDA Credit
for extension services, road development, soil and water conservation, wildlife
control programs, and technical services would be passed on to those agencies
responsible for Project implementation as a grant.  Assurances were obtained
during negotiations regarding the above terms. Retroactive financing of about
US$200,000 for Project start-up activities including housing and office
construction and vehicle procurement from June 15, 1978 would be available.
E. Procurement
3.15      For the Project's credit component, the items to be financed are
varied and would not be suitable for bulk procurement under international
competitive bidding. However, there is adequate competition, both inter-
national and national, in offering goods through the normal supply channels
which subborrowers would use. Major producers of farm machinery and fertil-
izers are represented in Kenya; sales and after-sales services are adequate,
supplies satisfactory, and prices competitive. Thus, farmers would procure
goods and services through normal commercial channels. Procurement of
equipment and materials for extension and credit services, soil and water
conservation, and the wildlife control program would follow Government pro-
curement procedures which are satisfactory. Contracts for road development
and maintenance works would be placed following local competitive bidding
procedures, which are satisfactory; works are too small and locations too
scattered to attract international bids. Most housing and office facilities
would be constructed through the Buildings Department of the Ministry of
Works; contractors would be employed to carry out these works following local
competitive bidding. AFC facilities would also be constructed by local con-
tractors. Again, works would be too small in scale to interest international
civil works concerns. Assurances as to these arrangements were obtained
during negotiations.
F. Disbursement
3.16      Funds from the Credit account would be disbursed over five years
on the following basis:
US$ million
(a) 85% of the amounts disbursed by AFC
under medium- and short-term subloans                7.3



- 33 -
(b) 85% of total expenditures for vehicles
and equipment                                         2.0
(c) 80% of total expenditures for civil
works and road development                            2.4
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures or 85% of
local expenditures for Project related
monitoring and evaluation, staff train-
ing, and road engineering consultants                0.2
(e) An unallocated amount representing
a part of price contingencies on the above
categories and transferable to them as
appropriate                                           1.1
Total IDA Credit                                    13.0
Disbursements against (b), (c) and (d) would be fully documented.   Disburse-
ments against (a) would be made against statements of expenditure certified by
AFC; these would be retained by AFC and made available to IDA for inspection
in the course of normal Project supervision. An estimated schedule of IDA
disbursements is given in Table 2.
G. Accounts and Audits
3.17      The Ministry of Agriculture and AFC would maintain records and
accounts adequate to explain all Project activities. Ministry accounts would
be audited through normal Government procedures. AFC's auditors have been
Messrs. Githongo and Company since May, 1978: the former auditors were the
Nairobi office of Coopers and Lybrand. Assurances were obtained at negotia-
tions that AFC would continue to appoint independent auditors acceptable to
IDA and that the audited accounts together with the auditors' report would be
submitted to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year. Assurances
were also obtained that accounts for funds channelled through Government
agencies would be audited and reports submitted to IDA within six months of
the close of each fiscal year.
H. Environmental Impact
3.18      Project investments would have a positive environmental impact
through a number of Project-sponsored activities. Project investments and
extension programs would actively encourage the reversal of the present soil
erosion problems by strengthening the Narok District Soil Conservation Service
(SCS) and Forestry Services. Plants for distribution to farmers would be



- 34 -
provided from tree nurseries to be established under the Project. An impor-
tant element of extension and credit programs would be the encouragement of
agricultural practices aimed at reducing soil erosion, including proper rota-
tions and development of grass strips and cut-off drains. The protection of
catchment forests in Narok district raises some environmental issues, since
protection policies have not been clearly defined and there is confusion as
to which ministry or agency has primary responsibility for the forest areas
concerned (para 2.15). We do not believe that forest destruction in fact
represents an important ecological threat, but areas which should be protected
should be more clearly delineated and responsibility for forest protection
better defined. This issue was discussed during negotiations and the issue
of forest protection will be closely followed in the future in the course of
Project supervision. No new water sources are to be tapped and the provision
of small dams under the Project is partly to regulate the flow of present
surface streams. The recommended fertilizer and pesticide inputs are not
expected to have any adverse environmental effects.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Management and Staffing
4.01      The Project would be implemented throuRh the district level ser-
vices responsible normally for the various activities concerned, under the
direction of the District Agricultural Officer (DAO), who would be desig-
nated as Project Coordinator. Policy matters relating to the Project would
be decided by the DAO in liaison with the Ministry of Agriculture's Land and
Farm Management Division, through the Provincial Director of Agriculture (PDA).
Thus, at the national level the Land and Farm Management Division would have
coordinating and policy responsibilities, but day-to-day Project management
and executive responsibility would be delegated to the DAO. The Narok AFC
branch manager would have primary responsibility for the credit program,
working in close liaison with the DAO. Project components outside the Min-
istry of Agriculture's normal sphere of responsibility (road development and
wildlife control) would be the responsibility of the respective Ministries
concerned, and their staff at central and district level would be coordinated
in their Project activities by the DAO. The District Development Committee
would review progress in implementing the Project at least once a year, and
would effectively act as a Project Coordination Committee.
4.02      The DAO would be an experienced farm management officer, and the
Government has decided that the post will carry a higher grade (L) than it
has in the past. The DAO would be assisted by an additional senior extension
officer who would be appointed to share his duties within the district (Deputy
Project Coordinator). District Specialist Officers and Technical Officers
would be responsible for specialist aspects of the Project's agricultural
programs. Schedule 1 summarizes existing staff who would be assigned new
responsibilities under the Project and the additional staff required to
achieve the Project's programs and objectives. Assurances were obtained at



- 35 -
negotiations that: (a) the Government would assign staff to Narok District
in line with the provisions of Schedule 1 before December 31, 1981, as that
schedule is modified from time to time in consultation with IDA; (b) that the
Government would submit for IDA approval draft terms of reference for key
Project staff; and (c) that the Government would consult with IDA on the
appointment of the DAO and Deputy Project Coordinator. It would be a condi-
tion of credit effectiveness that both these officers had been appointed.
4.03      Annual Project Review and Work Plan.  Specific Project implementa-
tion programs would be based on a detailed annual work plan. This plan would
be prepared by the DAO and his staff each year; it should be finalized during
March, i.e. three months prior to the commencement of each fiscal year.
Targets and provisions within each work plan would be projected on a quarterly
basis. The plan would be reviewed in Narok District with Ministry of Agricul-
ture Headquarters and provincial staff, during IDA supervision missions which
should normally be timed to coincide with the review.  Local officials, -
including the District Development Committee, should thus be fully involved
in on-going evaluation of the Project and planning for future development.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the work program for
each year would be submitted to IDA for review before March 1 of each year,
commencing in 1979.
4.04      The Project Coordinator would be responsible for coordinating the
major capital developments associated with the Project. He would also be
responsible for the final preparation of annual work plans, and the subsequent
annual reporting on Project achievements. District technical officers would
remain responsible to the DAO/Project Coordinator. The Deputy Project
Coordinator would be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Project,
in line with the annual work plan. He would be responsible for approving farm
plans, in liaison with the district technical officers and the AFC coordinator
(final approval of loans relating to these plans would rest with AFC). The
Deputy Project Coordinator would also be responsible for ensuring the timely
provision and coordination of services within the Project. Agricultural
Extension officers working in the Project area would, therefore, be respon-
sible to the Deputy Project Coordinator.
B. Management of Project Components
4.05      Extension Services and Farmer Training.  The District Agricultural
Officer (DAO) (Project Coordinator) would have direct responsibility for the
strengthening of extension services; more generally, development of Narok
extension services would come under the Deputy Director of Agriculture in
Nairobi, while technical specialists assigned by Ministry technical divisions
would provide assistance and advice (farm management, livestock and veterinary
services). The proposed extension organization can be summarized as follows:

Assistants (4)                                          Assistants (18)
In total, about an additional 30 extension staff would be required, phased
over a three-year period, bringing the total extension staff for Mau Division
to about 82. Of the additional staff, 3 would be senior specialist officers,
8 technical officers, and 20 technical assistants (Schedule 1).
4.06      AFC Credit Services.  AFC's branch office in Narok District would
be strengthened by provision of additional staff, vehicles, office and housing
facilities. Additional loan officers would provide active assistance to Masai
farmers in preparing loan applications, and would supervise development loans
carefully. Because of the difficult circumstances of Narok District, AFC
proposes an unusually high ratio of officers to loans, with one Loan Officer
per 100 loans (as opposed to 1:200-250 nationally).
4.07      Road Developments.  Planning, location, and programming of proposed
road improvement and maintenance would be carried out in close collaboration
between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Roads Department, Ministry of
Works. Engineering standards, technical specifications, and guidelines for
improvement works, including plans and tender documents, would be prepared by
the Roads Department, with assistance from consulting engineers selected with
IDA approval. Construction and maintenance during the Project period would
be carried out by contractors, because the Ministry of Works faces ever-
increasing responsibilities in maintaining existing classified roads, and
has limited facilities for such works in Narok District. The Roads Department
would review and approve contractors' technical proposals; the consulting
engineers would supervise construction, improvement, and maintenance works.
Roads Department would undertake these works on the basis of an agreement for
technical services between the Ministries of Agriculture and Works, specifying
services to be provided and cost reimbursement arrangements. Arrangements
for maintenance of wheat roads following the Project period have been in con-
junction with the transport sector review for Kenya, and CIDA assistance is
likely to be provided to strengthen the District Road Department services.
The studies designed to assist in preparation of future development programs



- 37 -
for Narok (para 3.10) would specifically consider general requirements for
future road development. This would include planning the road network,
assessing priority areas for development, estimating future maintenance
requirements, and developing proposals for strengthening the Narok District
Roads Department services. Proposals for these future developments should
be reviewed with IDA. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that:
(a) the Government would make appropriate administrative and financial pro-
vision for maintenance of roads developed under the Project following Proj-
ect completion; and (b) that the Government would consult with IDA on road
development programs (including road maintenance) for Narok District pre-
pared in conjunction with baseline and Project preparation studies not later
than December 31, 1981.
4.08      Wildlife Control.  The Ministry of Wildlife and Tourism would be
responsible for implementing the wildlife control program; the Narok District
game warden would have principal responsibility for day-to-day operations.
The details of the wildlife control program would be agreed upon by the
Government of Kenya and IDA following planning studies which would include
investigation of the wildlife damage problem (paras. 3.09 and 3.10). The
wildlife study would be short, practically oriented, and would be comple-
mented by early comparisons of alternative control methods on a field scale,
would assess costs and benefits of alternative control methods and would
recommend the most cost effective combination of methods and evaluate the
program's ecological impact. The studies and wildlife control program would
be coordinated with related activities under the ongoing Wildlife and Tourism
Project (1022-KE). It would be a condition of disbursement for this component
that IDA had approved the detailed program for the wildlife control study,
following completion of initial studies. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the Government would consult with IDA on the terms of
reference for the wildlife control study.
4.09      Technical Services.  CIDA would supervise implementation of baseline
studies in cooperation with the Government of Kenya. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the Government would consult with IDA on terms of
reference for those studies, (including the wildlife study - para 4.08). For
studies and staff training financed under the IDA credit, prior IDA approval
would be obtained for proposals and terms of reference (para 3.10).
Project Completion Report
4.10      The Government should prepare a completion report summarizing per-
formance under the Project and evaluating its successes and problems. This
should be submitted to IDA not later than six months after the expected clos-
ing date, and assurances on this subject were obtained during negotiations.
C. Project Implementation Schedule
4.11      The Project would be implemented over a period of about 4-1/2 years,
beginning in January, 1979; Project year 1 would be considered the period



- 38 -
January 1 to June 30, 1979 so that subsequent Project years would coincide
with the Government's fiscal year. A tentative Project Implementation
Schedule is summarized below, and was discussed during negotiations:

D. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.12     The Ministry of Agriculture has established a monitoring and eval-
uation system for projects. The system is operated jointly by the Land and
Farm Management Division and the Development Planning Division, with the dual
objectives of producing data for guiding Project managers and Project planners.
The system is closely related to the Integrated Rural Survey of the Central
Bureau of Statistics, and measures more precisely the performance of farmers
in response to specific projects and the projects' effectiveness in removing
constraints. The field operations of this evaluation system are directed by
the IADP Evaluation Coordinator, who works with a team of enumerators under
the control of provincial supervisors. The evaluation system at present is
being developed with the IADP, but will be adapted as soon as feasible to
evaluate the progress of the Commercial Farming Project (IDA Agricultural
Credit III). The evaluation of the N~rarok Project would be part of this
adapted scheme and would be further amended to include aspects and compo-
nents specific to this Project. In line with general policy, funds are in-
cluded in Project cost estimates to permit the expansion of the evaluation
scheme to meet its specific requirements.

V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
A. Technical Features
5.01      The majority of the Project area (Mau Division) has an annual rain-
fall of 800 - 1,200 mm and the average altitude of current wheat areas is
2,400 m (para. 3.01). Soils have predominantly medium to high fertility, de-
rived from volcanic ash and tuffs, and they have high levels of organic matter
and variable phosphorus content; they are deep; well-developed, friable clay-
loams exhibiting rapid infiltration rates and low susceptibility to erosion.
Most of the soils are deficient in copper. Present farm systems consist
mainly of wheat and natural pasture, and most wheat production is undertaken
by non-resident farmers who lease land from Masai landowners. Wheat, rape-
seed and fat lamb production would be the three farm enterprises adopted by
participating farmers; barley would in some cases be substituted for wheat
when considered a more profitable alternative. Under the Project, a three
pronged enterprise improvement strategy would be followed: (a) strengthen-
ing of extension and farmer training to improve crop and animal enterprise
husbandry, to provide individual farm planning and budgeting services, and
to assist resident owner-farmers to obtain loans; (b) provision of medium-
term credit to resident owner-farmers to improve the quality and timeliness
of cultivation; and (c) provision of seasonal credit for wheat and rapeseed
inputs to encourage optimal levels of input use.  This strategy would be
supported by lending for soil conservation, afforestation, storage, and
land clearing to ensure the establishment of viable long-term production
systems. The objective of the proposed Project is to strengthen services
for all farms in the Project area involved in wheat production, and to improve
rural infrastructure, notably roads; hence an estimated 2,000 farmers could
be affected. The analysis below, however, focuses on the specific farming
patterns of those farmers who would obtain credit under the first phase
Project, thus about 360 farmers. Project investments should assist other
farmers to increase yields (extension and training) and to improve delivery of
inputs and marketing of crops (roads). These benefits are difficult to
quantify with any reasonable degree of accuracy and therefore no effort has
been made to do so separately. The farm models described below are indicative
of the farming practices likely to be adopted by those who obtain credit under
the Project and, to a lesser extent, farmers who benefit from extension
advice; it is expected that other farmers would adopt similar farming systems
in the future. These models are particularly important for analysis of the
types of farming systems that should be promoted for Narok District, and are
less significant as a means of predicting precise output figures for the
relatively limited group of farmers who would be directly involved in this
first phase Project.
5.02      Two farm model types are considered to be representative of partici-
pants' farms: a smaller farm 30 hectare model with 22 hectares cultivated,
and a larger 75 ha model with 55 ha cultivated. It is assumed that farm
machinery would be obtained on credit by all the 75 ha farm participants,
but by only about 30% of the 30 ha farm participants. For the purposes of
the models a conservative eight course rotation of wheat, wheat, wheat, rape,



- 40 -
wheat, ley, ley, ley has been projected giving 50% wheat, 12% rapeseed, and
38% pasture. In practice, the emphasis would be on rotational flexibility,
and a rigid rotation is not recommended. Wheat and rapeseed are the most
profitable enterprises and since the soils should stand continuous cultiva-
tion, only weed and disease problems should dictate the rotational pattern.
Some farmers have husbandry standards that keep weed problems under control
even with frequent cropping; other farmers have poor husbandry standards and
face rapid weed build-ups. The extension service should therefore concentrate
on individually tailored advice on rotational practices, particularly in the
early years of a farmer's participation.
5.03      Crop yield increases are expected to arise largely from four hus-
bandry improvements: (a) earlier and better quality cultivation practices
giving improved soil moisture conservation through better weed control; (b)
improved use of herbicides for weed control; (c) rotational advice and the
judicious use of both rapeseed and pasture to handle weed and disease problems
in cereals; and (d) increased input use, particularly copper foliar sprays to
correct the widespread copper deficiencies. An estimated 30% of farmers are
expected to adopt minimum cultivation techniques, which would reduce require-
ments for tractor use from 8.5 hours/ha to about 4.85 hours/ha. Tests have
not shown any yield reduction from minimum cultivation practices. Livestock
production increases (from goats and fat lambs) are expected to arise from:
(a) improved nutrition from the use of improved sown pastures; (b) better
parasite control; and (c) use of exotic rams and frequent mating (where
nutrition is adequate). These improvements would be obtained through
strengthened extension services and through the farm owned machinery which
would make undersowing of ley at the correct time much easier. A number
of quite modest improvements in carrying capacity, lambing percentages and
mortality would combine to give substantial increases of production to 266
kg/ha. liveweight. Estimates of yield increases may be summarized as follows
(kg/ha):

/a   Year 0 reflects before Project situation; assumed without
Project situation is no change in yields.



- 41 -
B. Producer Benefits
5.04      The producer benefits to be obtained under the project would be
multifold.  A large proportion of the estimated 2,000 farm families in the
Project area would benefit from proposed Project investments; their net
incomes would increase as a result of intensified extension services and road
improvements which would improve productivity of existing wheat areas and
reduce losses. An estimated 360 loanees (many would represent several related
families on one landholding) would participate directly in the Project's
credit component over a five-year period. Up to 1,000 individual families
could be expected to benefit directly. These beneficiaries would be resident
owner-farmers only, thereby reversing a trend of lessee farmers who have shown
little interest in maintaining the land and who in fact have mined the land
for short-term gains. These owner-farmers would be able to increase their
net incomes considerably over and above their present income from leasing
their land to non-residents. Out of the 360 loanees approximately 125 would
purchase their own machinery. A direct result of this would be the future
availability of a local contracting ability which would benefit both Project
and non-Project farm families. Significant farm sizes identified are 30
hectares and 75 hectares. The largest group of farmers would be those with
about 30 hectares. The majority (70%) would not purchase machinery and they
would rely on contract services, provided mainly by farmers receiving loans,
for machinery requirements; their net income would be expected to increase
from about K Sh 5,000 (U$625) without the Project to about K Sh 28,000
(US$3,500) with the Project. About 30% of loanees with 30 hectares are
expected to purchase a plant to do their own mechanical preparation, seeding
and harvesting activities. Surpluses in tractor hours will be utilized by
neighboring farmers who do not have the machinery. Family incomes with the
Project are estimated at about K Sh 62,000 (US$7,750). Approximately 110
participants with around 75 hectares of land are expected to participate in
Project developments and all are expected to purchase a full set of equipment.
About 15 are expected to purchase a combine and these loanees will be able to
fulfill a real requirementq i.e. local contract availability during harvest
time. With Project incomes for families with 75 hectares are estimated at
about K Sh 100,000 (US$12,500); families with a combine harvester would earn
an estimated $9,000 additional income from contracting services. These
increases in net income are substantial; they result from increases in cropped
area (bringing land that was previously unutilized under cultivation), from
increased yields, and from reduced mechanization costs because of reliance on
local contracting services or farmers' own machinery.  The high family incomes
are to some extent offset by payment of income taxes, by limited risks in
terms of production, and from lack of guarantees of contracting services.  Net
farm income is in all cases commensurate with the relatively large size of the
individual loans and the inherent risks attached to the proposed cropping
activities.  In the future, increases in income in the district are likely to
become less dramatic as the availability of unused land decreases.
C. Production Estimates
5.05      Estimates of production are based on the farm budget analysis and
are therefore restricted to the 360 farmers participating directly in the



- 42 -
credit program (para 5.01). They should therefore be viewed as a conservative
projection of the likely impact of Project developments. At Project year 10,
incremental production is estimated at about 12,000 tons of wheat, 4,000
tons of rapeseed, and 800 tons of fat lambs a year. The wheat increment
would represent an increase of about 30% on the 1977/78 district production of
about 40,000 t; production would increase approximately 3% per year over 10
years. District production has been rising rapidly over the last three years
at the rate of 25% per year as a result of increasing area cropped, but this
increase would be expected to slow down without the Project because there is
little further wheat land available. It would represent a 7% increase above
the 1977 national production figure of 176,000 tons. The incremental increase
in rape-seed production would be approximately 400% of the 1977/78 district
production, largely a result of increased planting since this crop has only
recently become attractive following improvements in the prices offered to
farmers. It would represent a 25% increase above the 1977 national oilseeds
production figure of 15,000 tons. The percentage increment in fat lamb or
goat production is uncertain since no reliable estimate of district production
or even of livestock numbers is available. It would represent very approxi-
mately a 1% increase in national production of mutton and goat meat, estimated
at 64,000 tons in 1975. The Project is expected to result in increases in
cultivated areas of about 3,500 ha under wheat and 2,100 ha of rapeseed by
year 10; these represent, respectively, increases of 17% of 1977 estimated
wheat hectarage of 21,000 ha and 370% of 1977 rapeseed hectarage for Narok
District. It is not expected that significant increases in area under pas-
ture would result from the Project, although productivity per hectare would
increase gradually.
VI. GOVERNMENT AND AFC BENEFITS
6.01      With the exception of the Project's credit components, costs of
most Project investments would not be recovered directly from beneficiaries,
as these would be extensions of basic Government services which are normally
provided free of charge. Exceptions would be soil conservation works per-
formed by the Soil Conservation Service, for which farmers would pay the full
cost, and sale of tree seedlings; in the latter case, however, in line with
general practice the charge is nominal in order to promote reforestation as
a hedge against soil erosion. Costs would be recovered indirectly through
taxation on Project benefits and beneficiaries. A Government cash flow is
included as Table 3. The Project would require an increase in direct expendi-
tures on Narok services estimated at about K Sh 6 million (US$0.8 million)
from 1985 onwards; it is expected that all of these expenditures would be
recovered indirectly through taxation on Project farmers and on the wheat
industry.
6.02      AFC's Project-related cash flow is included in Table 3.  The develop-
ment of Credit services in Narok District would include an element of direct
subsidy which would be justified by the pilot nature of Project Credit opera-
tions, which are likely to lead to significantly expanded AFC activity in the
future. Apart from this development subsidy, AFC services and loans are ex-
pected to be financially self-supporting.



- 43 -
VII. MARKETS AND PRICES
7.01      Wheat, rapeseed, and livestock produced under the Project would be
marketed through existing channels. For wheat, farmers would be responsible
for delivery of wheat to WBK stores, normally in Nakuru or Narok; arrangements
for hauling are satisfactory as a number of transporters provide services at
reasonable costs. Processing and storage capacity of the Wheat Board are
adequate for expected incremental production. Farm stores developed with
Project credit should reduce losses on farms. Rapeseed would be marketed
directly to processing companies by farmers; these companies normally collect
crops at farmgate (para. 1.20). Livestock produced would be sold on the local
market. Project wheat production would substitute for wheat imports, while
rapeseed production should reduce import requirements for oilseeds.
7.02      Producer prices of a wide range of agricultural produce are fixed
and gazetted by the Government under the Agricultural Act; consumer prices
are fixed under the Price Control Act of 1971. Producer prices are formally
announced by the Ministry of Agriculture while wholesale and retail prices
are determined by the Ministry of Finance and Planning through the Price
Controller. Both ministries participate in the price decision making process
(para 1.17). Thus, prices are set by the Government and, in many instances,
implemented by parastatal organizations at producer, processor and retail
levels for, notably, maize, wheat, rice, sugar, milk, cattle, cotton (except
retail) and wattle bark.  Discussions are currently iinderw-v with the Govern-
ment of Kenya to define appropriate procedures for regular consultation with
the Government on prices of key agricultural commodities, including wheat; it
has been tentatively agreed that the Bank will participate at least informally
in the Government's (Ministry of Agriculture) annual price review for all
crops, rather than specifically in conjunction with price covenants for
individual projects. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
Government would continue to ensure that prices for wheat and other crops
would be maintained at appropriate level, taking into account incentives to
farmers, and that the Government would consult with IDA on wheat prices once
a year. Prices used for the financial analysis are farmgate prices received
by farmers; for both wheat and rapeseed it is assumed that these prices are
roughly comparable to import parity levels. Lambs were valued at market
prices which were assumed to reflect their economic value.
VIII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      Benefits resulting directly from Project investments would consist
of increased production of wheat, rapeseed, and sheep and lambs. The value
of annual incremental production is estimated at about US$4.6 million at full
development (Year 10). These benefits reflect only the direct production in-
creases from farmers who obtained loans under the Project (360 farmers), and
should thus be considered a conservative estimate of likely benefits. Addi-
tional benefits which have not been quantified would result from the improve-
ment of extension services and training throughout }{au Division, and from road
improvements; these would increase production of crops (primarily wheat) and
livestock, and would improve the efficiency of crop marketing (para 5.01).



- 44 -
Further benefits would be the protection of Narok's natural resources,
notably through soil and water conservation measures (para. 3.18). Additional
benefits would result from the wildlife control program, which would reduce
crop losses from damage by wild animals. In addition to these agricultural
benefits, the Project is designed to assist in the development of basic
agricultural services in Narok District, and thus to improve planning for
district development, implementation of development schemes, and delivery of
services to farmers. The development of local institutions and training of
staff and farmers would be of crucial importance for the preparation of future
development projects for Narok District.
8.02      The economic rate of return from directly productive elements of
the Project is estimated at about 13% over 20 years. All Project investment
costs which relate directly to expected increases in production were included
in the analysis; it would be reasonable to exclude part of the cost of ex-
tension and training, road development, and wildlife control from the analy-
sis since these would benefit a larger group of farmers for whom no direct
benefits have been estimated; this would increase the rate of return signi-
ficantly. Costs of studies were excluded from the analysis because benefits
from these activities are principally intended to assist in the design of
future development programs for Narok District, and would therefore accrue
largely in future projects; the estimated cost of monitoring and evaluation
was included in the analysis. Costs of farm labor were included in the
analysis. The cost of unskilled labor was valued at its actual cost, which
was assumed to reflect prevailing market costs of labor. Foreign exchange
costs and benefits were valued at US$1 = K Sh 11 (as opposed to the prevail-
ing rate of US$ = K Sh 8), to reflect the scarcity value of foreign exchange.
Prices used in calculations of benefits were those prevailing in August 1978.
These prices were adjusted to reflect expected shifts in world market prices
of wheat and oil seeds (the index used was for soybeans). The rate of return
was tested for sensitivity. If costs were increased by 10%, the rate of
return would be reduced by 3% to 9%; if costs were increased by 20%, the rate
of return would be 8%. If benefits were reduced by 10%, the rate of return
would be reduced by 3% to 9%; if benefits were reduced by 20% the rate of
return would be 7%. If costs were increased by 10% and benefits reduced by
10%, the rate of return would be 7%.
Risk
8.03      The Project presents limited financial risks, but it could encounter
significant problems during implementation. The problems most likely to
affect the Project would be implementation delays resulting from management
difficulties, and a slower than expected rate of participation in the credit
program by resident Masai farmer owners; these problems might be aggravated
if the land adjudication process in Narok progresses more slowly than the
Government now expects. If farmers did not seek credit as expected, AFC might
sustain some limited financial losses and new Government services might be
underutilized but the financial and economic effects would not be very sig-
nificant. The most important problem for Project implementation is to ensure
local involvement in Project implementation, and thus to secure adequate
support from local officials. It is further essential that incentives to



- 45 -
Masai farmers to participate in Project developments be adequate; these
incentives include access to credit and appropriate technical packages, but
basic technical assistance in farming and use of credit for these relatively
inexperienced and often suspicious farmers will be essential. Measures taken
to ensure decentralization of Project administration, including an annual
review in Narok itself, should offset this risk to some extent. It will also
be of vital importance that high quality staff are appointed, at least some
of them indigeneous to the District. Although the Project promises to present
some difficulties, it offers long-term benefits for development of Narok Dis-
trict, which has been relatively neglected in the past; in many respects its
principal benefits would be the strengthening of local institutions and local
planning capacity.
Employment and Income Distribution
8.04      An estimated 2,000 farm families would be expected to benefit from
the Project, although 360 families would benefit most directly. Most of these
farmers would be adjudicated land-owners in the middle income category. A
limited number of new jobs would be created through the Project's construction
activities as well as additions to government services and agencies.
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following
issues:
(a) Financing arrangements for the Project (para. 3.14);
(b) Procurement arrangements for the Project (para.3.15);
(c)  (i)  That AFC would continue to appoint independent auditors
acceptable to IDA and that audited accounts together
with the auditors' report should be submitted to IDA
within six months of the end of the fiscal year; and
(ii) That the Government would submit audited accounts
for Project investments channeled through government
agencies to IDA within six months following the close
of the fiscal year (para. 3.17);
(d) Regarding Project staffing:
(i)  that the Government would assign staff to Narok District
in line with the provisions of Schedule 1, as that
schedule is modified from time to time in consultation
with IDA;
(ii) that the Government would submit for IDA approval draft
terms of reference for key Project staff; and
(iii)  that the Government would consult with IDA on the appointment
of the DAO and Deputy Project Coordinator (para. 4.02).



- 46 -
(e) Arrangements for the annual Project work plan and review
(para. 4.03);
(f) Regarding roads,
(1)  that the Government would make appropriate administra-
tive and financial provision for maintenance of roads
developed under the Project following Project completion;
and
(ii)  that the Government would consult with IDA on future road
development programs for Narok district and specifically
road maintenance not later than December 31, 1981
(para. 4.07);
(g)  That the Government would consult with IDA on terms of refer-
ence for the study to prepare the wildlife control program
(para 4.08);
(h)  That the Government would consult with IDA on terms of
reference for baseline and monitoring studies, and would
obtain prior IDA approval on proposals and terms of reference
for studies and training to be financed under IDA Credit
(para. 4.09);
(i)  That the Government would prepare a draft completion report
on the Project and submit it to IDA not later than June 30,
1984 (para. 4.10).
(j)  That the Government would ensure that prices of wheat and other
crops would be maintained at appropriate levels, taking into
account incentives to farmers, and that the Government would
consult with IDA on wheat price levels once a year (para 7.02).
9.02      Conditions of Credit effectiveness would be:
(a)  Signature of a Subsidiary Financing Agreement between the
Government and AFC satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.14); and
(b)  Appointment of key Project staff (DAO and Deputy Project
Coordinator) (para 4.02).
9.03      It would be a condition of disbursement for the Wildlife Control
Program that IDA had approved a detailed program for wildlife control (para.
4.08).
9.04      Subject to the above assurances, the proposed Project would be
suitable for an IDA Credit of US$13.0 million to the Government of Kenya
on standard IDA terms.
