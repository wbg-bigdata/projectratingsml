Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:            Republic of Turkey
Beneficiary:         Cukurova Electric Company (CEAS)
Amount:              US$132 million equivalent
Terms:               Seventeen years including four years of grace, with
interest at the standard variable rate.
Onlending Terms:    The loan would be onlent to CEAS on at least the same
terms as the Bank's with CEAS assuming the foreign
exchange risk.
Project              The proposed project would support the Government's
Description:         strategy of developing Turkey's indigenous energy
resources and of bringing about greater involvement of
the private sector in energy development. Financing
would be provided for the 283.5 MW Sir Hydropower Station
on the Ceyhan river; the project would also include
transmission lines to connect the power station to the
national grid, technical assistance and training.
Project Benefits    The project would help in developing economically and
and Risks:           at least cost Turkey's indigenous energy resources.
Although geological investigations for the Sir dam were
comprehensive, there is still some risk that geological
problems might appear during construction. The risk is
considered manageable. Appropriate expert geological
supervision would be provided. In addition, it is likely
that CEAS will be restructured during project
implementation. Proposals for restructuring would be
discussed with the Bank.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY FOR THE
SIR HYDROPOWER PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$132 million to help finance
the foreign exchange cost of the Sir Hydropower Project. The loan would have
a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest at the standard
variable rate. The loan would be onlent to the Cukurova Elektrik S.A. Company
(CEAS) on at least the same terms as the Bank loan, with CEAS bearing the
foreign exchange risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.       An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled: "Turkey: Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU), was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission reviewed the Government's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89)
in September 1984 and its report: "Turkey: The Vth Five-Year Plan in the
Context of Structural Adjustment" (No. 5418-TU) was distributed in July 1985.
3.       Turkey's area is about 780,000 square kilometers (i.e. about equal to
the area of France and West Germany combined) with a populaticniL uf around
50 million and GNP per capita of $1200 in 1984. The density of popuilation is
low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural land), and about 47 percent live
in urban centers. Population growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the
median for middle-income countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the
mid-1970s as well as emigration of workers (to Western Europe and to the
Middle East), there is still substantial unemploymenc which, including
disguised unemployment in agriculture, is estimated at about 19 percent of the
civilian labor force. There is, however, little or no absolute poverty,
although income distribution is skewed. There are considerable regional
differences in income and large rural-urban disparities.  Recent data indicate
a probable increase in income inequality since the 1970s, especially a
relative deterioration of the position of wage and salary earners and an
improvement in the position of the trading and commercial classes, and, more
generally, of capital-owners.  Educational enrollment has expanded greatly,
but the level of adult literacy remains relatively low compared to the
European average for middle income countries.
1/ Parts I and II are substantially the same as Parts I and II of the
President's Report on the Second Railway Project (P-4223-TU) dated
Jui.._ 11, 1986.



-2-
Background
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration of its terms of external trade.
Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by increasing
public investment. The foreign exchange requirements were financed initially
by workers' remittances and then increasingly by borrowing, a large part of it
short-term. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as the
massive external debt burden led to a sbarp deterioration in creditworthiness,
severe shortages of imports, disruptions in industrial production and a rise
in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic inflation had also become an
issue of critical importance.
5.       In response to the crisis of the late 1970s, the Turkish authorities
made a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces. To alleviate the
balance of payments constraint and import shortages, policies were adopted to
expand exports, increase workers' remittances, liberalize imports, encourage
foreign investment and improve external debt management. On the domestic
front, the objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
five Structural Adjustment Loans, an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan, and
a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan involves far-reaching changes in attitudes,
institutions, and the legal and policy framework, all of which require time to
be put in place. Major structural changes have been made in the exchange rate
system, the export and import regimes, the tax system, interest rate and
selective credit policies and the public investment program. Implementation
of the adjustment program started in January 1980, continued under a military
regime during the period September 1980 - November 1983, and has since been
carried out by an elected government.
The Structural Adjustment Program, 1980-85
7.       The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural ad,ustment program and the outcome met or exceeded the Government's
own targets through 1982. The overall performance deteriorated in 1983 due to
a combination of factors (slowdown of export growth, slippages in the monetary
program, shortfall in Government revenues), but improved again, except in the
area of inflation and the budget deficit, in 1984. The improvement was
maintained in 1985, this time including a slowdown in inflation and a
reduction in the budget deficit.
8.       After expanding by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982, real
GNP growth slowed down to 3.2 percent in 1983, due to the effects of a bad
harvest, stagnant exports and lower workers' remittances. The growth rate
rebounded in 1984 to 5.9 percent, mostly on account of favorable performance
in agriculture (3.7 percent growth) and industry (9.3 percent growth).
Merchandise exports also expanded strongly, by more than 25 percent in dollar
terms. In 1985, according to the latest estimates, the economy grew by about
5.1 percent, as against the program target of 5.5 percent. The slowdown in



growth was most significant in agriculture (2.8 percent growth) and
manufacturing (5.5 percent), due respectively to less favorable climatic
conditions and slackening domestic demand. On the expenditure side, the
average annual real rate of growth of public fixed investment over the period
1980-84 was 3.8 percent. Provisional estimates for 1985 indicate that public
fixed investment totalled TL 3,181 billion, implying a much higher real growth
(17.1 percent) over 1984 than programmed (5.8 percent). The growth of
investment was c9ncentrated in infrastructure--energy, transportation and
telecommunicatk6&i   The growth rate of private investment has fluctuated more
severely, falling by 17 percent in 1980, recovering slowly, and then rising by
7.3 percent in 1984 and by 7.0 percent in 1985. 2rivate consumption, after
declining by 5 percent in real terms in 1980, grew by 5 percent in 1983 and
1984 before slowing down to an estimated 3.7 percent in 1985. Strict
budgetary discipline contributed to a steady decline in the real rate of
growth of public consumption from 8.4 percent in 1980 to 1.7 percent in 1983;
however, it increased to 3.2 percent in 1984 and an estimated 3.3 percent in
1985.
9.       During 1981-82, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation through a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incomes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the average annual
rate of increase in the wholesale price index (WPI) decelerated to 37 percent
in 1981 and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 the downward trend was reversed and
the inflation rate rose to 30 percent. Inflation accelerated further in 1984,
and reached 50 percent, due to the lagged impact of the expansionary monetary
policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant increase in
agricultural product prices, especially of fresh fruits and vegetables, as a
consequence of export liberalization and higher export market prices. Other
contributory factors included substantial "catch up" increases of SEE prices -
since January 1984 most SEEs have effectively been allowed to set their prices
freely - and higher import prices resulting from the nominal depreciation of
the Turkish lira. In addition, inflationary pressures stemmed from a larger
than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a slowdown in the
growth of revenues.
10.      In 1985 inflation declined considerably -- the average annual rate of
increase in the WPI fell to 43.2 percent, after reaching a very high level in
the first quarter of 1985 (about 60 percent as of March 1985). By
December 1985, the month-over-month change in the WPI (i.e. December 1985 over
December 1984) had correspondingly declined to 38.3 percent and by May 1986 it
had dipped even further, dropping to about 28 percent for the first time in
two and half years. Factors causing the high inflation rate in the first
quarter of 1985 were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) in
January 1985 and continued substantial increases in the prices of several key
intermediate goods and inputs. Thereafter, several factors combined to lower
inflationary pressures: (i) monetary growth slowed, particularly in the
fourth quarter, with M2 growth declining from an annual rate of 64 percent as
of September 1985 to 53 percent at year-end; (ii) by April 1985 most of the
catch-up increases in the prices of SEE products appeared to have been
completed and the rate of price adjustment abated considerably; (iii) the
significant slide of the dollar, which started after March 1985, resulted in a



- 4 -
slowing down of the nominal depreciation of the Turkish lira against the
dollar and therefore in smaller increases in prices of imported products than
were witnessed in 1983-84; (iv) the persistence of high real interest rates
(which increased as inflation declined) helped to channel liquidity towards
savings rather than consumption and thus lowered aggregate demand; and
(v) lower exports of certain agricultural products (cereals and pulses) meant
that the domestic market was well supplied, thus easing inflationary pressures
on food prices. The steady deceleration in the inflation rate, which has now
continued for over 12 months, reinforces the expectation that the Government's
target rate of 25 percent for 1986 could be achieved, particularly considering
the large decline in world oil prices since January 1986, the continued
weakening of the dollar relative to other international currencies, and the
Government's maintenance of a tight monetary and fiscal program.
11.      In the fiscal area, progress has been uneven.  During 1980-82 the
budget deficit declined from 5.3 to 2.1 percent of GNP, but increased to
almost 5 percent of GNP in 1984, due mainly to a disappointing performance in
raising tax revenues. In 1985, however, the budget deficit is estimated to
have been TL 621 billion or 2.3 percent of GNP, a significant improvement over
1984. This is largely because the Government took several measures in 1985 to
increase revenues, the most important of which was the introduction of VAT.
In its first year, VAT collections amounted to about TL 1 trillion,
significantly above the target. Other tax measures which were adopted
included substantial increases in various fixed charges and duties and large
increases in penalties for overdue tax payments. As a result of these
measures, budget revenues rose from 15.4 percent of GNP in 1984 to 17 percent
in 1985, reversing the downward trend in revenues over the previous three
years. Government expenditures decreased from 20.3 percent of GNP in 1984 to
an estimated 19.3 percent in 1985.
12.      Progress has also been made in rationalizing interest rates and
reforming the banking system. Since 1981, interest rates on time deposits at
commercial banks have been positive in real terms. Time deposits have been
yielding a positive real return since early 1984. Positive deposit interest
rates have resulted in a steady growth in deposits, about 10 percent per annum
in real terms in 1984 and 1985. Improvements in incentives for savings were
accompanied by administrative reforms of the banking system, the enactment of
a new banking law, and measures to revitalize the capital market.
13.      While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. Effective nominal interest
rates range from 60 to 80 percent on non-preferential credits, in part because
of the impact of high liquidity and reserve requirements, the option which
commercial banks have to invest in high-yielding government bonds, and high
intermediation costs. The Government took a number of steps in 1985 to reduce
the interest rate differentials between preferential and non-preferential
credits: in particular, the preferential interest rate for export credits was
discontinued in January 1985, while, during the year, interest rates for
larger agricultural loans and for loans to SEEs were increased from 28 and
22 percent to 34 and 35 percent respectively. The narrowing of the gap
between interest rates on preferential and non-preferential credits, together
with the decrease effected in the amount of preferential credits, is expected
to increase the general availability of credit and exert a downward pressure
on non-preferential interest rates.



14.      Improvements in the balance of payments were substantial between 1980
and 1982, with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.3 billion
(5.7 percent of GNP) in 1980 to $1.2 billion (1.6 percent of GNP) in 1982. In
1983 the current account deficit increased to $1.8 billion, as merchandise
exports stagnated and workers' remittances fell by one-third. These
developments were reversed in 1984 as exports increased by over 25 percent in
dollar terms to reach $7.4 billion.  Remittances, too, registered a higher
than expected increase, reaching $1.8 billion (up by 20 percent over 1983).
Merchandise imports grew by more than 16 percent to reach $10.8 billion. As a
result of these developments, both the trade and the current account deficits
declined as compared to 1983. Latest estimates for 1985 indicate a further
strong improvement of the balance of payments situation. Merchandise exports
grew by 11.6 percent (in dollar terms) in 1985, while merchandise imports
increased by 8 percent. Among the invisibles, tourism revenues and investment
income from abroad increased significantly compared to 1984 and previous
years. Workers' remittances, on the other hand, declined by 5 percent. The
current account deficit in 1985 is now estimated at about $1.0 billion, or
about 1.9 percent of GNP.
15.      Merchandise export performan,:e has been impressive throughout the
1980-85 period, during which expcrts *egistered an average annual rate of
increase of about 23 percent in doi'Lax terms.  This growth has been led by the
manufacturing sector and has involved a rise in the share of exports to the
Middle Eastern countries. Industrial exports, composed primarily of processed
foods and textiles, have risen from 32 percent of total exports in 1980 to
more than 72 percent in 1985. These results were achieved by a combination of
indirect measures (flexible exchange rate policy, import liberalization) as
well as direct measures (tax rebates, preferential credits) to enhance tne
relative profitability of exports and offset the traditional bias towards
production for the domestic market. Successful penetration of the Middle
Eastern markets has brought their share in total Turkish exports from
17 percent in 1980 to around 40 percent in the 1983-85 period.
16.      On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, as prices of both oil and
non-oil imports declined, and the volume rate of growth remained moderate. In
1984, however, merchandise imports increased substantially. The increase was
most pronounced in some of the groups (e.g. raw materials and consumer goods)
that have been subjected to major liberalization through a lowering of tariff
rates and a significant removal of quantitative restrictions. In 1985, as
domestic demand eased, and the initial effects of pent-up demand for
importables released by import liberalization weakened, the rate of import
growth decreased to about one-half of the level recorded in 1984.
Medium-Term Prospects
17.      The Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89), which was approved by
the Grand National Assembly in June 1984, reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursue an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces. The public
sector is targeted to play a supportive role by concentrating its investments
in infrastructure rather than manufacturing, while the private sector is to be
encouraged to play a leading role in the growth of manufacturing and exports.
Some of the key targets are:



- 6 -
(i)    an average annual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;
(ii)    an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii)    an average annual real rate of growth of 10.9 percent in private
investment and 6.8 percent in public investment;
(iv)    a declining external debt service ratio, from 26 percent in 1984
to around 18 percent in 1989; and
(v)    a decreasing rate of inflation reaching 10 percent p.a. in 1989.
18.      While the overall thrust of the Plan is in accord with the goals of
the structural adjustment program, the Plan targets, if viewed collectively
and in the light of the developments in 1984 and 1985, appear somewhat
ambitious and likely to strain domestic resources (especially in the public
sector) as well as have an adverse impact on the external balance.
Accordingly, the Government is adjusting the annual programs to ensure that
they remain compatible with the fight against inflation and with a growth
strategy commensurate with the Government's ability to generate resources.
19.      The recent decline in international oil prices is likely to have a
favorable impact on Turkey's balance of payments. The Bank's projections
presented below take into account the most recent decline in oil prices. The
analysis shows that the savings from direct petroleum imports alone could be
about $1.3 billion in 1986. The favorable direct impact would be offset to
some extent by lower export growth to oil-exporting countries (which account
presently for about 40 percent of Turkey's exports) as well as lower profit
and workers' remittances from construction activities in these countries.
However, a compensating increase in Turkish exports to, and workers'
remittances from, OECD countries on account of a more favorable OECD growth
outlook is likely in the medium term. Our estimate puts the net positive
impact of the oil price decline on Turkey's balance of payments at about
$400 million in 1986. There would be indirect benefits as well in the medium
term, including a reduction in the cost of debt servicing as a consequence of
a decline in inflation and interest rates in OECD countries. An improvement
in the balance of payments would give the Government the option of repaying
its external debt sooner, thus improving Turkey's debt service ratio in the
coming years, or using the extra resources to support a faster growth
strategy. Given the uncertainty associated with the oil price projections, we
have been cautious in revising GDP growth targets significantly at this time,
in order to emphasize inflation control and a greater build-up of foreign
exchange reserves.
20.      The Bank's projections indicate a GDP growth of 5.9 percent p.a. on
average for the 1986-90 period. At the beginning, growth might be relatively
slow (5.3 percent p.a.), gradually accelerating in the outer years to an
average rate of 6.1 percent p.a. in 1987-90. The inflation targets in the
Bank's projections are also more conservative compared to the Plan targets,
implying a reduction from about 43 percent in 1985 to around 18 percent in
1990. Key economic variables in the Bank's projections for the period 1986-90
are presented in Table 1.

21.      Achievement of these growth rates will depend primarily on the
performance of agriculture and manufacturing. This in turn will depend to a
large extent on the Government's determination to constrain the growth of the
public sector in line with resources and to create a more favorable investment
climate for the private sector. This translates into a projected real growth
in public fixed investment nf about 3.9 percent p.a. on average for the
1986-90 period. In light of the developments in 1985, this implies a much
tighter control of public investment. The comparable figure for the growth of
private fixed investment is 10.6 percent p.a. The projections allow for a
modest increase of per capita consumption of slightly above 3.0 percent p.a.
on average over the period 1986-90.
22.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average rate of
8.1 percent per annum in real terms during 1986-90. This assumes the
maintenance of a realistic exchange rate, further import liberalization and
the ability of Turkish exporters to take advantage of higher expected growth
in the OECD market. Merchandise imports are projected to grow at an average
annual rat.e of 7.4 percent. This is consistent with the import liberalization
program of the Government. On these assumptions, the current account deficit
is projected to decrease to $927 million in 1990 as compared to an estimated
1985 figure of $1,013 million. The projected capital account would remain
manageable throughout the period, even in the face of some sharp increases in
amortization payments arising from the debts rescheduled during 1978-80.
23.      The medium-term scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own development strategy. Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, the favorable response which
this has evoked from the international financial community, and the present
outlook for both lower oil prices and a decline in interest rates, the GNP
growth projected in the medium-term base case scenario could be exceeded if
the current account deficit is lowered and there is an improvement in the
mobilization of public resources.
24.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions
regarding export growth, a downside risk case has also been developed. With
Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous factors such as the
world economic conditions and movements in international prices, a slower
growth of merchandise exports (an average of about 6 percent p.a. over the
1986-90 period) coupled with lower mobilization of public resources (3 percent
lower revenues than envisaged under the base case scenario) would lead to a
more difficult but still manageable balance of payments situation, a lower GDP
growth (averaging about 4.7 percent p.a.) and a higher debt service ratio. In
such a situation the Government would have less chance of absorbing the
unemployed and improving tangibly the average standard of living. However, if
the Government in such circumstances were to resort to a high growth strategy,
then it could witness a repeat of the situation which prevailed in the 1970s,
and which led to a debt crisis. It is unlikely that the Government would risk
such a situation. It is therefore more probable - even if exogeneous
developments are unfavorable - that the Government would continue with the
structural adjustment program as implemented to date.



- 9-
External Debt and Creditworthiness
25.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
$7.0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, Turkey
rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of
rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors.
Following the resolution of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official
sources -- OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Since 1983 commitments
from commercial banks have outstripped those from official sources and have
reached an estimated level of $2.4 billion by end-1985. Of the estimated
total debt outstanding of $25.4 billion (including IMF) at end-1985, medium
and long-term debt accounted for about 75 percent. Short-term debt as a
percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to about
11 percent in 1982, then increased to an estimated 25 percent in 1985. Much
of this growth in the stock of short-term debt is due to the inflows
associated with the Dresdner Bank scheme. 1/ At end-1985, the outstanding
liabilities associated with the Dresdner scheme amounted to $2.7 billion,
constituting 40 percent of short-term external obligations. Inflows from the
Dresdner scheme have been steadily growing with few withdrawals, which is
clearly a reflection of increased confidence in the Government's economic
policies. The Government is sensitive, however, to the build-up of short-term
debt and intends to limit its share of total debt in the medium term to the
present level. Based on the growth scenario outlined in paras. 19-22, debt
outstanding and disbursed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an
estimated 46 percent in 1985 to 38 percent in 1990. This translates into a
forecast of total debt outstanding in 1990 of $31 billion, with short-term
debt constituting about 26 percent of the total.
26.      The debt service ratio for medium and long-term credits increased
from about 26 percent in 1984 to an estimated 31 percent in 1985, mostly as a
result of large repayments of rescheduled debt falling due. Debt service
obligations are expected to be on average about $4.3 billion a year during
1986-90, a quarter of which is attributable to service obligations on
rescheduled debt. However, the debt service ratio is projected to decrease to
about 25 percent in 1990, due largely to improvements in the current account
of the balance of payments. The debt burden should remain manageable provided
current policies are successfully implemented, the export drive is sustained,
and Turkey continues to receive support from international commercial and
official sources. Confidence in Turkey's overall economic performance, its
stable record in meeting debt servicing obligations and its improved debt
management, encouraged commercial banks to commit about $1.9 billion of
medium-term credits in 1985. In the first quarter of 1986, nearly
$500 million out oi a total of $700 million borrowed from commercial banks
consisted of medium and long-term loans. Several major American, European,
Japanese and Middle Eastern banks have been involved in these operations.
1/    Under this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits from Turkish
workers in West Germany and automatically places these funds at the
disposition of the Central Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the deposits
and pays an interest rate commensurate with the Euro-market rate.



- 10 -
27.      Turkey's economic program has been supported by the IMF through a
series of standby arrangements during 1980-84. The Government did not ask for
a new standby in 1985. The Government's decision seems to reflect the view
that the favorable economic developments in 1985 indicate that Turkey has
"graduated" from the IMF's program and that the IMF presence through
Article IV consultations and periodic staff visits to review the economic
performance should suffice for purposes of maintaining international
confidence.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
28.      Through March 31, 1986 the Bank and IDA have lent $6740.7 million 1/
to Turkey, through 92 projects. Agriculture accounts for 23 percent of the
funds lent, industry and DFCs for 22 percent, power for 18 percent, structural
adjustment and program loans for Z5 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for the remaining
12 percent. Disbursements for all sectors combined averaged 62 percent of
appraisal estimates at the end of March 1986, which compares favorably with
other countries in the region. As of March 31, 1986, IFC commitments to
Turkey totalled about $254 million, of which about $69 million were still held
by IFC. Annex II provides a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and
lFC inves,ments as of March 31, 1986.
29.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program, which was completed in June 1984, and more
recently the sectoral adjustment lending program. Significant progress has
been achieved in the last five years, but the task of restructuring is by no
means over. The current Five Year Plan involves the broadening and deepening
of the adjustment process at the sectoral level. Recent economic developments
have underlined the need for a continuation of the stabilization program
without giving up the goals of sectoral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of
Bank lending in the post-SAL period will continue to be on striking an
appropriate balance between sectoral adjustment lending designed in part to be
quick disbu-sing and supportive of policy reforms in the major sectors, and
carefully formulated project lending focussing on high priority projects
principally in the agriculture, energy, industry and transport sectors.
30.      A series of sectoral adjustment loans for the major sectors is
planned over the next few years. A first loan for agriculture was approved in
June 1985. A financial sector adjustment loan approved in June 1986 is the
second of the series. Further lending of this kind would support measures to
enhance the utilization of industrial capacity in the public and private
sectors, keeping in view the scope for the "privatization" of publicly-held
assets in the manufacturing subsectors. Other sectors where sectoral
adjustment loans are likely to be developed include energy and transport, and
it is expected that there would be a follow-up loan in agriculture.
1/ Net of cancellations.



- 11 -
31.      Project lending, which would continue to make up the majority of the
lending operations, would be designed to support and strengthen the adjustment
process. Some project lending would be earmarked for the construction or
rehabilitation of key projects in the energy sector. Other projects would be
guided by the major policy objectives of the Government, which include
generation of foreign exchange (including improving productivity in export
industries and providing essential infrastructure for exports), improvement of
institutional efficiency, non-inflationary output growth and amelioration of
the social costs of adjustment (including provision of social infrastructure
and employment generation, with some emphasis on the least developed provinces
in Eastern Turkey).
32.      This would be the second loan to Turkey presented to the Executive
Directors in this fiscal year. Other proposed loans being processed include
vocational training, water supply and sewerage, urban development, and an
energy sector adjustment loan.
33.      Turkey's debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1986-89 (paras. 25 and 26). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debt was 14 percent in 1984, is estimated at 14.4 percent in 1985, and is
expected to grow to about 20 percent by 1989. Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.0 billion in 1984 to $14.7 billion in 1989 and
private medium and long-term debt outstanding is projected to increase from
$5.2 billior in 1984 to $7.5 billion in 1989. The Bank group's share of total
debt service payments is projected to increase from about 12 percent in 1983
to an estimated 13 percent in 1984, and to about 18.6 percent in 1989.
34.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Energy Resources
36.      Turkey has substantial untapped lignite and hydropower resources, as
well as more limited, but still important, oil, gas and coal resources and
geothermal potential. Hydropower with potential economic viability is
estimated at about 29,500 MW under average hydrological conditions and
corresponds to an annual production of about 100,000 GWh. Only 15 percent has
been developed so far, but this is projected to rise to about 30 percent by
1990. Proven recoverable reserves of oil are about 16 million tons; however,
potential reserves that hiay become economically recoverable, using enhanced
oil recovery techniques currently being tested, could be as high as 30 million
tons. Oil production has been declining over the last decade, as few
discoveries have been made in recent years; in 1984 production was about
2.2 million tons, equivalent to 12 percent of total consumption. Proven
recoverable gas reserves are about 400 billion standard cubic feet. Domestic
gas is expected to be supplemented by large scale imports of natural gas from
the U.S.S.R.



- 12 -
37.      Total known reserves of hard coal are estimated at about 1 billion
tons, all located in the north of Turkey. Coal production has been declining
as operations move to deeper, less accessible seams; in 1984 production was
3.5 million tons (2.2 million toe). Proven and probable lignite reserves are
about 8 billion tons, but about half of this is of extremely low quality
(950-1,000 kcal/kg). Lignite production in 1984 was about 25 million tons,
equivalent to about 6.9 million tons of oil. There is potential for
geothermal development, for both space heating and electricity generation, and
a review of promising geothermal sites is under way.
Energy Consumption and Supply
38.      Total gross energy consumption was about 40.5 million toe in 1984, of
which commercial energy consumption amounted to 32 million toe. Petroleum
made up the most significant share of primary commercial energy (57 percent),
with lignite (20 percent), hydropower (11 percent), coal (11 percent),
asphaltite and imported electricity making up the balance. Overall, about
23 percent of final commercial energy consumption was in the form of
electricity. Non-commercial energy production (primarily fuelwood, but also
other biomass) was an important energy source, accounting for 29 percent of
total domestic energy production. The most notable change in the pattern of
energy consumption over the past two decades has been the decrease in the
relati-e share of hard coal in the total. This was accompanied by a rapid
growth in consumption of petroleum until the mid-1970s reaching 50 percent in
1977/78; and a rapid rise in the share of lignite (primarily for thermal power
production) and hydroelectric power consumption starting in the second half of
the 1970s. During this period, hard coal consumption stayed relatively
constant in absolute terms, while traditional biomass energy sources increased
slightly in absolute terms but decreased steadily as a percentage of total
energy consumed.
39.      Trends observed in the growth and pattern of energy consumption
during the latter part of the 1970s are expected to continue during the l980s
and 1990s. The most important factor in the growth of energy demand will be
the growth rate of the economy as a whole and the growth of the relatively
energy-intensive industrial sector. The demand for lignite is expected to
grow rapidly, both for direct consumption by households and industry and, even
more importantly, for the power sector.
Organization of the Energy Sector
40.      The energy sector in Turkey is characterized by the dominance of
Government owned enterprises and agencies. The Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources (MENR) is responsible for the development of energy resources in
Turkey. The Turkish Hard Coal Enterprise (TTK), the Turkish Lignite
Enterprise (TKI), the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPAO), and the Mineral
Research Institute (MTA) have responsibility for the extraction of fossil
fuels and radioactive minerals. Design and construction of hydroelectric
projects is entrusted to the State Hydraulics Authority (DSI). The Turkish
Electricity Authority (TEK) is responisible for the generation, transmission
and, since November 1982, the distribution of almost all the electricity sold
in Turkey. TEK is also responsible for the implementation of the Government's
program for rural electrification and the construction of all public sector
generating and transmission facilities, with the exception of public sector
hydroelectric plants for which DSI has responsibility.



- 13 -
41.      Private sector participation in the supply of electricity has until
now been confined to two private utilities (CEAS and KEPEZ) and industrial
companies which generate power for their own use. However, recent changes in
Government energy policy give greater encouragement to private sector
participation in the development and production of energy (para. 43). The
Government is actively seeking ways to encourage both local and foreign
private sector participation in geothermal development, lignite mining,
hydroelectric projects and the construction and operation of power plants
fired by imported fuels.
Energy Sector Policy
42.      To meet its energy requirements, Turkey launched a massive program in
the late 1970s to increase the domestic production of electricity and
lignite. This program tended to stretch the implementation capabilities of
the State energy agencies, and spread resources too thinly over too many
projects, with resulting long delays in completion schedules. This has, in
turn, resulted in an energy deficit which is likely to remain a feature of the
Turkish economy at least through the 1980s. MENR and TEK are in the process
of improving their energy planning capabilities; and MENR has produced
Turkey's first energy policy paper. Furthermore, the current Five Year
Development °lan (1985-89) contains some broad objectives relevant to the
energy sector including the following:
-   Priority is to be given to domestic sources of energy, especially
hydropower and lignite, provided that they are economically
justified;
-   Imported energy including, but not limited to, oil will be
considered;
-   Renewable and nonconventional resources such as geothermal, solar
and biogas will be supported; and
-   Private sector financing, both local and foreign, will be sought
for participation in energy development.
43.      Two features of Government policy represent a departure from previous
energy policy. The first is that Government policy is now quite clearly to
encourage private sector participation in the energy sector. There are no
longer constraints to private sector electricity generation, and existing
private utilities like KEPEZ and CEAS have plans to increase their
capacities. In addition, the Government is currently negotiating with private
consortia which would assemble financing, and construct and operate for a
specific period (10-15 years), thermal plants based upon imported fuels. The
second shift in policy focus is increased concern that indigenous resources be
developed only when economically justified. Improving efficiency in the
lignite mining subsector, at least to levels at which marginal production
costs are competitive with imported coal, or conversely abandoning mining
ventures if such economies cannot realistically be achieved, has become a
major energy policy objective for the Government.



- 14 -
44.      A less explicit but no less important component of the Government's
energy policy relates to the pricing of energy products. Regular increases in
the prices of petroleum products to maintain them at economic levels have been
a feature of the Government's pricing policy for the past five years.
Electricity tariffs have been increased sharply since early 1984. As of
April 1986 bulk power tariffs were roughly at the level of long run marginal
cost. Prices of petroleum products are being maintained at international
levels. Lignite prices, which had shown a threefold increase in real terms in
the seven years preceding 1983, declined slightly in real terms in 1984.
Since 1984 they have gradually increased in real terms.
45.      The Government is also in the process of developing a program for the
conservation of energy by encouraging more efficient use in existing and new
industrial enterprises. Energy efficiency programs and legislation have been
evaluated by both the ME?NU and SPO, and legislation has been passed which
allows for tax credits for various types of investments in energy efficiency
improvements. The Bank included financing of energy audits in selected
manufacturing facilities under Loan 1916-TU. Thiese audits have been completed
and are under review. TEK .ias engaged consultants to assist ir. the
development of an energy conservation and load management program. MENR has
requested Bank assistance in the development and implementation of a
comprehensive energy conservation program.
Electricity Supply and Demand
46.      The present installed power capacity in Turkey is about 8,500 MW of
which 4,500 MW (53 percent) is thermal and the balance hydro. The share of
hydroelectric power has increased sharply. It was about 33 percent in 1972.
On the thermal side, lignite has made an increasing contribution to the
production of electricity. Total net generation in 1985 was about 27,500 GWh,
of which TEK accounted for almost 90 percent. Imported electricity from
Bulgaria and the U.S.S.R. accounted for about 3,000 GWh.  Total availability
was less than the potential effective demand. There is considerable evidence
that power shortages have caused cutbacks in production in industries such as
cement, textiles and paper. In addition to the capacity constraint, the high
level of total system losses (technical losses plus energy unaccounted for),
estimated at about 20 percent, contributed to the supply shortages.
47.      Growth in demand for electricity averaged about 9 percent per annum
over the period 1965-1985. Between 1970 and 1983, the percentage of
population with public electricity supply rose from 51 percent to 78 percent.
Per capita consumption of electricity is currently about 550 kWh. TEK's
latest long-term generation plan (1987-2005) is based upon a projected overall
growth in electricity demand of about 10 percent per annum till 1990 and a
growth of 8X per annum beyond 1990.
48.      For more than two decades the Turkish power subsector has been
confronted with major problems. Electricity supply has been insufficient to
meet demand in every year since 1971, resulting in high costs to the economy
as imports increased and supply interruptions continued. Many of the issues
facing the subsector can be traced to institutional problems in the public
sector agencies responsible for planning and implementing the subsector's
investment program. This has resulted in project delays, consequent
substantial cost escalations, power shortages, frequent and protracted plant



- 15 -
breakdowns due to inadequate maintenance, and relatively high system losses,
especially in the urban networks. The shortage of qualified staff in TEK
resulted in resources, human and financial, spread too thinly over too many
projects in the investment program.
49.      The Government agrees that closing the supply gap will require a
sustained coordinated effort by the major agencies in the subsector. It plans
to emphasize increased supply in parallel with managing demand and improving
efficiency of existing facilities. To illustrate the magnitude of the task,
it should be noted that Turkey would have to bring on stream three times more
power generating capacity in the 1980s than in the 1970s and that the momentum
would have to be sustained throughout most of the 1990s. TKU and DSI will
have to meet their respective production targets comrnensurate with TEK's
plans. Even if a lower growth rate in electricity demand is assumed, and
optimistic assumptions are made about the sector's implementation capacity,
except for 1986 and 1987 some power shortages are likely to continue
throughout the 1980s.
Bank's Role in the Power Subsector and Experience with Past Lending
50.      The proposed project would be the twentieth Bank operation in the
power subsector in Turkey. The Bank has made fifteen loans and a technical
assistance grant (total $1131.7 million) and IDA has granted three credits
(total $55.7 million) for five hydroelectric projects, two thermal power
stations (oil- and lignite-fired), a lignite mine and several transmission and
distribution networks. The technical assistance grant helped reorganize
Turkey's power subsector. All these projects were completed successfully,
although often with long delays.
51.      A Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) distributed to the Board in
November 1981, 1/ on the Keban Transmission (Loan 568-TU) and the first TEK
Power Transmission (Loan 763-TU) projects, found that these projects had met
their physical objectives despite implementation delays and cost overruns. A
Project Completion Report on the Istanbul Power Distribution Project (Loan
892-TU), distributed to the Board in December 1982, 2/ also reported physical
completion of the project after considerable delay. Major problems identified
were the shortage of local counterpart finance and late preparation of bidding
documents.  The PCR on Loan 1194-TU commented on the need for improvement in
the monitoring and coordination of the project. The report recommended the
establishment of a project implementation unit within TEK. Such units are now
regularly used in Bank financed power projects in Turkey.
52.      Through its lending the Bank has been able to assist the Government
in the consolidation of the power sector and in the establishment of TEK. The
Bank has also provided advice and supported efforts to bring about other
institutional reforms. Considerable progress has been made in areas such as
TEK's system planning and procurement procedures. The Bank has also assisted
in attracting funds from other bilateral and international financing agencies
and from commercial banks. Recently a B-loan of $350 million was arranged for
the partial financing of the Kayraktepe Hydropower Project (Ln. 2655-TU).

Planned Strategy for Assistance to the Sector
53.     Sector policy discussions, which recently have been held twice a year
with the Government and energy sector agencies, hrve provided a valuable forum
to discuss the issues and constraints facing the sector. Detailed agency by
agency action programs are being prepared and will be discussed with the
Bank. Future Bank lending in the sector would be based on these action
programs.
54.     For the electric power subsector the Government will emphasize (a)
investments which yield quick returns, such as completion of priority ongoing
investments, upgrading of existing facilities, reduction in losses, and
improvements in maintenance procedures and efficiency; (b) programs to ensure
a balanced electric power development program through appropriate investment
in generation, transmission, distribution and general plant; (c) improved
demand management including identification of energy saving investments and
enactment of energy conservation legislation; (d) technical assistance to
strengthen capabilities in planning, financial management and manpower
development; (e) investments in new generation options such as those based
upon imported coal and natural gas; and (f) an increased role for the private
sector in the production of electricity.
55.     The Government has identified a series of investments which would
address the above medium-term issues. The size and structure of Turkey's 1986
power sector investment program and the investment strategy proposed for
subsequent years seem consistent with the goal of meeting Turkey's electricity
needs economically. The Bank will continue to have opportunities to express
its views on future energy sector investment programs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
56.     The proposed project would support the Government's strategy of
developing economically Turkey's indigenous energy resources. The project was
identified in March 1984 and appraised in June/July 1985. Loan negotiations
were held in Washington from May 28 to July 8, 1986. The Turkish delegation
was headed by Mr. Hikmet Ulugbay, Chief Counselor for Economic and Commercial
Affairs in the Turkish Embassy and included representatives of the Treasury
and CEAS. A Staff Appraisal Report entitled "Sir Hydropower Project" (No.
5919-TU) dated August 1, 1986 is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. The main features of the project are given in the Loan and Project
Summary and in Annex III.
Project Description and Rationale for Bank Involvement
57.     The project would help support the Government's strategy of reducing
Turkey's electric power deficit through, inter alia, developing economically
Turkey's indigenous energy resources and helping to bring about greater
involvement of the private sector in the energy sector. The Bank would serve
as a catalyst; through providing financial and technical assistance, it would
enable CEAS, a relatively small power company, to finance, construct and
operate a major power plant without direct recourse to public funds and



- 17 -
without imposing an administrative burden on the Turkish Electricity Authority
(TEK), which Is itself preoccupied with the implementation of a major
iovestment program.  The project would consist of the following components:
(a) construction of a thin concrete double curvature arch dam (120 m
high above the foundation and with a crest length of 325 m) at
Sir on the Ceyhan River to form a gross storage reservoir
capacity of 1,120 million M3, spillway, bottom outlet and
intake structures, a powerhouse with three 94.5-MW vertical
Francis turbine generator units, and a switchyard with SF6
switchgear and gas insulated busbars, including associated
consultancy services and the carrying out of a resettlement
program, or provision of idemnification, as required for about
7,000 people currently living in areas to be affected by the
project, including provision of alternative adequate housing and
other community and infrastructure facilities.
(b) transmission line facilities to interconnect the Sir powerhouse
with TEK's 380-kV grid, and subtransmission lines and substation
facilities to efficiently transmit the Sir generation to the load
centers in the CEAS service area; and
(c) technical assistance for studies to improve the existing
facilities of CEAS (Mersin, Seyhan and Kadincik II power
stations); and a regional power transmission study including
"wheeling" of power over the national grid system, training,
procurement of training equipment and upgrading of existing
computer facilities.
Cukurova Elektrik A.S.
58.      CEAS is a limited liability company which supplies electricity within
the Cukurova region in Southern Turkey, which includes the fertile and highly
developed Cilician plain and covers the provinces of Icel, Adana, and Hatay
plus a number of villages in the Kahramanmaras Province (to the east of Ad2na
province) which surround the Sir project site. CEAS was granted a concession
in 1953 for the supply of electricity in the region. It was initially formed
to operate the power portion of the multipurpose Seyhan Project, which was
completed in 1956 with the help of the Bank (Ln. 63-TU). CEAS presently
operates five generating plants. In 1983 CEAS received the approval of SPO
and MENR to build the Sir Hydropower Project and the Duzkesme-Berke Hydropower
project downstream.
59.      CEAS has applied to become a regional utility, as provided for under
Law 3096 of 1984. The Government confirmed during negotiations that it
expects CEAS' application to be approved, subject to a satisfactory outcome to
negotiations between MENR and CEAS. If the application is approved, CEAS
would be restructured as a fully integrated regional utility, possibly taking
over all generation, transmission and distribution facilities in the Cukurova
region. If CEAS becomes a regional utility, its operating revenues would
increase through direct electricity sales to retail customers. On the other
hand, CEAS would incur increased operating and maintenance expenditures
related to che distribution network, which would also require major
investments for rehabilitation and expansion. The possible terms for
transferring to CEAS other generating plants in the region (all hydroelectric)
have not yet been determined. Agreement was reached during negotiations thaL
the Goverrment and CEAS would exchange views with the Bank in respect of any



- 18 -
proposals leading to the restructuring or reorganization of CEAS. An
additional remedy has been included in the event that any action is taken
which may have an adverse impact on the project.
60.      CEAS presently has an authorized share capital of TL 15 billion of
which TL 3.6 billion is paid in. While the Government, through TEK, is the
largest single shareholder, TEK's shares account for only one quarter of the
total capital. Individual investors, trade associations, banks and insurance
companies, and other private firms own the majority of the stock. CEAS's
present installed capacity is 298 MW, of which 192 MW (642) is hydro. The
generating facilities consist of: (i) the 60-MW Seyhan hydroelectric plant;
(ii) the 70-MW Kadincik I hydroelectric plant; (iii) the 56-MW Kadincik II
hydroelectric plant; and (iv) a 106-MW oil-fired steam plant at Mersin. In
addition, CEAS operates a 6-MW hydropower station at Yuregir for which it pays
an annual rental fee to DSI.
61.      In 1985 total net generation by CEAS amounted to 1,394 GWh, compared
to a regional electricity consumption of 2,800 GWh (representing about 10S of
the national electricity consumption) and a peak demand of 502 MW. Because of
earlier restrictions placed on CEAS's ability to construct new generating
facilities, it purchases electricity increasingly from TEK to meet demand in
its concession area. CEAS has been a net purchaser of electricity since
1978. In 1985 TEK's supply accounted for 571 of the energy supplied to the
regional network.
62.      Peak load and electricity consumption in CEAS's concession area
increased at an average rate of 9.1% over the past ten years, mainly as a
result of the region's rapid economic growth. However, actual consunption has
been consistently lower than potential effective demand, estimated to be about
10S higher. Power shortages at the regional level are a reflection of the
pervasive energy deficit observed at the national level as TEK has been unable
to supply all the electricity needed by CEAS to complement its own generation.
63.      About 200 industrial customers account for over half of the regional
electricity consumption. The largest industrial customer in the region is the
Iron and Steel Works at Iskenderun (Isdemir), accounting for over 16S of
regional industrial consumption. This plant has its own generation
capability, but no longer has surplus energy to sell to CEAS. Other major
industrial consumers include textile, cement, and food processing plants. The
remaining share of available bulk supply is then sold by CEAS to TEK's
Toroslar Distribution Enterprise for retail distribution. On TEK'S behalf,
CEAS prepares bills for electricity sales to about 200 villages and
municipalities, but does not collect directly from these retail customers.
Despite the region's rapid industrial development and accompanying
urbanization, about half of the population is still classified as rural, and
of these, almost 901 are connected to the electricity grid as compared with
only 501 in 1975. Overall for the region, almost 95% of the population has
access to electricity, which is high compared to some other regions in Turkey.



- 19 -
64.      CEAS's planning department has prepared a 10-year forecast of
electricity demand in the Cukurova region and carried out an extensive
sensitivity analysis. It is expected that electricity demand will grow at an
average rate of 102 per annum over the 1986-1994 period, with industry's share
in the total remaining constant at about 60X. Net sales to the Cukurova
region are expected to reach 6,312 GWh by 1994 (as compared to 2,800 GWh in
1985) and peak demand 1,102 MW.
65.      The proposed Sir hydropower plant, to be commissioned in 1991, would
be CEAS's only new generating capacity coming on stream during the 1986-1994
period, in addition to the possible rehabilitation of the Mersin plant and its
conversion to combined cycle operation. Generation from Sir (projected at 725
GWh per annum without irrigation) would partially meet the increase in
electricity demand. The remaining deficit would have to be met by additional
transfers from TEK through the national grid. By 1990, purchases from TEK are
expected to represent 73Z of the energy supplied to the regional network, but
this share would decrease after Sir is commissioned. CEAS's ten-year forecast
balance of energy and capacity for the Cukurova region has been communicated
to MENR and TEK for use in the preparation of the national forecast balance of
energy and capacity. However, there is no contract between TEK and CEAS
concerning their annual exchanges of electricity. Instead, MENR collects
information from both utilities on the expected available supply and then
issues instructions to CEAS and TEK on the amount of electricity which in
principle should be exchanged between them during the year.  However, in the
event of power shortages at the national level, CEAS remains subject to
load-shedding measures to the same extent as other regions in Turkey.
66.      Primarily a wholesaler of power, CEAS operates a transmission grid
down to the 15-kV voltage, plus some of the 6-kV lines in the region.
Altogether CEAS owns and operates about 2,200 km of transmission and
distribution lines at 154, 66, 30, 15 and 6 kV. The operation of the CEAS
power system is controlled from a telephone-operated dispatch center at
Seyhan. However, there is inadequate coordination between TEK and CEAS
regarding optimization of the generation scheduling and planned plant
outages. Under the proposed project, technical assistance would be provided
to identify the requirements for improving CEAS's load dispatch operations and
their interface with TEK's system. Losses on CEAS's network are reasonable,
amounting to about 4% of the electricity supplied.
67.      The 380-kV substations and lines within the Cukurova region are part
of the national power grid owned and operated by TEK. CEAS interconnects with
this 380-kV grid at TEK's Erzin substation. Two additional interconnection
points at the 154-kV level exist at the Toroslar and Osmaniye substations.
TEK will construct an additional 380/154-kV substation at Adana, which is
being built under the Bank financed Fourth TEK Transmission Project (Loan
2586-TU). The distribution system within the CEAS concession area is owned
and operated by TEK, through the Toroslar Distribution Enterprise, which is
one of eighteen regional distribution enterprises formed in 1982 when the
responsibility for retail sales was transferred from the municipalities to TEK.

Implementation
68.      CEAS would be responsible for project Implementation.
Land Acquisition and Resettlement
69.      The laws and procedures relating to resettlement have been reviewed
and are considered to contain adequate provisions to protect the rights of the
population to be resettled. Land needed for public purposes may be acquired
compulsorily in Turkey in accordance with the Expropriation Law of 1983. This
is a three-step procedure. Firstly, the project agency offers to purchase the
land from the landowner through normal negotiations for the sale and purchase
of land. In the event the landowner does not wish to sell, a notice is filed
for compulsory acquisition in the public interest pursuant to the 1983
Expropriation Law. Under the Law, a permanent committee in each
province--consisting of local representatives, land experts and members of the
administration--determines the value of land in such cases. Land values are
determined at market value. In the event there is disagreement, the third
step is to take the matter to the courts. There are, in addition, procedures
for resettlement of displaced populations. Landowners are given the option
either to be resettled or to take cash compensation. Usually, it is the
Resettlement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural
Affairs (MAFRA) that makes available other land for displaced populations.
The cost of resettlement is borne by the project agency. Current resettlement
procedures specify that dam construction and resettlement should be carried
out in a coordinated manner and that priority should be given to the
resettlement of people whose land would be submerged due to dam construction.
In view of the delicate and sensitive issues associated with the resettlement
operations, the Prime Minister has ordered the various agencies involved to
fully cooperate with MAFRA in finalizing resettlement issues quickly.
70.      The Sir Dam reservoir covers about 48 kmz of surface area and would
affect nine villages having about 7,000 inhabitants (about 1800 families) in
houses which are mostly built with sun-dried bricks, stones, and briquettes.
The farms in the reservoir area consist of small scattered pieces of land, and
their produce is mostly for their own consumption. About 5,000 hectares of
land will need to be acquired for the project. CEAS has agreed to acquire the
necessary land in accordance with a time table agreed with the Bank. CEAS has
been preparing detailed surveys of the many smallholdings in the project area
for the last year and this work is continuing. This land includes 1,400
hectares of arable flat land, mostly devoted to maize and cotton, and 1,900
hectares of arid land or steep slopes. Forest covers around 600 hectares and
vineyards and gardens a further 400 hectares. The balance comprises rivers
(400 ha), villages (100 ha) and unregistered land (200 ha).
71.      In the most recently constructed hydroelectric project financed by
the Bank, impounding of the reservoir has just begun. All the property
affected has already been acquired and the measures taken by the Government to
resettle the affected population are considered satisfactory. For the
proposed Project, the Government has agreed to carry out with CEAS a
resettlement program for the affected inhabitants, including provision of
alternative adquate housing and other community and infrastructure
facilities. There is adequate suitable land within the province and
landowners opting for relocation would first be offered this government-owned
land. If this is not acceptable to them, they would then be offered land in



- 21 -
other provinces. New agricultural land is currently being developed in the
region through irrigation projects. Landowners who opt for indemnification
rather the resettlement will be compensated in cash. The overall program has
been drawn up by the provincial Directorate of Real Estate and Expropriation.
The detailed resettlement program will be in three parts. The first part
covers all the population (between 300 and 400 families) which will be
affected in the first year. These landholdings cover a 100-hectare area
required for the construction of the dam, access roads, and construction
camp. Negotiations with these landowners have already been concluded. All
opeted for the cash compensation proposed by the provincial expropriation
committee rather than resettlement. None appealed to the courts. CEAS has
already signed contracts for the construction of a replacement school, health
center and police station. The second part of the program will cover the land
affected during the second and third years by the completion of the diversion
works and the third part will cover the land to be flooded on completion of
the dam in 1990. CEAS has agreed to furnish to the Bank, not later than March
31, 1987, a detailed plan of action satisfactory to the Bank for the areas
affected during the first three years of project execution and a similar
comprehansive plan for the remaining affected areas by December 31, 1987, and
to promptly carry out the resettlement program in accordance with those
plans. In view of the satisfactory record of the Government in handling
resettlement issues, these proposals are considered acceptable. The
resettlement program will be closely monitored by the Bank during project
implementation. A sociologist will be included in supervision missions to
provide technical assistance to the implementing agencies.
Environmental Impact
72.      Cukurova University, Adana, conducted a study (September 1984) of the
environmental impact of the Sir and Duzkesme dams. The report states that the
forests in the project area have been depleted by fires, and felling for
lumber and firewood. The Sir and Duzkesme dam reservoirs are expected to have
beneficial effects on the climate of the region, and would assist plant life
and reforestation. There are no endangered plant species or plant types that
need preservation in the areas to be flooded by the two dams. The geology and
mineralogy of the reservoir area is such that no significant changes in water
quality are anticipated. The formation of the new shoreline around the
reservoir would create a new ecosystem with milder climatic conditions.
Presently the fishing potential in the river and streams in the project area
has not been developed. The report suggests introducing productive fish
species in the reservoir area. It also recommends recreational use of the
proposed reservoirs. The report identifies six sites with potential
archeological value. CEAS is discussing the environmental and archeological
issues with the Government to ensure timely and appropriate action on the part
of the concerned agencies.
Project Cost and Financing
73.      The total cost of the proposed project, including physical and price
contingencies and interest during construction ,would be about $259 million of
which about $132 million would be in foreign exchange (all in July 1985
prices). CEAS is exempt from import taxes and duties for projects under
construction. Although CEAS will pay Value Added Tax (VAT) on project
expenditures, these amounts would subsequently be recovered by CEAS and
therefore VAT is not included in the project cost. Overall physical



- 22 -
contingencies of about 10% have been added except for the items of land
acquisition, preliminary works and civil works, for which about 152 physical
contingencies have been included. These overall contingencies are in addition
to the specific allowances of 25Z (excavation) and 5Z (concreting) included in
estimates of quantities for the dam and upstream coffer dam. Similarly,
specific allowances of 5S have been included for the hydraulic and
electro-mechanical equipment. These overall contingencies and specific
allowances are considered adequate. The above estimates include price
escalation at 7.2 percent for 1986, 6.8 percent for 1987 and 1988, 7 percent
in 1989, 7.1 percent in 1990 and 4 percent thereafter . While local costs in
TL are expected to increase at a faster rate, it is assumed that the
Government will maintain current exchange rate polices which compensate for
differences between local and foreign inflation. It is estimated that 102
man-months of consultants are required for completing the four studies
included in the technical assistance component.
74.      The total foreign and local ex-factory cost of the project, including
interest during construction (US$132 million), is proposed to be covered by
the Bank loan to the Government. It would be onlent on at least the same
terms to CEAS. 1/ The Bank luan would finance: (a) the foreign cost of civil
works, the engineering consultants and experts required for engineering and
supervision of the project, and the technical assistance (studies, training,
and equipment): and (b) the foreign and local ex-factory cost of supply and
installation of material and equipment. In addition, in view of the
considerable foreign exchange cash flow needs during the construction period
of the project, the loan amount would also cover the interest during
construction on the Bank loan. All local costs would be borne by CEAS. The
signing of a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
CEAS's Financial Position
75.      CEAS has enjoyed a very healthy financial position in recent years,
due largely to the Government's pricing policy and the regulatory
environment. While electricity tariffs increased steadily in real terms from
the beginning of 1984 to April, 1985, the operating costs of CEAS' existing
hydropower stations remained low. Given that between 1970 and 1983 CEAS was
not authorized to begin construction of new generating facilities, and
distribution investments were also outside its realm, CEAS had been incurring
minimal annual capital expenditures before beginning investments on the Sir
Hydropower Plant in 1985. As a result of these factors, CEAS has been able to
accumulate substantial reserves in recent years. The estimated return on net
revalued assets in service in 1984 was 11X. Net income in 1985 was 192 of
gross revenues cf TL86 billion (approximately $150 million equivalent) on
sales of 2,800 GWh.
1/ The borrower may charge CEAS a one time fee of no more than 3 percent in
addition to the standard Bank terms.

76.      CEAS has exercised cautious cash management practices.  It has no
major customers in arrears; receivables over three months old amount to less
than 1% of total sales. CEAS has maintained a current ratio of over 1.2 since
1980. Debt service coverage to date has been more than adequate given that
CEAS has contracted no new borrowings, other than limited medium-term local
debt, since 1971. In 1985 cash generation covered debt service obligations
about 8 times.
77.      Since CEAS is adequately capitalized and not highly leveraged, it is
presently in a strong position to undertake the proposed project. The
debt/equity ratio for CEAS at the end of 1984 was about 10/90, when equity is
restated to reflect estimated asset revaluation.  CEAS presently has an
authorized share capital of TL 15 billion of which TL 3.6 billion (about
$6 million in book value) has been paid in, following an issue of new shares
in 1983 and again in 1985. CEAS is subject to the provisions of the Capital
Markets Law, issued in 1981, and to the Capital Markets Board (SPK), which was
established to carry out the Government's policy of strengthening the
regulation of capital markets and protecting the rights of shareholders. For
any capital increase up to the authorized level, CEAS must obtain clearance
from the SPK, the application being accompanied by a three-year financial
forecast, which will allow the SPK to determine whether the company is likely
to be in a strong enough financial position to pay an adequate return to its
shareholders. To date CEAS has had no difficulty in obtaining permission for
new share issues. Agreement was reached during negotiations that CEAS would
supply the Bank by December 31 of each year an updated financing plan for the
entire implementation period of the project. Agreement was also reached that
CEAS would not carry out major new investments (costing more than $25 million)
without the consent of the Bank, except for those facilities included in the
project and the Duzkesme Berke Hydropower project.
78.      Turkey has a policy of uniform tariffs across regions; the tariffs
applicable to consumers throughout other parts of Turkey have always applied
to customers within the CEAS concession area as well. The timing and level of
tariff increases on the national level to date have been determined by power
subsector financing requirements and by fuel cost adjustments, and occur in
response to an application from TEK and/or CEAS to the Government. It was
agreed during negotiations that CEAS would continue to charge its customers
prices in accordance with procedures currently in force.
Audits
79.      CEAS prepares its financial statements on a timely basis.  The
Turkish Commercial Code requires that the annual financial report be submitted
by mid-March, two weeks prior to the annual shareholders meeting. The audit
is carried out subsequently by qualified independent Turkish auditors.
Agreement was reached during negotiations that CEAS would submit its annual
financial statements to the Bank not later than five months and audited
financial statements not later than nine months after the close of each year.
Procurement and Disbursement
80.      All Bank-financed procurement for civil works, and supply and
installation of material and equipment, would be according to the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines. Procurement of consultants' services would be done
according to the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.



- 24 -
81.      International Competitive Bidding (ICB) according to the Bank's
procurement guidelines would be followed for the following:
(a)   civil works (excluding river diversion tunnel);
(b)   supply and installation of hydraulic equipment;
(c)   supply and installation of electro-mechanical equipment;
(d)   supply and installation of powerhouse switchyard equipment;
(e)   supply and erection of towers and erection of transmission
lines;
(f)   supply of transmission line conductors and accessories;
%g)   supply of insulators and hardware;
(h)   supply and installation of substation switchgear equipment
including cables; and
Ci)   supply and installation of transformers.
It is likely that domestic manufacturers may submit bids against items (b) and
(e) through (i). In case a contract is awarded to domestic manufacturers, the
Bank would finance the ex-factory amount of the contract. Qualifying domestic
manufacturers will receive preference in bid evaluation of 151 or the
prevailing import duty, whichever is lower. For electromechanical equipment,
the domestic content of each bid will be given preference by adding the
applicable tariff or 15X, whichever is less, to the CIF component representing
the imported elements in the package.
82.      International shopping according to the Bank's Guidelines would be
used for procurement of: (a) training equipment; and (b) miscellaneous tools,
instruments, and relays for substations and transmission lines. Such
procurement would involve obtaining offers from at least three foreign
suppliers and would be limited to US$20,000 per contract and US$200,000 in the
aggregate. Direct contracting would be used for upgrading of CEAS's existing
computer facilities. Total foreign expenditure under this procedure would be
limited to about $500,000.
83.      CEAS has already appointed the engineering consultant for thp dam and
the powerhouse, and has also appointed an International Board of Experts to
review the dam design and associated problems during construction, and to
review the progress of construction works. CEAS would appoint engineering
consultants for engineering and supervision during construction of the
transmission lines and for studies under the technical assistance component.
84.      The Bank would not finance the following costs of the civil works and
supply and installation of material and equipment procured according to local
competitive bidding procedures: (a) river diversion tunnel; (b) the owners
camp; and (c) materials and equipment for transmission lines and substations.
Local shopping procedures would be used for: (a) miscellaneous civil works;
(b) temporary bridge and site access roads; (c) miscellaneous boring and
drilling required for the site investigation; and (d) engineering consultants



- 25 -
for the engineering and supervision during construction of the substations.
Considering the amount involved (about 13Z of the project cost), the above
proposals for procurement following local competitive bidding and local
shopping procedures are economical and efficient. The Bank would permit the
use of Statements of Expenditure for contracts valued up to $20,000 equivalent
to assist CEAS in making timely payments to contractors. CEAS would retain
the supporting documents and make them available for inspection by Bank
supervision missions and external auditors. All payment requests would be
fully documented. A special account of $10.0 million would he established to
maintain an adequate flow of funds. Retroactive financing of up to $5 million
would be allowed to cover expenditures for engineering consultants and the
advance payments for the main civil works contract, to ensure maintaining the
project's implementation schedule. Because of the seasonal nature of rainfall
in the project area, a short delay in placing the main civil works contract
may lead to a significant delay in project completion and commissioning. The
estimated disbursement schedule follows the Bank's standard disbursement
profile for EMENA power projects.
85.      The procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below:

Project Justification
86.      In addition to promoting the role of the private sector in all
aspects of the electricity subsector, an important component of the
Government's energy strategy is the economic and least-cost development of
indigenous resources, especially hydropower. The role and importance of
hydropower resource development has been reviewed in a Bank sector study.
Under the Kayraktepe Hydropower project financed by the Bank (Loan. 2655-TU),
the Government will undertake a systematic review of all hydropower resources
within Turkey and raiik them on a comparable cost basis. This will be of major
assistance to the Government in planning the optimal development of the
hydropower subsector.
87.      In connection with the preparation of the proposed project, the Bank
reviewed a numbc:r of studies on hydropower projects and concluded that the Sir
Hydropower Project fell well within the range of economically viable
hydropower projects in Turkey. In addition, as part of the appraisal of the
Elbistan Rehabilitation Project (Ln. 2650-TU), an extensive review of the cost
of thermal alternatives was carried out, which shows that the proposed Sir
hydropower Project would generate electricity at lower cost than any other
baseload thermal plant included in the expansion program for the power
subsector and most of the hydropower plants.
88.      Since the project forms a part of the national 1985-1995 expansion
program, the economic rate of return on the whole timeslice power investment
program for 1985-1995 was calculated. The return on the program is estimated
at just over 11.5% compared to an estimated opportunity cost of capital of
12_, reflecting the fact that tariffs are slightly below the economic cost of
supply as measured by the long-run marginal cost. However, this calculation
understates the real economic return since the measurement of benefits
underestimates the willingness to pay for electricity.
Project Risks
89.      The geological investigation carried out in the foundation area of
the dam and other structures was generally adequate. Results of additional
investigations carried out at the suggestion of the Bank's consultant have
been taken into account in the final design. There is a risk that unexpected
geological difficulties during construction might cause unexpected delays and
increase the project cost. This risk would be mitigated by providing expert
geological supervision during excavation of foundation and foundation
grouting. Furthermore, where it is difficult to assess the quantity of work
with accuracy, sufficient contingency allowances have been included in the
project cost.
90.      It is expected that during the course of project implementation CEAS
will be restructured to allow for the expansion of its operations in the
Cukurova Region. This restructuring may also have implications for the
financial viability of the company. Accordingly the Government and CEAS would
undertake to discuss with the Bank any proposals involving the restructuring
or reorganization of the company.
