F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective of the project is to increase Croatia's trade competitiveness by improving
the international transport chain through the Rijeka Gateway for both freight and passengers
traffic through modernizing the port and road network connections, and privatizing port
operations. Specific objectives include: (i) increasing efficiency and improving financial, social
and environmental conditions at Rijeka Port, rehabilitating infrastructure and replacing
equipment; (ii) preparing to redevelop part of Rijeka Port for urban purposes; and (iii) improving
international road connections linked to the Rijeka gateway, and the administration of the road
sector.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

When the Rijeka Gateway Project was being prepared from 1999 to 2003, Croatia had undergone
a profound economic and institutional transformation since its independence. Consolidating itself
as an independent nation led to a war with all the associated social and economic costs. Output
collapsed by at least one-third. Peace was expensive in terms of investment for reconstruction,
mitigation of the social consequences of war and overcoming hyperinflation. By 2003, Croatia
had almost recovered its pre-independence level of output. The Project supported the CAS
objectives of (i) strengthening market institutions and competitiveness and (ii) increasing private
sector involvement in financing and operating transport sector infrastructure and services. In the
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), “A Strategy for Growth through European
Integration?1, the Bank recommendation to Croatia was that it must complete its transition to a
modern market economy to unlock its growth potential. Among the key constraints to sustainable
growth were the following: (i) the privatization strategy chosen in the 1990s had not been
conducive to enterprise restructuring and job creation and (ii) there had been a propensity to
“protect? jobs through expensive employment protection programs or through subsidies to loss-
making state owned enterprises.

According to the CEM, road infrastructure increased significantly from 1995 to 2003 - kilometers
of motorways increased by over a third. The Government planned (i) to rapidly develop its
motorway network to about 1,330 km within the next 10 to 15 years with an interim target of
850km for 2005 and (ii) to improve the road network by increasing investment in maintenance.
The CEM reported that maritime transport was in decline. The tons of goods carried by ocean-
going vessels fell by around 15 percent. The only exception to the decline was in passenger
transport on ocean going vessels, which had risen 17 percent since 1995 and 142 percent since
independence. The nature of maritime traffic also changed. There had been a steady decline in the
quantity of goods coming into Croatian ports intended for other countries within the region –
particularly as Serbia and Montenegro and Slovenia no longer used the Port of Rijeka and related
land transport for their own exports and imports to any great degree. Economic restructuring had
resulted in a reduction in the movement of heavy goods, a tendency to use roads and an increase
in the importance of trade with Western Europe. The 58 percent share of trade by volume that
was channeled through ports was predominately international business between Croatia and the
rest of the world.

At Appraisal, the main sector issues and the Government strategy were as follows:

Improving the economic role of the Rijeka Port. Rijeka is the largest international seaport in
Croatia. However, between 1980 and 1997, the Port of Rijeka lost almost 70 percent of its
throughput in general and bulk cargo. The considerations to support the reestablishment of Rijeka
were: (i) peace and political stability within the Balkans, (ii) Rijeka’s competitive advantage as
the only deep water port in the northern Adriatic, (iii) Rijeka’s historic role as the primary
gateway for Hungary, (iv) the resumption of traffic to and from the former Republic of
Yugoslavia, (v) the increasing involvement of the private sector in port operations, (vi) the

    Report No. 25434-HR, July 2003
                                                                                                 1
improvement in land connections, (vii) the Government’s decision to rationalize the Croatia port
system by concentrating international traffic at Rijeka and Ploce2, and (viii) the strategic location
of Rijeka as the gateway for one of the main Trans-European corridors, and the fact that it is both
a port and a destination for business being the third largest city in Croatia. It offers the shortest
land transport distance to reach Belgrade in Serbia and Budapest in Hungary and is located less
than 25 km away from the EU border.

Privatizing of Port Operations. The Government had started reform of port operations, including:
(i) the adoption of a new port law; (ii) the creation of a landlord port authority at Rijeka – the Port
of Rijeka Authority (PRA); and (iii) the initiation of port concessions financed under a PHRD
grant. The Government granted Luka Rijeka 3 (LR, port operating company) a global 12-year
priority concession to operate the port to 2012. The intention was to privatize LR during the
priority concession period. The agreed upon time frame for privatization of the port operations -
as expressed in tons operated by the private sector/total port tonnage per year - was as follows:
from 0 percent in 2004 to 30 percent in 2005, 50 percent in 2006 and 80 percent in 2008. Real
ownership rights for the concession were an obstacle to private financing. The Ministry of
Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications (MMATC) was preparing appropriate
amendments to the Maritime and Seaport Act.

Addressing the Redundancy of Port Staff. LR’s financial capacities were very limited due to low
levels of activity and overstaffing. LR could not meet the demand for performance, quality, and
competitiveness – thus, staffing level needed to be addressed. After a consultant study, the LR
Management acknowledged a staff surplus between 550 and 650 out of a total staff of around
1,400, in a scenario of moderately growing traffic. Reduction of staff level as well as social
protection for the redundant port staff were important issues for the Government.

Supporting Urban Redevelopment at the Rijeka Port. The Port of Rijeka was an old industrial
facility that stretched for several kilometers along the waterfront in the middle of the city,
creating a barrier to the Adriatic. Port traffic passed through city streets, contributing to traffic
congestion and increasing the cost of urban transport. Urban planning was difficult because port
property was maritime domain, i.e. administrated by the central Government. Much of the prime
potential waterfront area was occupied by dilapidated warehouses that were no longer suitable for
modern port operations. The Municipality and the Port were aware that other cities (e.g.
Baltimore, Bilbao, and New Orleans) had redeveloped old port areas as attractive and profitable
retail, office and public space on a public-private partnership basis.

Revising the Motorway and Road Program. As a part of the Bank’s sector dialogue, the
Government recognized the motorway program was not sustainable. The Bank assisted the
Government in defining a reduced program to be funded from a combination of tolls, extra-
budgetary fuel taxes and the state budget. At the same time, the road sector was reorganized into:
(i) Hrvatske Autoceste (HAC), responsible for the motorway network; and (ii) Hrvatske Ceste
(HC), responsible for the management of all other state roads which constitute the vast majority
of the network. The Bank’s Highway Sector Project4 contributed to maintenance expenditures

more than doubling from 1995 to 1998, but expenditures subsequently fell again due to the
diversion of funds to the motorway program Under the revised program, the Government would
provide an average of US$140 million for road maintenance financed from extra-budgetary
sources of fuel taxes, vehicle registration fees and budgetary support. This was almost in line with
the Bank recommended US$170 million p.a. needed to catch up with the backlog over six years.
In a Project Policy Letter, the Government expressed support for the strategy of a gradual
increase in road maintenance funding.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The overall objective of the Project was to increase Croatia’s trade competitiveness by improving
the international transport chain through the Rijeka Gateway for both freight and passenger traffic
through modernizing the port and road network connections, and privatizing port operations.
Specific objectives included: (i) increasing the efficiency and improving financial, social, and
environmental conditions at the Rijeka Port, rehabilitating infrastructure and replacing
equipment; (ii) preparing to redevelop part of the Rijeka Port for urban purposes; and (iii)
improving international road connections linked to the Rijeka Gateway, and the administration of
the road sector5.

Achievement of the PDO was to be confirmed by using the following key indicators:6

        Port operation performances7 are improving along the benchmark detailed in Annex 10
        Total Rijeka port traffic increases by an average 7% p.a. from 2004 to 2009, and
         passenger traffic increases by an average 5% p.a.
        Percentage of private sector participation in Rijeka port operations increases from 0% in
         2004 to 30% in 2005, 50% in 2006, and 80% in 2008 (expressed in tons operated by the
         private sector/total port tonnage.)8
        The ratio of total operating expenses (incl. asset depreciation) of Port of Rijeka Authority
         (PRA) to total operating revenues (excl. Government subsidies) declines from 240% in
         2002 to 150% in 2009
        In cooperation with the Municipality of Rijeka, and through a public competitive bidding
         process, a developer is selected to redevelop Delta and Porto Baros area9.
        Truck total transit time through the city of Rijeka reduced from an average one hour in
         2002 to less than 20 minutes in 2006.

    In the October 2010 restructuring, the implementation schedule was revised. A developer for the urban
redevelopment would be selected by December 2011.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by the original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification.

An Additional Financing in the amount of €35.3 million (US$48.0 million equivalent) was
approved for PRA in May 2007 to fund a financing gap for Component 1 of the Project. The
PDO and the key indicators were not revised.

In the October 22, 2010 Restructuring, the time schedule for achieving privatization of 80 percent
of port operations and for the selection of a developer for the Delta and Porto Baros were pushed
back from 2008 to 2001. The intermediate indicators to measure construction progress at the
Brajdica and Zagreb container terminals were added.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the Project were the PRA, the City of Rijeka and its residents, transit
traffic, road users and the Government. The Port benefitted by improving efficiencies which
reduced operating costs. The City of Rijeka saw a large increase in its access to the seafront with
the reopening and extension of the breakwater and the development of a new passenger terminal.
The Rijeka residents benefited by improved living conditions due to the reduction of transit traffic
(i.e., less traffic congestion and air and noise pollution). The road users benefited from road
investments made possible by reduced road vehicle operating costs and times. The elimination of
traffic black spots reduced traffic accidents and fatalities. The Government benefited by a
reduction of its financial contributions towards the Rijeka Port, which was made possible by
improved port operations. The separation of redundant port workers in a socially acceptable way
increased labor productivity and increased opportunities for the remaining port workers.

1.5 Original Components

The original Project of US$156.5 million equivalent involved three Borrowers: (i) the PRA;
US$55.1 million, (ii) HAC; €15.7 million, and (iii) HC; €76.2 million. The Republic of Croatia
was the Guarantor. Under the loan to the PRA, LR was an implementing entity and a subsidiary
loan agreement of US$8.1 million was concluded between the PRA and LR. LR was a party to a
Project Agreement with the Bank. The Project was expected to fund the following three
components:

Component 1: Port Restructuring and Modernization (US$75.10 million, US$50.2 million
financed by the Bank)

       Rehabilitation of port infrastructure and superstructure: rehabilitation works in the
        western part of the port to allow a smooth transfer of operations related to the handling of
        woods and timbers. [PRA]
       Demolition of existing warehouses and reconstruction of new ones in the Zagrebacko and
        Prasko Berth areas: light modular multi-functional warehouses to be constructed [PRA]
       Rehabilitation of Becko Berth [PRA]
       Construction of multi-purpose terminal at Zagrebacko Berth – construction of a berthing
        facility of 250 m length which would allow vessels of 15 meter draft to service the port.
        [PRA]
       Provision of traffic safety equipment [PRA]

                                                                                                  4
       Provision of antipollution equipment [PRA]
       Provision of heavy cargo handling equipment [PRA]
       Management modernization: various kinds of technical assistance, including privatization
        advice, drafting of technical ToRs, preparation of contracts and supervision of works.
        [PRA]
       Information technology modernization: Electronic Data Interchange [PRA]
       Severance payment – based on LR’s social plan proposal a severance would be financed
        under the Project. A well-publicized voluntary program under a limited time offer would
        be followed by an involuntary program to be worked out with the unions. [PRA/LR]
       Audit and financial management system [PRA]

Component 2: Port/City Interface Redevelopment (US$43.20 million, US$24.6 million Bank-
financed)

       Preparation works at the Delta and Porto Baros areas: transfer of port operations in these
        areas and preparation works for the areas to be redeveloped. [PRA]
       Construction of a new passenger terminal [PRA]
       Construction of Draga-Brajdica connecting road D-404 - a 4 km long road linking the
        Rijeka Bypass to the Port of Rijeka reducing heaving truck traffic through the congested
        city center. [HC]

Component 3: International Road Improvements (US$144.8 million, US$78.7 million Bank-
financed)

       HC management capacity improvement (software, TA, supervision consultants and
        training). [HC]
       Pavement and bridge management systems. [HC]
       Vehicle overloading monitoring system. [HC]
       HAC capacity improvement and training of HAC PIU staff [HAC]
       Construction of the Orehovic – Draga – Sv. Kuzam section of the Rijeka Bypass: this
        would complete the western section of the Rijeka Bypass, relieving traffic congestion and
        providing a through link for tourist traffic from Italy/Slovenia/Central Europe to the
        Dalmatian coast. [HC]
       Elimination of 30 black spots. [HC]
       Krk Bridge rehabilitation: this bridge provides the only road, electricity, water and oil
        (pipeline) connection from the mainland to the island of Krk where the Rijeka Airport
        and the Omisalj Oil Terminal are located. [HAC]

Component 4: Reimbursement of Project Preparation Facility (US$1.5 million)
    Five preparatory studies for the port component were completed. [PRA]

1.6 Revised Component

There was no formal revision of the components, although some subcomponents were in essence
dropped as they could not be implemented as originally planned (see below). Under Component 1,
several warehouses that were originally expected to be demolished under the Project were
ultimately preserved as buildings of historical significance. This meant that the western section of
the port could not be rehabilitated and new warehouses were not built. The construction of a
                                                                                                   5
multi-purpose terminal at Zagreb Pier was also revised to a container terminal because of
commercial needs. Funding for the extension of the Brajdica Container Terminal was not
originally covered in the Project (RG I), but under the Second Rijeka Gateway Project (RG II)
which was approved in 2008. In order to optimize the use of funds under RG I and RG II, the
restructuring in October 2010 included the funding of Brajdica under RG I.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

An Additional Financing in the amount of €35.3 million (US$48.0 million) for the PRA was
approved in May 2007 to cover costs associated with (i) cost overrun to complete the main port
component of the Zagreb Terminal and (ii) financing gap in technical services to prepare the
concession agreement for the Zagreb Terminal. The closing date for the PRA Loans was extended
from September 30, 2009 to December 31, 2010.

Second Rijeka Gateway Project (RG II) in the amount of €84 million (US$122.5 million) was
approved in November 2008. While RG II was processed as a new operation, it covered and
extended the activities initiated under the RG I. RG II funded (i) port terminal development for
the Brajdica and Zagreb Container Terminals; (ii) port service enhancement including support in
concessioning selected terminals, equipment and technical services for information flow
integration and secured port access, enhanced environmental response, and support for
Masterplan implementation; and (iii) Project implementation.

The project was restructured six times:

September 19, 2007: Level two restructuring approved for Loan 4714 HR which was extended to
HAC.      An amount of €7 million was cancelled because the awarded contract price was
substantially lower than the estimate.

February 24, 2010: Level two restructuring approved for Loan 4714 HR which was extended to
HAC. An amount of €500,000 was cancelled due to cost savings.

July 12, 2010: Level two restructuring approved for Loans 4715 HR and 4715-1HR which were
extended to the PRA. For all of the categories under the Loans, the percentages of expenditures to
be financed under the Loans were amended to 100 percent.

October 22, 2010: Level two restructuring approved for Loan 4714 HR for HAC and for Loans
4715 HR, 4715-1HR and 4716 HR for the PRA. This restructuring encompassed the following:

       A one-time waiver of financial covenants: debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for HAC
        for 2010, DSCR for LR for 2010; and operating ratio for the PRA for 2009. The financial
        crisis in 2009 significantly impacted the financial conditions of these three entities.
       Extension of the closing date for the Additional Loan for the PRA from December 31,
        2010 to September 30, 2012.
       Intermediate indicator targets were adjusted to reflect implementation status.
       Revision of time schedules for Project indicators: the Project’s end targets and results
        remained unchanged. The implementation time schedules were extended for private
        sector participation in port operations and for the selection of a developer for the urban
        redevelopment.

         Financing: to ensure that the available financing for the PRA was fully utilized, the PRA
          would first draw on its loans under RG I to finance the construction of the Brajdica and
          Zagreb Container Terminals, prior to drawing on its loan under RG II. Therefore RG I
          would finance a larger share of the Brajdica Terminal and a smaller share of the Zagreb
          Terminal than originally anticipated.

November 26, 2010: Level two restructuring for Loan 4714 HR for HAC and for Loan 4715 HR
for the PRA. This restructuring reallocated proceeds for the different categories for both loans
and extended the closing date for Loan 4715 HR from December 31, 2010 to August 31, 201110.

July 23, 2012: Level two restructuring for Loan 4716 HR for the PRA for the cancellation of €15
million from the Additional Financing.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Project underwent an extended preparation period. The first identification mission was in
June 1999 while the PCN was in June 2002 with the Board date in May 2003. The long gestation
period was understandable given that the Project was extremely complex 12 . The preparation
missions were combined with other activities in the country because during this period, the Bank
had extensive transport activities in Croatia in highway, in rail, in emergency transport and
landmines clearance, and in urban transport13. The Project was initially prepared as a road project
and a port project but was combined to reduce preparation and supervision expenses.

In preparing the Project, the Bank had detailed knowledge of the road sector, given the on-going
transport projects - and the counterparts were experienced in working with IFIs. The Bank’s
efforts had been focused on the port, because the Bank had not been involved in Croatia’s port
sector before. There was a PHRD grant for technical assistance to revamp the Maritime Law, to
develop plans to improve productivity and commercial orientation of the port and to prepare an
economically justified and prioritized Master Plan. There was also a Project Preparation Facility
(PPF) under which five preparatory studies for the port component were completed: (i) detailed


11
   The Additional Financing to the PRA had the latest Project closing date of September 30, 2012. The loans to the
PRA, HC, and HAC closed prior to that date.
12
   This was a very complex project with: (i) port investments (civil works, port equipment, information technology); (ii)
road investments (with tunnels and bridges); (iii) traffic safety improvements for both port and roads, maintenance and
other road technology investment; (v) private sector participation; (vi) a redundancy program; (vii) urban design and re-
development; (viii) environmental improvements and safeguards; (ix) land acquisitions; and (x) institutional reform
dimensions. There were three borrowers that were under the jurisdiction of two different ministries, three PIUs, and
three loan agreements.
13
    There were Highway Sector Projects, Emergency Transport and Landmine Clearance Project, Railway
Modernization and Restructuring Projects and the Zagreb Urban Transport Study.
                                                                                                                       8
engineering and Project design, (ii) study on port/urban redevelopment, (iii) environmental
assessment summary for the entire Project, (iv) business plan for LR, and (v) social plan for LR.
Throughout the period of preparation, there were many outreaches to the stakeholders - with
particular efforts to three trade unions active in the port. There were public workshops on
environmental assessment and on the modernization of the Rijeka Port. Using Project funds to
finance staff redundancy was sensitive, thus, this subcomponent received the Bank managing
director’s endorsement before finalization.

The Project design was complex, innovative and - in retrospect maybe - overly ambitious. This
could easily have been two if not three separate projects. Although two-thirds of the Project
financing was going to the road sector, a strong focus was placed on the Rijeka Port, as the port
modernization had many institutional and reform features. The redevelopment of the Delta and
Porto Baros areas was innovative and cross-sector; the D- 404 connector road and the Rijeka
Bypass was a multi-modal, holistic approach to a transport project. The Project Policy Letter from
the Government set out the measures required 14 in order to meet the Project objectives. The
preparation team had the proper skills mix; the task manager was a port specialist. The
preparation team included experienced specialists in transport economics, road engineering,
environment engineering, finance, local technical expertise, environment, and social safeguards.
Given Rijeka’s position in the country transport logistics and the Bank’s activity in the transport
sector, support to the PRA was the logical next step in the Bank’s dialogue and engagement in the
country.

The Project was solid at entry because of the time and expertise expended in preparation 15 ,
although there was no QER or other review. The quality of the PAD was good, with detailed
sector and Project analysis. The Decision Meeting reviewers raised relevant questions - some of
which foreshadowed the problems that would arise during Project implementation. This included
the country manager stating that her impression from a conversation with the Deputy Prime
Minister was that, “it would be extremely difficult to advance changes in the area of the Maritime
Domain, and reasons for that are multiple.? Another reviewer questioned the sequencing of
activities and wanted to see more progress on the privatization prior to going ahead with the port
infrastructure investments16. The complexity of the Project design was not questioned - except
one reviewer mentioned that the limitation of Board slots was not a valid reason to combine
projects. The Decision Meeting reviewers did not question the technical /engineering aspects of
the Project. This project involved lengthy road tunnels, steep and mountainous terrain, and deep
water marine construction - yet the technical risks were not identified as a possible risk in the
PAD17. The Bank relied on geotechnical surveys completed by the borrowers in earlier studies.
Technical capacity in Croatia had generally been good, and re-doing the geotechnical surveys



14
   (a) Legislative changes: (i) the PRA would need to be able to offer 25 year leases or concessions, (ii) the PRA and
the City of Rijeka would need to redevelop the maritime domain, (b) Financial support to the PRA, (c) Privatization of
port operations, (d) Plovput’s light dues, and (e) Road Maintenance Policy.
15
   Project preparation cost was slightly over US$600,000 which was reasonable for such a complex project.
16
   “A major objective of the Project is the improved efficiency … in part through privatization…. My concern is that
we have only an agreement in principle at this stage with all the detailed work on the sales to be done by privatization
advisor during project implementation. … The amount [about US$70 million] we are financing for civil works and
goods is substantial and can provide considerable leverage for getting the needed institutional reforms.?
17
   In the PAD, it was stated that no major technical issues were expected: the PRA had a good capacity in port
engineering and operations and the design of the various investment were fully compliant with international standards.
HC had long experience with the Bank - and while HAC was recently created, its technical staff were experienced.
                                                                                                                      9
would have been very expensive (in excess of US$1 million). Given the multiplicity of other
issues, the technical / engineering aspects were not concerns at preparation.

2.2 Implementation

Component 1: Port Restructuring and Modernization.

     a. The rehabilitation of the western part of the port and the construction of a multi-purpose
        terminal at the Zagreb Pier were not implemented because of unanticipated events.

(i) The historical designation of the existing warehouses meant that the rehabilitation works
intended for the western part of the port were no longer feasible. This was an important package
of activities: demolition of existing warehouses and construction of new ones, repaving the port,
rehabilitation of utilities works, rehabilitation of fencing and improvement of port connection to
road and railway networks. The rehabilitation required the demolition of existing warehouses.
The Minister of Culture initially authorized the port to demolish all of the warehouses except for
two. Unfortunately, the Government re-considered the designation and decided just when the
warehouse demolition was to begin that all of the warehouses had cultural importance. This
meant that it was no longer possible to implement two subcomponents under Component 1
totaling over more than US$13 million of Bank financing.

(ii) Unanticipated soil condition prevented the construction of a multi-purpose terminal at the
Zagreb Pier. The Project was supposed to finance the construction of a berthing facility of 250 m
length, which would have allowed vessels of 15 meter draft to service the Port. During the
implementation of the works contract, additional soil investigations were performed and it was
found that soil conditions prevalent at the Zagreb Pier location were much weaker than
anticipated. Given the depth of the sea bottom (minus 35 meters) and the thickness of the soil
strata requiring treatment (19 meters), it would have required complex deep-water consolidation
works. This led to the Additional Financing for the PRA to fund the contract amendment for such
consolidation works. However, due to a number of technical, financial and contractual risks, the
negotiations for the contract amendment did not succeed. In the end, the contract was terminated
in early 2008 for Employer’s convenience18.

(iii) A container terminal is being constructed at the Zagreb Pier. Instead of a multi-purpose
terminal as originally planned, the subcomponent was revised to be a design-build package for a
container terminal at the Zagreb Pier. The design-build contract was signed in April 2012 and
design is on-going. Only the advance payment for the construction contract was funded under the
Project. The financing to complete this activity will be funded out of RG II.

     b. The activities under this component were adjusted in response to business needs. The
        Bajidica Terminal extension is almost completed and the focus on container traffic
        enhances competitiveness.




18
   Because the contractor for the terminal construction was already in place, the PRA incurred significant stand by and
termination costs.

                                                                                                                   10
The Project implementation period with extensions was 9 years. During this time, the PRA
updated its Masterplan with the support of the Project, and the Bank Team revised the Project
activities to reflect the growth in the container market in the North Adriatic19. In 2008, RG II was
prepared to fund the expansion of the Brajdica Container Terminal - which was almost at
capacity20 , and to provide additional financing for the construction of the Zagreb Terminal -
which would now be for containers. In the October 2010 Restructuring - in order to fully utilize
available Bank financing - it was agreed that RG I would fund a larger share of the Brajdica
Container Terminal than anticipated and a smaller share of the Zagreb Terminal. By proactively
adding the Brajdica Container Terminal expansion to RG I through a restructuring, RG I was able
to support the targeted increase in port capacity. Civil works for the Brajdica extension is about
95 percent completed and is expected to be opened in May 2013. The Project also supported the
concessioning of the Brajdica Terminal to a private operator that now owns a 51 percent share of
the Adriatic Gate21, which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of LR. This was the first
successful PPP in port infrastructure in Croatia. The private operator has already increased
productivity and developed additional container business.

     c. The restructuring of LR was successfully completed. The Social Program for Port staff
        redundancy achieved its objectives22.

At the time of the Project appraisal, there were about 1,420 employees at LR 23 . The LR
Management accepted a staff surplus in the range of 550 - 650, based on projected moderate
traffic growth. The Social Program offered three main package options: (i) early retirement with
associated benefits; (ii) early voluntary separation including increased subsistence; and (iii)
severance payments out of the Collective Contract. A well-publicized voluntary program with an
incentive of 1,000 Kuna per year of service to a maximum of 25 years for eligible workers would
be followed by involuntary departure to be worked out with the unions. The workers were at first
skeptical about whether they would receive the money promised under the voluntary option. Once
it was known that the money was speedily paid, there were many volunteers for the redundancy
package. In the end, 479 staff departed through the Social Program options of early retirement
and voluntary departure. An overwhelming number of workers (78 percent) chose the option of
enhanced severance because of its attractiveness and incentives. The involuntary separation
option was never implemented because by that time freight traffic had grown faster than had been
expected at the time of appraisal and the voluntary staff departure was adequate. The total cost of
the program was about US$7.2 million (or about US$15,000 per staff equivalent to two years of
salary.) 24 The independent auditors’ report in 2008 reviewed the severance payments and
confirmed that the payments were made to all the 479 staff in a transparent and accountable


19
   The growth of container traffic was due to: (i) global growth in container traffic and (ii) a progressive and partial shift
in traffic from East Asia to Central Europe via the ports of the Northern Adriatic instead of the ports in the Northern
Europe due to savings in both ship travel time and land transport costs.
20
   RG II was supposed to extend Brajdica by about 330 meters, increasing its capacity by 200 kTEU. This extension
was eventually financed mostly out of RG I.
21
   The private operator has assumed the responsibility for additional investments in exchange for 50 percent of the
shares in the Adriatic Gate. LR then sold 1 percent of the shares to the private operator for €12.53 million equivalent,
which was invested in new equipment to increase productivity in other parts of the port - particularly for general cargo.
22
   See Annex 11 for details.
23
   The PHRD and the PPF financed various studies to improve productivity, and devised a Social Program that
suggested a staff surplus in the range of 687 - 776.
24
   This was expended on severance payments, counseling and advisory services, and training and job-search assistance.

                                                                                                                          11
manner. The Social Program achieved most of its objectives. It generated stronger consultation
between management and workers’ unions. The restructuring improved the company’s workforce
structure with an emphasis on better qualified and dynamic staff, and assisted LR in rebalancing
the blue/white collar ratio. Overall, the LR Social Program - as an integral part of the company’s
restructuring strategy - has proven to be successful, with quantifiable outcomes in the areas of
increased productivity and better financial performance of the company.

     d. The process of privatizing port operations was slow but the concessioning of the Brajdica
        Container Terminal was a success.

Increasing private sector participation in port operations and the resultant improvement in port
efficiency were central themes during Project preparation. LR received a 12-year priority
concession to operate most areas in the port until 201225. The plan was to privatize incrementally
through the sale of majority shares of daughter companies (Adriatic Gate and others to be
established) such that total tonnage operated by the private sector would reach 80 percent by
200826. This time schedule, admittedly aggressive, was later extended. During the first phase of
Project implementation, private sector involvement primarily took place through the outsourcing
by LR of cargo handling activities to private companies - operations and management still
remained with LR. The Bank championed the selling of the shares in the Adriatic Gate which
operates the Brajdica Container Terminal. Brajdica is now privately-operated and the container
business has high margins and promising future growth. However, the level of privatization at the
Rijeka Port is modest, at about 35 %27. The port law was amended in 2000 with the view of
initiating port concessions. In the other strategic port in Croatia - Ploce - the main port operator
is now 80 percent privately owned. In spite of the success of the Brajdica privatization, other
concessions which had been planned for the bulk cargo and the silos were not implemented. This
was because the economic crisis has reduced the amount of freight – therefore, a commercial
decision was made to delay the tenders.

     e. Other activities were implemented that modernized the Rijeka Port.

The Becko Berth - a priority investment - was rehabilitated according to plan. Various equipment
- such as mobile cranes, a state of the art vessel traffic management information system28, video
CCTV & ID cards (added later) - were purchased and in use, and various technical consultancies
were completed. The Project also funded the development of a comprehensive port environment
protection plan which is being implemented in phases. The developed system will serve as a tool
to get accreditation for the Eco Management and Audit system (ISO 14001) and the Port
Environmental Review System for all operations. The Bank’s support for environment
improvement in the Port will be continued in RG II to enhance environmental response with the
development of the environment protection plan and the purchase of waste collection vessel to
address traffic increase.



25
   The priority concession was later extended for another 30 years.
26
   The percentage of private sector participation is expressed in tons operated by the private sector/total port tonnage.
27
   There have been some discussions on how the privatization percentage is calculated. The PAD stated that the
percentage is expressed in tons operated by the private sector/total port tonnage. LR included the outsourcing of cargo
handling activities as privatization. However, management decisions and operational control still rests with LR. The
privatization percentage in this ICR is derived mainly from the privatization of the Brajdica Container Terminal.

                                                                                                                     12
Component 2: Port/City Interface Redevelopment.

     a. The D-404 Draga-Brajdica connecting road was constructed as planned

HC constructed the D-404 which allowed heavy trucks to connect from the port to the Rijeka
Bypass without driving through the city center. A trip that once took more than half an hour,
now takes about 6 minutes. The construction of the D-404 experienced delays and substantial
cost overruns29 due to the need to re-design because the City of Rijeka was unable to finance a
second exit tunnel as originally planned30. The permitting process also delayed the opening of the
road. The civil works was complex. Although only 3.5 km, the D-404 included one bridge, five
viaducts, and two tunnels that took up to 58 percent of the entire length of the new road. A key
element for the construction of the D-404 was the Pecine Tunnel that stretches for 1341 km under
the urban zone and the railway line. The tunnel incorporates an intersection in the main tube with
a 234 m long exit tunnel.

     b. The passenger terminal and associated infrastructure improved the quality of life for the
        residents of Rijeka City.

In addition to financing the construction of a new passenger terminal, the Project also funded
additional investments to make the passenger terminal area accessible. These included financing
the construction of a new bridge for vehicles and building connecting roads to the passenger
terminal, and rehabilitating and extending the breakwater. This tripled the access to the waterfront,
reopened the breakwater to citizens and improved the quality of life in Rijeka. The passenger
terminal has a picturesque view of the harbor and is a popular social venue.          However, the
opening of the new passenger terminal did not increase passenger numbers, because a new
motorway was built that provided easy access to the Croatian coast and the subsidy for ferry
tickets was reduced.

     c. The redevelopment of the Delta and the Porto Baros areas encountered difficulties. This
        subcomponent should have been revised when it became clear that implementing this
        activity faced political hurdles.

For Component 2, the funding was mainly for the passenger terminal and the D-404 connecting
road. The support that the Project was providing for urban re-development was limited to
technical assistance for consultancy. In the Project Policy Letter, the Government agreed to
submit the required legislative changes for the Maritime Domain law such that the PRA and the
City of Rijeka could re-develop the maritime domain at the Rijeka Port for non-maritime
purposes. Subsequently, there have been several amendments to the Maritime Domain law,
although the legislative solution put in place is still imperfect. A decision needs to be made on the
status of the land in Porto Baros, and more specifically on what is or is not maritime domain, and
who owns that land. This has an impact on both the attractiveness of these locations for private

   The actual construction cost for the D-404 was about 117 percent over the appraisal estimate. The cost overrun was
about US$37 million.

   Two emergency exits for pedestrians had to be constructed before the permit for use could be issued. The re-design
and the acquisition of the necessary permits took two addition years.
                                                                                                                  13
developers - and also the potential revenues that the PRA can expect. Throughout the
implementation period, much effort was made to prepare the Delta and the Porto Baros areas for
redevelopment.

Most of the technical studies related to the completion of the bidding documents to select a
developer have been completed. However, the PRA has fallen short of selecting a developer. The
dynamics were such that the partnership between the Port and the City did not come naturally31.
In addition, both parties are public sector entities that lack familiarity with commercial interests.
Matters took extensive time to resolve. In addition to legal issues, other Port/ City interface
matters included the provisions for roads, utilities and parking, the location of a waste water
treatment plant, urban and architectural plans, building density and hotel capacity at Porto Baros,
environment requirements (soil investigations), and land use planning. In addition, LR had a
concession on the Delta and Porto Baros and required an alternative space in order to relocate its
activities32. In short, once it emerged that there were many issues related to the redevelopment
and that the dialogue between the City and the Port was not the most straightforward, the Team
could have been more selective in its effort and limited its attention to the transport-related
activities. The PDO and the PDO indicator related to urban redevelopment and the selection of a
developer should have been revised, because they had limited bearing on the overall PDO of
increasing trade competitiveness by improving the international transport chain.          This was
especially true because RG II has an indicator for the redevelopment of port land into urban area
– thus, the selection of a developer in RG I was not essential.

Component 3: International Road Improvements

     a. The Rijeka Bypass was opened in 2006

The construction of the 6.4 km section of the Rijeka Bypass (Orehovic-Draga-Sv. Kuzam)
experienced delays and cost overruns due to three major landslides33 and a number of smaller
ones. The landslides in the Sv. Kuzam Tunnel required geotechnical investigations and revision
of designs. The civil works were challenging; there were three interchanges, five viaducts, and
two tunnels – one of 323 meters, and the other of 211 meters. This section of the Bypass was
opened for traffic at the end of 2006.

     b. The Krk Bridge rehabilitation came in below estimate.

For the rehabilitation of the Krk Bridge, the awarded contracts were much lower than estimated.
Therefore, there were two loan cancellations totaling €7.5 million. The rehabilitation took longer
than planned, because the big arch of the Krk Bridge required more extensive works 34 , and
because HAC added the rehabilitation of two piers utilizing cost savings from the loan. While
the Krk Bridge work was a rehabilitation, it was substantial. This bridge was once the longest
arch bridge in the world, providing the only road, electricity, water and oil (pipeline) connection


31
   The city of Rijeka and the PRA were until recently administrated by members of different political parties.
32
   This was not possible within the Project timeframe due to delays in the construction of the new port terminal and
preservation of the historic warehouses.
33
   The road had to pass through a very mountainous terrain. One major landslide occurred when a road segment was
close to completion. The road segment could not be operational until the slope was stabilized.
34
   The extent of the deterioration of the pillars was not known until the pillars were opened up.

                                                                                                                 14
from the mainland to the Island of Krk. The repairs had to deploy modern techniques, because the
bridge needed to stay open during the rehabilitation period. During implementation, an
Environment Management Plan was developed and instituted.

     c. The elimination of traffic black spots was funded outside of the Project.

The Project was originally supposed to fund the elimination of 30 traffic black spots. HC re-
allocated the funds to other civil works, and funded the elimination of the black spots through its
own budget and through an EIB project.35

     d. Technical assistance to improve road administration was implemented.

HAC established a highway database and received certifications for ISO 9001 (Quality
Management System), ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems) and OHSAS 18001
(Management system for health and safety). HC implemented the pavement management system.
Training and other technical assistance were also completed.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The Project was complex. Therefore, the M&E design was very detailed, and it was spread over
multiple sections of the documentation - which made implementation difficult. Overall, the M&E
design appropriately measured outcome for the PDO. For the port, the measurements were: (i)
efficiency - through port operating performance and private sector participation; (ii) financial -
through operating ratios; (iii) social and environmental conditions - through implementation of
Project activities in terms of staff redundancy and environment investments; and (iv)
competitiveness - through port and passenger traffic levels. For the port/city interface, the
measurement was the selection of a developer for the Delta and Porto Baros areas. For
international road connections the measurement was truck transit time through the city of Rijeka.
For administration of the road sector, the measurement was intermediate indicators for ISO 9001
certification and implementation of pavement and bridge maintenance systems. The linkages
between the PDO and the indicators were strong.

The Aide Memoires had a detailed results framework that reported the performance of some
indicators, the financial ratios achieved as part of the loan covenants, and actions agreed upon in
the Policy Letter. However, the implementation of M&E as reflected in the ISR had much room
for improvement. The indicators in the ISR did not match the indicators in PAD - although Annex
1 of the PAD was admittedly confusing. In the October 2010 restructuring, the intermediate
indicators for construction progress for the Brajdica and the Zagreb Container Terminals were
added. These new indicators were not added to the ISR. The ISR had missing indicators and some
of the reported indicators were not the ones agreed upon.          The ISR indicators presented a
negative assessment of the Project36. (to be discussed further in Section 3.2.)


35
   During the past ten years, 215 black spots were eliminated and 46 black spots were improved. The results measured
over a three-year period showed a decrease in road accidents at the high risk locations by 75 percent and a decrease of
fatalities by 91 percent.
36
   For instance, the improvement of Rijeka cargo handling performance according to agreed benchmarks was an
important discussion point during Project preparation, as it evaluated operational efficiency. After the 2006 Mid-Term
Review, LR’s operating performance was no longer reported as it met the initial objective. The ISR also did not have
the PDO indicator for time savings on the road investments which was met once the roads were constructed. Given
                                                                                                                   15
It should be noted that the reporting on the results of the implementation of the Social Program
was very comprehensive, because the Project financed a tracer study. Otherwise, the
implementation of the M&E was acceptable when data were easily available - such as the
financial data. The milestones for some indicators (privatization and the selection of a developer)
were adjusted based on implementation progress. The reporting on M&E was also relatively
optimistic; some of the targets appeared challenging to achieve in a timely fashion. A more
realistic assessment earlier in the implementation period, and a proactive approach in revising the
indicators, would have serviced the Project better. For example, the number of passengers from
ferries and cruises did not materialize early on in the implementation period - and so this could
have been revised. The privatization level was below target throughout the implementation period
- and so this could have been revised downwards to match the implementation realities.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance was rated as “Satisfactory?.

The environment category for the Project was “A?, full assessment. The modernization of the
Rijeka Port was not expected to involve dredging or major works in the water. The only issues
that were expected to raise environmental concerns were: (i) the demolition of old warehouses
that might contain asbestos; (ii) the PCB in a transformer within the Zagreb Berth; and (iii)
reclamation of land along the Zagreb Pier. The allocation of safeguard compliance
responsibilities among the various project participants did result in some initial issues. The
environmental assessments of the Rijeka Bypass and the D-404 were prepared in conformity with
Croatian legislations that were satisfactory to the Bank. The rehabilitation of Krk Bridge was not
a concern. During implementation, environmental issues not anticipated at the Project preparation
came up and they were successfully dealt with. The asbestos waste generated from the works
performed on the passenger terminal was transported to an authorized landfill. A brief EMP was
developed for the rehabilitation of the large arc of the Krk Bridge, because the rehabilitation was
more extensive than originally anticipated. Environment safeguards were observed when further
soil investigations were needed for the Zagreb Pier. The implementation of environmental
safeguards for the Brajdica Pier extension experienced no issues. The implementation of the
Project required the resettlement of 12 families. The families were satisfied with the replacement
housing provided. During the implementation period, the Project instituted a resettlement action
plan for the land acquisition related to the construction of Road 403 which was not financed by
the proceeds of any Bank loan. However, it was regarded as functionally linked from a safeguards
perspective. The Team proactively ensured that the land acquisition process complied and still
complied with the Bank social safeguards policies.

Fiduciary Compliance was rated as “Satisfactory?.

There were no significant procurement issues, but the project had to face several contractual
management issues, the most significant being the termination of the first Zagreb Terminal
construction contract. While client capacity in the PRA was sometimes challenged during
implementation, compliance with World Bank guidelines was secured during the whole Project


almost two-thirds of the Project financed roads, this PDO indicator would have provided a fuller picture of the Project’s
achievements.
                                                                                                                     16
life and difficult contract management issues were resolved satisfactorily. The FM by HC, HAC
and the PRA were generally satisfactory. There were occasions when the FM supervisions for
these entities were marginally satisfactory, and - in one case - marginally unsatisfactory. These
were quickly remedied by installing new accounting software, keeping a better paper trail of the
reconciliation and preparing accounting and internal control manual. The unaudited and audited
financial reports were generally timely submitted.

2.5 Post-completion Operation / Next Phase

Croatia has a well-developed and well-managed road sector, with funding for fuel excise charges,
tolls, and the state budget. The road sector is also supported by other IFIs – thus, the future role of
the Bank would be focused more on advisory services. In regard to the Rijeka Port, the RG II is
on-going and will continue the implementation of many of the activities envisioned in RG I -
including the completion of the Brajdica Terminal Extension and Zagreb Container Terminal and
keeps the objective of urban redevelopment. Many of the Project indicators are carried through to
RG II with an emphasis on container traffic capacity. RG I started the concept of a corridor
approach to transport development; this would be continued in RG II, with more emphasis on
improving the road and rail links to port areas. The Bank is also supporting Croatia with the on-
going Trade and Transport Integration Project for Ploce. Therefore, sector dialogue and Project
specific support for the Rijeka Port will continue.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Croatia is scheduled to become an EU member state on July 1st 2013 and the Project’s
development objective is more than ever relevant because Rijeka will be able to compete on a
more equal footing with ports in Italy and Slovenia. One of the pillars of the current CPS FY
2009 to FY2013 is to strengthen private sector-led growth and accelerate convergence with the
EU through enhanced public sector governance, to improve the investment climate, and to align
the provision of infrastructure and related services with demand. The design of RG I was
innovative for its time. The Project addressed a transport issue from a logistic and corridor
perspective. The RG I design anticipated the current transport logistic issues that are of
importance to the maritime sector in Croatia today. RG I incorporated road infrastructure
development into a primarily port Project. It started to address the problems of inadequate
transport infrastructure connecting ports with their hinterland, and inadequate port, road and rail
interface infrastructure that increases the cost of transport. The Project implementation supported
private sector investment through: (i) technical assistance to the Brajdica Container Terminal
privatization, (ii) the emphasis on private participation in port operations, and (iii) the preparation
of Delta and Porto Baros for private-led redevelopment. The implementation was relevant to the
CPS objective of private sector led growth.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of the PDO was rated as “Moderately Unsatisfactory?.

The Project’s PDO consisted of two sentences. The first sentence stated that the overall
objective of the Project was “to increase Croatia’s trade competitiveness by improving the
international transport chain…? The specific objectives referred to the three parts of the Project:
                                                                                                 17
       (i) Increasing efficiency and improving financial, social and environmental conditions at the
                Rijeka Port, rehabilitating infrastructure and replacing equipment;
       (ii) Preparing to redevelop part of the Rijeka Port for urban purposes; and
       (iii) Improving international road connections linked to the Rijeka Gateway, and the
                administration of the road sector.

The last ISR rated the Project as Moderately Unsatisfactory. In assessing the totality of the
Project’s outcome, the overall PDO (first sentence) was met, two of the specific PDOs, i.e. (i) and
(iii), were met and for the third specific PDO, i.e. (ii), was partially met. However, several
important PDO indicators were not met by the Project despite a long implementation period of
nine years. Detailed analysis is presented below:

The indicators as reported in the ISR were incomplete. Some PDO and intermediate indicators
were missing from the ISR. There were 7 PDO indicators – however, the ISR reported on only 2
of them. There were 8 intermediate indicators – however, the ISR reported on 2 PDO indicators
as intermediate indicators, and 2 of the 8 intermediate indicators. The achievement of the Project
based on the results framework as approved in the PAD and in the October 2010 Restructuring
are as follows:

PDO Indicators:

           Total port traffic increased by an average of 7 percent per annum from 2004 to 2009 -
            target met.
           Passengers from ferries and cruise vessels increased by an average 5 percent per annum -
            target not met, because of a new motorway along the coast and the ensuring reduction of
            subsidy for ferry tickets.
           Operational performance improvements for Luka Rijeka for steel, other dry cargos and
            containers37 – target met.
           Operating ratio – target was not met because of a reduction in freight and thus revenue as
            a result of the economic crisis in Europe.
           Selection of a developer for the Delta and Port Baros area – target not met.
           Percentage of private sector participation in the Rijeka Port operation – the privatization
            percentage is below target; the Brajdica Container Terminal was privatized; due to the
            reduction in freight traffic as a result of the economic crisis, the concessioning of other
            terminals is on hold for business environment reasons.
           Total truck transit time through the city of Rijeka – target met.

Of the 7 PDO indicators, 3 were met and 4 were not. The PDO indicators that were not met
(passenger traffic, operation ratio and privatization level) were partly due to commercial reasons.
The PDO indicators that met targets, i.e., freight traffic, port operational performance, and truck
transit time, measured the Project’s achievements in trade competitiveness, and improvement in
transport efficiencies.

Intermediate Indicators



37
     Note: This indicator is reported in the Data Sheet as Indicator 3 and Indicator 4, because of formatting constraints.
                                                                                                                         18
          Law on Concessions and Maritime Domain modified – target partially met. The Law on
           Concessions was modified. The Maritime Domain law was modified but issues related
           to urban redevelopment were not completely addressed.
          Luka Rijeka restructured in a socially acceptable way – target met. The reduction in
           staff was through the voluntary options.
          Progressive reduction of Government subsidies for the PRA and LA – target met.
          Port’s security indicators comply with IMO and EU standards – target met.
          ISO 9001 certification granted for motorway services – target met.
          Implementation of PMS/BMS system extended – target partially met.
          Zagreb Container Terminal construction progress - target not met.
          Brajdica Terminal construction progress – target met.

Of the 8 Intermediate indicators, 6 were met and 2 were not.

According to OPCS’s ICR Guidelines38 (Guidelines), “if the operation has multiple objectives,
indicate their relative importance, and describe the achievements objective-by-objective.?
Therefore when there are multiple objectives, the objectives need not be weighted equally. This
Project had three specific objectives: port operations, urban redevelopment and road investments.
The first and third specific objectives were essential elements in measuring the achievement of
the Project’s overall PDO objective of increasing trade competitiveness by improving
international transport chain. The second objective was related to urban redevelopment. It could
be argued that the second objective was only tangentially related to the overall PDO objectives
and should have a lower relative weight. However, the PAD and subsequent restructurings never
indicated that urban redevelopment was of lesser importance than the other Project specific
objectives.

The specific objectives for the port component were:
    Increasing efficiency - through the improvement of the LR operational performance –
       PDO indicator met.
    Improving financial conditions - through improvement of the operating ratio – PDO
       indicator not met in the last few years because of economic crisis; and through reduction
       of government subsidies – Intermediate indicator met.
    Improving social conditions - through restructuring LR in a socially responsible manner –
       Intermediate indicator met.
    Improving environmental conditions – through Project support for a comprehensive port
       environment protection plan – completed.
    Rehabilitating infrastructure - rehabilitating the Becko Berth, building the ferry terminal
       and associated infrastructure and extending the Brajdica terminal – completed.
    Replacing equipment – through purchase of movable cranes – completed.

The specific PDO for the port investments has been achieved. The Rijeka Port has become more
competitive, as reflected by the increase in freight traffic (PDO indicator met).

     Implementation Completion and Results Report, Guidelines, OPCS updated November 10, 2010.
                                                                                                 19
The specific objectives for road investments were:
    Improving international road connections – the D-404 connector road moves traffic from
       the port to the Rijeka Bypass and the Zagreb motorway in about 6 minutes (PDO
       indicator met). The Rijeka Bypass facilitates transit traffic between Istria, Slovenia, Italy
       and the rest of Croatia. The Krk bridge which links Rijeka to its airport in Krk has been
       rehabilitated.
    Improving administration of the road sector – (i) Certifications were awarded to HAC for
       ISO 9001 (Quality Management System), ISO 14001 (Environmental Management
       Systems) and OHSAS 18001 (Management System for Health and Safety), (ii) 72 HAC
       employees received auditor certifications and 110 employees received various training,
       (iii) road data has been in active use, and (iv) pavement management system has been
       implemented.

The specific PDO for roads investments has been achieved. The specific PDO for the urban
redevelopment has been partially achieved because the port area around the new ferry terminal
and the rehabilitated and extended breakwater has partially transformed city life along the Rijeka
waterfront. However, the PDO indicator for the selection of a developer has yet to be met. The
results of the Project were significant. The overall Project objective to increase Croatia’s trade
competitiveness by improving the international transport chain has been achieved. However, the
specific PDO for urban redevelopment and four PDO indicator targets were not fully achieved.

3.3 Efficiency

Efficiency in achieving the PDO in terms of ERR was rated as “Satisfactory?

An ex-post economic evaluation for the Project was completed on investments analyzed at
Project preparation. The overall Project ex-post ERR was 15.9 percent, which was higher than the
12.0 percent discount rate defined in the appraisal document. The ex-post economic evaluation
includes the Brajdica Terminal extension which has been funded out of RG I instead of RG II as
originally planned. The table below summarizes the ex-post economic evaluation results.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Project objective and design remain highly relevant to Croatia’s current development
priorities and current Bank country and sector strategies. The Project achieved its overall
                                                                                                   20
development objective; however, the implementation period was lengthy and a specific PDO and
four PDO indicators were not met. The Project was efficient as the ex-post economic rate of
return was 15.9 percent. The “Moderately Unsatisfactory? rating is derived from the relevance of
the Project (highly relevant), the achievement of the PDO (moderately unsatisfactory), and the
Project efficiency (satisfactory).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development
The Social Program for redundancy of port staff was implemented in a timely fashion, in
consultation with staff, unions and other key stakeholders through a transparent process, with
minimal social tension. In implementing the Social Program, LR held numerous consultations.
Direct engagement and dialogue with the unions proved to be the key in building trust and
partnership with them during the restructuring process. The implementation of the Social
Program improved LR’s financial performance and benefited the remaining LR staff. Most of the
staff that participated in the Social Program (two-thirds) chose to retire. The others were mostly
employed full time – 80 percent of the respondents in the tracer study were reemployed at equal
or better positions. Three out of 4 respondents looking for a job found new employment in less
than one year.

The Project substantially improved the quality of life for Rijeka residents. As mentioned, the
passenger terminal and the extension of the breakwater opened up the access to the waterfront. In
addition, the D-404 has allowed vehicles - many of them freight traffic - to bypass Rijeka City
center and connect directly to the Zagreb motorway. The average daily traffic on the D-404 in
2011 was close to 6,000 vehicles - which constitutes traffic that otherwise would have been
transiting through the city center. The construction of the Rijeka Bypass allowed the diversion of
transit traffic between Istria, Slovenia, Italy and the rest of Croatia. The average daily traffic on
the bypass in 2011 was about 5800 vehicles.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The successful implementation of the Social Program had a beneficial institutional impact on LR.
In addition, through implementation of this Project, the PRA and LR learned through doing.
Their institutional capacity improved, so that they would be better able to work effectively with
other IFIs and EU organizations in the future. The ISO certifications supported HAC’s
institutional strengthening.

(c) Other Unintended Outcome and Impacts (positive or negative)
The refocus of the port development to the container business was a positive outcome that had not
been planned in the original Project. It reflected a proactive approach by the PRA and the Bank
Team to rapidly adapt to evolving market conditions. The privatization of the Brajdica Container
Port, besides improving the operation performance of LR, has also transformed the attitude of the
PRA and LR toward private involvement in port activities. The operational efficiency of the
private container operator is demonstrated by the improved operational performance for
movement of containers - which is 90 percent above the target level39.



39
  The baseline for movement of containers was 13 moves/crane/hour - the target was 22 moves/crane/hour, and the
achieved level by the private operator was 32 moves/crane/hour.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshop

A beneficiary survey was not carried out.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

The risk to Development Outcome was rated as low, because the road investments once made are
expected to be properly maintained as the HC and HAC collect revenues from fuel taxes, toll
revenues, and other user charges. The institutional development in the road sector has been
incorporated into regular operations - i.e., HAC has undertaken recertification of the ISO
certifications and the road database is actively used. The Port activities once completed would not
be easily reversed. The modernization of the port operation will continue in RG II. Results to date
have been favorable, and there is general support for modernization. The Brajdica privatization
has already demonstrated an improvement in efficiency and the development of new business and
additional revenues. The port equipments are in use. The Social Program has been completed for
some time. Some of the development outcomes that cannot yet be assessed – such as the urban re-
development and further privatization – will be evaluated when RG II is completed.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a)Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

Despite its complexity, this was a well-prepared Project. Detailed preparation was completed for
all of the Project components. Project preparation was supported by the PHRD and PPF studies.
The analysis of the sector issues was correct and the intervention was targeted. The road linkage
with the port operations was a logistic/corridor approach to transport development, and
anticipated the future development in the sector. The urban redevelopment was a limited
involvement, because the Project only funded technical assistance to prepare the area for
redevelopment. This subcomponent was innovative and cross-sector. The difficulty encountered
should not be counted against the Team for being bold and assuming a challenge. The Team
established dialogue with the labor unions and engendered trust from the Project inception which
contributed to the successful implementation of the Social Program. The Team might have been
too optimistic regarding the ease with which it would be possible to amend existing laws. In
retrospect, the capacity of the client to manage complex contracts was overestimated. The target
levels to be achieved under the various indicators were also in retrospect ambitious. These
impacted the Bank performance rating as well as the Bank management acquiescence to such a
complex Project. While there were in-depth reviews, no one seriously examined whether RG I
should have been two projects instead of one. The complexity was not an issue during preparation,
because the preparation period was lengthy and the preparation budget was supplemented by
PHRD and PPF funds. However, this complexity made implementation difficult.

(b) Quality at Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
                                                                                                22
The Project was complex; the team supervised essentially two projects. There were regular
supervisions and the aide memoires were comprehensive. The field-based implementation teams
provided hands-on and timely support. The Project experienced vexing technical issues, which
the Team worked closely with the counterparts to solve. The PRA and LR were not familiar with
the Bank processes, which made supervision was even more challenging. In short, this was not an
easy Project to implement well. The Team focused on the essential elements and improved the
Project design during implementation. The inclusion of the Brajdica Container Port in RG I, the
modification of Zagreb Pier from a multi-purpose function to a container terminal strengthened
the Project. The privatization of the Brajdica Container Terminal demonstrated improved
efficiency from private participation - and would not have happened without the support from the
Bank. The Team was diligent on both environmental and social safeguards which never became
issues, although the environment risk was high especially with the deep water marine
construction and new construction. Unfortunately, within the multiplicity of problems, the Team
did not adjust the Project’s objectives, indicators, target levels and design based on
implementation realities by processing a Level I Restructuring. This Project achieved much;
however, the results framework designed at the Project inception in 2003 set a very high bar for
the Project to meet. The disconnect between the indicators in the ISR and those from the PAD
and the October 2010 Restructuring was also a shortcoming. While some aspects of the
implementation were highly satisfactory, the overall rating for the implementation can only be
moderately satisfactory for the reasons stated above.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Moderately Satisfactory rating for overall Bank performance resulted from: (i) a satisfactory
rating for the quality at entry; and (ii) a moderately satisfactory rating for Project supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a)Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In the Project Policy Letter, the Government agreed to implement a number of measures in order
to achieve the Project objectives. These included: (i) legislative changes (for concession40 and
maritime domain) to the Parliament, (ii) financial support for the PRA, (iii) privatization of port
operations, (iv) reduction of the Plovput’s light dues and (v) funding of the maintenance budget.
The Government made a good faith effort to implement all of the measures as agreed upon. The
financial support to the PRA and the funding of maintenance were never issues. The legislative
change permitting the PRA to offer 25-year leases or concessions to private terminal operations
on its own authority was eventually enacted. The Plovput Light dues were for a time quite high,
and were not reduced as per the Policy Letter. When a new light dues tariff became effective in
2006, it further increased the dues on ships calling the Port of Rijeka. The Bank alerted the
Government on this matter via the Mid-Term Review report. Working with the Ministry of Sea,
Transport, Tourism and Development, a solution was crafted. In 2009, annual dues for those ships


40
  Under the previous legislation, the PRA/LR had little incentive to grant long-term leases or concessions to terminal
operators because under the law the revenues would go to the central Government. The Law on Concessions was
amended, and LR received €12.53 million equivalent as payment for the 1 percent of the shares it sold.
                                                                                                                   23
frequenting the Port of Rijeka were introduced - this reduced the light dues by 31 percent which
unfortunately is still below the 60 percent reduction41 specified in the Letter. The privatization
level for Rijeka Port operations was not achieved. As the head of the PRA is appointed by the
Government and a deputy Minister is on the LR board of directors, if the commitment to
privatization was stronger more progress could have been made. There were amendments to the
Maritime Domain but the issues related to the redevelopment of the Delta and Porto Baros areas
have still not been solved. Many of the measures in the Policy Letter were implemented, and the
Government made good faith efforts to follow through on the remainder. For these reasons, the
Government performance was rated as “Moderately Satisfactory?.

(b) Implementation Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

There were three implementing entities: HC, HAC and the PRA/LR. The performances of HC
and HAC were satisfactory. HC and the personnel of HAC had experience working with
international financial institutions and implementing large-scale civil works projects. The
institutional modernization elements related to HC and HAC financing were modest and easily
achievable. The road-related activities and technical assistance were completed. The performance
of the PRA/LR was moderately unsatisfactory, notwithstanding that fact that: (i) the
implementation of the Social Program was a success; and (ii) the geotechnical issue related to the
Zagreb Pier, the historic designation of the warehouses, and the delay in the amendment of the
Maritime Domain law were all beyond their control. After the amendment to the concession law,
privatization could have proceeded on a quickened pace. The delay in many of the civil works
was due to the PRA’s inexperience in contract management. However, the PRA has the
responsibility to ensure technical issues are quickly resolved, contracts are timely amended, and
procurement proceeds with due speed. The failure of LR to provide the operating performance
data also contributed to the rating42. Given the importance attached to these performance data
during Project preparation and in the early phase of Project implementation, the collection and
reporting of the data should have continued without prompting.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall Borrower performance was rated as “Moderately Satisfactory?, because of the
moderately satisfactory ratings for the Government performance and the Implementing Agencies
performances.

6. Lessons Learned

Unexpected events should be expected in a large-scale project. Whether a project is successful
depends on how these events are addressed. The soil conditions under the Zagreb Pier were
unanticipated; fault was not attributable to any Project participants and did not impact any Project
ratings. At the time of appraisal there was an existing soil investigation report that was later found
to be not adequately detailed. The time and effort put into analyzing the issue, exploring technical


41
  This might be an unrealistic requirement since it failed to take into account any inflation.
42
  Until 2006, the Aide Memoires indicated that LR was requested regularly to analyze and report on its performance
and data. The port performance data for this ICR was received after much effort.
                                                                                                               24
options, and processing additional financing were exemplary. The revised design-build solution
for a container terminal improved the Project. If RG I were to be rated on this element alone, it
would have been highly satisfactory.

Project complexity increases implementation risk. The Project was well designed but it was
almost three Projects in one. The technical challenges, the disparate elements and the reform
agenda made this Project nearly impossible to successfully implement. The Bank Team did a
good job. Even so, the multiplicity of issues was more than one team on one implementation
budget could handled, and this impacted the Project outcome.

The results framework matters, and is how a Project is evaluated. The PDO and the indicators
were well-crafted at inception. RG I - like most projects when they are being prepared - was
optimistic on the pace of institutional change, and the achievement targets were ambitious. At
implementation, there was a new reality. The Bank Team should have proactively revised the
PDO and the results framework during the extended implementation period. The Project achieved
much but the Project rating was limited by the results framework as approved in 2003. In
addition, a Project is monitored based on the indicators. If the indicators as reported in the ISR
are different from the ones approved, this disconnect impacts evaluation. Improper
documentation has adverse consequences.

Legal changes might not be appropriate for specific investment loans. The Project had a Project
Policy Letter from the Government that amendments to the Laws on Concessions and the
Maritime Domain would be implemented by the end of 2003. The Law on Concessions was
eventually amended, because this became a precondition for the processing of RG II. This
allowed the privatization of the Brajdica Terminal to go forward. Amendments to the Maritime
Domain Law are still being discussed. The implementation of Project activities that depend on
legislative changes increases Project risk. Legislative hurdles are often beyond the control of the
Government.

Institutional reform requires commitment from the Government and built-in incentives from the
Project design. The modernization of Rijeka, the largest port in Croatia with a long history43, was
never going to be easy. The Government might have been supportive of the concept of
privatization but implementing difficult actions was going to be another matter. It was natural for
LR to resist relinquishing its business. The Project-financed investments were with the PRA, and
not with LR - which has much stronger political patronage. Once the Social Program was funded,
there was little built-in incentive for LR to follow through with the privatization schedule. Except
for the Project Policy Letter and the agreed upon targets, there was limited leverage for the Bank.
In retrospective, sequencing of activities as suggested by one reviewer might have prompted
faster and deeper institutional reform.

The capacity of the counterparts in contract management is essential in a large civil works
project. The road investments were complex and encountered unanticipated geotechnical
problems - such as landslides. However, the technical issues for the road investments were
resolved without much impact to the Project, because HC had extensive experience in large civil
works projects, and was familiar with international construction companies – thus, HC was able


43
  Rijeka once had ships that sailed directly to New York City and it laid claims to a number of scientific inventions -
including the torpedo.
                                                                                                                   25
to manage the contract to meet the changing circumstances. The PRA had not had significant
investments for many years until RG I. Its staff had the technical capacity. However, when the
soil underneath the Zagreb Pier was found to be unsuitable - but the contractor was already on
site - the resolution and eventual termination of the contract significantly delayed the progress of
the Project. Therefore, while the Bank usually pays attention to the procurement, financial
management and safeguards compliance capacity of the counterparts, the counterparts’ capacity
to manage large civil works contracts is essential to the success of complex infrastructure projects.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies

(b) Co-financiers
    There is no co-financier.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders.
    EBRD financed the Orehovica-Rupa section of the Rijeka Bypass which links up to the
    Bank-financed section. The EBRD section was not in the Project description, because failure
    to implement those works would not have affected the outcome of the Project.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The appraisal economic evaluation has been carried out for the civil works and redundancy
components of the Project, which comprised 91 percent of Project costs. Those works were: (i)
rehabilitation of infrastructure in the western port area; (ii) reconstruction of the Zagrebacko-
West Berth and demolition and rehabilitation works; (ii) redundancy program; (iii) urban
redevelopment of the Delta area and the Port Baros passenger terminal; (v) construction of the
Rijeka Bypass; (vi) construction of the D-404 port connector road; and (vii) rehabilitation of the
Krk Bridge. The overall Project Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was estimated at appraisal to be
27.3 percent.

The investments of the rehabilitation of infrastructure in the western port component were
estimated at appraisal to be US$7.9 million, with an ERR of 13.6 percent. This component
originally envisaged rehabilitation works in the western part of the port to allow a smooth transfer
of the operations related to the handling of woods and timber—including demolition of outdated
warehouses. It was ultimately decided that the warehouses scheduled for demolition should be
preserved as cultural heritage. Therefore, the PRA abandoned the planned construction of the
infrastructure corridor, this component was not implemented, and the funds originally allocated to
it were distributed to other components. Because this component was cancelled, no ex-post
economic evaluation was done.

The investments of the reconstruction of Zagrebacko-West Berth and demolition and
rehabilitation works component were estimated at appraisal to be US$40.4 million, with an ERR
of 13.8 percent. The demolition and construction of warehouses at the Zagrebacko and Prague
Berth areas (US$13.1 million) were not implemented, because the PRA decided to pursue with
construction of a quay wall of 400 m and leave the development of the terminal facilities to a
prospective concessionaire. The reconstruction of the Zagrebacko-West Berth was not
implemented under the Project. The initial plan of the PRA was to construct a 250 meter berthing
facility—which would have allowed vessels of 15 meter draft to service the Port of Rijeka—
however, those plans were not realized. Soil investigations revealed the existence of soft marine
deposits, and the revised estimated cost of construction was outside the allowable budget.
Therefore, the contract for this work was cancelled, and no ex-post economic evaluation was
done.

The costs of the redundancy program were estimated at appraisal to be US$7.5 million, with an
ERR of 20.1 percent. The actual costs of the program were US$6.9 million. The ex-post
economic analysis considered the economic costs of severance payments, redeployment and
outsourced labor, as well as marginal productivity value of labor savings and marginal
productivity of workers who found employment outside LR. The ex-post ERR of this component
was estimated to be 79.0 percent.

The investments of the Delta area and Port Baros urban redevelopment/passenger terminal
component were estimated at appraisal to be US$5.8 million, with an ERR of 12.4 percent. The
contract for the construction of the passenger terminal building on the Rijeka Breakwater was
signed on November 2005, and the contract was successfully finalized with a total contract
amount of €4.2 million (US$5.5 million). At appraisal, the passenger tariffs were US$0.34 per
domestic passenger, and US$1.82 per international passenger. In 2012, the passenger tariffs were
US$0.85 per domestic passenger, and US$2.28 per international passenger; 169,190 passengers
                                                                                                 33
from ferries and cruise vessels used the passenger terminal. Considering that the actual
construction costs were slightly lower than the appraisal estimates, the ex-post ERR of this
component was estimated to be 13.1percent.

The investments for the Rijeka Bypass construction (Orehovica-Draga-Sv. Kuzan section) were
estimated at appraisal to be US$87.8 million, with an ERR of 15.3 percent. The Project bypass
section has been constructed, and has been fully operational since the opening on December 2006.
The bypass provides a through link for traffic—thereby relieving the congested city center. In
addition, the bypass provides an efficient transport link between the Port of Rijeka area and the
national/international transport network. The construction works were divided into four lots, and
four contracts were procured with an actual cost of civil works of €90.3 million (US$117.4
million)—which represents an increase of 33 percent over the estimated costs at appraisal, and 26
percent over the original contract cost (US$91.1 million). Cost overruns were caused by
unforeseen circumstances (landslides) encountered during the works. Considering that the actual
construction costs were higher than the appraisal estimates, the ex-post ERR of this component
was estimated to be 11.2 percent.

The investments on the D-404 port connector road were estimated at appraisal to be US$31.4
million, with an ERR of 13.2 percent. The road was constructed, and it has been fully operational
since May 2011; it provides an efficient eastern exit from the city. The truck transit time from the
port to the bypass has been reduced from half an hour to less than ten minutes. The construction
works were divided in three lots, and three contracts were procured with an actual cost of civil
works of €52.3 million (US$68.0 million). This represented an increase of 117 percent over the
estimated costs at appraisal, and 23 percent over the original contract cost (US$55.3 million).
Cost overruns were caused by revision of the initial design of the tunnel. Considering the actual
construction costs—which were much higher than the appraisal estimates—and the positive
immediate impact of the Project in terms of travel times, the ex-post ERR of this component was
estimated to be 8.2 percent.

The investments on the Krk Bridge rehabilitation were estimated at appraisal to be US$31.5
million, with an ERR of 47.0 percent. The Krk Bridge was rehabilitated. As a result of
rehabilitation works on the protection of the concrete structure, the lifetime of the treated
structural parts of the KrK Bridge has been extended for a minimum of 15 years. The
rehabilitation works were executed under two contracts, with an actual total cost of HRK 84.8
million (US$14.5 million). This represented a decrease of 54 percent from the estimated costs at
appraisal. Considering the actual rehabilitation costs, the ex-post ERR of this component was
estimated to be 59.0 percent.

The realization of the Brajdica Container Terminal was not envisaged at appraisal—it came about
as a result of revised development plans. The construction works are being done in four sections
financed by RG I, RG I/ AF and RG II. The construction works financed by RG I and RG I/ AF
have an actual total cost of US$32.1 million. The economic evaluation done for this component
during the preparation of RG II indicates that these investments have an ERR of 17 percent.

Taking into the account the six Project components for which an ex-post economic evaluation
was done, the overall project ex-post ERR was 15.9 percent, which was higher than the 12.0
percent discount rate defined on the appraisal document. The table below summarizes the ex-post
economic evaluation results.

Annex 7A. Summary of Borrower's ICR – Port of Rijeka Authority

Note: The Summary below is taken from the Borrower’s ICR.           There has been no revision
except when there is an obvious error.

(a) Introduction
RG I. In 2003, the World Bank and the Croatian Government agreed on the legal structure of
three loan agreements totalling to USD 155 million, with PRA (USD 55.1 million), Croatian
Roads (USD 83.3 million) and Croatian Motorways (USD 17.1 million), responsible for the
implementation of their respective parts of the project usually referred to as: “Rijeka Gateway
Project I? or “RG I?.

       “The original estimated value of the whole Rijeka Gateway Project was USD 266.1
       million (USD 155 million WB financed, and the balance financed from the Croatian state
       budget). Out of that amount, USD 55.1 million of World Bank funds was allocated to
       PRA. The value of the project grew through RG I / AF and, subsequently, through RG
       II.?

As indicated above, within Rijeka Gateway Project I, the World Bank has granted a loan to PRA
(IBRD Loan no. 4715-HR), amounting to USD 55.1 million, to assist in financing of
redevelopment of Port of Rijeka.

The loan agreement was signed on July 12, 2003.

RG I/AF – Additional Financing. In 2007, the World Bank granted additional financing to PRA
(IBRD Loan no. 4715-1 HR) in the amount of EUR 35.300.000,00 (USD 48,0 million equivalent).
This additional financing has been granted to enable the objectives related to the port component
of RG I be achieved (Croatian Roads and Croatian Motorways have completed their activities
under RG I and have not been parties to RG I /AF).

The loan agreement providing for the additional financing was signed on June 11, 2007.

RG II. In 2009, the World Bank granted another loan to PRA (IBRD Loan no. 7638 HR), as
extension of the ongoing Rijeka Gateway program. The new loan, usually referred to as “Rijeka
Gateway Project II? or “RG II?, seeks to improve the competitiveness of Rijeka as port-city, by
modernizing strategic port facilities, increase private sector involvement in the port, improving
PRA financial performance enabling a gradual reduction of subsidies, and enhancing the port-city
environment, while better integrating Rijeka in international transport corridors. It provides a
widening in scope to respond to new traffic demand by including new port extensions. The
project RG II builds on the partnerships and achievements of the first Rijeka Gateway project,
engaging a broad spectrum of stakeholders.

Original components of RG I and RG I /AF project: Investments under RG I have originally
included the following components and subcomponents:

As indicated above, the additional financing has been granted in 2007 to PRA to enable the
objectives related to the port component of RG I to be achieved. The additional financing
amounted to EUR 35.3 million and it was intended:

               to cover the financing gap coming from the cost overrun in completion of the
                ZCT subcomponent (EUR 34 million from the additional financing);

               to cover the financing gap in technical services to prepare concession
                arrangements for the ZCT subcomponent (EUR 1.3 million from the additional
                financing).

The composition of components and sub-components to be financed changed to accommodate for
changes in circumstances. The actual outputs by components and sub-components are given in
the following chapter.

Component 1. Port Restructuring And Modernization

Repayment of PPF – Preparatory studies for port component. The funds have been used for
reimbursement of the Project Preparation Facility. Five reparatory studies for the port component
have been financed under the PPF that is to say: (I) detailed engineering and project design by
Nippon Koei (Japan), (ii) study o port/urban redevelopment by consortium FVR/INROS/
HPC/Rijekaprojekt / RGS, (iii) environmental assessment for the whole project by Urbing d.o.o.
Croatia, (iv) business plan for LR by IBM/CSS and RMG and (v) social plan for LR by Jolanta
Hess as individual consultants.

The details of the stated studies are as follows:

(i) Detailed engineering and port design study for redevelopment of the Port of Rijeka (consultant
services; RGP/QCBS/001/2003). On 22 April 2003, the PRA executed the contract with NIPPON
KOEI CO., LTD of Japan on detailed engineering and port design study for redevelopment of the
Port of Rijeka. The consultant had the following main tasks: to review the existing studies and

                                                                                                                                    42
propose conceptual design of various infrastructure project identified in the Port Redevelopment
Program; to prepare all necessary preliminary designs including pertaining cost estimates,
corresponding calculations and detailed economic analysis of the Port Redevelopment Program as
well as all other documents for obtaining location permits; to prepare the technical documentation
sufficient to obtain construction permits; to prepare tender documents for construction. The
contract with the consultant has been amended several times to adapt to the changes in
circumstances (especially in relation to the design of Zagreb Pier Extension, soil investigation
works, soil improvement works). The contract has been finalized on 15 December 2009 in line
with its terms. The initial contract value was EUR 579.605,00. Ultimately, it grew to EUR
1.097.320,00 (through the Addendum no. 5 executed on 17 February 2007).

(ii) Rijeka Port / Urban Area Redevelopment (consultant services; RGP/QCBS/004/2003). On 17
February 2003, PRA executed the contract with FVR Verkehrslogstik & Regionalplannung
GmbH Germany, HPC Hamburg Port Consulting GmbH Germany and INROS
Planungsgesellschaft mbH Germany that was financed out of Project Preparation Facilities, with
the view to assist PRA in managing, designing and financing the redevelopment of 17 hectares of
the waterfront. The services included definition of legal framework, preliminary site analysis and
data collection, land use allocation, parcelling, economic and financial analysis. The consultant
performed the services in line with contractual terms and conditions for the value of EUR
244.73,00. The contract closed on 30 September 2009.

(iii) Environmental Assessment for the Rijeka Gateway Project . On 15 October 2002, PRA and
Urbing d.o.o. executed the contract pursuant to which the consultant provided the services of
environmental assessment report for the RG Project in line with IBRD requirements. The contract
was finalized in accordance with its terms on 30 June 2002. The contract value amounted to EUR
54.419,00 (USD 58.520,00).

(iv) Contracts related to Luka Rijeka d.d. The Port of Rijeka is the man port of Croatia. Up to
1995, it was run by LR. In 1996, state-owned enterprise Luka Rijeka split into LR which is a joint
stock company in charge of operations, and PRA – a public authority (landlord). Based on 1995
Maritime Law, the priority concession was granted to LR in 2000 for all existing terminals except
Brajdica Container Terminal, the Passenger Terminal and Raša (at Istria peninsula). Through the
Priority Concession Agreement, the Government, PRA and LR have agreed to complete the
privatization of port operations. On 30 September 2002, PRA and Pricewaterhouse Coopers, PwC
Consulting – Plant Location International of Belgium, executed the contract for Preparation of
Enterprise Restructuring Plan for Luka Rijeka d.d. for the price of USD 200.000,00 (EUR
179.292,00) pursuant to which the consultant prepared a 3-year Business Plan for LR defining the
sequence and timing of proposed changes in LR, and estimated their expected operational,
organizational, and financial impact, with a view to improving port services in a competitive
environment and accomplishing the transition in a socially responsible way as defined by Priority
Concession Agreement. The social aspect of LR restructuring was supported through the contract
for Preparation of Social Plan for LR executed on 2 October 2002 between PRA and Jolanta
Hess. The contract was finalized successfully and its value amounted to EUR 27.112,00 (USD
30.000,00).

(v) Audit services 2002 (consultant services; RGP/LCS/002/2002). Contract for the audit of Port
of Rijeka Authority and for the audit of the Rijeka Gateway Project for the year 2002 had been
signed on 20 May 2002 with Iris Nova d.o.o. Croatia. The audit reports had been sent to the WB
and had been found acceptable. The total value of the contract amounted to EUR 24.912,40.
                                                                                             43
Rehabilitation of port infrastructure and superstructure. This sub-component originally
envisaged rehabilitation works in the western part of the port to allow a smooth transfer of the
operations related to the handling of woods and timber, including demolition of outdated and
unused warehouses, repaving along the western part of the port for the storage of general cargo,
rehabilitation of utility networks (water, electricity and telephone), rehabilitation of the fencing
and improvement of the port connection with the road and railways network.

Given that the warehouses scheduled for demolition were later preserved as cultural heritage and
given that PRA gave up the construction of the infrastructure corridor, the funds originally
allocated to this sub-component were distributed to other sub-components.

Demolition and construction of warehouses at Zagreba?ko and Prague berth area. The PRA
initially intended to construct Zagreb Pier of 250 m and develop / arrange the terminal.
Subsequently, PRA decided to pursue with construction of the quay wall of 400 m and leave the
development of the terminal facilities to a prospective concessionaire. Therefore the funds
originally allocated to this sub-component were distributed to other sub-components.

Reconstruction of Becko berth (works; RGP/03/01 NCB 2004). The contract on reconstruction
of Becko berth was concluded on 27 July 2004 with GP KRK d.d. for the value of EUR
1.145.845,00. The contract was completed successfully – the operating permit was obtained in
June 2005 and Becko berth has been put into operation.

Reconstruction of Zagreba?ko – West Berth. The initial plan of the PRA was to construct a
berthing facility of 250 m length which would allow vessels of 15 meter draft to service the Port
of Rijeka. These plans have changed substantially.

Zagreb Pier Extension (works; RGP-CW-019/2004) On 24 November 2005, PRA has signed the
contract on Zagreb Pier Extension with the most favorable bidder – KAJIMA CORPORATION
of Japan for the price of HRK 217.911.411,89 and YPY 372.820.668,22. The contract envisaged
extension of the pier for 250 m to allow the vessels of 15 meter draft to service the port of Rijeka.
During the implementation of the contract, the additional soil investigations had been performed
(upon the request of authorized design reviewers). The boring logs have revealed that the project
area was generally in conformity with the originally estimated soil conditions, except for the one
location, where very soft marine deposits had been found. In spite of all efforts to develop the
most economical and most efficient method of soft soil improvement, it was concluded that the
soil improvement works were too risky and that the estimated cost of construction overcame the
allowable budget. Therefore, PRA decided to start the process of termination of the Contract for
Employer’s convenience. The termination of the Contract became effective on March 31, 2008.
In parallel, preparatory activities for Zagreb Container Terminal Design & Build bidding process
had started.

Geotechnical Soil Investigation for Zagreb Pier – 2nd stage (works; RGP/049/08/ICB/2008). As a
preparatory step for the procurement of ZCT Design & Build Contract, on 23 July 2009 PRA
contracted geotechnical soil investigation works with Igeotest Marina of Spain, for the value of
EUR 2.329.944, 54 (financed entirely from RG I /AF). The results of the investigations (finished
in early 2010) were included in ZCT Design & Build Contract.


                                                                                                  44

from RG I /AF.

Construction of Brajdica Container Terminal. The realization of this sub-component was not
envisaged initially - it came as a result of revised development plans.

The first stage of construction of Brajdica Container Terminal was already completed (before RG
project) and it existed as container terminal with the following main characteristics: 125,000 sq
meters of surface area, quay lengths: RO-RO ramp 59 m, Brajdica West 164m, Brajdica South
295 m; declared quay draft: 11 m. Further construction (the so-called 2nd construction stage)
envisaged four sections:

       Section A – extension of the existing South quay towards the East, by 328 m with depth
        along quay apron of 14.5 m;
       Section B – new entrance – exit point;
       Section C – container railway station;
       Section D – service activities areas.

The construction of Section B – Entrance Facilities - has been completed (the works have started
beginning of 2011 and have been performed by Viadukt d.d. Zagreb; RGP/050 NCB 20010) and
the construction of Section A – Pier Extension is ongoing; the contract has been awarded in
December 2009 to a Joint venture GP Krk, Viadukt and Primorje (RGP/048/08 ICB 2008). The
start of tendering process for sections C and D depends on an agreement with the port operator
(concessionaire) Adriatic Gate. Construction of the largest BCT section (Section A) is expected to
last for 3 years, from the beginning of 2010 to the beginning of 2013. Construction of Section B
has been financed from RG I /AF. Section A has been financed from RG I, RG I /AF and would
be financed from RG II.

training and testing of all elements of the system, the VTMIS system was officially taken over
and put into full operation of 1 July 2009.

Antipollution equipment. A part of the antipollution equipment was installed by PRA before the
commencement of the RG Project. The additional equipment was not installed due to the lack of
operative arrangement with the concessionaire – LR.

decided that all ports in Croatia have to use single window system, usually referred to as: CIMIS.
Furthermore, Brajdica CT concessionaire has started to use a new international IT solution -
NAVIS - which is a worldwide accepted solution. Luka Rijeka d.d. also decided to invest in IT
solution and to cover some important logistic processes. Taking in account all above

the Senjsko quay and the root of the breakwater were completed on December 23, 2011. Vertical
and horizontal traffic signals were set on and the subcomponent was finalized on February 29,
2012 for the total contract amount of EUR 435.679,00.

Rijeka Breakwater Armor Rock Recovery (works; RGP-069/NCB/2012). The contract was
executed on 29 June 2012 for the contract amount of HRK 3.352.984,97. The works were
completed on 27 September 2012.

(c) The Bank’s and the Borrower’s performance

The Bank

During the implementation of RG I and RG I /AF, the World Bank project team has provided
invaluable guidance and advice. It reviewed and commented all related documentation, provided
clearance (no objection) whenever required, and performed overall supervision of the project. The
communication between Bank’s and PRA’s teams has been excellent giving the opportunity at
any moment to team members to exchange information at various levels. To manage demanding
tasks the Bank has engaged specialists for different area of expertise, especially in the port sector.
The specialists supported the PRA’s project team. The most important was transfer of
procurement skills to PRA’s team members since Rijeka Gateway Project was the first time that
Bank’s procurement procedures have been used in the field of port modernization projects in
Croatia. PRA is proud that design and build contract pursuant to the FIDIC Yellow book, has
been used first time ever. In this respect, the Bank’s support was and still is of utmost importance.
PRA’s financial and overall monitoring of the project during its implementation has been
continuously followed by the Bank’s team giving at the same time advice whenever was
necessary.

                                                                                                   54
The Borrower

At the beginning of the Rijeka Gateway Project, the Borrower had no experience with WB
financing and no knowledge of WB procedures and it was learning by doing. The Borrower’s
Project Implementation Unit has been provided training and support, and nowadays, after a
decade of work with WB, it can handle the most complex projects. At all times, PIU has strictly
followed Bank’s guidelines and procedures which relate to different kind of procurements
methods.

(d) Lessons Learned

The most important lessons learned by implementation of the loan are following:

   i.   From the early beginning it was clear that well defined project components are essential
        for future implementation. In this respect analyze of needs which to be covered by the
        project components were required. Since port component of the RGP had various items to
        be procured it was very important to distinguish their significance.
   ii. To modernize performance of the port of Rijeka it was essential to make an overview of
        the existing facilities and operational potentials as well as state-of-the-art requirements.
        The project itself had covered wide spectrum of the port components ranging from
        construction of the quite new piers and terminals to the equipment necessary for the
        vessel traffic management within the port area. To this end, validation of the components
        was of utmost importance targeting at the same time the balanced development.
   iii. Well prepared terms of reference and technical specifications have been identified as
        crucial for implementation of the project. In this respect risk assessments for each
        component gave possibility to predict week points in advance.

Annex 7B. Borrower's ICR – Croatian Roads

Note: The Summary below is taken from the Borrower’s ICR.             There has been no revision
except when there is an obvious error.

1. Original Objectives

The overall objective of the Rijeka Gateway Project was to increase Croatia’s trade
competitiveness by improving the international transport gateway through Rijeka. Specific
objective for highway component was to improve international road connections linked to Rijeka
and the administration of the road sector.

2. Description of the Highway Component

Part C: INTERNATIONAL ROAD IMPROVEMENTS:
C3.      Construction of Rijeka bypass section Orehovica-Draga-Sv.Kuzam on D8.
C4.      Safety improvements for selected road sections with a high incidence of traffic accidents
         through: (a) traffic management improvements; (b) design improvement, and (c)
         combined civil engineering-traffic measures.
C5.      Provision of equipment, software upgrade for the pavement and bridge management
         systems, and technical assistance and training to the Borrower to maintain the pavement
         and bridge management systems.
C6.      Carrying out an axle load stud, installation of equipment (fixed scales), and to develop a
         strategy for implementation of the EU axle load standards.
C7.      Provision of technical assistance to the Borrower for improvement of its administration
         of road districts, development of multi-year road maintenance contracts and
         establishment of the road design standards for local roads.

3. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs by Components

    a. Outcome/Achievement of Objective:

For the Borrower, Hrvatske ceste d.o.o., a state agency responsible for the development,
management and maintenance of the state road network, the project enabled completion of two
well justified road sections of national importance, but it also provided a significant support to
HC policy to conserve the value of road assets by timely maintenance and to improve its road
management by implementing advanced road management tools. The project as a whole was
successfully implemented. The last element to complete the project objective for HC was the road
D404, which was opened on May 30, 2011.

    b. Output by Category Components

        b1. Civil works

Construction of Rijeka Bypass section Orehovica-Draga-Sv.Kuzam

The section has been constructed and has been fully operational since the opening on December
14, 2006. The section replaced the segment of the Adriatic Road through the city of Rijeka and
                                                                                                56
completed the western bypass of Rijeka along the route that stretches towards eastern coastal
zones and southwards to Dalmatia. The section was built from Orehovica, a location north of the
City of Rijeka, to the village of Sv.Kuzam, situated above the Bay of Bakar. While providing a
through link for traffic travelling southwards, and thus relieving the congested city centre, the
Bypass also provided an efficient transport link between the Port of Rijeka area and the
national/international transport network. The Bypass is a 6.36 km long highway with a two-lane
dual roadway. It incorporates three interchanges (Orehovica, Draga and Sv.Kuzam), five viaducts
and two tunnels (Sv.Kuzam, 323 m and Draga, 211 m).

Implementation aspects
The initial works on Lot 0 started in September 2003 with the reconstruction of the existing road
Podmar?i-Draga and the construction of Viaduct Vežica in order to enable detour route during the
construction of the bypass. In January 2004 contracts were made for the remaining three lots on
the section. The works were completed and the opening took place on December 14, 2006. Time
and cost overruns were caused by unforeseen circumstances encountered during the works. Three
major landslides and a number of smaller ones delayed the works. The landslides in the tunnel
Sv.Kuzam required geotechnical investigations and designs to eliminate the landslide. In addition,
when the works were close to completion, a landslide event occurred along the northern roadway
and the section had not been fully operational until the landslide was stabilized.

Actual component cost
Civil works            EUR 90,339,278
Traffic equipment      EUR 5,895,514

Exchange rate as in PAD, May 9,2003 (1 EUR=7,580034 HRK)

Construction of the Draga-Brajdica (D-404) Connector Road:

The project objective has been met: the road was constructed and has been fully operational since
the opening on May 30, 2011. The road has provided an efficient eastern exit from the City. The
southern terminus of the section is at the National Theatre Building in the city centre. It runs
across Brajdica container terminal and passes the tunnels Pećine (1.34 km) and Bobova (130 m)
before being connected to the highway system at the at the interchange Draga on the Bypass. The
truck transit time from the Port to the Bypass been reduced from half an hour to less than ten
minutes. In addition to improving traffic efficiency in the city and road safety, the road has
brought great relief to the city population because the air pollution from diesel driven vehicles
and urban noise have been reduced. The city zones and the region have already benefited in many
ways from this efficient transport link that is essential for future development of the Port.

The road is only 3.49 km long but it includes one bridge, five viaducts and two tunnels that take
58% of the entire length. The section running through city street area adjacent to the port has two
to four lanes with pedestrian sidewalks, while the uphill section through the tunnels to the Bypass
has three lanes.

A key element for the project was Pećine tunnel that stretches 1341 m under the urban zone and
the railway line. The tunnel incorporates an intersection in the main tube where an exit tunnel 234
m long diverges as a connection to the Policentro trade center area.


                                                                                                57
Implementation aspects
The contracts for works were made in 2004. The construction works on the Lot 3 from the Draga
intersection to the first exit were completed and opened to traffic in December 2006 together with
a segment connecting D8 with the tunnel Bobova which was constructed within the Lot 3
Contract for D8 Bypass and was temporarily functioning as a connecting road from the Bypass to
the southeast part of the city.

The works on the Lot 1 at the Delta had initial difficulties because Luka Rijeka did not remove its
storage in the Delta Area to free the land plots needed for the works. The issue was later resolved
when the Government gave the replacement land to Luka Rijeka but the removal of storage was
delayed until effectiveness of the Government’ decision. This delayed the works at the southern
terminus of the section. However, the resettlement of ten families from the buildings in the port
area that had to be demolished was carried out to the satisfaction of the people involved.

Works on Lot 2 (Pećine tunnel) were the major element in the construction of the road. Originally
it was foreseen that two exit tunnels would be built to connect the main Pećine tunnel with the
Policentro trade area. The exit tunnels were planned to be financed jointly by HC and the City of
Rijeka. However, the City of Rijeka decided to finance the construction of only one tunnel exit
while postponing the other indefinitely.

Consequently, the tunnel designs had to be changed and the construction permit revised
accordingly, thus between November 2003 and May 2009, several amendments to the
construction permit were issued.

Since the second exit tunnel was not to be constructed, in July 2008 the authorities responsible for
safety requested that two emergency exits for pedestrians, each about 100 long, should be
constructed instead. This had to be done in line with new safety legislation and was a
precondition for issuance of the permit for use.

The construction of the two emergency exists, not funded by the project, and was also expected to
be completed earlier. However, a series of unforeseen events delayed the completion. The
contract for works was made only after repeated bidding procedure because HC had not received
a successful bid in line with cost estimates at first. Major factor in delays were the changes in the
design and construction permit which resulted in mandatory changes to the tunnel equipment
(traffic signs, ventilation, and lighting). The delivery and installation of the equipment was
delayed because works in the pedestrian tunnels had to be completed first. Following the
completion on February 28, 2011, the technical inspections had to be conducted and the use
permits obtained. The procedure took another three months until the final opening of D404.

Time and cost overruns may all be attributed to the revision of the initial design of the tunnel.

Black spot elimination

Originally it was foreseen that the Bank would co-finance the improvements of a number of black
spots in Croatia within a broader program of HC carried out in support to the Government’s
National Road Safety Program. Previously the Bank supported the efforts of the Government and
HC to reduce high accident rates in Croatia through financing of the Road Safety Study within the
Highway Sector Study.

During the implementation of the Rijeka Gateway Project, HC decided to use its own funds for
the elimination of black spots, while the project component was reallocated to other civil works
(EUR 6 million).

In the past ten years HC spent 179.5 million kuna for its black spot program carried out within its
periodic maintenance, special improvement schemes and betterment project financed by EIB.
This resulted in the elimination of 215 and the improvement of 46 black spots.

The results measured over a three year period (before and after the improvement) show a
decrease of road accidents at the high risk locations by 75.2% (1568 versus 6326), a decrease of
fatalities by 90.8% (12 versus 131), heavily injured by 74.2% (141 versus 548) and light injuries
by 71.9% (555 versus 1980). Thus, the HC program of road safety improvements has been very
effective in reducing accident costs and human suffering (accidents and saved lives (over 119
lives saved and 4758 accidents avoided).

        b2. Goods

Provision of Traffic Equipment for D-8 and for link road D404
The contract for supply and installation of traffic equipment included equipment for power supply,
roadway lighting, traffic signalization, road furniture, video surveillance system, tunnel
ventilation for both sections D8 and D404 combined. The deadline for D8 was met in 2006, but
the installation of traffic equipment on D404 was delayed until the completion of construction
works in the tunnel. Supervision services for the installation of equipment were included in the
contract for supervision of works. Cost estimate for this item at appraisal was EUR 9,000,000.

Actual component cost EUR 12,484,560.

Traffic Counters
Traffic counters that were included in the component were intended to complement the pavement
and bridge management systems (PMS/BMS) initially supported under the Bank’s Highway
Sector Project (traffic counters, weigh-in-motion scales, weather monitoring system, PMS/BMS
software upgrade, and technical assistance/training). However, during the implementation of
Rijeka Gateway Project, HC decided to use its own funds for the procurement of traffic counters,
and the loan funds were reallocated to civil works category (EUR 650,000).The existing traffic
census system in Croatia includes over 470 traffic counting sites. At present there are 207
automatic traffic counters and 66 portable traffic counters used. The counters are linked to the
central system and are regularly replaced or supplemented by new counters. HC is satisfied with
the system that provides reliable data on traffic volumes in the state road network.


                                                                                                59
WIM Scales
Originally, WIM Scales were included in the procurement plan (EUR 350,000). Later, HC
purchased two WIM scales using its own funds while the loan funds were reallocated to the
works. The scales are permanently installed on D1 and D8 to measure the total mass and axle
loads of vehicles that cross the roads throughout the year. In addition, four portable WIM devices
were procured and are used at 134 sites throughout the state road network. HC spent 3.5 million
HRK for the scales.

Weather Monitoring System
Weather monitoring system included in the original design of the project (EUR 700,000) was also
excluded from the Bank financing and proposed for reallocation. HC financed the development of
the weather monitoring system on state roads using its own funds. HC has been replacing and
upgrading the weather monitoring stations continually (in 2010-2011 HC spent one million HRK
for the acquisition of 11 new WMS). Currently there are 79 weather monitoring stations installed
on the state roads, with special emphasis on regions with colder climate and moderate to high
traffic volumes. The stations are linked to the central weather information system to enable
visualization and archiving of data and control of variable traffic signs.

PMS/BMS Software upgrade and HDM IV
Estimated cost for this item was EUR 100,000. The items procured included the software dTIMS
CT by Deighton (USD 52.916 or EUR 32,243 in March 2005); HDM IV software (USD 4416),
and the upgrading of the existing laser prophilograph (Greenwood Engineering A/S) owned by
Hrvatske ceste. The upgrading consisted in replacement of the complete software system of the
prophilograph and installation of a new laser sensor for measuring of pavement texture together
with data processing software for that component. The contract price was EUR 51,870. In 2011
further upgrade to the prophilograph was made by moving of the prophilograph P55 to a new
vehicle with an upgrade by two new measuring lasers and the supply and integration of digital
imaging system (two cameras for ROW wider than 3.5 m). HC spent EUR 82,000 of its own
funds for that purpose. The prophilograph has been essential to monitoring of the road network
condition conducted by HC.

Vehicle Inspection Station
Installation of vehicle inspection stations (estimated cost EUR 1,850,000) was abandoned
because of the need to establish integrated system of axle road enforcement on the entire road
network. Eight mobile inspection teams were established and equipped to implement enforcement
of the permitted total mass and axle loads of vehicles in road traffic. The inspections are
scheduled and enforced in cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Croatia.
Measuring of the total mass and axle loads of freight vehicles is carried out on vehicles when
motionless, on portable scales, at about 1272 inspection sites established within the road-of-way,
or on the rest areas, additional lanes and lay-bys. In addition, inspection of total mass of freight
vehicles that enter the Republic of Croatia is carried out within customs inspections at all
international border crossings.

GIS Configuration Extension Intergraph and Oracle Supplement License
The estimated cost for the software was EUR 500,000. The software, procured in 2004 within the
project (EUR 391,782) has been in use.



                                                                                                60
Software (Weather System, Traffic System)
Originally the cost estimate for this item had been EUR 150,000, however the funds were
reallocated. The decision was justified by the opinion that the weather monitoring system and
traffic monitoring system operated in a satisfactory manner using the existing software.

        b3. Consultant’s services and training

Supervision services on D8 and D404
The consultants’ services of supervision for all civil works and installation of road equipment
were provided by Civil Engineering Institute from Zagreb. The contract was signed in 2003 for
EUR 3.14 million and implemented until the completion of civil works and installation of traffic
equipment in May 2011.

Axle load study
It was foreseen that the project would finance an axle load study to improve the enforcement of
axle load limits in Croatia and the installation of equipment (fixed scales) to develop a strategy
for enforcement of permitted axle loads ((10t/axle) and eventual adoption of the EU standard
(11.5 t/axle). However, at the time of mid-term implementation of the project, it was assessed
that the enforcement of total mass and axle loads of vehicles on the roads in Croatia had been
adequate for the conditions in Croatia, therefore HC cancelled the Study and the loan funds were
reallocated (EUR 500,000).

Management consultant
Originally it was intended that management consultants would be provided by the project to assist
HC in improving the administration of the Road Districts, introduce multi-year road maintenance
contracts, and establish road design standards for local roads. Later it was decided that the funds
for this component (EUR 300.000) would be reallocated. During implementation of the project,
HC made a commitment within the EBRD loan made in 2006 to finance the eastern part of Rijeka
Bypass Sv.Kuzam-Križišće section. The project included technical assistance to assist the
Borrower with the preparation and introduction of performance-based road maintenance contracts
in two to three pilot areas of the country. The consultant’s services are under way, it is expected
that a multi-year road maintenance performance based maintenance contract will be made next
year.

Technical assistance/training for PMS/BMS
Initially, consultant’s services had been intended to be provided for the establishment of the
advanced road pavement management system that would have enabled optimization of the
pavement condition on the road network level. Following the procurement of dTIMS CT software
under the project, the procurement of consultant’s services was launched in 2005. However the
component was postponed, and the sum of EUR 200,000 was reallocated to other category.

HC pursued the delayed procurement in 2010 and financed the services by its own funds (EUR
153,450.00). The contract was made with the Viagroup from Switzerland and implemented by
March 2012. The services included: development of pavement condition assessment and
pavement performance prediction models, definition of treatment catalogue and development of
model for implementation of maintenance treatments and impact on pavement condition,
identification of homogenous sections with respect to pavement condition, development of model
for definition of costs/benefits and analyses of various scenarios of investment in maintenance of
state road network. The results obtained defined conditions of pavements in ten or more year
                                                                                               61
periods and correlated them to various maintenance scenarios and various maintenance budget
levels. The results of analyses will be used for preparation of maintenance programs in the
upcoming period.

Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

             Project preparation/ Quality at Entry
At the time of appraisal the project components Bypass on D8 and Connector road on D404 had
already undergone procedures for the defining and approval of locations. The engineering design
documents, environmental studies, location permits and the procurement documents for the first
year’s activities were complete and ready for the start of project implementation. The contracts
for works of D8 started as early as 2003, and D404 started in 2004. The resettlement of families
along the D404 was done in the early stage and to the satisfaction of people involved.

           Factors Outside of the Control of Implementing Agency:
      Unforeseen circumstances during the construction of Orehovica-Sv.Kuzam: Soil/rock
       conditions were worse than anticipated and a series of landslides occurred. Three major
       landslides around the tunnel and in Sv.Kuzam tunnel required additional geotechnical
       investigations and the tunnel design was redefined. When the works were close to
       completion, a landslide event occurred along the northern roadway and the landslide had
       to be stabilized prior to opening of the full profile of the section to traffic. As a
       consequence, the costs increased and the completion of the section was delayed.

      Unforeseen circumstances during the construction of D404 connector road: The works on
       the Lot 1 at the Delta had initial difficulties because Luka Rijeka did not free land plots in
       the Delta Area occupied by its storage. Luka Rijeka claimed indemnity for the loss of
       space resulting from the works. The issue was later resolved when the Government gave
       a land for compensation to Luka Rijeka. However, the removal of storage was delayed
       until effectiveness of the Government’ decision. This further delayed the works at the
       southern terminus of the road. Soon after the launch of the project, the City of Rijeka who
       had previously made a commitment to finance the Pećine tunnel exits to Policentro trade
       center and act as the Employer for the tunnel exits (while HC would co-finance half of
       the costs), decided to build only one exit tunnel and postpone the other because of the
       lack of funds. The City also assigned its role of the Employer to Rijeka Promet d.d. As a
       consequence HC had to undertake a series of engineering and legal actions that would not
       otherwise had been undertaken and ultimately had to finance unforeseen cost overruns for
       the project. An engineering redesign of the tunnel was followed by a series of
       amendments to the construction permit (2003-2009). A change in safety regulations that
       came in force in 2008 required two pedestrian safety exits to be built in the tunnel. The
       tunnel signalization and equipment had to be revised accordingly. New contracts for
       works on the safety exits had to be procured (and it took three bidding reiterations to
       receive the bid in line with cost estimates). As a consequence, the D404 section was
       opened to traffic five years behind the schedule.

           Monitoring indicators for the road sector:
Road Maintenance Levels
The road maintenance expenditure was increased and as a result the road network condition was
improved during project implementation, in line with the sector Letter of Development Policy.
                                                                                                  62
In 1999-2000 the road maintenance budget had been reduced in favor of the intensive motorway
construction program. Hrvatske ceste d.o.o proposed and the Government supported the road
maintenance program that included gradual increase of the road maintenance standards for both
routine and periodic maintenance. The road management program was supported under the
project and adequate road maintenance levels were established as monitoring indicators for the
project. Loan Agreement covenant stated that sufficient funds should be spent on road
maintenance/rehabilitation so as to improve the average condition of the main road network. In
the 2003-2009 period, the objective set in terms of maintenance level was met, and the overall
increase in road maintenance exceeded the original targets (2.5 times the minimum maintenance
expenditures set as a target).

Bank and Borrower Performance

              The Bank
The performance of the Bank was very satisfactory during the preparation of the project and
later during implementation. The Bank team at project appraisal was very efficient in tailoring
the project component and established excellent communication with HC staff at various levels.
Some of the specialists already had good knowledge of the transport sector in Croatia and the
Borrower (HC) through their involvement in the Highway Sector Project. In particular, strong
support was provided in early procurement procedures for civil works component that had
started even before the project was launched (prequalification of contractors).
The Bank’s team during implementation of the project continued to provide hands-on advice
and assistance to HC staff in procurement matters. Assistance in financial monitoring or overall
monitoring of the progress also had a good effect. The role of the Bank and understanding of the
difficulties faced during implementation were appreciated by the Borrower.

            The Borrower
Hrvatske ceste d.o.o. had already had experience with the road sector projects financed by the
World Bank in the decade before the launch of Rijeka Gateway Project. HC had PIU which
participated in project preparation and was fully operational by project effectiveness. It was
staffed with personnel who had had the experience with Bank rules and procedures. As the
Project moved into implementation PIU was additionally staffed by young professionals who
contributed considerably to project implementation capacities at HC.

Lessons Learned
Main lessons in implementation of this loan are the following:

(i)     While sound preparation is important to project implementation, there are some events
        that cannot be foreseen. For this reason a well defined plan with clearly defined functions
        and responsibilities is crucial for healthy partnership and efficient project implementation.
        This is even more relevant for a project that involves project partners that come from
        both local and state level and have different views and priorities.
(ii)    With local partners who have a special interest in a project and make commitments to
        participate in financing, HC should have a well defined contract in place with clearly
        established contractual obligations and responsibilities. The case with D404 has shown
        that although a change in contract obligations on the part of the local partner may have
        been justified, it has resulted in major unforeseen design alterations and legal procedures
        which entailed a series of consecutive delays and cost overruns for HC.

                                                                                                 63
(iii)   Realistic assessment of the future needs, priorities and capacities are essential in making
        future commitments. Any potential risks should be identified in project preparation stage
        and dealt with proactively.

1.       Project Description

The proposed services make a part of the project called "Rijeka Gateway Project", in which
"Hrvatske autoceste" d.o.o. was one of the implementation companies performing the project,
responsible for:
     rehabilitation of the Krk bridge (small and big arch);
     obtaining of ISO 9001 certificate (for itself);
     obtaining of Internal Audit Services for implementation of the Total Quality Management
        System;
     certification of Total Quality Management;

As the main activity was rehabilitation of the Krk bridge that connects the land with the largest
Croatian island of Krk (via St. Mark islet) nearby Kraljevica (approximately 25 km from Rijeka,
Croatia's main port). It is of an exceptional economic, particularly tourist, importance to the
island of Krk, and also to the neighbouring islands of Cres and Lošinj. It consists of two bridges:
the large arch bridge, which connects the land with the islet of St. Mark, and the small arch bridge,
which extends this connection to the island of Krk. The first arch is 390 m long and is still one of
the largest bridges of its kind in the world. The other is 244 m long. The overall length of the
bridge is 1310 m, which includes a 96 m road cutting on St. Mark islet.

The goal of establishing the Highway Database with all relevant structures on motorways and the
surrounding area consisted in the increased efficiency of the existing systems by computerization
of the main activities. The set of data in the Highway Database is prepared as a support to
                                                                                                  66
decision making ranging from making daily operating decisions to investment maintenance
planning of motorways and the appertaining structure as well as the decisions on construction of
new motorways and ancillary infrastructure.

Besides this, the applications contained in the Database permit efficient reporting to the
competent national and international institutions on issues related to the motorway management
system in Croatia.

The proposed project was aimed at supplementing the current database with the data on the
remaining part of the network and introduce upgrading and adjustment in accordance with the
determined needs of the company for more efficient management.

For this purpose updating of the highway database using all relevant data on motorway sections
managed by HAC d.o.o. that have not been yet surveyed or entered into the base was of
extremely importance. The new survey, data processing and migration into the HDB was
completed for approximately 315 km of new motorways.

Expert supervision implies the accuracy check of the data collected on field (accuracy of
mapping), checking of accuracy of basic attributes as well as the check of consistency of data in
forms prepared for migration. At the migration stage the supervision checks the consistency and
the integrity of the data sets as well as the functionality of the base over the entered data.

Within this project was implemented the following:
            o The system of control of data collected by survey for the HDB
            o Verification of the survey data
            o Control of entering the data into the database
            o Control of the accuracy of the entered data and the functionality of the base with
                regard to the entered data.

4.       Revised Project Development Objectives

    a. Additional works that have been contracted
Works on the rehabilitation of the piers S18 and S19 (piers that belong to the big arch of the Krk
bridge).
Amendment amount: 4.804.017,51 HRK (net amount) + 1.056.883,85 HRK (VAT)

     b. Additional services that have been contracted
           o Collection of data from the existing motorway network, data processing and
               entering into the Highway Database.
           o Expert supervision over collection and processing of data for the Highway
               Database.

5.      Conclusion

Hrvatske autoceste d.o.o. have successfully finished all of the Project components and activities
under the Rijeka Gateway Project. With the rehabilitation works on the protection on the concrete
structure the lifetime of the treated structural parts of the Krk Bridge has been extended for
minimum of 15 years.
                                                                                              67
Thanks to Loan proceeds, Croatian Motorways acquired three certificates as follows:
       ISO 9001:2000
       ISO 14001:2004
       OHSAS 18001:1999

During the period 2006-2009 19 audits were executed by Det Norske Veritas Adriatica and 61
Croatian Motorway's employees were educated out of which 41 internal auditor certificates were
granted. During the same period Buerau Veritas Croatia executed 53 internal audits. 31
employees were educated according to OHSAS 18001, out of which 19 of them were awarded
with the certificate of Internal Auditor. Four educations for top management, medium and
operative management (110 employees) were executed through seven courses.

Major benefits from certification and harmonization of the management system project in the
period 2005-2010 were as follows:

   a. ISO 9001 Quality Management System:
         o Recognition of the main processes in HAC
         o Recognition and goal determination in organization units
         o Significant improvement of supervision of documents
         o Improvement of documents labeling
         o Determination of management board commitment
         o Planning of quality system management
         o Improvement of establishment of responsibilities,               authorities,   internal
             communication.
         o Improving employees awareness for quality management

   b.   ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management Systems
           o 45 recognition of environmental impacts
           o program design for environmental impacts, determination of responsibilities and
              jurisdiction in its management
           o Supervision improvement over the above mentioned activities which includes
              Mandatory analysis and conducting the improvements
           o Better recognition and identification of the relevant legislative
           o Employee education and raising the awareness

   c. OHSAS 18001 Management system for health and safety
        o Improved presentation and communication of the relevant legal requirements and
           Internal documents with all employees
        o Improvement of system analysis
        o Employee education and raising the awareness

In 2010 HAC has initiated procedure for recertification of the above said certificates (norms)
which will be financed from its own resources. Certificates have been successfully extended for
next three years (2010-2013).

The Project of collecting data for Highways database by means of geodetic survey provided an
additional value to Croatian Motorways’ Information Management system. More than 500 km of
highways were surveyed and huge amount of new data was collected and added to the existing
database thus providing the complete and accurate information system for our in-house analysis
                                                                                           68
and decision making requirements and also better service for the outside institutions in need of
our data.

Annex 11: Implementation of Luka Rijeka Social Program45

Introduction

In 2003, the Croatian Government launched the Rijeka Gateway (RG) Project, supported by a
World Bank loan. The objective of the Project was to increase Croatia’s trade competitiveness by
improving the international transport chain through Rijeka, modernizing the port and road
network connections, and privatizing port operations. In particular, the Project supported the
restructuring of the port operator Luka Rijeka d.d (LR)—including labor force restructuring. LR
prepared a strategy for restructuring the labor force in a socially responsible manner, called its
Social Program. During the four years of the Social Program’s implementation, 479 (out of a total
of 1339) employees voluntarily departed LR through options of early retirement and enhanced
severance, at a total cost of US$7.2 million. The Social Program was implemented—in
consultation with staff, unions and other key stakeholders—through a transparent process, in a
timely fashion with minimal social tensions. A tracer study reviewed the Social Program ex-post,
and provided a number of lessons learned.

Rationale and Background

In the late 1990s, the Government of Croatia undertook significant efforts to reform its port sector,
including the largest Croatian port, the Port of Rijeka. The port operating company—LR—was
transformed into a joint stock company in 1999, and a year later it was granted a 12-year priority
concession to operate the port. The concession period was designed to allow for the restructuring
of LR. At that time, LR was in a very weak financial position, characterized by overstaffing,
outdated equipment and low efficiency.

The Project supported the restructuring of LR to increase efficiency and improve the financial,
social and environmental conditions at the Port of Rijeka, through rehabilitation of infrastructure
and replacement of equipment. As part of the Project preparation, a business plan was devised
that provided the medium-term framework for LR’s restructuring. The business plan analyzed in
detail LR’s performance in comparison to its main competitors (Trieste and Koper)—it included
an analysis of labor productivity. The results indicated that LR suffered from low staff
productivity levels as compared to its competitors. In addition to the planned infrastructure
investments and institutional restructuring, the business plan identified the need for labor
restructuring with two main goals: (i) significant staff reductions; and (ii) improvement in the
blue/white collar ratio.

As explained above, in 2003 LR prepared and launched the Social Program, its strategy for
restructuring its labor force. The Social Program was designed to reach optimal staffing levels,
while taking into account the characteristics of the existing LR workforce. It included
redeployment measures to assist displaced employees. The Program was developed in close
cooperation with the unions. It was financed by the RG Project—through a sub-loan from the Port
Authority to LR in the amount of US$7.2 million—by the Croatian Employment Service (CES),
with support from the EU and LR. In addition, a tracer study was conducted to monitor the
welfare of retrenched staff and to provide guidance for future human resource policy.

     This note was prepared by Hana Huzjak, Research Analyst in 2010
                                                                                                 72
Key Features of the Social Program

The Social Program envisaged a planned approach to the labor reduction. This consisted of a
Phase 1 to address the general level of overstaffing, and a Phase 2 linked to the physical activities
of port modernization and restructuring. The design of both phases included the provision to
workers of access to an information center located on LR premises, and to counseling and other
redeployment assistance provided by the Project established Mobility Center.

Staff Reduction Options

During Phase 1, eligible workers had three options. The first option was early retirement on a
voluntary basis—by purchasing the missing years of service through an insurance company. The
second option was voluntary departure with an enhanced severance package as stipulated in the
collective agreement—with an additional incentive of Kuna 1,00046 per year for each year of
service in LR up to a maximum of 25 years. The third option was involuntary departure for the
workers who were on the redundancy list and who did not qualify for retirement or pre-retirement
benefits.

In addition to staff reduction options, the Social Program included communication activities,
consultation, information sharing, and stakeholders’ input during the entire process. The
consultation and communication activities strongly focused on internal communication with the
workers—mainly through direct contact in the information center.

A Worker Information Center (WIC) was established on LR premises in 2003, which offered
information about the restructuring program and the Social Program. Workers were able to visit
the WIC during their working hours, and receive information on available options, severance
payments, training related to the implementation of the restructuring program, etc. The WIC also
provided referrals to the Mobility Center. The WIC was active for three years, successfully
providing information and advice to the workers of LR. Four staff of LR were trained and
assigned to work in the WIC. This proved to be the key success factor, because the workers felt
comfortable approaching those staff, and asking for clarifications, recommendations and advice.

A Mobility Center (MC) was developed in 2004, in coordination with the Croatian Employment
Service (CES)—it was co-financed by the EU CARDS 2001 Labor Market Restructuring Project.
It was a novelty in Croatia, with the objective of providing financial counseling, as well as
information on redeployment opportunities and current conditions in the labor market. The MC
had four full-time employees (two of whom were employees of LR).

Partnership

During the preparation and implementation of the Social Program, LR had numerous
consultations with all key stakeholders. LR consulted on a regular basis with the workers’ unions
in order to keep potential social tensions to a minimum, and to create favorable conditions for the
implementation of the Social Program. The unions were sensitized to the poor financial condition

of their company and the adverse consequences of retaining the status quo. This direct
engagement and dialogue with the unions proved to be the key to building a sense of trust and
partnership during the restructuring process. It also enabled the company to persuade the unions
that improved company performance would benefit the remaining LR employees. LR also
cooperated closely with the CES during the establishment and operation of the Mobility Center.

Challenges and Outcomes

From 2003-2007, 479 staff departed LR (35 percent of a total of 1339 staff) through the Social
Program options of early retirement and voluntary departure. An overwhelming number of
workers (78 percent) chose the option of enhanced severance—due to its attractiveness and
incentives—and departed voluntarily. This resulted in non-implementation of the involuntary
departure option. The rightsizing exercise resulted in increased productivity levels for the
remaining staff, as well as an increase in staff benefits.

The total cost of the program was US$7.2 million (or about US$15 thousand per staff equivalent
to two years of salary), which was expended on severance payments, counseling and advisory
services, and training and job-search assistance. The independent auditors’ report—which was
undertaken in 2008—reviewed the severance payments (statements of expenditures), and
confirmed that payments were made to all 479 staff members in a transparent and accountable
manner.

The Social Program achieved most of its objectives. It generated stronger consultation between
management and workers’ unions. The restructuring improved the company’s workforce
structure—with an emphasis on better qualified and dynamic staff—and assisted LR in
rebalancing the blue/white collar ratio. It is nonetheless noted that the workforce structure did not
change fully as expected, because the involuntarily retirement option was not triggered. Overall,
the LR Social Program—as an integral part of the company’s restructuring strategy—has proven
to be successful, with quantifiable outcomes in the areas of increased productivity and better
financial performance.

Financial and Economic Evaluation

A financial and economic analysis was undertaken to evaluate the impact of the LR labor
restructuring47. It considered the costs of severance payments, redeployment assistance (WIC,
MC, training) and outsourced labor for LR, as well as savings in wages and transportation
allowance of former workers. The findings indicate significant financial benefits—with a net
present value of US$8.7 million using a discount rate of 12 percent, and an ERR of 60 percent.

The economic analysis considered the economic costs of severance payments, redeployment and
outsourced labor, as well as marginal productivity value of labor savings and marginal
productivity of workers who found employment outside LR. The economic benefits were also
high—at a net present value of US$10.6 million, and an ERR of 79 percent.

Tracer Survey of the LR Social Program

A tracer study was conducted to determine the changes in the welfare and labor market status of
displaced workers who participated in the Social Program. A database of beneficiaries was
created, and the status of each severed employee was traced. The review showed that all severed
employees received full severance packages and social benefits, in line with the existing
regulations (the Study—including methodology and major findings—is attached).

A closer review of the critical findings of the Study indicates that more men (66 percent) were
retrenched than women (33 percent). A majority of retrenched workers (68 percent) were aged 50
and above; about 65 percent had lower educational qualifications, and 78 percent were married
with two to three children. Overall, only 10 percent had a negative perception of the severance
program. When asked to assess the overall change in their quality of life after retrenchment, a
majority of retrenched workers said that it was worse (52 percent), and a minority said it was
equal (36 percent) or better (12 percent).

Type of Social Benefit Used. Half of the respondents left LR with an enhanced severance package,
45 percent with severance, while for only 4 percent of respondents LR bought additional years of
service through the early retirement option. The majority of respondents used their severance for
maintenance of their life standard (39 percent), or invested it in real estate and/or automobiles (35
percent); 20 percent used it for savings; only 2 percent used it for self-employment or additional
education.

Employment Search. While the establishment of the Workers’ Center within LR was successful,
only a small number of beneficiaries used the services of the Mobility Center (11 percent). This
was due to two factors: (i) the majority of SP beneficiaries (61 percent) were not attempting to
find employment after leaving LR; and (ii) a significant number of beneficiaries had general
mistrust towards the redeployment support offered by their former employer. A symbolic number
of the respondents used their severance payment for business start-ups. Three out of 4
respondents looking for a job found new employment in less than a year, mostly through friends,
but also through vacancy announcements in media and employment agencies.

Characteristic of Current Job. Currently, more than two-thirds of the respondents are retired, and
the rest are mostly employed full-time—80 percent of respondents who are reemployed are
equally or better positioned in their new job.

The findings of the tracer survey have been shared with the representatives of LR, the Port of
Rijeka Authority, workers’ unions, and other interested parties. On a before versus after
comparison, the Study indicates: (i) a significant increase in competitiveness and turnover
volume; (ii) an improved workforce structure—particularly with respect to age, qualifications and
the blue/white collar ratio; (iii) optimization of total number of employees; and (iv) increased
salaries and bonuses.
