MEtMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR AN
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND SOCIAL ACTION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed IDA credit to
the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for SDR 17.1 million (US$22.0 million
equivalent) are submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms and would help finance an Economic Management and Social Action Project
(EMSAP) to address the social dimensions of development and support ongoing
structural adjustment operations. Additional funds would be provided, primarily on
a grant basis, by the African Development Fund (US$4.0 million equivalent),
Switzerland (US$4.7 million equivalent), United Nations Development Programe
(US$3.8 million equivalent), and various UN agencies, France, Japan and Italy
(US$1.8 million equivalent).
2.       Background.  Per capita income in Madagascar fts been declining virtually
without interruption for the last 16 years.  During the 19709, the Governmext's
economic policies emphasized increased public sector involvement,
industrialization, nationalization of foreign-owned enterprises, urban consumer
subsidies, and a high level of government control over private economic activity.
Between 1978 and 1980 the Government financed a massive public investment program
with foreign borrowing, which led to a quadr"pling of external debt. Together with
a substantial deterioration of the terms of trade, those policies led to a serious
financial and economic crisis in the early eighties. Between 1971 and 1982, real
per capita GDP fell by about one-fourth.
3.       Since 1983, the Government has implemented courageous actions to redress
the severe internal and external imbalances and to lay the basis for resumed
economic growth. The decline in teal GDP has been arrested, but a high population
growth rate of 3 percent has prevented resumption of per capita income growths
Madagascar is today one of the poorest nations in Africa (US$225 per capita GDP in
1987). These long-term trends are apparent in the deterioration of social
indicators (mortality and morbidity rates, food insecurity, homelessness, etc) for
most social categories. In addition, the same policies that stopped the decline in
GDP have affected different segments of the population differently. For intance,
rapid shifts in the urban/rural terms of trade, together with a sharp decline in
the real wages of civil servants, while beneficial for the bulk of the Malagasy
population, have adversely affected urban dwellers, and especially the poorest
among them, worsening already dismal living conditions.  Other groups, such as
public enterprise employees, while not in absolute poverty, will also be affected
by some of the policy measures. Although trade and tariff policy reforms have led
to the creation of new jobs, the reform of public enterprises will create
redundancies. Finally, the resurgence of malaria to epidemic proportions is not
directly linked to adjustment policies, but constitutes a threat to long-term
recovery prospects.
4.       The Government is conscious that the restoration of per capita growth is a
necessary condition for improving living standards, and has adopted policies to
promote sustainable economic growth. However, the Government is also convinced
that, in the short term, per capita income growth will not be sufficient to
alleviate poverty and increase the access of the most disadvantaged groups t.o
productive resources and employment opportunities. Hence, the Government has



-2
adopted a social policy whose primary objective is economic growth with equity.
The principal elements of the new social policy are outlined in the Government's
Letter of Development Policy (LDP), in stpport of which the Executive Directors
approved the Public Sector Adjustment Credit (PSAC) in June 1988. The LDP also
spells out the priorities, principles and criteria for selecting and targeting
social projects and a Government commitment to cost-effectiveness and budgetary
transparency in implementing social programs.
5.       The Government has identified in broad terms the most disadvantaged target
groups that have not yet benefited from existing programs or projects. These
include: (i) the estimated 2.5 million people (mainly mothers and children) who are
most at risk in the current malaria epidemic becattee of insufficient drugs and poor
distribution; (ii) a significant number of households, that, for a variety of
reasons, including unemployment, chronic underemployment and rapid shifts in the
internal terms of trade, are considered the most severely food-insecure; (iII) the
estimated 11,000 social welfare cases (abandoned children, handicapped, etc.); and
(iv) the estimated 7,000 public enterprise employees who are likely to be laid off
by the public enterprise reforms under the next phase of the adjustment program.
This initial targeting does not address the full spectrum of the social dimensions
of development. It constitutes, however, a significant step in the right direction
that will need to be complemented by further analysis of the most disadvantaged and
vulnerable groups, of what can be done about their situation, and of the most
appropriate delivery vehicles. In this context, the Government intends to make
fuller use of the potential contribution of the non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) in Madagascar, which could be considerable.
6.       Obtaining the full beneficial impact of the adjustment process supported
by the PSAC will depend on the effectiveness of its Implementation. This will
require a reform of the administration's core macroeconomic management instruments,
including in-depth changes of the public expenditure programming and budgeting
systems, the management of investments in state-owned enterprises, and the
structure of the financial sector. The Government has requested IDA assistance to
strengthen its institutional capacity to Implement these reforms effectively, to
collect and analyze key economic and social data, and to address the most urgent
social problems.
7.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Consultative Group (CG) meeting of
January 1988 fully endorsed the Government's priorities. Both the Government and
the donors represented at the CG requested that IDA assist in the development and
implementation of a social program. Up to now, Government actions to address the
social dimensions of development have been limited by the severe financial
constraints, while non-governmental efforts have tended to be fragmented,
underfunded and largely uncoordinated. Moreover, deepening the adjustment process
will require the development and implementation of sometimes complex policy and
institutional reforms. IDA's involvement is considered essential, given the
linkages between the adjustment program and the facilitating measures supported
under the proposed project. Preparation and appraisal of the project components
have been carried out jointly with the Swiss Cooperation and the African
Development Bank, and in close coordination with the donors represented at the
Consultative Group meeting. It was initially envisaged that the proposed project
would be presented to the Executive Directors simultaneously with the PSAC in June
1988. However, because of the complex institutional arrangements necessary for its
implementation, it was decided to pursue the discussions with Government until the
activities under the first year were better defined and the arrangements for their
implementation fully satisfactory. Preparation and start-up activities have been
financed through PPFs totalling US$1.5 million, and through retroactive financing
(para. 11).



-3-
8.       It is anticipated that, following project completion, the actions
initiated will continue to receive donor support. In this context, continued
support for the malaria control and family planning programs is envisaged under the
Association's proposed population and health project and for targeted food
distribution and nutrition under the proposed food security project.
9.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed EMSAP would support the Government's
efforts to improve public sector management, to address the plight of the more
disadvantaged groups and to strengthen its capacity to monitor and address social
issues, policies and programs systematically within its overall economic policy
framework and within the priorities established in the framework of the public
expenditure program. The EMSAP aims to: (i) initiate a program of emergency
actions for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups; (ii) reinforce the capacity of the
Government to monitor social conditions and design social policies and programs;
and (iii) facilitate implementation of the adjustment program by strengthening key
institutions.
10.      Project Description.  Following the Government's and IDA's review of a
larger portfolio of social interventions, agreement has been reached on three major
components, which are: (i) A social action program consisting of: (a) an emrgency
malaria control program; (b) an expansion of family planning services by
Fianakaviana Sambatra (FISA), a local NGO; (c) assistance for the preparation and
Implementation of a food security policy; (d) income-generating sub-projects in
targeted areas; (e) support to the Ministry of Population for coordinating the
NGOs; and (f) a redeployment program for workers who are likely to be laid off as a
result of the public enterprise reform. (ii) A component supported by the Bank's
Africa Region-wide Social Dimensions of Adiustment (SDA) proiect, which would
strengthen the administrative capacity for identifying, preparing, imp-ementing and
monitoring medium- and long-term targeted social programs, in particular by setting
up permanent household surveys and establishing appraisal capabilities for food
security and poverty alleviation projects. (iii) An economic manasement assistance
component that would support lmplem ntation of the adjustment program by financing
short-term technical assistance, studies, training and logistical support for: (a)
reform of the budget process and preparation of a broader public expenditure reform
program; (b) public enterprise reform; and (c) establishment of a study fund to
facilitate preparetion of the next phase of the adjustment process. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$40.9 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$22.3 million (54 percent). A breakdown of the costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations In Madagascar are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. The staff appraisal report No. 7410-MAG, dated October 27, 1988
is also attached.
11.      Project Manazement.  In keeping with the complexity of the situation, the
current lack of reliable data for targeting purposes and the urgency of taking
action, the project design stresses flexibility, includes pilot actions and
emphasizes agreed decision-making processes and selection criteria. This approach
should make it possible to integrate the information gathered during project
implementation to refine, inter alia, the targeting mechanisms as well as the
design of specific social programs. The project's overall coordination would be
handled by the Direction Generale du Plan (DGP). Implementation of the agreed
social action program and of the economic management component would be managed
directly by the concerned ministries or agencies based on a strengthening of
existing institutions. Terms of reference for technical assistance personnel have
been agreed to. Training of their local counterparts would be emphasized to reduce
the need for technical assistance in the long term. To speed project
implementation, retroactive financing for expenditures under the project incurred
prior to effectiveness but no earlier than July 1, 1988 would be provided for an
amount not to exceed US$2.0 million (9.1 percent of the proposed credit amount).

12.      Aareed Actions.  The Government has defined selection criteria for social
action programs and the moialities for monitoring their impact in the LDP. In
addition, the following actions have been agreeds (i) Overall Project. (a) Annual
work programs for overall execution of the project to be prepared and submitted for
IDA approval by the end of August of each year; (b) the appointment of an overall
project coordinator at the DGP and of a component manager for each component; (c)
annual audits, project monitoring procedures and special accounts to be
established. (ii) Social Action Program. The Government has submitted and the
Association has approved: (a) annual work programs for the first year for each
component; (b) a list of eligible institutes, training programs, criteria of
eligibility and maximum cost per participant, as well as operating procedures for
the redeployment fund. (iii) Economic Management Assistance. Under the PSAC, the
Government comnitted itself to: (a) a three-year reform program for the public
enterprise sector; (b) the creation of an ad hoc committee to manage the
divestiture and liquidation programs; and (c) action plans to reform the budgetary
process and implement a three-year rolling public investment program. Under ENSAP,
agreement was reached on technical assistance support to Implement these reforms.
13.      Benefits.  The proposed ENSAP would facilitate implementation of the
Government's adjustment program by addressing the most pressing social problems and
strengthening the administration's capacity to ranage the economy. The expected
short-term benefits include increased sustainability of the Government's adjustment
policies until growth achieves momentum by: (i) better meeting the basic needs of
the targeted population in terms of health and nutrition status and employment
opportunities; and (ii) facilitating the redeployment of workers made redundant in
public enterprises, while speeding labor market adjustment. Over the medium term,
the proposed project would lay the basis fors (i) developing targeting mechanisms
that could be used in the design and implementation of policies that properly
consider both economic and social factors; (ii) redefining the respective roles of
the Government and other agents (such as NGOs) in the delivery of social services;
(III) improving the delivery;pf family planning services; and (iv) strengthening
the Government's capacity for macroeconomic management.
14.      Risks.  The complexity of the program is the main risk, given the limited
institutional capacity of the Malagasy administ-ation. Another risk relates to the
accuracy of the targeting mechanisms used in designing the program. A third risk
is whether the Government will be able to ensure that program assistance is limited
to the intended beneficiaries. The first risk is reduced by the project's design,
which, besides flexibility, entails independent components that will be implemented
by the agencies that actively participated in their design and preparation.
Necessary technical assistance has been agreed to and will be financed under the
project. The second risk is minimized by the diversification of the intervention
port folio and by built-in provisions to Improve targeting mechanisms. The third
risk is addressed by periodic reviews of the project's activities and reporting and
auditing arrangements.
15.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
