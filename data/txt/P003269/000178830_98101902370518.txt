INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSED TRANSPORT REHABILITATION IMPORTS PROGRAM LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan for the equivalent of US$42
million which would have a term of 20 years including 5 years grace, with
interest at  9.6  percent per annum, to the Republic of Zimbabwe.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The first economic mission, since Zimbabwe attained independence,
visited the country in September 1980, and its report is scheduled to be
distributed shortly. 2/ The information in this report was gathered by this
mission and two subsequent missions which visited Zimbabwe in October and
November to appraise the proposed Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program
Loan and Credit.
3.        Zimbabwe is a landlocked country of about 390,000 square kilometers,
which borders Mozambique on the east, Botswana on the southwest, Zambia on the
northwest and South Africa on the south. Topographically, the territory rises
from low plains (low veld) in the northwest and southeast to the middle veld
(600-1,200 meters) and further to a high plateau (high veld, 1,200-1,500
meters), which runs from the southwest to the northeast. The high veld is a
temperate climate with a reasonably high level of rainfall, while the middle
veld regions are warmer and drier and the low veld areas are arid to sub-arid.
Population estimates for Zimbabwe for end-December 1979 indicate that there
are about 7.3 million people, 97 percent of whom are Africans. 3/ The remaining
or "non-African" people consist of about 220,000 Europeans, 10,000 Asians and
23,000 people of mixed origin. The growth rate of the African population is
estimated to be 3.6 percent per year while the number of non-Africans is now
declining due to emigration. It is estimated, on the basis of pre-war data,
that 20 percent of the population is urban.
4.        The economic structure is well diversified.  Agriculture, manufac-
turing and mining are the important, directly productive sectors of the
economy. Agriculture accounts for about 12-15 percent of GDP and provides
formal employment for 334,000 persons (34 percent of all the formal employ-
ment) and income opportunities for another estimated 1.4 million who depend
mainly on subsistence or smallholder agriculture. Until recently, agricultural
1/   Reprinted verbatim from President's Report No. P-2931-ZIM.
2/   The economic data in this report and Annex V is drawn from the draft
version of the economic report and is not therefore entirely consistent
with figures in Annex I, for social indicators which were prepared in
October 1980.
3/   The Government of Zimbabwe's nomenclature.



- 2 -
exports provided about 39 percent of total foreign exchange earnings.  Major
products are flue-cured tobacco, cotton, maize, sugar, wheat, coffee and
livestock.
5.        Zimbabwe's mineral resources include gold, asbestos, nickel,
copper, coal, chrome ore, tin, iron ore, silver and cobalt. Besides contribut-
ing 7.5 percent of the country's GDP and providing almost 6 percent of total
formal employment, mining also is central to Zimbabwe's foreign trade. In
1979, for example, mining exports--mainly gold, asbestos, copper, nickel,
and ferrochrome--contributed about 40 percent of the total foreign exchange
earnings.
6.        The mining and agricultural sectors supply the bulk of the inputs
for the manufacturing sector, which in 1979 was 25 percent of GDP, employed
145,000 of the 989,000 workers in formal employment, and accounted for 21
percent of Zimbabwe's merchandise exports.
7.        In 1979, per capita income was about Z$357 (US$470, using the World
Bank Atlas methodology). Distribution of income and assets between Africans
and non-Africans, however, was highly skewed. The Land Tenure Act of 1969
divided the country's total land area roughly into two equal parts for European
and African settlement. About 8 percent of the area designated for African
settlement was set aside to be available for purchase (African Purchase
Areas), while the rest was designated as Tribal Trust Lands (TTL) to be held
under communal ownership and used mainly for subsistence farming. This
distribution of land implies that there are at present 2.5 hectares of land
per African person as compared with 65.2 hectares of land per non-African.
Similar disparities exist in the distribution of other productive assets.
Rough estimates suggest that the per capita income for the African population
in 1979 was about Z$110 (US$175) compared with roughly Z$5,500 (US$9,000) for
non-Africans.
8.        In 1965, the international community imposed economic sanctions on
Rhodesia with the aim of forcing the Government to abandon its Unilateral
Declaration of Independence (UDI). The subsequent war between the white-
dominated regime and African nationalists, who joined together as, the Patri-
otic Front, intensified from 1973, but neither the sanctions nor the war
appeared to have seriously affected the economy until 1975. In fact, real GDP
grew at about 7 percent and per capita income about 3.5 percent a year, until
1974, with manufacturing, agricultural and mineral output all registering
impressive gains.
9.        The sanctions were only partially effective, however.  In addition,
they stimulated the development of local capacity to manufacture substitute
goods for imports so that by 1979 consumers goods were only about 10 percent
of total imports, compared with 22 percent in 1964. They also encouraged
diversification of commercial agriculture. Virginia Tobacco, for example,
accounted for more than 56 percent of total agricultural output in 1964/65,
but by 1979/80 had dropped to only 25 percent. Livestock production over the



- 3 -
same period increased from 22 to 30 percent of total output, and cotton, soya
beans, wheat and coffee emerged as major crops. Overall, the value of agri-
cultural output rose from Z$123 million in 1966 to Z$305 million in 1979.
During the same time, mining grew rapidly under the impetus of expanding
exports (more than 90 percent of mining output is exported) and continuing
reinvestments by firms, plus some new investments from abroad. By 1979, the
value of mining output had risen nearly 400 percent since sanctions were
imposed in 1965.
10.       The economic situation changed considerably from 1975 on.  Sanctions,
the war and its petroleum requirements, oil price increases and two droughts
caused considerable disruption and resulted in a decline in economic activity
between 1975 and 1979. As a result, per capita income in real terms fell by
35 percent between 1975 and 1979 returning to its 1965 level. Although the
value of exports rose somewhat during the period, the increasing cost of
imports, in particular oil, caused the volume of imports, especially non-oil
intermediate inputs, to fall precipitously. Real investment also fell from
Z$392 million in 1974 to Z$140 million in 1978.
11.       The war and two droughts in 1978 and 1979 caused declines in agri-
cultural output, mainly of maize, so that Zimbabwe, which had been exporting
an average of about 500,000 tons of maize a year, became a net importer in
1979. The manufacturing sector also declined. Formal employment fell by
about 65,000 affecting virtually every sector except public administration,
which increased by over 20,000 persons.
12.       In the sixties and early seventies, the Government's budget was
approximately in balance. However, beginning in 1974/75, deficits each year
increased until the 1979/80 deficit amounted to 35 percent of total government
expenditures and 14 percent of GDP. Government expenditures during the same
period rose 20 percent per annum and in 1979/80 was 37 percent of GDP, com-
pared with 18 percent in 1971/72. The composition of government expenditure
also shifted. The share of expenditure for administration and defense consti--
tuted 46 percent of the total in 1979/80, while the portion directed to
economic services, notably agriculture, commerce and industry declined. While
extensive controls kept price increases relatively low--5 percent annually
during 1970-75--the annual rise from 1975 to 1979 was about 11.5 percent.
13.       Externally, the economy maintained a reasonable balance on current
account--as imports grew less rapidly than exports--until 1975, when there
was a deficit of Z$116 million, financed in large part by private borrowing
abroad. With tightened exchange controls in 1975, imports in the following
three years dropped below 1974 levels and the balance on current account was
restored. A Z$61 million deficit in 1979, due in part to a sharp increase in
imports, as well as a net outflow of private capital was covered by Government
borrowing from South Africa.
14.       With the end of the war and attainment of independence, the economy
began to grow. This was mainly due to an almost 40 percent increase in
imports, which facilitated a slight increase in capacity utilization. The



- 4 -
rise in imports has been financed from expanded foreign exchange earnings
from mineral exports (the price of gold increased appreciably). It has also
been financed from additional foreign exchange earnings resulting from the
removal of sanctions, which had obliged Rhodesia to pay a premium for imports
and accept discounted prices for its exports. Furthermore, with the end of
the war, the people are now able to concentrate on economic pursuits. Finally,
growth in the agricultural sector has been facilitated by favorable weather.
Consequently, a 6-8 percent real growth is expected in 1980.
15.       The new Government's first budget presentation to Parliament stresses
pragmatic policies and programs aimed at a rapid rehabilitation of the economy,
greater employment opportunities, and redistribution with growth. Relative
increases are registered in government expenditures on health, education,
smallholder agriculture and capital investments by the Government. The
capital budget increased from Z$85 million in 1979/80, to Z$142 million in
1980/81, and the recurrent budget from Z$972 million to Z$1,145 million.
Expenditures for internal security and defense are expected to continue to be
sizeable and to make larger demands on resources than previously anticipated.
Overall, the budget projects a deficit of about Z$575 million.
16.       Economic prospects for the next two to three years are generally
good provided the Government is able to control potentially divisive political
and military forces. The economic rehabilitation will require substantial
amounts of external assistance in addition to the domestic savings which can
reasonably be expected to be mobilized. The Government has established a
reconstruction fund, separate from the central government budget, which is
expected to attract about US$350 million of foreign grants and loans on
concessionary terms over the next three years. This would assist in covering
the cost of reconstruction of damaged schools, hospitals, local roads and
rural infrastructure. The mining sector can be counted on to continue to
attract private foreign investment for its growth and to earn increasing
amounts of foreign exchange for several years to come. Significant efforts to
restructure the agricultural sector and increase output are expected
particularly through government encouragement of smallholder production and
giving incentives, initially to maintain and later to increase agricultural
output from the commercial farmers.
17.       However, Zimbabwe faces a formidable array of problems calling for
both immediate and long-term solutions. The immediate problems relate to
rehabilitation and reconstruction. The Government must mobilize substantial
amounts of resources over a very limited period in order to remove critical
bottlenecks on the economy created by the war and the sanctions. The annual
cost to the railway and power investments should about equal total gross fixed
investment in 1979. Therefore, if these and other large capital requirements
are to be met, external assistance of the order of US$400 million a year for
the next few years will be required.
18.       Unemployment is another critical problem which must be addressed
quickly. The Government is attempting to deal with this problem through
settlement and resettlement programs and through improving capacity utiliza-
tion. Relative to other African countries, Zimbabwe has a reservoir of



-5-
skilled labor. However, in relation to the Zimbabwean economic structure
and degree of sophistication, the country is short of trained manpower; a
problem which has been aggravated by migration following independence.
Retention of existing skilled workers is an important reason for the Govern-
ments moderate and reconciliatory attitude after independence. In addition,
serious efforts are being made to attract some 25,000 educated and skilled
Zimbabweans back to the country.
19.       The most complex problem is going to be restructuring of the economy
in a manner which will ensure equitable distribution of income and assets
without jeopardizing growth. This implies integrating the African majority
into Zimbabwe½ economic mainstream. Plans are underway for land reform,
developing of smallholder agriculture, and establishing small-scale industries
to bring about the gradual redistribution of assets and integration of the
African population. Zimbabwe½ longer-run political and economic stability
will depend on how fast the Government makes progress in this area.
20.       Zimbabwe emerged from 15 years of sanctions and the war with rela-
tively low external indebtedness. In mid-1980, foreign debt totalled Z$451
million, and the country½ gross international reserves equalled about Z$215
million of three months of estimated 1980 imports of goods. The external
debt figure was the equivalent of US$98 per capita or about 15 percent of
estimated GDP. The debt service ratio, which is expected to be 4 percent in
1980, and is projected to rise to 9 percent in 1981 and 8 percent in 1982.
These external indebtedness figures do not include foreign exchange obliga-
tions resulting from restrictions on the repatriation of certain monies by
private individuals and companies. Although the exact amount of these is not
known, they are not large enough to affect the overall picture significantly.
Consequently, given the low estimated debt service ratios and the country½
potential for growth and expansion, Zimbabwe clearly is creditworthy for Bank
lending. However, given Zimbabwe½ massive external resource requirements for
reconstruction and rehabilitation, expected high interest rates and relatively
hard repayment terms, the future debt service ratio seems certain to rise.
Because of these large resource requirements, Zimbabwe needs to receive at
least part of the external assistance required on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
21.       Before 1965, the Bank made five loans totalling US$140.3 million,
benefitting Rhodesia--two directly to the Government for agriculture (US$5.6
million) and power (US$28.0 million), two loans totalling US$87.7 million to
the Central African Power Coporation (CAPCO), and a US$19 million loan to the
Rhodesia railways. As a guarantor of each of the loan, the UK serviced them
after 1964. The loans for agriculture and railways have been repaid, and CAPCO
resumed servicing its two loans, on which US$13.8 million was still outstanding
as of June 30, 1980, following the lifting of sanctions of December 21, 1979.
Recently, the Bank and the Association approved a loan of US$50 million and a
credit of US$15 million for the Manufacturing Sector Rehabilitation Imports



- 6 -
Program. The loan and the credit are expected to finance priority import
requirements of raw materials, spare parts, components and balancing equipment
needed to utilize existing idle capacity in the manufacturing sector.
22.       IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe was approved by its Board last
month. The investment is in the form of a US$38 million loan of which US$20
million is for IFC's own account, and US$18 million comprises commercial bank
participations in the IFC loan. IFC was also responsible for arranging a
further US$10.3 million of commercial bank financing related to a proposed
loan by the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Eximbank).  The invest-
ment, in the Wankie Colliery Company Limited, is to help finance a project to
produce coal mainly for a thermal power station presently under construction,
but also for other uses.
23.       Following Zimbabwe's becoming a member of the Bank Group in September
1980, an initial program was discussed with the Government consisting of the
Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program and the proposed imports program
to rehabilitate the transport sector. Work on identifying and preparing
projects in agriculture, rural development, power, transport, manpower develop-
ment and training, and industrial intermediation now is underway or shortly
will be initiated.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
24.       Zimbabwe possesses, on the whole, a well-developed basic transport
system. The railway which is administered by a state-owned corporation--the
National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ)--is the primary mode of transport. The
system consists of 3,374 km of track of which 640 km are in Botswana, but owned
and operated by NRZ. Of Zimbabwe's 85,240 km road network, about 14 percent is
paved and another 54 percent is gravelled. The remaining 32 percent consists
of earth tracks. Air Zimbabwe, which over the past five years has carried more
than one million passengers yearly, is embarking on a modernization program.
There are eight airports in the country of which three, Salisbury, Bulawayo and
Victoria Falls are international.
Regional Importance
25.       Zimbabwe's transport network is of vital importance to the entire
southern African region. The country sits astride key railway and road routes
which offer landlocked Zambia, Botswana and Zaire access to the sea. The
National Railway of Zimbabwe links up with the South African Railway system
directly and through Botswana, with the Zambian Railways (which, in turn, con-
nects to the Tanzania-Zambia line to Dar-es-Salaam) and the Mozambican Railway
lines to both Maputo and Beira. There are similar international road links.



26.       Illustrative of Zimbabwe's pivotal position, prior to Rhodesia's uni-
lateral declaration of independence in 1965 practically all of Zambia's external
trade went by rail through Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia). Even in 1972, just before
the border between the two countries was closed, almost two-thirds of Zambia's
external trade still passed through Zimbabwe. Mozambique formerly earned a
significant part of its foreign exchange from transit traffic, most of which
came through Zimbabwe. Although the Tanzania-Zambia (Tazara) Railway to Dar-es-
Salaam and the Benguela line through Zaire to the Angolan port of Lobito now
affords alternatives, the routes through Zimbabwe will continue to be of major
importance. However, the region would greatly benefit by coordinating action on:
(i) traffic related questions (tariff levels, tariff quotas, customs procedures,
etc.); (ii) specifications for equipment; (iii) sharing maintenance facilities;
(iv) machinery for ensuring speedy return of railway wagons crossing international
boundaries; and (v) improvement in regional communications which is of paramount
importance to regional transport movements.
Impact of the War
27.       The country emerged from the war with most of its transport infrastruc-
ture intact, although the Salisbury-Maputo railway line suffered extensive damage,
as did many rural roads. However, in the course of the conflict, the Government
was forced increasingly to divert resources away from the economy in pursuit of
the war. Dwindling allocations of foreign exchange starved the transport system
of needed spare parts, plant and equipment so that maintenance often was inadequate
and replacement of overaged equipment was deferred. As a result, the transport
system--especially the railway--suffered serious deterioration.
28.       Shortages of spare parts, coupled with overaged workshops and equipment
--and a growing scarcity of skilled personnel--have, for example reduced the
availability of locomotives to an average of about 60 percent for diesel and
50 percent for steam. Similarly, maintenance of the road network is seriously
hampered by the overaged equipment and vehicle fleet available for the task.  Thus,
although Zimbabwe's transport system suffered relatively little direct damage,
shortcomings resulting from forced neglect during the war seriously undermine its
ability to meet the demands now being placed on it. A detailed analysis of the
individual subsectors is given below.
Railways
29.       Of the Railways' 3,374 km of track, the mainline portions, except for
sections close to Mozambique and the 640 km stretch in Botswana, generally are
in good condition, although little capital work was undertaken and track mainten-
ance was severely curtailed during the war.  Branch lines need upgrading, and
the outmoded signalling systems currently in use will have to be replaced. NRZ
plans to change these systems in conjunction with its electrification program,
which is phased over a number of years. The first stage, 335 km of track between
Dabuka and Salisbury, is getting underway and is expected to be completed by



- 8 -
1983. The Railways plans to spend Z$15.3 million (US$24.3 million in FY81)
and Z$62.2 million (US$98.9 million) and Z$38.8 million (US$61.7 million) in
the succeeding two years for electrification (Annex IV).
30.       NRZ has 261 diesel electric locomotives, 14 diesel hydraulic and
159 steam, although, as noted earlier, availability is low. Given Zimbabwe's
ample coal supplies, and the comparatively simple maintenance requirements,
steam locomotives will be kept in service for the next 10 to 15 years primarily
on the northern section (centered on the Wankie Colliery). By that time NRZ
expects to be able to progressively replace the steamers with diesel locomotives
from sections which will have been electrified. For hauling freight,NRZ has
13,480 wagons, of which about 10,800 reportedly are available for service.
During the war, 2,780 wagons were impounded in Mozambique; only a few so far
have been returned, mostly in inoperable condition. Although the average
availability has been as high as 95 percent, many of the wagons are in poor
condition. Most of NRZ' 475 passenger coaches also are overaged.
31.       One central maintenance workshop in Bulawayo maintains all equipment,
while a smaller workshop in Umtali repairs wagons and diesel locomotives, and
five other repair steam locomotives. Although the workshop (built in the early
1900s) and the machinery (25 to 30 years old) are in good condition, most of
the latter will be replaced during 1983-85. The quality of maintenance is high,
but capacity is seriously limited by the shortages of skilled labor and spare
parts.
32.       Most of the Railways' traffic is local (8.0 million out of a total of
13.3 million tons), made up mainly of coal, iron ore, fertilizer and agricultural
products. Exports and imports, in FY80, accounted for about one-third of total
freight. Coal, steel, maize and sugar were the main export commodities carried.
Transit traffic, critically important to Zaire and Zambia, totalled about one
million tons in FY80, a large part of which were copper concentrates. NRZ is
projecting its freight traffic to rise more than 50 percent (to 19 million tons)
by 1984/85.
33.       Although by most standards, NRZ can be classified as well-managed and
efficient, it has incurred a financial deficit in its operations each year since
1970, retroactively funded by government grants. The deficit, which totalled
Z$32.2 million (US$51.2 million) in FY80, has risen steadily from Z$1.7 million
(US$2.7 million) in 1971, primarily the result of sub-economic tariffs dictated
by the Government, especially for hauling coal, coke and agricultural commodities.
However, any subsidies for rail transport should be clearly identified and
segregated from NRZ' operations, rather than handled by the Government's funding
of the Railway's overall deficits retroactively each year.
34.       Both the Government and NRZ fully appreciate the problem, in fact.
the Railways Act stipulates that NRZ is expected to operate on a commercial basis.
Subsidies for rail transport, however, are only part of a web of subsidies which



- 9 -
touch most of the economy directly or indirectly. The incidence of the various
subsidies, their inter-relationships and the impact on the economy, and on
individuals within it, of reducing or eliminating them needs to be examined
carefully before appropriate measures can be taken. As a starting point in
this process the Government has agreed to undertake and complete by June 30, 1982,
a study of the railways' tariff and costing structure, in accordance with terms
of reference agreed between the Government and the Bank. The Bank will be given
a report on the conclusions and recommendations arrived at as a result of the
study, and be given reasonable opportunity to exchange views with the Government
before recommendations in the report are adopted (Section 4.04(a) of the draft
Loan Agreement). The results of that study will form part of the continuing
dialogue between the Bank and the Government in connection with future operations.
35.       Meanwhile, the Government has increased several railway tariffs by 22 per-
cent on average, effective May 1, 1981, and is expected to consider further adjust-
ments. The Government and NRZ have given the Bank assurances that the latter would
endeavor to achieve a working ratio of 110 in 1982/83 and 100 in 1984/85.
Roads
36.       Responsibility for constructing and maintaining the 16,490 km of
Zimbabwe's most important roads (state roads) and 4,000 km of contiguous district
roads rests with the Ministry of Roads and Road Traffic (MRRT). Rural councils
and the district administrations look after the remaining (about 65,000 km) roads.
The road network is adequate. However, there is urgent need for strengthening
and upgrading, and rehabilitating some of the roads which were affected by the
war.
37.       The MRRT has prepared a five-year road development program estimated
to cost about US$340 million (in 1980 prices). The Bank's future lending operations
are expected to support this program. Budgetary allocations for recurrent ex-
penditures for state roads are adequate, and rural councils are given sufficient
grants from the Central Government to supplement revenue from local taxation of
vehicles.
38.       Road traffic regulations govern vehicle weights and provide adequate
legislation to protect the road system. They are strictly enforced with weigh-
bridges located in vehicle inspection centers in all major towns supplemented by
loadometers at strategic points on the road network.
39.       The Central Mechanical Equipment Department (CMED), a department of
the Ministry of Transport (MT), is responsible for procuring, hiring maintainirng,
repairing and replacing of all government equipment and vehicles. The CMED
operates on a commercial basis, but many units of its equipment and vehicle
fleets have passed their economic lives and urgently need replacement.
40.       Although there is a shortage of staff in the MRRT and CMED at all
levels, the standard of construction and maintenance of the road network is high.



- 10 -
Good training institutions are available, but lack sufficien inc-ructors and
need to be expanded in order to meet the increasing demand for technicians and
skilled staff. The Bank is expected to assist by financing technical assist-
ance and training under future highway projects.
Constraints
41.       In addition to restoration and maintenance of the infrastructure (roads,
rail track and equipment) neglected during the war, the main transport sector
problems facing Zimbabwe are the following: (i) shortage of skilled transport
sector personnel; (ii) the increasing cost of fuel; and (iii) the poor condition
of the Mozambique railway which is Zimbabwe's shortest route to the sea.
42.       The Government is trying to address these issues in various ways.  First,
it is seeking financial assistance for the short-term rehabilitation and conver-
sion of trucking and railway motive power and rolling stock and roads/track,
from bilateral and multilateral sources including the Bank. Secondly, with its
own resources it is making limited purchases of new equipment. Thirdly, a wide
ranging manpower study is being prepared under UNDP auspices, which will include
transport sector requirements. Fourthly, a railway electrification project, based
upon indigenous hydro- and coal-fired electricity supplies is being pursued. The
first stage contracts are now let and a feasibility study for the second stage
will shortly be undertaken. Fifthly, the Government is re-examining its institu-
tional framework in order to improve transport coordination. Finally, Zimbabwe
is giving every encouragement to Mozambique in its search for financial resources
to improve its domestic transport infrastructure.
43.       The most immediate need is for additional foreign exchange with which
to import spare parts for locomotives and wagons for the railway, and equipment
for CMED. The proposed lending operation (Part IV), is designed to address this
problem.  Equally serious is the problem of shortage of qualified staff.  The
authorities are seeking to alleviate the manpower problem by encouraging skilled
and experienced manpower now in retirement to come back to service for limited
periods, and by recruiting technical assistance for specific tasks. Consequently,
the manpower needed for installation of the parts and equipment to be financed
under the proposed loan have been identified and will be paid for as technical
assistance from the proceeds of the loan. However, NRZ recognizes that the
longer-term solution depends upon development of its own manpower and training
programs. The problem will be addressed by the proposed loan. Overall, the
thrust of the Government's policy in dealing with transport issues is sound. It
has been and will continue to be discussed with the Bank in the course of project
preparation and supervision.

PART IV - THE TRANSPORT REHABILITATION IMPORTS PROGRAM LOAN
44.       During the economic review mission which visited Zimbabwe in
September 1980, the Government requested that the Bank provide quick-disbursing
assistance in order to remove bottlenecks and rehabilitate the transport sector
so as to maintain its operations at a reasonable degree of efficiency. The re-
quest was further discussed with a subsequent Bank mission in October 1980 and
appraisal and post-appraisal missions in November 1980 and in January 1981,
respectively. Negotiations were held in Washington on April 6-10, 1981, and
Zimbabwe's delegation was led by Mr. J. Gurney, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury,
Objectives and Description of the Loan
45.       The basic objectives of the proposed loan are to restore and maintain
Zimbabwe's transport system, in order for it to meet the transport needs of the
postwar rehabilitation and reconstruction of the economy. The transport systen
was severely affected by the war damage and scarcity of foreign exchange during
the seven years war. Given the country's landlocked position, rehabilitation of
the transport sector is a prerequisite to a quick rehabilitation of the economy
as a whole, and a vital necessity in promoting future economic development. These
objectives are consistent with the Government's strategy and priorities in the
sector as indicated in the investment and rehabilitation programs below.
46.       Following the end of the war, the country is now faced with numerous
and pressing demands to resettle and rehabilitate large numbers, of displaced
persons and exfreedom fighters, rebuild damaged schools, clinics, water supplies
in the rural areas and to restore and expand infrastructure, such as power, which
also has been neglected. Thus, the foreign exchange resources available for the
transport sector fall far short of the levels required.
47.       NRZ has prepared a three-year (1980/81-1982/83) investment plan amount-
ing to about Z$185.4 million (US$294.8 million), of which Z$52.6 million (US$83.6
million) is foreign exchange (Annex IV). It has also prepared a priority re-
habilitation import program estimated to cost in foreign exchange Z$23.9 million
(US$38 million). CMED has also identified urgently needed rehabilitation and main-
tenance equipment and spare parts, estimated to cost in foreign exchange Z$2.3
million (US$3.7 million). Both the appraisal and post-appraisal missions re-
veiwed the investment plan and the rehabilitation imports program and concluded
that they were systematically prepared, well designed and justified. The Bank
obtained assurances that NRZ' three-year investment program and NRZ' and CMED's
rehabilitation import program will not be substantially changed without allowing
the Bank a reasonable opportunity to comment on proposed changes. Furthermore,
the Bank obtained assurances also that in the event financial resources are not
adequate to finance in full the investment plan and the rehabilitation program,
priority will be given the rehabilitation and maintenance requirements (Section
4.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).



- 12 -
48.       The loan is designed to assist implementation of the priority rehabili-
tation import program. The three-year investment plan is expected to be assisted
through normal project lending. Requirements of the trucking subsector are ex-
pected to be met from other sources. Specifically, the loan would finance the
immediately needed imports of (i) diesel locomotive spare parts and components;
(ii) wagon spare parts; (iii) general spare parts; (iv) machine tools; (v) track
tools and equipment; (vi) signalling equipment; and (vii) electricial spares, all
for NRZ; (viii) equipment; and (ix) vehicles fleet for CMED, for road construction
and maintenance. In order to strengthen NRZ and enable it to execute the re-
habilitation program expeditiously, the loan would also finance technical assist-
ance needed to install the parts and equipment to be imported under the loan for
NRZ, as follows: (a) 4 man years of assistant mechanical engineers; (b) 152 man
years of artisans; (c) 40 man years of fitters; (d) 20 man years of electricians;
(e) 24 man years of welders; and (f) 28 man years of other technical cadres.
49.       The rehabilitation program and the loan would increase locomotive
availability, and thus handling capacity, from 55 percent to 75 percent, and
would increase the wagon fleet by 2,800 wagons, by restoring locomotives and wagons
which presently are idle. It would also greatly improve the condition of the track
and signalling facilities. As a result, NRZ' overall capability and efficiency
would sufficiently improve for it to meet the demands placed upon it for the next
few years. The loan would also restore Government's capability for road mainten-
ance, and would enable it to undertake reconstruction work in the areas affected
by the war. The impact of the loan would be immediate, since the entire loan is
expected to be disbursed within two years after affectiveness.
Institutional Capabilities
50.       Despite shortages of skilled manpower, NRZ is managerially and techni-
cally a sound organization which has demonstrated its ability to carry a high
volume of traffic in difficult circumstances. Given the proposed technical assist-
ance to install parts and equipment to be financed, it should have no difficulty
in implementing its part of the program in a timely and efficient fashion. Never-
theless, in order to meet the manpower needs of NRZ, the Bank obtained assurances
that the borrower will by March 31, 1982, undertake and complete a study of NRZ'
manpower needs on terms of reference agreed between the Bank and the borrower, and
will prepare a training program (Section 4.04(B) of the draft Loan Agreement).
The CMED is also a soundly administered department, which has enabled the Govern-
ment to maintain an extensive and comparatively sophisticated road network in good
condition. It has the capacity to purchase and maintain the equipment to be
financed, and is therefore expected to implement its loan component without
difficulty.
Import Program Cost and Financing
51.       The total cost of the items and services is estimated at Z$31.1 million
(US$49.5 million equivalent) of which Z$26.2 million (US$42.0 million) is in



- 13 -
foreign exchange. Local costs would amount to Z$4.7 million (US$7.5 million).
The Bank loan of US$42.0 million would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange
requirements. The Government is expected to finance the local costs.
Procurement and Disbursement
52.       Equipment and material for NRZ financed by the Bank will be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines,
except: small orders under US$20,000 each, but not more than US$1,000,000 in total;
spare parts which will be retroactively financed; and spare parts which are only
available from the original manufacturers or from authorized reliable manufacturers.
In these cases, procurement would be on the basis of international or local shopp-
ing. Contracts under ICB would be subject to ex post review, that is, a brief
report containing evidence that it was let in accordance with Bank guidelines,
would be provided prior to or with submission of withdrawal requests.
53.       Procurement of the equipment, vehicles and spare parts for the CMED will
also be under international competitive bidding procedures in accordance with
Bank guidelines, except for small orders under US$20,000 each up to a total of
US$250,000 which may be on the basis of international or local shopping. Bank
funds would be disbursed for 100 percent of foreign expenditures. Withdrawal
applications would be submitted with full documentation, including copies of
invoices, bills of lading and import licenses.
54.       Some of the urgently needed spare parts worth about US$4.0 million, have
already been ordered, but not paid for due to lack of foreign exchange; hence,
cannot be shipped. Consequently, retroactive financing of not more than US$4.0
million equivalent to the value of this category of eligible imports is recommended,
provided the goods were procured in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Accounts Audit and Evaluation
55.       NRZ and CMED would maintain separate accounts for the program which
would be audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and certified copies of the
relevant financial statements would be submitted to the Bank within four months
of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1983. NRZ and CMED will maintain records ade-
quate to monitor program implementation. Furthermore, not later than six months
after completion of the program, the Government would prepare and furnish to the
Bank a completion report on the costs and benefits resulting from the program.
Benefits and Risks
56.       The principal benefits anticipated from the proposed loan, are that it
would permit the importation of urgently needed spare parts, tools and equipment
and their timely deployment for the rehabilitation of the very vital transport



- 14 -
sector of landlocked Zimbabwe. Without rehabilitation of the transport sector
it would be difficult to rehabilitate the rest of the economy expeditiously. The
loan would increase NRZ' capacity and improve its efficiency, and would avoid
further deterioration in the railways' carrying capacity--indeed, increase it to
a level required for the expected traffic for the next few years. It would also
improve the reliability of train control. It would restore the Government's
capability for carrying out routine maintenance of the country's road network
and for undertaking reconstruction work in the war affected areas. Furthermore,
the assistance would provide a venue for a dialogue on important policy areas
relating to tariffs and subsidies.
57.       There are no particular risks to the proposed transport rehabilitation
program per se. Overall, lasting stability in Zimbabwe, however, will depend on
how quickly the economy can respond to present demands for economic well being
for all. This in turn, will depend largely on how quickly the economy can be
rehabilitated and expanded--two key areas in which rehabilitation of the transport
sector is a prerequisite.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Zimbabwe and the Bank,
the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of the Agreement of the Bank are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
59.       Special conditions of the program are listed in Section III of Annex III.
60.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
61.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

/a   There is no generally agreed upon way of classifying trade data according
to the categories agriculture, mining and manufacturing. As a result,
the composition of exports or imports can differ depending on the classi-
fication used. For instance, if the Government s own trade classification
is used, the composition of exports for 1979 would be agriculture, 19 per-
cent; mining, 34 percent; and manufacturing, 47 percent. On the other
hand, if manufactured goods are defined in terms of SITC codes 5, 6 (less
non-ferrous metals and ferrochrome), 7, and 8, and agricultural produce is
defined in terms of SITC codes 0 and 1, a portion of 2 and 4, then the
composition of exports for 1979 would be agriculture, 39 percent;
mining, 40 percent; and manufacturing, 21 percent.
/b   Defined as edible food and fats plus non-edible agricultural output
such as tobacco, cotton, forestry products, etc.
Ic   Defined as crude materials and minerals, gold and processed mining
materials--mainly unfabricated metals. Much of this might, by another
classification, be considered manufacturing output.
