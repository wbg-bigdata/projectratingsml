INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO FOR A LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Reoublic of the Congo for the equivalent
of US$5.6 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a livestock project.
US$3.6 million of the credit would be relent to the Office du Ranch de la
Dihesse (ORD) for 25 years including 10 years grace with interest at 6 per-
cent per annum. US$2.0 million would be the Government's equity contribution
to ORD.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of the People's Republic of the
Congo - Recent Developments and Prospects" was distributed to the Executive
Directors on December 3, 1971, under No. R71/261. A Bank updating mission
visited the country in January/February 1973; its report will be completed
later this year. Country economic data will be found in Annex I.
3.        Congo's economic growth potential is based mainly on its location
on the Congo River between the landlocked interior of the continent and the
Atlantic Ocean from which the country derives its regional transportation
function. It possesses, moreover, extensive forest reserves and some mineral
resources. Offshore oil reserves were discovered in 1969, and with continu-
ing exploration the Congo hopes to produce about 5 million tons per year of
crude oil by the mid-seventies. Agricultural development faces more limited
possibilities except in the south-western part of the country in which the
project is located. Enterprising groups in the population and relatively
high literacy are further assets for development.
4.        GDP growth in real terms was estimated at 4 percent between 1967
and 1971. The important economic sectors are manufacturing, mining and con-
struction (23 percent of GDP), government (19 percent of GDP), and transpor-
tation (13 percent). The share of agriculture is relatively modest. However,
about 60 percent of the population in rural areas still depend on agriculture
and forestry for their income. Their per capita income is estimated at US$50,
a fraction of the national average per capita income of US$240,
5.        Congo's future growth is especially hampered by transportation
bottlenecks, an insufficient number of experienced local managers and the
lack of public savings. The Government's transport agency, ATC (Agence
Transcongolaise des Communications), has embarked on an investment program
designed to increase the capacity of the road-river-rail network linking
Chad, the Central African Republic and the Congolese hinterland with the
Atlantic ocean at Pointe Noire. The Government has also taken measures
with outside help to improve its management capability.



6.        The Govern-rmrett faces a difficult financial situation.  After years
of current budgetary su-i-plusns, the 'budget began to deteriorate in 1970.
Both the 1971 and 1972 ludge;.s resulted in sizeable current deficits,
although the 1972 deficit was lower thnan in 197t.  There are also consider-
able arrears in payments. rThe deterioration was caused mainly by increasecd
outlays on salaries coupled aith expanding subsidies to state enterprises.
These enterprises, largely set up in the late sixties, now operate below
canacity and at substartial  osses due mr.ainnly tc inadequate pro'l_ct prepara-
tion, weak management Em.d] a rapic.1. r-se in the nurber 3f employees without
corresponding gains in productivit-7.
7.        The need to curb this unfLavorable trend in public finance was re-
cognized in mid-1071 and pub.iOly p,ronounced during a Special Congress of the
Party in December 1972, w-L.Le the -ehabilitation of the State enterprises was
specified as the most irg'it aca-.on to be undertaken.
8.        Some relie-f fo  th  Budget can be expected from revenue on oil
production, but for the n.-xt few years projected receipts will rise only
gradually and will not be large enough to cover the arrears and simultaneously
maintain the present overalli expen6iture level. Prospects for other improve-
ments in revenue exist, but are probably rather limited in view of the fact
that the revenue effort o: the country is alreadv considerable at an estimated
21 percent of GDP. There-ore, a more stable budget weill require restraint
on current expenditures.  Scrie measures nave already been taken which aim at
bringing under control further increases in personnel outlays and supporting
state enter-prises with inlt:erest-bearing loans instead of grants. Further
measures w-ill be discussed in the ,forthcoming Economic Report.
9.        At this ti.me of severe bu&-etary constraints * the country is also
passing through a period or ,-edefiniticns of its volitical, social and economic
objectives.  No developmnent -plan has been formulated since the 1964-1968 P:an
expired, but several back-goLnd studies have been comp'leted.  Once a set o-
priorities and coherent po:Licies has been adopted, economic and social develop-
ment could probably se ac:elerated.   Tn the meantime, some urgent investments
which are clearly wi thia .he g:-enerali develop,ment goals of the country should
go ahead.
10.      .Ls in t-he  r,: 1- the bulk of investments will continue to be centered
on transport.  Tne servici-s tihis country rernders to the region justify con-
tinued strong emphasis ;n maintenance and improvement of water and rail
transport facilities,  Jh'iC"k are ty7? cally capital-intensive.  In t'his field,
the Governmaent has been., arLd i5s lik;ely to continue to be, successful in
attracting substantial foqreign aid* especially for the ATC system. However,
both the Governmenst and entervnal d&0nors feel that other sectors, especially
agriculture and livestock. ha-.ve beean neglected, and the proposed livestock
proiect is particularly i..3port-aw i.. this respect.
11.      Miore productive wnvstments would ultimately have an appreciable
effect on Congc's trade ba`anre which has recently shown persistent and
large deficits.  Thanks t^. congo?s regional transport role, earnings on ser-



- 3 -
vices account help to cover a portion of the trade deficits. Given the
favorable petroleum and timber export prospects, and assuming both that the
inflow of public external capital will continue at the current level and
that the high level of imports can be controlled, the balance of payments
should remain manageable for the next five years.
12.       Congo's creditworthiness is likely to be constrained by debt
service. Total external public and publicly guaranteed debt amounts to $171
million, of which 17 percent is owed to the Bank Group, principally on account
of the potash project, the Bank loan for which also enjoys the guarantees of
the Company's shareholders. In 1971, debt service on direct government borrow-
ings amounted to 5 percent of merchandise exports and net service receipts,
and 11 percent of government revenue.   Including Government guaranteed debt,
debt service is 8 percent of export earnings and 16 percent of revenue. The
recent economic mission estimates that Congo's total public debt service
could rise, over the next five years, to 15 percent of export earnings with
the disbursement of already contracted but as yet undisbursed loans - mainly
suppliers' credits.
13.       Given the country? s poverty and the current constraint on public
savings, external assistance to the Congo should so far as possible be on
concessionary terms, and as far as the Bank Group is concerned, only IDA
credits are contemplated for the foreseeable future. The limited savings
capability of the Congo at this time also requires that external financing
cover a high proportion of project cost, including, in appropriate cases,
part of local currency cost.
14.       The Congolese Government has undertaken a number of nationalizations
which were referred to in detail in the President's Report dated December 1,
1971 (No. R71-71). As indicated in the last President's Report dated March 1,
1972 (No. R72-27), the Government has made progress in settling several dis-
putes. Thus, it reached agreement with Compagnie Generale de Transports en
Afrique Equatoriale (CGTAE) in late 1971. The dispute with the shareholders
of Societe Industrielle et Agricole du Niari - Societe Sucriere du Niari
(SIAN-SOSUNIARI) is still pending and the Bank is following developments in
the case.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.       Apart from a US$185,000 grant for technical studies in the highway
sector in 1966, Bank/IDA lending consisted of seven operations amounting to
US$45.9 million as of July 31, 1973 (US$11.28 million undisbursed). Mining
accounted for 65 percent of this amount, and transport 27 percent. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of July 31,
1973, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
16.       The first lending-operation in the Congo after independence was a
loan in 1967 of US$30 million to the Compagnie des Potasses du Congo (CPC)



-4-
(480-COB) to help finance the exploitation of potash deposits. This loan
has been fully disbursed, and serious problems have been encountered in the
execution of the project. Since 1970, the company's management has signif-
cantly reduced costs and improved production which, together with sales, is
in tline with revised forecasts, but long term prospects remain uncertain.
17.       With the exception of the 1971 Education Plroject (Credit 237-COB;
US$3.5 million), Bank Group lending in the Congo has subsequently focused
on the tra-sp6rt sector. Fol'lowing preparatory stuclies financed under the
technical assistance grant mentioned above, the Road Engineering Project
(Credit S6-COB of 1969; US$0.63 million) provided for three studies: (i)
preparation of a detailed road maintenance program, (ii) detailed engineering
for the Sibiti-Zanaga road, and (iii) feasibility study and detailed engineer-
ing for the 40-km Pointe Noire-Bondi road. These project items were all
satisfactorily completed at less than the estimated cost, and US$40,000 of
the credit was cancelled.
18.       The Highway Improvement Project (Credit 189-COB of 1970; US$1.5
million) provides for improvement of the 34-kmn Pointe Noire-Makola road,
and for supervision of construction work. The project was completed on
schedule. The Government is in arrears with its local payments, but has
given assurances to the Bank that it is making every effort to meet pay-
ments due and has recently initiated settlement of these arrears.
19.       The Highway Miaintenance Project (Credit 274-COB of 1971; US$4 million)
provides for the refunding of the Road Engineering Credit S6-COB (US$600,000),
and for a four-year road maintenance program.    Consultants assisting the
Government in project execution have had some difficulties in mobilizing their
team, and this has caused a three-month delay in carrying out the initial
phase of the project.   The Bank has approved the bidding documents for equip-
ment.
20.       The Bank has been executing agency for a UNDP feasibility study of
the improvement of the mountainous Holle-Dolisie section (110 km) of the CFCO
railway, connecting the capital, Brazzaville, with the seaport of Pointe
Noire. This study was completed in January 1973. Railway Credit 297-COB of
1972 (US$6.3 million, subs<lieently increased by US$0.6 million in 1973),
provides financing for the frnal engineering of the realignment of this sec-
.ion, traffic costing stud:es, arid rolling stock to cope with short-term
capacity probleras.   n YMay/Juine 1973, a Bank mission reviewed the progress
made in preparing this realignmeat project, and discussed it with potential
donors.  The Bank's decision whether to appraise this project will depend
on the outcome of t.he engineering and other studies referred to above, wh.ich
are expected to be completed by the end of this year.
21.       in 4970-1972, the Congo received foreign offical grants and loans
for public investment financing from diversified sources. The European
Development Fund and the Frenc]h Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) were
the most important grant donors; disbursements on loans came mostly from the



-5-
People's Republic of China and also from France, the U.S.S.R. and East Germany.
The World Bank Group contribution was modest and consisted wholly of IDA
disbursements. In future, IDA disbursements may become relatively more
important and approach those of the European Community, France and China (ex-
cluding suppliers credits). The World Bank Group will continue to cooperate
actively with the European Community, and French Government aid agencies con-
cerning assistance to the Congo.
PART III - TiHE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
22.       For large parts of the country, agricultural development potential
is limited by soil and climatic conditions, low population density and de-
ficient infrastructure and commercial networks. The southwestern part is
better endowed in these respects, however, and has attracted most of the
crop and livestock production. The Niari Valley, where the proposed project
would be located, is one of the most promising agricultural regions.
23.       Unlike other countries in the region, agriculture, livestock and
fisheries play only a modest role in the Congolese economy, with 12 percent
of GDP in 1970. Forestry accounts for an additional 4 percent of GDP.
Cassava is the major staple and represents, together with other food crops,
about 80 percent of production value while commercial crops, especially
sugarcane, account for only 20 percent. Accordingly, except for sugar (and,
to a far smaller extent, coffee and cocoa) agriculture does not contribute
significantly to export earnings, which are dominated by forestry products.
Growth in production of food crops appears to fulfill subsistence needs
of the rural population. But urban demand, boosted by the large rural-urban
migration, is exceeding supply and exerts pressure on the price level of
foodstuffs; deficiencies in commercial and transportation networks are con-
tributing to the supply shortfall. Growth in production of cash crops has
been very uneven especially for sugar, output of which dropped dramatically
as a result of difficulties in the State enterprise, SIACONGO. Livestock
and fisheries are both little developed in the Congo.
24.       The Government plans to implement a number of policies designed to
revive the agricultural sector by developing food crop production, livestock,
fisheries, commercial crops for local processing, and expansion and diversi-
fication of export crops. They moreover indicate that about 10 percent of
total envisaged public investments will be spent in agriculture, fisheries,
livestock and forestry combined. The amount in question would mean a sub-
stantial improvement over actual investments in recent years, even after
allowance is made for slippage. Investment in beef production is given high
priority in these plans.
25.       Livestock production represents only about 10 percent of agricultural
production, or about 1 percent of GDP (1970 estimate); within this subsector,
one-tenth is derived from cattle raising, a recent activity for the Congo
which started only in the fifties. The existing cattle herd is small, estimated
at about 35,000 head, and almost exclusively raised for beef. About one-th4rd



- 6 -
is held in the traditional sector and tywo-thirds is held in the modern sector
which consists of twelve raniches.
26.       Congo has extensive land resources suitable for beef cattle
production, and the long-term objective should be to encourage and assist
small farmers to engage in this form of production. However, shortage of
suitable breeding cattle, lack of experierice in cattle -;aising and oc
trained extension officers preclude development of cattle raising by small
farmers -' the immediate future.  To overcome these obstacles, the Govern-
ment has decided to establish relatively large-scale, commercially managed
ranches which, on the basis of imported cattle, couLld, inter alia, produce
breeding stock well in excess of thei-r own replacement needs, theraDy pro-
viding a source of breeding cattle for the formation of new livestock enter-
prises.  Ranches such as these would simultaneously provide the training
ground for local personnel wiho in due course could provide technical assist-
ance to new individual cattlemen.   T!hus the format-on of state ranches is
an intermediate step in the developmenat of tne livestock resources of Congo.
This strategy is sound and should be supported. Accordingly, IDA's finan-
cial support to the Dihesse Ranch should also be viewed as a first step in
this direction.
27.       According to rough estimates, the average calory intake in the
Congo is less than 74 percent of daily requirements. With regard to protein
intake, the deficiency is more pronounced with less than 60 percent of
requirements covered.  This percentage strongly suggests the need for an
improved protein intake. In projecting nutritional demands of its popula-
tion, the Congo faces not only an overall population growth rate of about
2.2 percent per year, but more particularly a high and still growing
urbanization now estimated at 40 percent of total population. Urban diets
differ from rural food habits; for example, a far higher quantity of meat
was consumed per head of the urban population in 19659 (about 12 kilograms)
than in rural areas (1.4 kilograms). Continued rural-urban migration would
therefore significantly influnerc  future demand for meat; and a growth rate
of 5 percent per annum has been assumed.
28.       At present, the upward trend in beef prices is quite marked in the
whole Equatozial African - gion, where there are increasing difficulties in
obtaining supplies.  In the Co.go, prices of imported meat have increased by
about 10 percent per annuia over the last two years.
29.       Beef consumption in the Congo was estimated at about 4,700 tons
in 1969, o-f Ywhich 91 percent had to be imported. It is expected that promo-
tion of local beef cattle raising could bring the share of imports down to
70 percent by 1985.  However, since overall beef consumption would be in-
creasing by 5 percent per year over tnis period, the country's import re-
quirements would continue to grow by about 4 percent per year in terms of
volume.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The Government of the Congo has been interested in developing the
livestock potential of the Niari Valley since 1965. The limited knowledge of
cattle raising in the Congo, and in this valley in particular, necessitated a
series of detailed studies which were undertaken by the French Bureau pour le
Developpement de la Production Agricole (BDPA) and Societe d'Etudes pour le
Developpement Economique et Social (SEDES), with funds from the Congolese
Government and the French Ponds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC). The Bank's
field mission in Abidjan played an important part in the identification of
the project. Following completion of these studies, the Government requested
in September 1971 Bank Group financing for the project, which was appraised
in January-February 1972. Further Bank missions were, however, required in
September 1972 and May-June 1973 to discuss particularly the technical
assistance aspects of the project and the availability and price of breeding
stock, with both the Government and FAC.
31.       Report No. PA-149a, of August 3, 1973 (Appraisal of a Livestock
Project-People's Republic of the Congo) is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors. This report appraises a US$8.8 million project
to establish a 30,000 ha ranch on almost unutilized land in southern Congo.
An autonomous state-owned agency, the Office du Ranch de la Dihesse (ORD),
would be established to operate and manage this ranch. ORD's Board of
Directors will include representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Plan-
ning and Agriculture.   Annex III to this report gives a summary of the proj-
ect and the proposed US$5.6 million IDA credit.
32.       The ranch would be constructed mainly over a 7-year period, when
90 percent of development costs would be incurred. Investments would include
clearing one-third of the ranch area, building 720 km of fencing, constructing
135 km of ranch roads, firebreaks, watering facilities, dipping tanks, housing
for expatriate and Congolese personnel, and contributing to initial net oper-
ating costs.
33.       The ranch would be stocked with cattle of the N'dama breed which is
well suited to this area. The overall carrying capacity of the pastures would
be about one animal unit per hectare, and 6,600 N'dama heifers would be pur-
chased over the first six years. About 3,900 heifers and 230 good quality
bulls would be purchased in Zaire, and the remainder would be purchased in
the Congo. A small number of Afrikander or other breeds for crossbreeding
and comparison purposes would also be imported.
34.       The number of breeding cows would be increased to about 10,000 by
year 8, when the herd would be stabilised, and total cattle would reach
35,000 by year 10. Annual offtake is estimated at about 21 percent and
annual beef production at 35 kilograms per head, or 40 kilograms per hectare.
This compares favorably with a similar ranch in Zaire where annual offtake is
22 percent and production 33 kilograms per head.



35.       The project is an important and sound step by the Government in its
effort to increase and improve local bee. nroduction and expand the presently
very small beef cattle industry. 'The proposed operation would inlcrease
local production almost fourfold at economic cost, thereby reducing meat
imports and increasing foreign exchange savings.    It would also help overcotme
some basic constraints to livestock development -- lack of breeding stock,
applied research and overall expe-,tise -- a benefit which would be applicabie
in other WUest African countries as well. Surplus heifers (at least 1,100 per
year) would De available for sale in the Congo, to both large ranches and small
farmers.
36.       Cattle raising on a cozanercial basis is in its early stages in
most of West t1rica. The development of the proposed ranch would provide
an excellent opportunity for applied study of pasture establishment and
management, anrd cattle husbandry trials. IThe project would therefore finance
the cost of applied research on the ranch.   A consulting firm and the Govern-
ment would establish a research program satisfactory to iDA. Implementation
of this program would involve empioyment on the ranch of a research specialist
Lor the initial 5, possibly 7, years and professional and technical support
including periodic visits by the consultant as required.    The French Govern-
ment would finance the cost of both the research specialist and the consultant.
The main purpose of the applied research would be to allow the ranch management
to maximize the efficiency of production both per hectare of pasture and per
head of cattle, and to provide techniques and data for further development
programs in the livestock sector.
37.       Due to lack of Congolese trained in livestock developmcnt, as many
as six technical assistants (a General Manager, two Deputy Mianagers, a foreman,
a foreman mechanic, and an accountant) would be required for about the first
five years to set up and uanage the ranch, select and buy the foundation
breeding stocrks, and train local counterparts.  The French Government has agreed
to finance the cost of technical assistance for the initial five, possibly
seven, years of the project and has signed an agreemenit wit'hl the Congo in this
respect.  The agreement, which is satisfactory to IDA, provides, among other
things, that a suitably qualified General Manager and an Accountant would be
in the fielQ wxithin three  o-aoths of the signing of the proposed IDA credit
and tlhe other technical aslbL-ar-ts, a few months thereafter.  The assumption
of heis post by the General Manager would be a condition of effectiveness of
t;,e r-roposed credit.  The agze(cent also provides for a consultant to give
the required professional and techlical support to the technical assistance
'tea,.
33.       T'raining of Congolese perso-,nel in ranch management would be an
ix.portant feature of the project.  Congolese staff would be appointed as
counterparts tc the techn-cal assistants responsible for initially operatIng
the project.  These staff would receive in-service and, when required, over-
seas training for subsequent eatployment as assistant ranch managers, veterinary
ass_stants, head stoclanen, forEmen, bDookkeepers, mechanics, drivers, builders
a:Lcd ehrdsmen. The French Government would finance trainfng of these staff
wit-,mn the Franc zone and IDA uuuld finance possible training outside this
zone. The Government, ORD and -he Fre.nch agency concerned would consult



-9-
with IDA not later than the fifth year after the Credit has been signed on
the availability of qualified local personnel to replace expatriate staff
before their departure.
39.       There are only about 130 families living in the general area of
the ranch, mainly by the railway. Sections of the ranch would be set aside
for residential and cropping purposes, and these would include some houses
and land presently used.   However, a number of farmers would be required to
nove out of the ranch area, and assurance was obtained during negotiations
that the Government would arrange for their resettlement elsewhere.   A number
of these people could be employed on the ranch.   At full development, the
ranch is expected to provide direct employment for some 230 families and
create a significant indirect demand for labor and services during the con-
struction period and thereafter. The research program should lead to more
intensive exploitation of the ranch and, consequently, a further increase in
employment.
40.       Project cost, net of taxes, is estimated at US$8.8 million, of
which US$5.8 million (65 percent) is foreign exchange and the remaining
US$3.0 million (35 percent) local cost. Costs have been estimated on the
basis of May 1973 prices. A 15 percent physical and a 5 percent price con-
tingency have been provided. Table 1 below shows the costs and financing of
the proposed project. These costs do not include any capitalized interest.

The Government would onlend IJS$J .6 mil3ion out of the proposed Credit to ORD
for 25 years at the 6 percent: interest rate applicable to borrowings by agri-
culture enterprises in Congo. Interest would be deferred and capitalized for
a 10-year grace period.   Principal and capitalized interest would be repaid
from year 11 to year 25, an obligation ORD can fulfill without endangering its
liquidity.  The Government would transfer the remaining US$2.0 million of
the Credit to ORD as equity. This would strengthen ORD's capital structure,
enhance its creditworthiness and borrowing capacity, and allow it to finance
possible additional investments.
42.       Disbursements under the Credit would help finance the following items:
(a)  ranch investment items, including breeding stock
(US$3.8 million);
(b) net operating costs for the first seven years
(US$1.3 million); and
(c)  research (excluding bilateral technical assistance) and
training outside the Franc zone (US$0.5 million).
43.       The Government would contribute about 4 percent of project cost,
and furthermore would advance US$250,000 required to initiate the purchase
of breeding stock and other investment items; it would also provide land
and public facilities and meet the IDA service charges during the disburse-
ment period. This contribution is substantial in view of the Government's
limited financ-ial resources and its efforts to Improve existing state ranches.
The payment of the US$250,000 advance and the Government:s capital contribu-
tion to ORD would be a condition of effectiveness. ORD would finance the
fixed investment costs required for years 8 to 10, amiounting to about 5 per-
cent of total project cost.   Ihe French Government would provide a grant to
finance the technical assistance and training of Congolese project personnel
within the Franc zone.
44.       Finan.cing net operazing costs (after allowing for income from sales)
is required to meet deficits arising from the launching of the ranch. Such
deficits are usual in the initial years of establishing a new beef cattle ranch
because of the comparatively long period required to produce marketable beef
cattle and the need to retain nearly all females for some years for breeding.
A substantial amount of funds from outside ORD would therefore be needed to
cover operating costs. Since the Government contribution is already substantial
and ro funds are available through the banking system, the proposed financing
of 100 percen: of net operating costs for the first seven; years is considered
justified.
45.       ORD is expected to break even at year 7, after which it could
complete on-ranch investments from its resources. It would be able to start



repaying the loan from Government at year 11, and its net worth at the end
of year 15 should be about US$4.9 million, or US$4.4 million more than its
initial capital.
46.       International competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines
would be utilized for all contracts for goods and services in excess of
US$25,000, except for consultant services and for the purchase of N'dama
cattle, most of which would be purchased from a single supplier and the
remainder in small lots. To the extent possible, contracts for vehicles,
machinery, equipment and materials would be bulked into orders suitable
for competitive bidding.
47.       The bulk of the N'dama cattle would be furnished by one, well-
established, supplier, the Van Lancker ranch in Zaire and the remainder
would be purchased in the Congo. Before purchase, all animals would be
subject to adequate veterinary testing, particularly against brucellosis.
48.       Some important benefits expected to accrue from the project are
not quantifiable. These include the demonstration effect of good management
practices on the future development of the unutilized land in the Dihesse
Plain, the effect of the progressive improvement of stock owned by small
farmers and the creation of a foundation breeding stock of the scarce, tse-tse
tolerant N'dama breed. In this respect, the project is a pilot enterprise.
Inexperience with this kind of project makes it most difficult to assess the
prospects of success. However, it is expected that the thoroughness of the
pre-investment studies will ensure a reasonably high prospect of success.
49.       The following direct benefits are expected to accrue from the im-
plementation of the project: (a) an incremental production of 1,200 tons of
beef per annum valued at US$1.6 million by year 12 (at 1973 prices); (b)
the establishment of a large herd of good quality cattle which could supply
at least 1,100 heifers per year as foundation stock to other projects or to
individual farmers; (c) the training of Congolese personnel in all aspects
of ranch management; and (d) the provision of direct employment for 230
families. The applied research studies financed under the project should
lead to further improvement in techniques which can be used for cattle pro-
duction. Based only on the direct increases in beef production, the rate
of return to the economy is estimated at 12.5 percent. The major factor
likely to prejudice the realization of the expected benefits is the diffi-
culty of guaranteeing adequate management methods. However, all feasible
measures to ensure sound management have been included in the project.
50.       Special conditions of effectiveness of the proposed credit would be:
(a) adoption of satisfactory legislation creating ORD;
(b) the assumption of his post by the ORD General Manager;
(c) signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between Government
and ORD; and



(d) Government payment of its capital contribution to project cost
and US$250,000 adv.nce to ORD.
The Government and the Association have initiated action aimed at the
satisfactory and early fulfillment of these conditions.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Republic of the Congo and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the
text of the resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
separately. The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern for credits
for livestock projects.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed devel-
opment credit.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Ln 480-COB - Potash Project; US$30.0 million loan of Januarv 9, 1967
This loan has been fully disbursed. In his memorandum of
September ", 1971, the Secretary informed the Executive Directors about the
status of the project and the serious problems which have been encountered
in its execution (see Document Sec. M71-456). The resulting difficulties
have limited production to about 212,000 tons of KCl (25 percent of rated
capacity) in 1970 and about 424.000 tons of KCl (50 percent of rated capacity)
in 1971. At this (1971) level of operations, the company had a cash loss
before interest and depreciation of about US$1.7 million. However, the new
management has controlled operating costs and improved the quality and re-
sultant sale price for potash. In 1972, there was a small cash surplus before
depreciation and interest, and sales were 9 percent higher than forecast.
The ,-.ain shareholder, Entreprise Miniere et Chimique, is presently financing
the borrower's cash requirements in the form of shareholder advances. The
long-term prospects for the company are still uncertain. The company is also
considering producing potash from carnallite. A Bank mission is at present
in the field to review progress.
Cr. 189-COB - Pointe Noire-Malkola Highway Improvement Project; US$1.5 million
Credit of May 28, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1973.
The project consists of the improvement, including paving, of the
Pointe Noire-Makola road (34 km) and supervision of construction work. The
project is now completed. The Government's payments of its contribution
under the project have been overdue since February 1972; it has recently paid
CFAF 60 million out of the 160 million due to the contractor and intends to
settle the outstanding arears in the near future. Consultations are taking
place between the Government an6 the Association with a view to postponing

balance of the credit.
Cr. 237-COB - Education Project.; US$3.5 million Credit of March 26, 1971
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
The project consists of (A) the construction, furnishing, and
equipment of Ci) a teacher training college at Dolisie; (ii) a technician
training institute at Pointe Noire; (iii) a vocational training center at
Boko; and (iv) extensions to two second-cycle general schools at Pointe
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being takern to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strenoths and weaknesses in project execution.

Noire and Brazzaville; and (B) the provision of 26 man-years of technical
assistance. The project is about six months behind schedule due to delay
in appointing consulting architects, completing preliminary designs, and
selecting specialists under the technical assistance program. A 20 percent
cost overrun on total project cost is likely, because of increases in con-
struction costs in 1972 and the two dollar devaluations.
Cr. 274-COB - Highway Maintenance Project; US$4.0 million Credit of December 22,
1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project consists of a four-year highway maintenance program,
providing for (i) reorganization of road maintenance; (ii) comprehensive
training of personnel; (iii) extension and renovation of workshops for equip-
ment maintenance. IDA has approved bidding documents for procurement of
equipment and spare parts. Equipment to be procured as determined on the
basis of a 1969 BCEOM study will probably be insufficient to carry out the
maintenance program. Increase in equipment requirements seems to be due
to higher than expected deterioration of existing equipment since the end of
the study. Consequently and also due to the dollar devaluation, consideration
is being given to the necessity of either increasing the credit or scaling
down the maintenance program.
Cr. 297-COB - First Railway Project; US$6.3 million Credit of April 7, 1972;
increased by US$0.6 million on July 3, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1974
The project covers a portion of ATC's 1972-75 development plan and
the credit provides financing for: (i) final engineering for a possible re-
alignment of a 100 km mountain section of the railway where capacity is now
inadequate for increasing traffic; (ii) a study of future traffic, especially
timber (one of the principal commodities carried) and of traffic costs gen-
erally of the various agency services; and (iii) the provision of freight cars
to improve the railway's operations. Project execution is proceeding as
planned. Other investments of CFCO have been somewhat delayed because of the
time required to finalize the financialarrangements with lending agencies.
