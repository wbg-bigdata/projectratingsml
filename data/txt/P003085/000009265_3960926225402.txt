EMIORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
Or TEE TNTERNATIONAL DEVELOP1MENT ASSOCIATION
TO 7TE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 32.6 MILLION (US$45.0 MILLION EQUIVALENT)
TO THE REPUBLIC OF 7AIRF
FOR A THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed credit to the Republic of
Zaire for SDR 32.6 million (US$45.0 million equivalert) is submltted for
approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and would
assist in financing a Third Water Supply Project.
2.        Background:  The availability of safe stater plays a key role
in the development of ZAIRE where waterborne and water-related diseases
are prevalent, affecting in rural areas as much as JO0 of the population
and belng the primary cause of the high infant mortality rate of 25%.
1herefore access to safe water supply has within the ongoing 1987-1993
"septennat du social" been accorded a high priority by the Government of
Zaire. Responsibility for rural non-piped water supply systems
(springs, wells and boreholes equipped with hand pumps) is entrusted to
the National Service for rural water supply within the Ministry of Rural
Development, while the state-owned water utility REGIDESO - one of the
best managed and performing ones in Africa - is in charge of piped urban
and rural water supply systems. IDA's involvement in the water supply
sector and experience gained through the successful implementation of
two projects have confirmed on the one hand the actual need for
extending the water supply service to rural areas and on the other hand
the need for continuing and strengthening autonomous management
practices in the context of the overall structural adjustment process.
Financial reform aiming essentially at (i) continually adjusting water
tariffs, (ii) setting up an appropriate tariff structure to reduce the
large differences between tariffs of public and private consumers and
(iii) causing Government to pay arrears and regularly pay for future
water service, are needed to reach full cost recovery, thus addressing
current sectoral constraints related to the difficult economic situation
of the country and to the lack of skilled manpower. The proposed
project would provide the foreign exchange required to implement the
water supply development program and to purchase equipment needed for
operation and maintenance.
3.        Ohbectives:  Country-wide sector policy and investment program
were for the first time addressed in the sector study carried out in
1973 by the Government and Bank-WHO Cooperative Program, REGIDESO being
appointed a Government Counterpart Agency. Ever since, REGIDESO has
been continuously updating the sector study and investment program and
the proposed project is an essential component of the overall 1988-1992
ZP 31 billion (constant 1987 prices) REGIDESO investment program. The
key objectives of the proposed project would be: (i) to improve/
strengthen sector investment/ expenditure planning, in line with the
overall yearly PEP review process and consistent with the current
structural adjustment program; this would allow for stepping up
investments to meet expansion and rehabilitation requirements.



-2-
The development of project setectt0r criteria and the improvement of thie
preparation, appraisal and implemertation capacity of REGIDESO would
also be achieved througlh tbhe preposed project; (ii) to formutlate
policies and programs to address key sector i.sues, in particular rural
water supply and increased covimunrty participation; and (iii) to enhar.ce
REGIDESO's financial sustainah!lity, strengthen cost recovery
performance and improve operational eff0ciency.
4.  Project Description:  While addressing the above basic sector
economic and financial issues, the proposed pro4ect would include the
following componertF wh4ch are crucial to sector development: (4)
developing new water supply systems in 18 sem4-rural centers
("cliefs-lieux de zone") which are priority development poles for
important surrounding rural areas.- For the first time, semi-rural
agglomerations with poputhtions ranging from 10,000 to 40,000
inhabitants would be serviced through piped water supplv systems which
would contribute to their further developrent:  (iI) reinforcing the
water supply system of Likasi, ani essential element for the develcpment
of thiF importauxt town of the Shaba region whose economic activity is
dominated by the mining industry; (iii) technical assistance ard
training aimed at strergthening the sector planning as well as the
mauagement and operational capabilities of REGIDESO, which would extend
its responsibilities to supplvirg water to 18 additional centers;
(iv) consulting services for sectoral policy and sector study,
feasibility and final design studies, tender documents and works'
supervision for the waterworks to be implemented through the proposed
project, feasibility study/master plan of the Kinshasa sewerage/
environmental protection svstem (s) as well as the preparation of a
future water supply project and the medium/long-term
organizationimanagement study of REGIDESO; and (v) supply of essential
operational and training ecuipinent to further strengthen REGIDESO's
operational and managerial capabilitles.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement:  Notwithstanding REGIDESO's
good performance, the water supply sector in Zaire remains grossly
underdeveloped. Investments have lagged behind urban growth and
coverage is inadequate. The development of an adecuate water supply
service provided by a competent, efficiently run institution is crtcial
for the development of Zaire, and this is in full corformity with the
recommendations of the Government's sector development strategy study.
IDA's inivolvement has been and will be instrumenta] in helping to
mobilize external resources and assisting the Government and donors to
fully implement a sector development strategy and fttrd an agreed upon,
high priority Public Investment Program (1988-1992).
6.        Actions Agreed:  On May 5, 1988, the Government are RFCIDESO
signed a "contrat-programme" which is an agreement specifying sector
objectives and performance targets over a first period of three years
(1988-1990) and which settles the key issues identified during
appraisal. The sector objectives and performance targets would be
reviewed periodically and jointly by the Government, REGIDESO and TDA.
Or May 5, 1988, the Government also approved the new water tariff



-3-
structure providing for continuous quarterlv adjustments, effect!ve fror.
Yev 23, 1988, which would cover the foreign exchange risk. On ttay 8,
19i8  the Government approved the payment of !ts arrears to REGIDESO.  During
regotiations agreement was reaclhed with REGIDESO and the various
Ministers concerned on the following: (a) setting up a sector
programmra4rg trd review process consistent with the rolling three-year
PEP review; and (b) REGIDESO installing water connectionr in project
centers on',y 4r houses where beneficiaries formally commit themselves
towards REGIDESO to build adequate wastewater dispose] facilities in
order to preserve the environment. Conditions of credit effectiveness
will be: (i) the execution of the subsidiary loan agreemert ur.der terms
and conditicors scceptable to the Association and (ii) the submission to
the Association of a new on-lending agreement for credit 1261-7R signed
by both Coverrment and REGIDESO in which the interest rate would be the
same as for the subsidiary loen agreement mentioned above under (i),
together with reconfirmation that REGIDESO carries the foreign exchange
risk.
7.        Justification and Benefits:  The proposed project would
(i) weke avai'able safe water supply systems to that part of the
population living in agglomerated rural areas which so far have rot
berefitted adequately from such improvement of their living conditions
and (ii) contribute to human resource development and therefore foster
economic development. REGIDESO's center for studies has already gained
valuable experience by preparing the project with the support of
technical assistance. This building up of local project preparation,
appraisal and implementation capacity will -,ontinue during project
execution. Together with the implementation of the proposed project
this would, in the future, encourage other donors to finance water
svstems in similar rural agglomerations. In economic terms the savings
due to elimination of water hauling and assessment of the customers'
benefits in terms of overall income, result in rates of returr for the
indivIdue] sub-projects (centers) which are fully acceptable.
8.        Risks:  The project would not pose specific technical risks.
Execution of phvsical components would be straightforward. The risks
mostly involve the Government's willingness and commitment to carry out
and enforce needed reforms stipulated in the contrat-programme.
9.        Recommendations:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the IDA and recommend
that the Executive Ditectors approve the prorosed credit.
