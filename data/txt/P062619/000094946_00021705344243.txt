A: Project Development Objective
1. Project Development Objective and Key Performance Indicators (see Annex 1):
The main project objective is to support the design and implementation of institutional and legal reforms-
neededfor the second phase of Social Security and Pension Reform in Brazil.
The first phase of the Government's Social Security Reform Program involved reform measures passed
with Congressional approval, on December 15, 1998, of an amendment to the Federal Constitution of
1988. This first phase of reform was supported by a Bank S/SECAL of US$757,570,000. The second
phase of pension reform will involve the enactment of enabling legislation and institutional changes to
complete the pension reform. The proposed project would provide technical assistance for the design and
implementation of institutional and legal reforms needed to put into effect the reforms approved by the
Constitutional amendment of December 1998 and to initiate the second phase of the program of social
security reform for private sector workers in Brazil. Specifically, the project would support: (i) the design
and selected implementation of institutional reforms to enable the National Institute of Social Security
(Instituto Nacional de Seguridade Social - INSS) to carry out its new responsibilities within the reformed
pension system; (ii) the strengthening of the pension and insurance legal framework; and (iii) the
strengthening of supervision and regulation of the complementary pension funds system by the Secretariat
of Complementary Pension Funds (Secretaria da Previdencia Complementar -SPC)'.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-Related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Goal Supported by the Project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: R98-116          Date of latest CAS discussion: June 2, 1998
The June 1998 CAS Progress Report acknowledged that Brazil could be subject to external shocks, and
that in such eventuality, if the Government responded with corrective policy measures, the CAS proposed
to respond quickly with financial support for reforms in such areas as privatization, social security and
safety nets. In response to external shocks at the end of 1998, the Government initiated a strong reform
program in (among other areas) social security to improve the long term actuarial balance of the system,
which accounts for two thirds of the fiscal deficit. The Bank's strategy is to support the Government's
Social Security Reform Program with two S/SECALs and related technical assistance.
2. Main Sector Issues and Government Strategy:
The Government's Pension Reform Program. The current administration is committed to a phased
program of pension reform aimed at: (i) reducing the fiscal deficit of the pension system by introducing
the principle of actuarial balance; (ii) reducing the inequality in pension benefits between the pension
programs of private and public sector workers; and (iii) broadening individual choice by limiting the first-
pillar pension systems to workers with relatively low earnings, while stimulating the creation of
complementary pension funds for workers with higher earnings, in private companies and government
entities. This reform program is being implemented in two phases and will complement major reforms in
the areas of labor legislation and administrative reform.
The Government's pension reform program is being implemented in two phases. The First Phase of
Pension Reform. The main objectives of the Constitutional Amendment approved in December 15, 1998,
were to: (i) introduce the principle of actuarial and fiscal balance for the pension systems of private and
public sector workers; (ii) replace pensions based on length-of-service by pensions based on years-of-
contribution; (iii) eliminate the benefit rule to determine pensions for private sector workers from the text
of the Constitution; (iv) eliminate most special pension regimes (except for school teachers and workers
' The INSS and the SPC are both under the Ministry of Social Security (MPAS).

in hazardous activities); (v) impose a minimum retirement age on civil servants; and (vi) extend the
option of creating complementary pension funds to states and municipalities.  Together with the
Constitutional Amendment, Congress approved legislation to reduce the deficit of the state and municipal
pension regimes. The first phase of pension reform also included the initial stages of restructuring of
INSS to improve revenue collection and reduce evasion. The Second Phase of Pension Reform will
involve the implementation of the Constitutional Amendment reform through the passage of
complementary and ordinary laws and institutional reforms of the government agencies that oversee the
pension system: the INSS, which manages the pension system for private sector workers (RGPS), and the
SPC, which monitors and regulates the system of closed pension funds.
Pension Legal Framework. The Ministry of Social Security and Social Assistance (MPAS) is in charge
of implementing the second phase of reforms with respect to the RGPS. To accomplish this, MPAS is in
the process of drafting the new complementary and ordinary laws that will define the parameters of the
reformed RGPS, in order to achieve the objective of financial and actuarial balance stipulated in the
Constitutional Amendment. The new legislation is likely to generate some controversy. For this reason,
the MPAS plans a public information and dissemination campaign aimed at informing about the
importance of the reform, the implications of the options under consideration and the international
experience. The MPAS is also working on the reform of the pension system for federal workers (Regime
Juridico Unico -RJU) with the collaboration of technicians from SEAP (Secretaria de Estado da
Administragao e do Patrim6nio). MPAS is also assisting in the reform of state and municipal RJUs2.
Restructuring of INSS. The INSS administers the RGPS for private sector employees and oversees the
closed funds run by state enterprises. The INSS is the result of the merger of several previous
organizations. It has a staff of 50,000, distributed in 1,200 offices and a yearly operating budget of R$5 .0
billion in 1998. While the INSS has begun a program of institutional strengthening, more work needs to
be done to make it into a more efficient organization able to support the structural changes in the
Government's pension reform program. Some of the problems facing the INSS include: (i) high cost of
operation per client served; (ii) an organizational structure in which the previous organizations that
merged to form the INSS are not fully integrated; (iii) weak revenue collection auid benefit control
procedures; and (iv) slow customer service, which has resulted in a poor public image of the institution.
Some of the difficulties the INSS faces are the result of a lack of both reliable information on contributors
and beneficiaries and efficient and timely data processing services.
INSS has initiated a process of institutional strengthening to improve its efficiency, reduce operating costs
and enable it to implement the systemic reforms of the RGPS, including the adoption of individual
pension accounts. 1NSS is implementing a cost reducing program, and has already begun to take actions
to improve revenue collection. The INSS strengthening program will involve two steps. The first step
will be to develop an audit of the institution's strengths and opportunities, and based on the findings of
this audit, to elaborate a Strategic Plan for the INSS. The Strategic Plan will also form the basis for
developing detailed plans and funding estimates for the different components of the restructuring
program, and for setting up priorities. A second step would be the implementation of the Strategic Plan,
which will lead to a new organizational structure for the INSS, and a total reengineering of processes
within the institution.
In parallel with the preparation of the diagnosis and Strategic Plan, the INSS is embarked on an effort to:
* Develop a Master Plan of Information Systems Renewal: The objectives are to: (i) improve

workers at the State and Federal levels is being done under a LIL for State Pension Reform Technical Assistance
Project, approved in June 1998. A proposed PHRD Grant in support of the preparation of a Second Social Security
Special Sector Adjustment Loan, will also finance additional technical work for the reform of the federal RJU
system.

collection, monitoring and benefit payment functions; (ii) adopt a system of individual pension
accounts; (iii) improve the communication net between INSS/MPAS and the data processing agent
DATAPREV; (iv) improve the links of client service centers to the information system; and (v)
introduce an effective management information system;
E Expand the New System of Revenue Collection: Since August 1998, the Contributions Collection
Department (DAF) has established a new unit (SGS) to implement a contributor's management
system focusing on specific groups of contributors, by productive sectors and market segments, and
to monitor and collect contributions from different segments of the economy. This includes the
10,000 largest employers which account for 70% of all contributions. MPAS has spent its own
resources to: (i) initiate the establishment of a management information system by segments; and (ii)
provide training and personal computers to new inspectors.
*  Improve the National Integrated Data Base of Social Information (CNIS): INSS has made important
efforts to unify the different data bases of social information under the CNIS, but the quality of the
data has not been evaluated for use in determining pension benefits. Improvement of the CNIS is
fundamental to the implementation of a system of individual accounts, as contemplated in the
Government's pension reform program.
Strengthening of the SPC. The main problems facing the system of complementary pension funds
(SCPP) are: (i) low coverage (less than 5% of Brazil's economically active population); (ii) incomplete
regulation; and (iii) weak and fragmented supervision. The regulatory framework lacks transparency and
detail on issues like funding levels, solvency proceedings, portability, vesting and investment rules.
Supervision is divided between two entities. Closed funds are supervised by the SPC, which is a special
branch within MPAS; and the open funds are supervised by the Superintendencia de Seguros Privados
(SUSEP), attached to the Ministry of Finance. The capacity of the regulatory agencies to regulate and
supervise is severely constrained, given their limited resources.
The SPC has initiated a process of institutional strengthening to enable it to implement the provisions in
the Constitutional Amendment concerning the SCPP. This program is being supported by a US$1.2
million grant from the IDB. The main elements of the strengthening program include:
-  Elaboration of Complementary and Ordinary Laws: The Constitutional amendment will be
implemented through three Complementary Laws that must be submitted to Congress within 90 days
of approval of the Amendment. With support from an IDB grant of US$1.2 million, the SPC has
already drafted these laws and presented them to Congress for approval. The first law will create a
new framework for closed pension funds and cover such issues as who can form pension funds, what
will be the rights of workers, the funding, vesting and portability requirements, and similar regulatory
issues. It will provide the possibility for non-employer-based funds to be set up (for example by
professional associations), and for multi-employer funds to be established to cater for the needs of
smaller firms. The second law will allow for closed pension funds to be created by public authorities
(federal, state and municipal). The third law will regulate institutional aspects of the day to day
functioning of the closed pension funds of public enterprises. Following Congressional approval of
the three Complementary Laws, the SPC will draft ordinary laws and implementing regulations.
* Strengthening SPC's regulatory and supervisory activities. Also, with support from the IDB grant,
the SPC is in the process of creating investment, accounting, actuarial, fisJcal and registration records.
The SPC has also initiated preparation of a new framework for regulating pension fund investments,
including prudential controls on investment that are not performed at present.
* Creation of a new regulatory agency for Complementary Pension Funds. The SPC is in a process of
preparing a new law proposal for the creation of a new National Agency of Complementary Pension

Funds, that would regulate all pension funds according to a single set of sound business practices.
3. Learning and Innovation Issues to be Addressed by the Project
This LIL focuses on learning and piloting in search of developmental solutions to issues presented by the
restructuring of the institutions that administer the Pension System in Brazil, and the design of the legal
and regulatory framework for the new pension system for private sector workers. The solutions found
under this LIL will be implemented through three larger-scale future operations. This LIL will help
prepare the strategic plans for the INSS and the SPC. These strategic plans will develop new solutions to
the institutional restructuring of the INSS and the SPC. The solutions developed under this LIL will help
design a larger TA loan to support the implementation of the proposed institutional reforms. This LIL
will also help to design an affective public information and communication strategy to inform social
security stakeholders about the choices and implications of social security reform. This strategy will be
implemented under a future TA loan. The actuarial models developed under this LIL will contribute to
establish the financial viability of alternative benefit formulas for the RGPS. The insights gained trough
this work will help design Brazil's second phase of pension reform. Similarly, the legal and regulatory
work to be carried our under this LIL will help design new laws and regulations needed to implement the
second phase of pension reform in Brazil. The expectation is that the second phase of social security
reform will be supported by a second Bank special S/SECAL.
A) Institutional Reform of the Government agencies that administer the Pension System:
Restructuring of the INSS. The project would assist in the preparation of the diagnostic work and of
the Strategic Plan for the institutional restructuring of the agency. It would also assist in the preparation
of the Master Systems Renewal Strategy, in the expansion of the SGS (to cover all the contributor
segments, to integrate INSS regional offices into the system, and to train additional officers in its use);
and in the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the CNIS. The implementation of the Strategic Plan
would be supported by a follow up technical assistance loan.
There are some strategic considerations that will be taken into account during project implementation.
The informational and institutional requirements of 1NSS will depend heavily on the nature of the reform
being implemented. For example, a notional accounts reform will require more timely information and
more intensive record-keeping than a reform which involves only a salary-based defined benefit formula.
However, although the thinking about the specifics of the reform is still evolving, it is necessary to initiate
the reform of the INSS to avoid the possibility of having to delay the reform due to lack of institutional
preparedness. For this reason, as the project evolves, it is contemplated that the Bank and the INSS will
take a broad view of reforms and make sure that the institutional diagnosis and restructuring plans do not
close the door on any policy options. To this effect, the studies to be financed under the LIL will look not
only at the institutional requirements of notional accounts systems, but also at the institutional
requirements of a well-run salary based defined benefit systems, at the institutional requirements of full
multipillar systems, where the Complementary System would apply to everyone, not just those with
salaries above Rs. 1,200 per month. It will look also at the institutional implications of integrating the
state RJUs and the RGPS systems and the degree of compatibility between the data bases of the Ministry
of Administration and State Reform (MARE) with DATAPREV in case that such integration may occur.
Also, in the design of the information requirement for the adoption of individual accounts by the INSS,
the project will take into consideration the possibility of using the FGTS system as the basis for
introducing individual accounts in the INSS3
Strengthening regulation of Complementary Pension System. The proposed project would support the
preparation of a Strategic Plan for the creation of a New National Agency of Complementary Pension

contributions.

Funds to regulate pension funds according to a single set of sound business practices. With financing
from the IDB, the SCP has prepared three Complementary Laws to implement the changes in the
Complementary Pension System stipulated in the recently approved Constitutional Amendment. The
proposed project would support the preparation of additional laws and regulations required to fully
implement reform of the complementary pension system stipulated in the Constitutional Amendment.
The project would also support the strengthening of SPC's capacity to regulate and monitor
complementary pension funds by improving its information system, and administrative procedures.
There is an strategic choice in deciding to complement, under the LIL, the technical work for the
revamping of the regulatory framework of private pension funds that will be supported by an IDB grant.
The work in this area includes the design of investment and actuarial models and the creation of a data
base consisting of six modules. Close cooperation between the work supported by the LIL and the work
supported by the IDB grant will ensure consistency of the technical work financed by both institutions
with the overall objectives of a sound regulatory system. The dissemination funds included in the LIL
will allow for extensive consultation with the private sector in this area.
B) Design of the legal and regulatory framework for the reform of the Pension System of Private Sector
Workers.
The project would strengthen the capacity of the MPAS to carry out the technical studies and legal work
to establish the new parameters of the reformed pension system for private sector workers within the
parameters of the approved Constitutional Amendment. These parameters stipulate the need for actuarial
and fiscal balance in the pension system. The need to achieve such balances, coupled with the political
constraints to pension reform, pose a challenge to the MPAS on how to design the future pension laws.
This LIL will support the studies that will clearly present the trade-off of different alternatives for
achieving these balances. The project would also support studies to reduce evasion and expand coverage
of social security and to reform the work related injury insurance system.
There is a strategic link between the proposed LIL and the other ways in which the Bank supports the
process of pension reform in Brazil, including: (i) the ongoing ESW on pension reform; (ii) the First
Social Security S/SECAL (approved in December 1998); (iii) the State Pension Reform Technical
Assistance Project -PARSEP- (approved in June 1998); and (iv) a PHRD grant, recently approved, to
support the preparation of the Second Social Security Special Sector Adjustment Loan. The Bank's ESW
on pension reform in Brazil provided the analytical basis for the first Social Security S/SECAL and serves
as the basis for the ongoing Bank/Government dialogue on these issues. The PARSEP supports
strengthening the capability of the states and federal governments on pension modeling, to allow them to
diagnose their pension problems and design the solutions. The proposed LIL and the PHRD grant will
support the initial stages of institutional restructuring of the Government agencies administering the
pension systems and the technical work for the elaboration of the laws and regulations that will define the
second phase of pension reform. that would be supported by a proposed Second Social Security
Adjustment Loan. There is also strong coordination between Bank support of pension reform in Brazil
and the support that the IMF provides to Brazil in this area.
C) Dissemination and Communication of Pension Reform Issues:
This LIL includes an innovative component to increase awareness of the importance of pension reforn
and lessons from international experience. Assistance under this component will cover preparation of an
information dissemination strategy, information material for dissemination of information, and seminars
to disseminate international experience in pension reform.
4. Learning and innovation expectations
The project's expected results are:



Page 7
Institutional
*  An Strategic Plan that will establish the main parameters for the restructuring of the INSS and
improved capacity of the INSS to implement the systemic reforms of the pension system for private
sector workers.
*  An Strategic Plan for the creation of a new national agency for the regulation of complementary
pension funds and improved regulation and monitoring of the funds. In the long run, the expectation
is for faster growth of complementary pension funds both in number of funds and in assets-under-
management, brought about by the lowering of risks through improved regulation and monitoring of
the funds. Growth of these funds will have a stimulating effect in the capital markets and will ensure
better retirement benefits for the participating workers; and
*  An strategy for dissemination of information about pension reform to increase awareness of the need
for further pension reform, the options available and lessons from international experience.
Economic
* A legal framework for the pension system for private sector workers which establishes the basis for a
more actuarially fair and financially viable system.
Participation
* A more informed population that will support pension reform as a result of the communications and
dissemination campaign.

2. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
The Project Coordinating Unit (PCU). A PCU has been established under the implementing institution,
the Ministry of Social Security and Social Assistance (MPAS). An experienced Project Coordinator has
been hired to head this unit. The Project Coordinator will be assisted by a small team including an
accountant and a lawyer.
Technical Unit. A Technical Unit (TU) will be constituted at MPAS to assist the PCU in managing the
technical aspects of the project. It will vet terms of reference for consultants, organize workshops and
generally manage, provide opinions, and handle all technical aspects of the project. The TU will include
technical staff from the MPAS, INSS, and DATAPREV. MPAS will enter into an administrative
arrangement with INSS and DATAPREV to govern the participation of these institutions in the Project.
Financial Management and Procurement. The Project Coordinator and all members of the Project
Coordinating Unit will undergo training in Bank procurement, disbursement and financial management
procedures. Procurement will be supervised from the Bank's Brasilia office. A Brasilia based Financial
Management Specialist (FMS) will assist the PCU to meet Bank standards and help with project
implementation thereafter.
3.Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements
A mid-term review would take place when half of the project funds have been committed, or after
eighteen months after the date of the Loan Agreement, whichever is earlier.

7. Participatory Approach
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
The primary beneficiaries of the restructuring of the INSS and of a new legal framework to
implement reforms to the pension system brought about by the Constitutional Amendment, are future
retirees. They will benefit in terms of better services and lower risk of insufficient retirement income.



Page 1 0
Future beneficiaries have participated in the political debate preceding Congressional approval of the
Constitutional Amendment. Workers not covered by the social security system will benefit from the
studies aimed at expanding the system's coverage. Finally, the population at large will benefit from
better informnation about social security issues and alternatives through the project's public
information and dissemination program.
* Groups that would be affected by the new regulatory framework for pension funds include the
affiliates and managers of closed and open pension funds, as well as the clients and managers of
banks and insurance companies.  In the course of project preparation, Bank staff met with
representatives of these groups to discuss their opinions and concerns.
b. Other key stakeholders:
An additional group of key stakeholders in the project are the staff of INSS. In the course of project
preparation, Bank staff met with INSS staff at upper and middle managerial levels to discuss their
concerns about the current problems in the institution and their views on how INSS should be reorganized
in the future to be more efficient and provide better services to its clients.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Aspects related to Pension Reform Legislation. The project will support the elaboration of the legal
framework for reform of the RGPS. The new laws will define the parameters of the reformed regime
in order to achieve the objective of financial and actuarial balance stipulated in the Constitutional
amendment. The achievement of that balance will require difficult choices. Current government
thinking with respect to the RGPS is to introduce individual pension accounts. Contribution records
would be kept by INSS for each individual worker, and the individual's contributions would be
credited with a notional interest rate. Upon retirement, the individual's balance in the account would
be divided by a factor based on the life expectancy for the individuals at that age, and the result would
be a pension indexed by inflation throughout the individual's lifetime. Controversial aspects of this
option include the determination of the initial year of the individual account, and the methodology for
determining the notional interest rate.
* Aspect related to the restructuring of INSS. In any institutional reorganization, decisions about
organizational restructuring and staff downsizing, tend to create controversy. However, this project is
not expected to generate major controversies in these areas because it will only support the initial
stage of INSS restructuring, including the elaboration of a Strategic Plan. The actual restructuring of
the institution would be supported by a follow up technical assistance loan.
* Aspects related to the regulation of pension funds. Another controversial issue is the scope of the
new regulatory agency for pension funds. It is unclear at this time if this regulatory agency should
cover only closed funds or also open pension funds, which are currently overseen by the insurance
regulator, SUSEP.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
I. Procurement
1.1    The procurement of project components financed by the Bank loan would be carried out
in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement of Goods and Works (January 1995,
revised January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999), and the Bank Guidelines
for the Use of Consultants (January 1997, revised September 1997, and January 1999).
1.2   Procurement of Goods: Goods (computer equipment and software) costing more than
US$350,000 would be procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures.
Although not envisaged, there may be the need to procure during project implementation some
items costing less than US$350,000, but more than US$100,000, and others costing less than
US$100,000. They, if any, would be procured on the basis of National Competitive Bidding
(NCB) or National/International Shopping respectively. Shopping procedures would require
quotations from at least three suppliers. There would be no works to be procured under this
project.
1.3    Technical Assistance: Consulting Services and Training worth more than US$100,000
would be selected in accordance with Quality and-Cost-Based Selection procedures (QCBS).
Contracts for simple assignments not exceeding the equivalent of US$100,000 per contract, up to
an aggregate amount equivalent to US$250,000, may be awarded following Least Cost Selection
procedures (LCS). Consulting services estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per
contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$250,000, for which the need for preparing and
evaluating competitive proposals is not justified, may be procured under contracts awarded
following consultant's qualifications. Consulting services estimated to cost less than US$100,000
equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$250,000 equivalent, may, with the
Bank's prior agreement, be procured under contracts awarded based on single source selection.
Consulting services not requiring the use of teams, up to an aggregate amount of US$250,000,
may be procured under contract awarded to individual consultants, selected based on their
professional qualifications.
1.4    Bank's Procurement Review: Prior Review: The Bank will review ex-ante the ICB
bidding documents for the procurement of goods estimated to cost US$350,000 or more and the
first contract under NCB, if it materializes. The Bank would also review ex-ante all
documentation for the selection of consultants (request for proposal, short lists, letters of
invitation, contract forms, terms of reference, etc) of contracts estimated at more than
US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. Prior review of terms of reference only
would be required for contracts estimated at less than US$100,000 for firms and less than
US$50,000 for individuals. Post review: All procurement documentation, including that related
to contracts not subject to prior review would be kept by the Borrower for ex-post review by the
Bank during the supervision mission.
1.5   The Borrower is planning to administer and implement part of the project under the
auspices of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). This agency will help to enhance
the local institutional capacity and take care of some procurement processes following Bank's
guidelines. The Project Document (PRODOC) has to be approved by the Bank prior to its
signature. The UNDP fees would be financed by the Borrower. Table A shows Project Costs by

Procurement Arrangements.   Table Al shows Project Costs by Consultant Selection
Arrangements and Table B shows Thresholds for Procurement Methods and Prior Review.
II Financial Management.
2.1    A financial management assessment has been performed by the local Bank FMS/OPR
prior to loan negotiations. A time bound detailed action plan has been agreed with project
management, describing the necessary steps and measures required to strengthen the Financial
Management System to enable the Borrower to disburse based on PMRs. This plan would be
implemented within six months of loan effectiveness.
IIl. Disbursement
3.1    Allocation of loan proceeds: The project is expected to be completed over a period of
thirty three months. The last disbursement will be incurred twenty four months after the contract
signing date. The closing date of the loan will bq December 31, 2002. The allocation of loan
proceeds by project component is shown in Table C.
3.2   Initially, the loan would be disbursed on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs).
After the action plan for the financial management system has been implemented, the loan will be
disbursed under the Project Management Reports (PMRs)-based disbursement system. The PCU
will prepare, in accordance with guidelines acceptable to the Bank, and furnish to the Bank no
later than 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter, a PMR for such period, which (i) sets
forth actual sources and application of funds for the project, both cumulatively and for the period
covered by the report, and projected sources and application of funds for the following six-month
period; (ii) PMRs in each quarterly report will describe the physical progress in project
implementation and explain variances between the actual and previously forecast implementation
targets; and (iii) set forth the status of procurement under the project and expenditures under
contracts financed out of the proceeds of the loan as at the end of the period covered by the
report.
3.3   Special Account: A Special Account will be established to cover expenditures paid
directly by the Borrower. For the initial period of disbursements under SOEs, the Authorized
Allocation of the Special Account will be US$500,000. Once the PMR-based disbursement
system is implemented, the authorized allocation will be established based on the cash flow
forecast for a six month period. Withdrawals from the Loan Account of amounts to be deposited
into the Special Account, shall be supported by PMRs. The Special Account would be managed
by the PCU, which would be responsible for preparing applications for withdrawals and the
supporting PMRs. These applications would be submitted every six months or when the Special
Account has been drawn down by a third of the initial deposit, whichever occurs first.
3.4    Retroactive Financing: There would be retroactive financing of up to US$500,000 for
expenditures incurred between February 1, 1999 and the loan signing date. Retroactive financing
is recommended to allow for Bank financing of expenditures, which have been incurred since the
project was identified.
IV. Accounting and Auditing
4.1    Accounts, including the Special Account and related financial information (including



Page 28
supporting documentation for the PMRs), would be audited annually by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with Bank auditing guidelines. Certified copies of the
audited consolidated project accounts and audited Special Account (including a separate opinion
on the use of PMRs) would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the close of
the fiscal year.
