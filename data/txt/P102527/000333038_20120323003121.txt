A. Summary

1.      This memorandum seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President (MNAVP) to extend
the Closing Date of the Improved Access to Water and Sanitation Services Project (P102527) by 12
months from its current closing date of December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 as requested by
the three operators implementing the project, namely Lyonnaise des Eaux de Casablanca (LYDEC),
Amendis-Tanger and Régie Autonome de Distribution d’Eau et d’Electricité de Meknès (RADEM),
through letters dated respectively November 29, 2010, November 16, 2010 and October 22, 2010.
Written confirmations were received from the Ministry of Interior and from the Ministry of Finance
on December 6, 2010 (Letter and written confirmation are attached to this Paper). This is the
second extension of closing date. A first extension was processed to change the closing date from
the original closing date of December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. The cumulative extension
period is thus 2 years, requiring Regional Vice President’s approval.

B. Project Status

2.      According to Schedule 1 of the Grant Agreement dated January 29, 2007, the Project
development objective is to promote, following an output-based approach, the connection to water
and sanitation services of about 11,300 low income beneficiary households selected in
disadvantaged peri-urban and rural INDH neighborhoods in the urban centers of Casablanca,
Tangiers and Meknes in the territory of the Kingdom of Morocco. The project thus aims at
providing sustainable access to combined water and sewerage service to peri-urban areas with high
levels of low income households while demonstrating replicable OBA mechanisms to target sector
funds and potential donor monies in support of the Government of Morocco’s challenge to extend
water supply & sewerage (WS&S) service in poor and vulnerable communities, within the
framework of King’s National Initiative for Human Development (INDH). To that effect, the
project is targeted towards three municipalities keen on piloting OBA approaches for improved
water and sanitation access, i.e. Casablanca, Meknes and Tangiers, under conditions representative
of Morocco’s WS&S market. Two international private sector incumbents (Amendis in Tangiers
and LYDEC in Casablanca), and a public sector incumbent (RADEM in Meknès) are the service
providers in their respective service areas. While the details of the schemes vary, the common
objective of the pilots is to expand access to water and sanitation to the poor living in recently
legalized informal settlements in peri-urban areas.
3.     Based on the current USD/MAD exchange rate, the pilots are expected to extend water
supply services to about 10,400 households, or approximately 52,000 people, and sanitation
services to 9,500 of these households, or approximately 47,500 people. The estimated total cost of
the project is estimated to be USD22.2 million, including USD 7 million GPOBA subsidies
(USD 3.5 million Casablanca, USD 2 million Tangiers and USD 1.5 million Meknès) and about
15.2 millions of user’s contribution.
4.      The outputs for which OBA subsidies are disbursed are individual household network
connections for standard potable water and/or sewerage utility service, in previously unserved
informal and predominantly poor peri-urban neighborhoods, recently regularized. The disbursement
profile of the individual subsidy is as follows: (i) 60% of unit subsidy is released upon verification
of eligible water and sewerage household connection, and (ii) 40% of unit subsidy is released upon
verification of sustained service for a period of 6 months.

5.      Subsidy targeting is geographical in nature: The target neighborhoods are recognized among
the poorest in urban Morocco, and are part of the Government of Morocco INDH’s shortlist of 160
most disadvantaged urban and peri-urban communities. All households in the selected pilot areas
are eligible to participate in the connection subsidy program. The eligibility criteria for social
connections as determined at the level of each operator are described in the table below.

6.      The US$ 7 million grant was executed on January 29, 2007. It experienced a slow start with
the first disbursement taking place in early 2008. Implementation accelerated in 2008, with the
operators reaching between 14 and 39% of their planned number of connections to water supply and
between 19 and 44% of their planned number of connections to sewerage. At the end of 2008, the
pilot had delivered overall 24% of the planned connections to water supply and 27% of the planned
number of connection to sanitation. In 2009, progress relied on increases in the number of
connections delivered in Meknès and Tangiers, as the pilot in Casablanca faced major challenges
stalling the connection delivery until the last quarter. In 2010, progress under the pilot jumped 46%
for connections to water supply and 37% for connections to sanitation, each operator delivering
record number of connections. Table 2 reflects implementation status and significant progress by
each operator towards achieving the Project’s development objective.

7.     Project ratings.

The performance of the Recipients, in particular the three implementing operators is satisfactory:
The project is rated Satisfactory for Progress towards achievement of PDO, Overall Implementation
Progress, Project Management, Counterpart Funding, Monitoring and Evaluation and Safeguards.

The Procurement rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

Financial management (FM) rating is Moderately Satisfactory. Audits reports acceptable to the
Bank have been received from all three operators, delayed receipts of the same justify the rating.

C. Proposed Changes

8.      The only proposed change is the extension of the closing date of the Project by 12 months
from its current closing date of December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. The extension is
necessary to allow the full utilization of the Grant’s proceeds to LYDEC, as reflected in their Action
Plan submitted together with their request for extension letter (see Annex 2). The proposed
extension will also give ample time to process remaining disbursements to Amendis-Tanger and
RADEM, which committed their subsidy amount in full in the second and third quarters of 2010,
respectively. The proposed change does not impact the Project performance indicators, which
remain the same.

D. Appraisal Summary

9.      The changes described above do not have a significant impact on the original economic,
financial, technical, institutional or safeguards aspects of the project. The Project’s development
objective remains achievable. The proposed extension would give additional time to provide
subsidized access to services to about 1,870 poor households in the Greater Casablanca area, which
the remaining subsidy can allow connecting under the project.

10.     The portions of the Grant allocated to Amendis-Tanger and to RADEM were fully
committed on the basis of the connections realized during the second quarter and the fourth quarter
of 2010, respectively. As such, Amendis-Tanger and RADEM delivered in accordance with the
action plans they provided in support of the first request for extension.

11.     In the case of LYDEC, land acquisition issues and works under the responsibility of third
parties - independent of LYDEC - translated into delays of over a year in the implementation
schedule. A solution was finally found allowing LYDEC to resume connection of beneficiary
households in the last quarter of 2009. Since then, LYDEC realized record numbers of connections
each quarter, allowing the number of connections to jump from 1,205 connections by the end of
September 2009 (21% completion) to 3,893 connections by the end of September 2010 (67%
completion). According to the projections provided by LYDEC through its Action Plan, the portion
of the Grant proceeds allocated to the Greater Casablanca pilot will be fully committed on the basis
of the number of connections made by the end of the first quarter of 2011 and will be fully
disbursed before the proposed revised closing date.

12.    In light of the situation in the three cities, the Bank’s team considers that the proposed
extension of the closing date would allow the full utilization of the Grant proceeds during the
requested extension.

                       Demande de prolongation d’un an pour la réalisation
                     des pilotes prévus dans l’accord de don du 29 janvier 2007

                                                   Plan d’action


La présente note a pour objet de solliciter auprès de la Banque Mondiale le report de la date de
clôture du GPOBA du 31 décembre 2010 au 31 décembre 2011.

Par un accord de don signé le 29 janvier 2007, le Royaume du Maroc, la Banque Mondiale et
LYDEC ont initié un partenariat basé sur les résultats (GPOBA) visant à favoriser l’accès aux
services d’eau et d’assainissement dans trois quartiers périurbains défavorisés de la région du
Grand Casablanca: Lahraouiyine Nord, Lemkansa Nord et Lemkansa Sud.

Le 28 octobre 2008, suite à la demande de LYDEC, la Banque Mondiale a donné son accord pour
incorporer dans le pilote OBA les opérations d’extension des services dans 3 nouveaux quartiers :
Hamadate, Lahfari et Mekkzaz.

Conformément aux dispositions de cet accord, et suite à l’accord de prolongation accordé par la
Banque mondiale le 30 décembre 2009, le montant de la subvention alloué à la LYDEC doit
bénéficier aux ménages raccordés aux services de l’eau potable et de l’assainissement des eaux
usées d’ici le 31 décembre 2010.

Après plus d’un an de travail avec toutes les parties prenantes, nous avons le regret de constater
que des difficultés et des blocages exogènes à LYDEC et à la démarche OBA persistent et ne
permettront pas à LYDEC de pouvoir présenter un nombre de raccordements suffisants pour
permettre d’engager la totalité du Don du GPOBA prévus par le pilote pour le Grand Casablanca.

Selon la projection des raccordements communiquée ci jointe, environ 5.000 raccordements seront
réalisés au 31 décembre 2010, permettant d’engager 77% du montant total de subvention 1. Pour
permettre l’engagement et le décaissement de l’intégralité de la subvention allouée dans le cadre
du pilote, il est nécessaire de prolonger le délai prévisionnel d’une année supplémentaire soit un
report jusqu’au 31 décembre 2011.

En complément des rapports d’avancement trimestriel transmis pendant l’année 2010, cette note
présente le plan d’action (situation à novembre 2010 et projections au 31 décembre 2011) par

1
  La subvention étant décaissée en Dirhams Marocains et le montant de la subvention allouée au pilote OBA du Grand
Casablanca étant en Dollars Américains, le nombre de raccordements pouvant bénéficier de subventions est assujetti
aux variations du taux de change. Le taux de change en vigueur lors de la préparation permettait de subventionner 6.218
raccordements, le taux de change en vigueur au 30 novembre 2010 ne permet d’en subventionner que 5.763.

opération du pilote pour le décaissement de l’intégralité de la subvention allouée d’ici le 31
décembre 2011.
A - Opération Lahraouiyine Nord :

L’opération d’accès à l’eau potable et à l’assainissement des habitants du quartier de Lahraouiyine
Nord a démarré début 2007 avec une estimation de raccordement de 5.600 foyers. Une première
tranche de l’opération desservant 600 foyers est terminée depuis 2008.

La réalisation des tranches suivantes est conditionnée par l’achèvement par la société Al Omrane
des réseaux structurants et de la station de refoulement des eaux usées et pluviales. Les travaux à
la charge de LYDEC dans le cadre du projet INDH-INMAE sont par conséquent suspendus depuis
août 2008 en attente de la finalisation des travaux à la charge de notre partenaire Al Omrane.

Relevant initialement de la Commune Rurale de Lahraouiyine (Province de Médiouna), le quartier
de Lahraouiyine Nord est intégré en 2009, dans le cadre d’un découpage administratif, au
périmètre urbain de la Ville de Casablanca (Arrondissement de Sidi Othmane, Préfecture de
Moulay Rachid).

La prise en main, dès le mois de mars 2009, par la Préfecture de Moulay Rachid a été suivie de
décisions et d’actions immédiates ayant permis la relance de l’opération avec notamment le
traitement de la problématique foncière qui bloquait la réalisation par la société Al Omrane des
ouvrages de hors site assainissement (cf. rapport d’avancement trimestriel n°11)

Malgré cette dynamique, les travaux hors site à la charge d’Al Omrane se sont poursuivis toute
l’année 2010, avec un achèvement prévu en décembre 2010.

Les travaux in site des tranches 2 à 8, à la charge de LYDEC, ne devraient être repris qu’en début
d’année 2011 avec des premières connections prévues mi 2011.

Il est à souligner que ces dates prévisionnelles sont conditionnées par les deux points suivants :

        La signature de l’avenant à la convention spécifique faisant état entre autre des
         financements complémentaires de l’opération suite au resencement de 2010 (cf. ci-
         après) ;

        La finalisation de la restructuration engagée par la Préfecture de Moulay Rachid avec
         l’Agence Urbaine de Casablanca.

Le recensement de l’opération Lahraouiyine Nord effectué par la Préfecture de Moulay Rachid
s’est achevé le 25 juin 2010 avec les résultats suivants :

        Recensement 2005 :5.580 foyers ;

        Recensement 2010 : 9.980 foyers (soit une augmentation de 79% du nombre de foyers
         par rapport au chiffre de 2005 à l’intérieur du périmètre de l’opération).

Les conséquences du nouveau recensement sont les suivantes :

        La reprise des études pour les adapter à la nouvelle situation ;




                                                 10
              La prise en comte d’un montant prévisionnel d’investissement de 135 MDHTTC 2 au lieu
               86 MDHTTC auparavant ;

              Le déficit de financement estimé à 60 MDH au lieu de 35 MDH auparavant ;

              La signature d’un avenant à la convention spécifique de l’opération précisant les
               financements complémentaires et la participation d’Al Omrane.

Il est à noter que, compte tenu du retard pris par l’opération, le don prévu ne bénéficiera
vraisemblablement pas aux ménages situés à Lahraouiyine Nord, puisqu’il sera décaissé
intégralement sur la base des raccordements réalisés dans les autres quartiers éligibles (cf.
projections 2010/2011 en annexe de cette note).

                                                      ----oooo----

B - Opération Lamkensa Nord :

L’objectif de l’opération est de donner l’accès aux services à domicile en eau et en assainissement
des eaux usées pour environ 5.137 foyers. Au 30 octobre 2010, les autorités ont validé l’extension
des services à 60% des foyers de ce quartier. Cette validation se traduit par une vérification en
commission des listes de foyers bénéficiaires recensées en présence des Autorités locales (Elus
d’Arrondissement et Services de la préfecture) pour approbation (Arrondissement) et validation
(Préfecture).

Les travaux de l’opération Lamkensa Nord ont débuté en janvier 2007, par tranches successives,
jusqu’à la dernière lancée en août 2008 et achevée en fin d’année 2009. Les réseaux structurants,
les dessertes et les branchements individuels (eau et assainissement) sont réalisés à 100 %.

      L’opération est divisée en quatre tranches :

             Une première tranche comprenant : 345 foyers, séparés en deux blocs distincts (3 bloc B,
              et 5 bloc A) : 302 compteurs posés. Opération achevée depuis le deuxième trimestre 2008 ;

             Une seconde tranche (Lamkensa 5 bloc B1), ciblant 227 foyers, dont les travaux de
              desserte ont débuté mi-août 2007 et se sont achevés fin avril 2008 ; 179 compteurs posés ;

             Une troisième tranche comprenant la réalisation de 4.700 ml de conduites eau potable
              (réseaux Hors site et réseaux structurants) et d’un surpresseur qui bénéficiera à l’ensemble
              des foyers de Lamkensa Nord ;

             Une quatrième tranche divisée en 8 lots comprenant la connection au réseau d’eau et
              d’assainissement de 4.565 foyers.

En mars 2009, avec le nouveau découpage administratif, l’opération Lamkensa Nord a été
transférée de la Province de Nouaceur vers la Préfecture de Aïn Chock. Ce changement a
impliqué une intégration de Lamkensa Nord dans le périmètre urbain de la Ville de Casablanca. La
prise en main dès le mois d’avril 2009 par la Préfecture de Aïn Chock, a été suivie des décisions
suivantes :

              La révision du dossier d’origine impliquant une opération de restructuration ;

2
    Estimation sommaire en attente de l’achèvement des études définitives

                                                            11
            La suspension des travaux en mars 2009.

Suite à la signature du Procès Verbal du 23 novembre 2009, en présence de toutes les parties
prenantes (Commune Urbaine de Casablanca / Préfecture d’Aïn Chock / Arrondissement d’Aïn
Chock / LYDEC), les travaux ont pu reprendre et le processus de validation des listes des
bénéficiaires a été acté et la formation d’une commission multipartite (Préfectures, élus
communaux, autorité locale, LYDEC) a été décidée. Le travail d’analyse de la commission a
officiellement démarré en février 2010. La commission prévoit d’achever sa mission au premier
semestre de l’année 2011.

Selon les prévisions d’adhésion des bénéficiaires et de validation/approbation par les Autorités, les
raccordements pouvant bénéficier d’une subvention OBA permettront de décaisser 60% de la
subvention unitaire au 1er semestre 2011 et le reliquat de 40% au 2ème semestre 2011.

                                                ----oooo----

C - Opération Lamkensa Sud :

L’opération Lamkensa Sud compte 2.185 foyers selon le dernier recensement réalisé par LYDEC
en décembre 2008, 70 % des foyers sont validés par les Autorités.

L’opération est divisée en 3 tranches :

            Une première tranche comprenant la réalisation d’un réseau in site pour 500 foyers, avec
             400 compteurs posés, opération achevée depuis 2008

            Tranche 2 : travaux achevés en 2010 (hors site assainissement)

            Tranche 3 : réalisation des réseaux in site eau potable et assainissement permettant le
             raccordement de 1.731 foyers divisés en 2 lots :

         -    Lot n°1 : travaux en cours durée de réalisation 8 mois : juin à janvier 2011.

         -    Lot n°2 : travaux achevés, poses compteurs en cours.

Du mois de juin 2010 au mois de septembre 2010, plusieurs réunions avec les Autorités ont fait
état de difficultés d’ordre administratif pour la validation des listes de foyers bénéficiaires. Cette
situation à présent résolue, les abonnements et les poses compteurs ont repris dans ce quartier
depuis le mois d’octobre 2010.

Selon les prévisions d’adhésion des bénéficiaires et de validation/approbation par les Autorités, les
raccordements pouvant bénéficier d’une subvention OBA permettront de décaisser 60% de la
subvention unitaire au 1er semestre 2011 et le reliquat de 40% au 2ème semestre 2011.

                                                ----oooo----

D - Les nouveaux douars incorporés à la revue à mi parcours (accord du 28 octobre 2008) :

D.1 - Opération Hamadate :

255 foyers recensés, 208 foyers validés par l’Autorité.


                                                    12
Les travaux sont en cours de finalisation et les poses compteurs en cours sur les zones
réceptionnées.

Il est à noter que, suite à un litige administratif avec l’entreprise sous traitante, les travaux de cette
opération ont été arrêtés de juin 2010 à octobre 2010, avant l’achèvement total des raccordements
à l’assainissement (cf. rapport trimestriel n°15). Ce contre temps n’a pas permis de respecter le
planning initial prévoyant de connecter l’ensemble des foyers avant le 4ème trimestre 2010.

Selon les prévisions d’adhésion des bénéficiaires et de validation/approbation par les Autorités, les
raccordements pouvant bénéficier d’une subvention OBA permettront de décaisser 60% de la
subvention unitaire au 1er semestre 2011 et le reliquat de 40% au 2ème semestre 2011.

D.2 - Opération Lahfari :

568 foyers recensés, 457 foyers validés par l’Autorités

De nombreuses problématiques liées au foncier n’ont pas permis d’achever les travaux dans les
délais prévus initialement (cf. rapports trimestriels n°10 & 11). La nécessité de modifier les projets
techniques d’origine et d’intégrer la réalisation d’une station de relevage a reporté d’un an le délai
prévisionnel de finalisation des travaux.

Les poses compteurs seront projetées au 3ème trimestre 2011, vraisemblablement après que
l’intégralité de la subvention du GPOBA ait été engagée. En conséquence, seuls 81
raccordements pourront bénéficier d’une subvention OBA permettant de décaisser 60% de la
subvention unitaire au 1er semestre 2011 et le reliquat de 40 % au 2ème semestre 2011.

D.3 - Opération Mekkzaz :

538 foyers recensés, 384 foyers validés.

Les travaux sont achevés sur une partie de Mekkzaz avec des foyers déjà connectés (98
compteurs). Les autres poses compteurs sont projetées au fur et à mesure de l’avancement des
travaux conformément aux informations communiquées dans le rapport trimestriel n°15. Ce retard
sur le planning initial s’explique par un arrêt des travaux d’environ 5 mois pendant les inondations
de l’hiver 2009/2010 entraînant des dégâts importants en particulier pour la réalisation de la fosse
septique (cf. rapport trimestriel n°13).

Selon les prévisions d’adhésion des bénéficiaires et de validation/approbation par les Autorités, les
raccordements pouvant bénéficier d’un subvention OBA permettront de décaisser 60% de la
subvention unitaire au 1er semestre 2011 et le reliquat de 40% au 2ème semestre 2011.

                                               ----oooo----

E – Annexe :

Les projections de raccordement communiquées ci-jointes en annexe indiquent l’engagement de
l’intégralité de la subvention OBA en 2011 et son décaissement à 100% d’ici le 31 décembre 2011.
Une année supplémentaire est donc indispensable pour une utilisation de la totalité du don alloué.

                 Request for a one-year extension to allow completion of the pilot
                  Implemented per the Grant Agreement dated January 29 2007

                                                  Action plan


This object of this document is to request the World Bank to extend the closing date of the Grant
Agreement from December 31st, 2010 until December 31st, 2011.

By a Grant Agreement signed January 29th, 2007, the Kingdom of Morocco, the World Bank and
LYDEC introduced an Output Based Aid (OBA) approach aiming at promoting access to water and
sanitation services in three poor periurban districts of the Greater Casablanca area, namely
Lahraouiyine Nord, Lemkansa Nord and Lemkansa Sud.

On October 28th, 2008, at the request of LYDEC, the World Bank agreed to incorporate into the
OBA pilot the operations of service extension in 3 new districts: Hamadate, Lahfari and Mekkzaz.

According to the provisions of the aforementioned Grant Agreement, and further to the extension of
the closing date granted by the World Bank on December 30th, 2009, the amount of subsidy
allocated to LYDEC has to benefit households connected to water and sanitation services before
December 31st, 2010.

After more than one year working with all stakeholders, we regret to report that difficulties and
obstacles exogenous to LYDEC and to the OBA approach persist, which have prevented LYDEC
to deliver a high enough number of connections to allow committing the whole GPOBA Grant
allocated to Greater Casablanca.

According to the attached projection of connections, approximately 5.000 connections will be
realized by December 31st, 2010, allowing committing 77 % of the subsidy amount 3. In order to
allow the commitment and the disbursement of the entire subsidy about allocated within the
framework of the pilot, an extension of one additional year until December 31st, 2011 is necessary.

Besides the quarterly progress reports submitted during the year 2010, this document presents the
Action Plan prepared by LYDEC to ensure the disbursement of the entire amount of allocated
subsidy before December 31st, 2011. This action plan was prepared on the basis of the situation in
November, 2010 and of projections until December 31st, 2011, for each district-wide service
extension operation carried out under this OBA pilot.


3
 The subsidy is disbursed in Moroccan Dirhams (MAD), while the amount of subsidy allocated to the OBA pilot of
Greater Casablanca is in USD. The number of connections which can benefit from subsidies is thus subjected to the
variations of the USD/MAD exchange rate. During the pilot preparation, the exchange rate allowed to subsidize 6,218
connections. As of November 30th, 2010, it only allows to subsidize 5,763 connections.

                                                        15
A - Operation to extend services in the “Lahraouiyine Nord? district:

The operation to extend water supply and sanitation services to residents of the Lahraouiyine
North district started at the beginning of 2007. The number of households to connect was
estimated at 5,600. A first tranche of the operation was carried out in 2008 and allow connecting
600 households to the services.

Carrying out the following tranches is conditioned by the prior completion by the company “Al
Omrane? of the structuring networks and a pumping station of wastewater and pluvial water. The
works under the responsibility of LYDEC with respect to the INDH-INMAE project in this district are
consequently suspended since August, 2008 as they await completion of the works under the
responsibility of our partner “Al Omrane?.

At the beginning of pilot implementation, the district of Lahraouiyine Nord belonged to the rural
district of Lahraouiyine (Province of “Médiouna?). In 2009, within the framework of an administrative
apportionment, it was integrated into the urban perimeter of the City of Casablanca (District of “Sidi
Othmane?, Prefecture of “Moulay Rachid?).

The handling of the situation, from March 2009, by the Prefecture of Moulay Rachid was followed
by immediate decisions and actions, which allowed the restart of the operation. It led, in particular,
to finding a solution to the land acquisition issue which blocked the completion by the company “Al
Omrane? of the offsite works they were responsible for (cf. quarterly progress report n°11).

Nevertheless, the offsite works under the responsibility of “Al Omrane? continued throughout 2010,
with a completion planned in December, 2010.

The in site works of tranches 2 to 8, under the responsibility of LYDEC, should resume only at the
beginning of 2011 with first connections planned mid 2011.

It is important to underline that these projected dates are conditioned by two major elements:

       •   The signature of the amendment to the specific agreement stating, among other things,
           additional financing necessary to complete the operation, following the 2010 households
           census (cf. below);

       •   The finalization of the restructuring started by the Prefecture of “Moulay Rachid? together
           with the Urban Agency of Casablanca.

Besides, the households’ census of the Lahraouiyine Nord operation carried out by the Prefecture
of “Moulay Rachid? ended on June 25th, 2010 with the following results:

       •   Households Census as of 2005: 5,580 households

       •   Households Census as of 2005: 9,980 households (a 79 % increase compared to number
           of households living in 2005 in the “Lahraouiyine Nord? operation perimeter).

The consequences of the new census are the following ones:

       -        Need to revise the studies to update them based on the new situation;

       -        Increase of the projected investment levels from MAD86 million to MAD135 million 4;

4
    Rough estimates while the studies are getting finalized

                                                              16
   -   The financing deficit estimated at MAD60 million instead of MAD35 million according to
       original estimates;

   -   The signature of an amendment to the specific agreement of the operation specifying
       additional financing and Al Omrane's funding level.

It is important to underline that, considering the delay, the GPOBA Grant will most likely not benefit
households located in “Lahraouiyine Nord? area, because it will be used up entirely on connections
realized sooner in the other eligible districts (cf. 2010/2011 projections in appendix to this note).

B - Operation to extend services in the “Lamkensa Nord? district:

The objective of this operation is to provide access to water and sanitation services through house
connections to approximately 5,137 households. As of October 30th, 2010, the local authorities
validated the extension of the services to 60 % of the households located in this district. This
validation consists in a review of the lists of beneficiary households in a commission gathering the
local authorities (Elected officials by District and Services of the prefecture) for approval (District)
and validation (Prefecture).

The works of the operation in “Lamkensa Nord? began in January, 2007, in successive tranches.
The last tranche started in August, 2008 and was completed towards the end of 2009. The offsite
structuring networks, the in site distribution networks and the house connections (water and
sanitation) are 100 % complete.

The operation is divided into four tranches:

      A first tranche consisted of 345 households organized in two different blocks (3 block B,
       and 5 block A): 302 meters were installed. This first tranche was completed during the
       second quarter of 2008.

      A second tranche (Lamkensa 5 block B1), targeting 227 households, began in the middle of
       August 2007 and ended in April, 2008; 179 meters were installed.

      A third tranche consists of laying a pipeline of 4,700 linear meters for drinking water supply
       (structuring off-site network) and building a pressure booster facility, which will benefit to all
       the households of “Lamkensa Nord?.

      The fourth tranche divided into 8 sub-areas consists of connecting 4.565 households to
       water and sanitation services.

In March, 2009, with the new administrative apportionment, Lamkensa Nord was transferred from
the Province of Nouaceur to the Prefecture of Aïn Chock. This change implied an integration of
“Lamkensa Nord? in the urban perimeter of the City of Casablanca. The transfer from April 2009 by
the Prefecture of Aïn Chock, was followed by the following decisions:

   -        A return to the original plan involving restructuring the district;

   -        The suspension of the works from March, 2009 until November, 2009.



                                                    17
Following the signature of the November 23rd, 2009 report, in the presence of all stakeholders
(Urban district of Casablanca / Prefecture of Aïn Chock / District of Aïn Chock / LYDEC), the works
could start again. This report clarified the process of validation of the lists of beneficiaries and
decided that a commission gathering representatives of the Prefecture, elected officials, local
authority and LYDEC. The commission started its work officially in February, 2010. The
commission plans to finish its mission during the first semester of 2011.

According to the forecasts of demand for connections by beneficiary households and of validation /
approval by the Authorities, the connections which will benefit from an OBA subsidy will allow
disbursing 60% of the unit subsidy per connection during the first semester of 2011, while the
remaining 40 % would be disbursed during the second semester of 2011.

C - Operation to extend services in the “Lamkensa Sud? district:

The operation in “Lamkensa Sud? counts 2,185 households according to the last census realized
by LYDEC in December, 2008. 70 % of households are validated by the Authorities.

The operation is divided in four tranches:

   •   A first tranche consists in developing an in-site distribution network to serve 500
       households, with 400 meters installed. This operation was completed since 2008

   •   Tranche 2: the works were completed in 2010 (off-site sanitation)

   •   Tranche 3: realization of in-site networks drinking water and sanitation allowing connecting
       of 1,731 households divided into 2 lots:

       -   The lot n°1: the current works lasted 8 months from June 2010 to January, 2011;

       -   The lot n°2: the works are completed. Meters are being installed.

Between June 2010 and September 2010, several meetings with the Authorities took place, which
stated administrative difficulties with respect to the validation of the lists of beneficiary households.
This situation is at present resolved, subscriptions and installed meters started again in this district
since October 2010.

According to the forecasts of beneficiaries’ uptake and validation / approval by the Authorities,
connections which can benefit from an OBA subsidy will allow disbursing 60% of the unit subsidy
per connection during the first semester of 2011, while the remaining 40 % would be disbursed
during the second semester of 2011.

                                              ----oooo----

D - Operation to extend services in the new districts incorporated at the mid-term review
(agreement of October 28, 2008):

D.1 - Operation to extend services in the “Hamadate? district:

255 households identified, 208 households validated by the Authority.

The works are being finalized and meters are currently being installed.

                                                   18
It is important to underline that, following an administrative dispute with the subcontracting
company, the works for this operation were stopped between June, 2010 and October, 2010,
before the total completion of connections to sanitation. (cf. quarterly report n°15). This challenged
the initial schedule to connect all households before the fourth quarter of 2010.

According to the forecasts of beneficiary uptake and validation / approval of lists by the Authorities,
connections which can benefit from an OBA subsidy will allow disbursing 60% of the unit subsidy
per connection during the first semester of 2011, while the remaining 40 % would be disbursed
during the second semester of 2011.

D.2 - Operation to extend services in the “Lahfari? district:

568 households identified. 457 households validated by Authorities.

Numerous issues linked to land acquisition prevented completing the works in accordance with
initially timing (cf. quarterly report n°10 and 11). The need to modify original technical projects and
to integrate the construction of a pumping station delayed by one year the projected deadline of
finalization of the works.

The installations of meters are expected to start during the third quarter of 2011 most likely after
the GPOBA Grant will be fully committed. Consequently, only 81 connections will benefit from the
OBA subsidy. Disbursement of 60% of the unit subsidy per connection is expected during the first
semester of 2011, while the remaining 40 % would be disbursed during the second semester of
2011.

D.3 - Operation to extend services in the “Mekkzaz? district:

538 households identified, 384 validated households.

The works are completed in a part of the “Mekkzaz? district, which allowed connecting 98
households (98 meters installed). Further meters will be installed on the basis of the progress of
the works, as indicated in the quarterly report n°15. The floods which took place during the winter
2009/2010 generated important damages. They stalled the works for about five months, in
particular the construction of the septic tank. (cf. quarterly report n°13).

According to the forecasts of beneficiary uptake and validation / approval of lists by the Authorities,
connections which can benefit from an OBA subsidy will allow disbursing 60% of the unit subsidy
per connection during the first semester of 2011, while the remaining 40 % would be disbursed
during the second semester of 2011.

                                             ----oooo----

E – Annex :

The attached connections projections (see appendix) indicate that the OBA subsidy is expected to
be fully committed in 2011 and to be 100% disbursed by December 31st, 2011. An additional year
is thus indispensable for a use of the totality of the allocated Grant.
