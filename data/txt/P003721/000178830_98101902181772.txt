INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A SECOND EDUCATION
PROJECT: AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$6.3
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a second education project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Indonesia so far has received seventeeri IDA credits for a total
amount of US$231.4 million.   A summary statement of IDA credits and IFC
investments is attached as Annex I.   In addition to the proposed credit,
I have recommended in my report (P-1021), distributed to thle Executive
Directors on February 9 (IDA/R/72-14), a credit equivalent to US$12.5 million
for a fourth irrigation rehabilitation project, which is scheduled for
consideration on February 22.   The Association's lending program reflects
the rehabilitation and development priorities established by the Government
and is described in paragraphs 2 to 5 of that report.  Credits experiencing
long delays in disbursement, as well as the overall disbursement rate of the
Indonesian lending program, are discussed in paragraphs 6 to 8 of the report.
Regarding the first education project (219-IND), project implementation is
significantly behind schedule because of problems in selecting and appointing
consultants by the Government.   Negotiations with consultants have not yet
been concluded, partly because of uncertainties resulting from the Government's
recent imposition of Indonesian income taxes upon foreign consultants and
contractors, but negotiations are expected to be completed shortly.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
3.        The latest Bank economic report on Indonesia (EAP-27a) dated
November 30, 1971, finds that Indonesia's economic progress continues to be
satisfactory.   The economic report's findings are summarized in my report
(P-1021) mentioned above.  Country data are presented in Annex II.
PART III - THE SECTOR
4.        The Indonesian economy is predominantly rural with agricultural
production contributing about 50 percent to the national product; about
70 percent of the labor force is engaged in agriculture.   Indonesia's First
Five-Year Plan (1969-1974) rightly gives highest priority to the agricultural
sector, with particular emphasis on rice production.  Opportunity exists for



- 2 -
considerable improvement in output of both food and export crops with the
aid of modern technology; the technical supporting services for agriculture
continue to be grossly inadequate, and agricultural education and training
facilities are lacking in efficiency and effectiveness.
5.        The Ministry of Education is primarily responsible for education
in Indonesia, including university level agricultural education.    However,
agricultural training is primarily within the Ministry of Agriculture, which
has five Directors General administering training programs independently from
one another.   This lack of coordination results in duplication of effort,
under-utilization of facilities and teachers and uneconomic small institutions.
It also affects adversely the administration of extension services and the
performance of the technical field staff.
6.        Total Government allocations to education and trainr,g in 1971/72
(April-March) are Rp 82 billion, or 16 percent of the Government's total
expenditure.   Of this amount, capital expenditure on education and training
amounted to Rp 9 billion and recurrent expenditure Rp 73 billion.    There is
a shortage of funds for teaching materials and for maintenance of equipment
and buildings;  almost 90% of recurrent expenditures are spent on teachers'
salaries.   In most schools very low student fees are levied to supplement
the inadequate teacher salaries and to pay for additional supplies of
teaching materials.   Total private expenditure on education is estimated at
about 20% of that of the Government.   External aid has assisted the Government
in implementing its programs for education planning, curriculum development,
selective staff recruitment and upgrading of training.    The Ministry of
Education, the recipient of moot .of this aid, received assistance in 1970/71
equivalent to about $6.8 million or 13 percent of its total expenditures.
A small amount of external aid was also extended for the development of
agricultural education and training.
7.        Preparatory to a fundamental reform of the education system, the
Government is conducting an intensive study with assistance from UNESC0 and
the Ford Fbundation, to assess education structure, organization and curricula,
and their relevance to the country's manpower requirements.   Until this study
is completed in 1973, the Association is assisting in the financing of only
those education projects whose priority is obvious and immediate.
8.        The first education project (Cr. 219-IND) dated November 6, 1970,
helped finance five technical training centers to assist in improving the
quality of technical secondary education.   During its appraisal it became
apparent that there was a prima facie case for assisting in the development
-of agricultural education.   However, agricultural items were not included in
the first project because of the unsatisfactory organization for training within
*the Ministry of Agriculture and because of insufficient information on existing



- 3 -
agricultural training programs and institutions.  Instead, a study of middle-
level agricultural training in Indonesia was made by FAO from October 1970 to
April 1971 to provide information on programs and institutions and to recommend
appropriate measures to improve the efficiency of agricultural training.  The
Ministry of Agriculture's training program is sizeable in absolute terms but
small in comparison with the Government's overall edacation program.  In
terms of its own budget, the Ministry in 1971/72 allocated only 10 percent
of its recurrent funds and 4 percent of its capital funds to training.
9.        From the FAO study it has become clear that to promote agricultural
development training programs must be upgraded and expanded for (a) the
agricultural labor force at large and (b) employees of the Ministry of Agri-
culture.   Based upon the FAO study's recommendations,the Government has
formulated a two-phase strategy to improve its agricultural training capacity.
The first phase comprises measures needed (a) to upgrade the administrative
and technical staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and (b) to upgrade and
expand selected training institutions for which it is responsible, consistent
with manpower needs.   The second phase comprises measures needed to (a)
reorganize extension services into one integrated service and (b) to improve
the Ministry's system for introducing modern techniques to the agricultural
labor force.   The first phase can now be implemented with the aid of the
proposed IDA credit; the second phase will require further study before
implementation and is under review by the IBRD Resident Staff in Djakarta.
The implementation of the first phase of the strategy for agricultural
education development would incur yearly recurrent expenditures of about
Rp 560 million by 1975, which is double the funds now allocated for the purpose.
The Government will provide the additional recurrent annual funds required,
about Rp 290 million.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
10.       The proposed project will assist the Ministry of Agriculture in
centralizing the planning, management and operation of agricultural education
and training, and upgrading and expanding selected middle-level agricultural
training institations to meet the most pressing in-service training needs of
the Government's agricultural staff and the most urgent manpower needs of the
agricultural sector.   It entails investment in education facilities throughout
the country, reflecting the growing importance attached by the Government to
regioaal balance in Indonesia's development (see map attached).  The project
consists of: (a) the establishment, in the Ministry of Agriculture, of an
Agency for Agricultural Education and Training and a Project Implementation
Unit; (b) the rehabilitation, expansion and equipping of 13 in-service training
centers and a training institute; (c) the construction and equipping of two
new agricultural secondary schools and the rehabilitation, expansion and
equipping of twelve agricultural secondary schools; (d) the construction of



one and equipping of two forestry technician training centers; and (e)
technical assistance, including the provision of specialists' services and
fellowships for selected local staff (see Annex III).
11.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $12.3 million,
including a foreign exchange component of $6.3 million (approximately 51
percent of the total cost).   This estimate includes adjustments in prIces
to reflect recent changes in foreign exchange rates.   The proposed credit
would cover all the foreign exchange cost, and the Goverrnment would meet the
local cost of the project, estimated at $6.0 milli on.  The project institutions
are dispersed over a large area, and in most instances construction works
involved are small and, cosist of relatively minor extensions.   All civil
works contracts would be open to international competitive bidding.    Fbr
larger institutions whose construction costs are estimated to exceed yS$200,000
invitations to bid would be advertised internationally.   For smaller construction
works, not likely to attract foreign bidders, international advvep4isement would
not be required., but foreign firms may bid.
-12.      !quipment and furniture would be procured after intern4tioonpal com-
petitive bidding. Local xianufacturers would be allowed a margin of preference
of 15 percent or the actual custons duty payable by non-exempt importers,
whichever is lower. The type of equipment required for the project - largely
laboratory, teaching and farm field equipment - is not manufactured in
Indonesia, and contracts for equipment are thus not expected to be won by
local bidders. Most of the contracts for the supply of furniture, however,
are expected to be awarded to local manufacturers.
13.       The Association would disburse against the c.i.f. cost,of directly
imported goods and the foreign exchange cost of specialists' senyices and
fellowships.   It would disburse 42 percent of the estimated cqot,,of civil
works and 17 percent of the cost of locally produced furniture, both representing
the estimated foreign exchange component.
14.       A project implementation unit would be established in the Ministry of
Agriculture and would be responsible for supervision of project implementation,
for coordination with relevant Ministries and other parties involved in the
iproject, and for liaison with the Association.   The establishment of the
,project unit would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
The project unit would include on a fulltime basis a project director - who
would report to the executive secretary of the Agency for Agricultural Education
and T'raining - and an architect;  the appointment of the project director and
;architect would be a condition of effectiveness.   The unit would also employ
,an accountant and a procurement officer who would be appointed according to a
timetable acceptable to the Association.    The unit would be provided with
iadequate facilities and appropriate staff.



15.       A central feature of the project will be the establishment of
the Agency for Agricultural Education and Training in the Ministry of
Agriculture.   The Agency will be responsible for the management and operation
of all the Ministry's training programs and will carry out the rationalization
of these programs.   It will identify and rank agricultural training priorities,
will develop and implement agricultural training plans in liaison with the
DLrectorates of the Ministry and with other appropriate agencies.   It will
set standards of accreditation for the provincial and private agricultural
schools. The Agency, established at the fLrectorate-General level, will
consist of a Chairman, an Ebcecutive Secretary and Secretariat, and an Advisory
Board consisting of representatives of the government organizations concerned.
Decrees establishing the Agency were agreed with the Government during
negotiation and are expected to be signed not later than February 18.    The
Agency is to be fully staffed and operational within six months of the signing
of the proposed credit.   The transfer of responsibility for operating and
managing the agricultural education and training institutions from the various
Directorates-General of the Ministry of Agriculture to the new Agency will be
gradual and only be completed by April 1, 1975.   This date is just under a
year before the project institutions become operational and will allow time
for the Agency properly to train its staff and plan its operations.    The
proposed credit would finance furniture, equipment and technical assistance
needed by the Agency.
16.       In addition, all middle-level in-service training will be consolidated
into 13 existing centers which will be renovated, expanded and re-equipped.
The Agricultural Training Institute at Tjiawi, which offers in-service training
courses to senior staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, will be renovated and
re-equipped and will have laboratories and workshops added, enabling the
Institute to offer programs for training agricultural secondary school teachers.
Newly constructed and equipped laboratories, workshops and farm buildings will
be provided at two new and 12 existing national agricultural senior secondary
schools, enabling their curricula to be reoriented towards practical training.
For the more specialised requirements of forestry, a new technician training
center will beconstructed at Samarinda, in addition to another already under
construction.
17.       The project would provide for eight specialists for combined total
of 24 man years, to assist the Agency for Agricultural Education and Training
in: (a) planning and coordinating national agricultural education and training
and supervising such activities t the provincial and private levels; (b)
organizing and assisting in the initial operation of the in-service training
centers; (c) improving the agricultural teacher training program by including
agricultural technology and more modern science; (d) introducing the new
curriculum in the agricultural senior secondary schools; and (e) developing
the curriculum for the forestry training center and ass'sting in its initial
operation.



- 6 -
18.       The project would include fellowships for training amounting to
28 man-years. Of these, 8 man-years would be for overseas training of
selected local staff who upon their return would be qualified to become
counterparts to the above-mentioned specialists. The remaining 20 years
of fellowships would be for training and orientation of selected staff
of the project institutions.
19.       With respect to the qualifications and salaries of the staff
teaching at the project institutions, the Government assured the Association
during negotiations that as from 1975 the qualifications for new teaching
staff would be a university degree in agriculture and a course in pedagogy,
and that salary supplements would be provided to ensure the full-time
availability of teaching staff of the project institutions when the new
facilities become operational.
20.       The project will provide the institutional and tecxip4ac  basis
for expanding and improving agricultural training and, in particular, will
help to upgrade the skills of Government agricultural staff and increase
the supply of agricultural middle-level manpower in support of the Govern-
ment' s agricultural development program.
PART V - LGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
21.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and
the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distri-
buted to the Erecutive Directors separately. The draft Development Credit
Agreement conforms substantially to the pattern of agreements for agricultural
education projects.
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PARI! VI - RECOMMENDATION
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Development
Credit.
