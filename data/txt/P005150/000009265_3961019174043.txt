STRUCTJURAL ADUSTMFNT LOAN
(LOAN 3353-EGT)
Preface
The Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) to Egypt, in the amount of US$300 million
equivalent was approved by the Board on June 21, 1991, and declared effective on February 20,
1992.
The first tranche of the loan (US$150 million equivalent) was fully disbursed by
August 17, 1992. The release of the second tranche was approved by the Executive Directors in
March 1993. However, at the Government's request, the loan balance of US$150 million equivalent
was canceled because of the improved balance of payments position in October 1993. The loan
was closed on June 30, 1994. Cofinancing was provided by the African Development Bank
(US$130 million equivalent in two tranches) and the European Economic Community ($100
million linked to the second tranche).
This ICR was prepared by Alberto R. Musalem and Christian Petersen from the
Country Operations Division of the Middle East and North Africa Region (MN2CO) and reviewed
by Adil Kanaan, William Tyler and Gianni Brizzi. The main report is followed by a Statistical
Annex. The Borrower's comments were solicited, however none were provided by the time this
report was issued.
Satisfactory performance under the SAL led to the preparation, jointly with the
Govermnent and the Fund, of a second phase of the Government's Economic Reforn and
Structural Adjustment Program (ERSAP). The original intention was to support this second
phase with a second SAL, to again complement the IMF's financial assistance. The improved
balance of payments and reserve position, however, precluded the need for the financial support
afforded by a second SAL. Instead, a Structural Adjustment Monitoring Program (SAMP) was
devised to provide the technical support to the Government for its reform program but without
financial support.
The preparation of this ICR was deferred because of the intention to include an analysis
of the SAMP as well. The SAMP began in the second half of 1993 and was originally scheduled
for completion by December 1995. However, delays in the implementation of the measures
covered under the SAMP have led to the decision to proceed with this ICR covering the SAL.
The Task Managers for the SAL were as follows:
John Wall                January 89 - June 90
William Tyler            July 90 - July 91
Alberto Musalem          July 91 - June 94 (loan closure)
For most of the period in question, Spiros Voyadzis was the managing Division Chief.

STRUCTIRAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
(LOAN 3353-EGT)
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Evaluation Summary
1.          Background. In the period 1952-90, Egypt pursued a largely public-sector-led,
inward-looking development strategy. High growth was achieved during the oil boom years.
However, this strategy led to less than optimal allocation of resources and large fiscal and current
account deficits, financed, in part, with foreign debt. In the second half of the 1980s, the
economy was hit hard by a number of external shocks. Oil export earnings, workers' remittances
and external financial assistance declined sharply. GDP growth declined to an average of about
2 percent p.a. during the second half of the 1980s, about the same as population growth. Total
external debt reached US$51 billion (144 percent of GDP) by FY90 with debt service obligations
equal to nearly 50 percent of foreign exchange earnings. Less than half of these obligations were
actually paid, and debt arrears increased to over US$ I billion (about one-third of GDP).
2.          Faced with such serious economic problems, the Government embarked on a
comprehensive adjustment program to deal with the macroeconomic disequilibria and structural
imbalances, and lay the foundations of renewed, sustainable economic growth.  The
Government's program was supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), which was
approved by the IMF Board on May 17, 1991, by the SAL, and by debt\debt service reduction
(DDSR) granted by Paris Club creditors and other bilateral donors.
3.          Loan Objectives. The objectives of the SAL were to help: (i) stabilize the
economy, achieve internal and external equilibrium, and liberalize the financial and foreign
exchange markets; (ii) restructure the economy and increase the efficiency of resource use
through price liberalization, decontrol of investment, a more outward orientation, and the
reshaping of the regulatory framework; and (iii) minimize any transitory adverse effects of the
reforms on the poor through improved social policies.
4.          Implementation Experience and Results. On balance, the overall implementation
of the SAL has been satisfactory. Regarding the stabilization program, the fiscal deficit as a
share of GDP was reduced from about 17 percent of GDP in FY90-91 to 2.5 percent in FY94.
Agreed targets were achieved for the rate of monetary expansion, the expansion of credit to the
public sector, and the size of public investment relative to GDP. Regarding the structural
adjustment program, the Government implemented major reforms during the period of the loan,
in some areas exceeding project objectives. Prices and interest rates were liberalized and
subsidies significantly reduced, particularly in energy. A sales tax was introduced. The foreign



iii                              Summary
exchange market was decontrolled and the exchange rate unified. Bank solvency and prudential
regulation were improved, and a market for treasury bills (TBs) was established. Several major
barriers to trade and private sector investment were removed.  After some delay, the
implementation of public enterprise (PE) reform began. Privatization of PEs was slower than
anticipated. While implementation of the PE reform and privatization components were less than
satisfactory, implementation of the other components of the SAL were highly satisfactory.
5.          The Government implemented other important structural reforms in addition to
the SAL supported program, such as liberalization of rural rents, and passage of the Capital
Market Law. In part, the overall success of the SAL was due to the fact that it was unusually
leveraged by the Paris Club's conditional DDSR. Through intensive supervision, the Bank
played a supportive role providing technical assistance on a continued basis to help with program
implementation. Finally, simultaneously with the SAL, IDA and cofinanciers supported a Social
Fund for Development (SFD) which helped provide a social safety net for those groups most
vulnerable to transitory effects of the reform.
6.          The release of the second tranche was approved by the Executive Directors in
March 1993. However, at the Government's request, the loan balance of US$150 million
equivalent was canceled because of the improved balance of payments position in October 1993.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1994.
7.          Summary of Findings. Future Operations. and Key Lessons Learned.  While
implementation of the economic stabilization component and some structural reform measures
has been highly satisfactory, implementation of other structural measures, particularly
privatization, has been rather hesitant. Partly as a reflection of this, private investments, imports
and non-oil exports have only recently started to respond to the reform measures (trade openness
-- exports plus imports to GDP ratio -- continuously fell from 73 percent in 1979/80 to 54 percent
in 1993/94). The reform program has not yet succeeded in reverting the long trend loss in
competitiveness, even though non-traditional exports seem to have picked up significantly in
1994/95. Although GDP performed better than anticipated, GDP per capita continued to decline
and unemployment has worsened.
8.          The SAL was followed by the Structural Adjustment Monitoring Program
(SAMP, a program that monitored performance of the structural reforms agreed to under the
IMF's Extended Fund Facility which followed the SBA, but which was not associated with a
Bank loan). The IMF arrangements had, as a prerequisite, that the implementation of the agreed
upon structural adjustment program be satisfactory to the Bank. The release of the three tranches
of the Paris Club DDSR was dependent upon satisfactory performance under the IMF
arrangements. The first tranche of the DDSR (15 percent of the present value of debt service)
was granted to Egypt in July 1991 following approval of the SBA and the SAL. The second
tranche (another 15 percent of the same base) was granted in October 1993 following the IMF
Board approval of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the Bank Management approval of the
SAMP. The third and final tranche (for 20 percent of the same base) was scheduled to have
taken place by end-June 1994, and was conditional on the IMF Board approving the first review



iv                               Summary
and the program for the second review of the EFF. Given the delay, the Paris Club decided to
request that Egypt, as of July 1, 1994, service the debt to their members according to the
schedule of completion of the second stage of the debt reduction agreement. This represented a
cost in debt servicing to Egypt of about $360 million p.a.
9.          The overall success of the program supported by the SAL was probably due to the
at least three factors -- timing, content, and assistance. The SAL came at a time when the
Government's reforms in support of private sector development and away from public sector were
well underway. The conditional DDSR provided by the Paris Club and the participation of the IMF
provided leverage and ensured program consistency. Furthermore, international events leading to
the global decline of centrally planned strategies and the ascendance of free market orientation
provided extra impetus to the Egyptian reforms.
10.         The magnitude of the macroeconomic imbalances and widespread distortions in
the incentive system warranted a comprehensive approach to reform. The Government realized
the need for strong action and demonstrated a commitment to implement such action. Finally,
the Government received very substantial assistance from the Bank and the donor community for
implementing its economic reform program.  The close working relationship with the
Government contributed to the satisfactory implementation of a very ambitious stabilization and
structural adjustment program.






I1SPLEMENTATIONCOMnPLETION REPORT
ARAR REpUBLIC OF IGYPT
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
(LOAN 3353-EGT)
Background
1.          During most of the four decades (1950-1990), Egypt pursued a largely public-
sector-led and inward-looking development strategy based on central ownership and a command
economy. High growth was achieved during the period of high relative oil prices, and social
conditions improved. As a result of this policy, public enterprises (PEs) and entities have played
a dominant role in the economy, and account for one of the largest shares of gross output and
employment among the developing countries. Even today, almost half of total GDP is still
produced by the public sector. The Open Door Policy, initiated in 1974, brought about a partial
liberalization of the economy. This development strategy, however, continued to be based on
import substitution, while exports of manufactures (excluding textile and clothing) remained
virtually stagnant.
2.          During the 1980s, the economy did not adjust well to the negative external shocks
(decline in oil prices and increase in interest rates). The resulting massive fiscal and current
account deficits led to unsustainable debt accumulation. By the second half of the 1 980s, Egypt
was no longer able to service its debts, triggering both a substantial reduction in capital inflows
and an accumulation of arrears, as a heavy external debt overhang became apparent. Growth
slowed to about 2.5 percent p.a. in the second half of the 1980s. Inflation accelerated to over 20
percent p.a. while the open unemployment rate rose rapidly from about 5 percent in the mid-
1970s to more than 10 percent by 1990.
3.          By 1990, the Government launched an economic reform and structural adjustment
program (ERSAP) whose ultimate goal was to sustain economic growth and improve the
country's living standards. The program focused on three areas: (a) stabilization to restore
macroeconomic balance and reduce inflation; (b) structural adjustment to stimulate medium- and
long-term growth; and (c) modifications in current social policies to minimize the transitory
effects of economic reforms on the poor. The measures encompassed in these areas formed a
comprehensive and ambitious reform program that were pursued in toto. The macroeconomic
stabilization program was primarily supported by an IMF SBA; the implementation of structural
adjustment policies was assisted by the SAL; and social issues received support from a
freestanding SFD project financed by IDA and other donors.
4.          The SAL, in an amount equivalent to US$300 million, was approved by the Bank
on June 20, 1991. The first tranche of the loan (US$150 million) was fully disbursed by August
1992. The release of the second tranche was approved in March 1993, but because of the
improved balance of payments (BOP) position at the time, it was canceled at the request of the
Government in October 1993. At about the same time, in May 1991, the Govemment entered



2                             Main Report
into an 18-month IMF SBA for SDR 234.4 million (34.6 percent of quota). The second review
of the SBA was successfully completed in March 1993. Because of the improved BOP position,
however, the Government decided to draw only SDR 147.2 million and not to make any further
purchases under the SBA. This SBA expired on May 31, 1993.
5.          A precautionary three-year EFF, in an amount equivalent to SDR 400 million (59
percent of quota), was approved by the IMF on September 20, 1993. In parallel, the SAL was
followed by the Structural Adjustment Monitoring Program (SAMP), a program that monitored
performance on the structural reform front but which was not associated with a loan from the
Bank because of Egypt's improved balance of payments position. SAMP was justified by the
need for continual Bank support to the Government's reform program. In addition, the ongoing
IMF arrangements had, and still have, as a prerequisite, that the implementation of the agreed
upon structural adjustment program be satisfactory to the Bank. The DDSR granted by Paris
Club creditors in May 1991 was linked to the Government's performance under IMF
arrangements. Relief was to be provided in three phases. The first phase was implemented in
July 1991, and provided a 15 percent reduction in the present value of debt service. The second
phase, in the same amount, took place in October 1993, after the IMF approved the EFF. The
third phase, that would further reduce the present value of debt service by 20 percent, was
scheduled to have taken place by July 1, 1994, and was conditional on the successful completion
of the first review of the EFF. Although the first SAMP review in July 1994 was favorable in the
areas under the Bank's purview, the IMF and the Government have not yet reached agreement
with regard to the macroeconomic policy framework. As a result the release of the third tranche
of the DDSR is delayed, which represents payments to service Paris Club creditors of about
US$360 million p.a. since July 1994.
Project Objectives
6.          The economic reform program supported by the SAL was comprehensive in
nature, consisting of various components with diverse, but economically reinforcing aims.
(a)   Macroeconomic reform was expected to curtail inflation, reduce the current
account and budget deficits, restore creditworthiness, and bring about high and
sustainable long-term economic growth.
(b)   Public enterprise reform was expected to increase economic efficiency through
competition. To that end, it aimed to privatize and restructure public enterprises and
to reform financial relationships between public enterprises, the banking system and
the Government. Public enterprises were to be subjected to the same rules and
obligations as private enterprises, the "umbilical cord" between the Government
and public enterprises severed, and access to bank credit based strictly on the
creditworthiness of individual enterprises. Greater competitiveness was expected to
be served through greater management autonomy of public sector enterprises. The
role of the Government was to be limited to that exercised normally by a major
shareholder in a large corporation; public enterprise managers were to have full
financial, commercial and managerial autonomy, including the authority to spin off



3                              Main Report
non-viable activities. In addition, the liquidation of non-viable public enterprises
were to be permitted and the privatization of the public enterprises were to be both
allowed and encouraged.
(c)   Domestic price liberalization reform aimed to increase economic efficiency through
promoting competition and through removal of government-imposed distortions in
the pricing system. As such, price setting in the public and private agricultural and
manufacturing sectors was to be decontrolled, within three years, most prices were
to be fully determined by market forces. In the transport, energy and power sectors,
prices were to be gradually raised to international or long-term marginal cost levels.
(d)   Foreign trade liberalization was intended to increase economic efficiency through
the promotion of import competition and export rivalry, and through the removal of
government-imposed distortions in the incentive system. To attain this objective,
trade reforms initiated under the ERSAP were to phase out most nontariff barriers to
imports and exports within two years, reduce high customs tariffs, and dismantle
restrictions on exports.
(e)   Private sector reform  was intended to increase economic efficiency through
promotion of competition and enabling greater market entry, market exit, and factor
mobility.  Specifically, it was to encourage and facilitate private enterprise
development through the abolishment of investment and production controls
(limiting government intervention to the granting of specific investment incentives
in justifiable cases), the dismantling of government monopolies, and the phasing out
of private sector discrimination in the purchase of inputs from public sector
companies.
(f)    The Social Fund for Development was expected to minimize the effect of further
economic reforms on the poor, facilitate the reintegration of Egyptian workers
returning from Iraq, and enhance labor mobility in general.
7.          The major areas under the IMF's primary responsibility have been: the macro-
economic framework (fiscal, monetary and foreign exchange policies); and tax policy (income,
stamp and value-added taxes). The major areas under the Bank's primary responsibility have
been: price and trade liberalization; public investment; PE reform and privatization; regulatory
reforms; financial sector reform; and the strengthening of the social safety net.
Achievements of Project Objectives
8.          Compliance under the SAL program included indicators that were to be monitored
during the program, while deviations were to be used as signals of possible remedial action.
Regarding the stabilization program, indicators were: the fiscal deficit as a share of GDP, the rate
of monetary expansion, the expansion of credit to the public sector, and the size of public
investment relative to GDP. Regarding the structural adjustment program, indicators were:
(i) trade reform, namely reduction in the domestic production coverage of import bans, removal



4                             Main Report
of a number of prior approvals for imports, level of maximum and minimum import tariffs,
removal of a number of tariff preferences, reduction in the number of export bans, quotas, and
prior approvals; (ii) public enterprise reform and privatization, including share of existing
affiliated companies to be reorganized as Holding Companies (HCs), amnount of asset value to
bring to the point of sale (POS) and completed sales; (iii) private sector development, i.e.,
increasing the share of commercialization of cement and fertilizer by private sector companies;
and (iv) price liberalization, consisting of a program including adjustments in petroleum product
and producer cotton prices according to targets relative to world market equivalent, targets for
electricity prices to reach relative to LRMC, reduction of the budget allocation for fertilizer and
pesticide subsidies, and rail tariff increases to attain targeted improvement in Egyptian National
Railways' revenue coverage ratio.
9.          The overall implementation of the SAL was satisfactory, compliance in the five
main areas described above was good, and a large number of other program objectives have been
met as well. In fact, in a number of cases, the Government has gone well beyond the actions
supported by the loan. Following are detailed discussions on performance under the stabilization
and structural adjustment programs.
10.         Macroeconomic Stabilization.   The Government's stabilization program,
supported under the SAL, consisted of reduction in the fiscal deficit, the pursuit of consistent
monetary and exchange rate policies and achievement of balance of payments viability. Egypt's
fiscal adjustment has been impressive, providing an important anchor to its successful
stabilization program. The fiscal deficit was reduced from about 17 percent of GDP in FY90-
FY91 to 2.5 percent in FY94. In fact, adjustment in the primary deficit provides a better
indicator to assess the magnitude of domestic adjustment (net of saving in interest payments
which has been affected by the DDSR granted to Egypt). A primary deficit of about 9.5 percent
of GDP at the beginning of the program was changed to a primary surplus of about 10 percent in
FY94; a swing of almost 20 percent of GDP achieved in a relatively short period of time -- a
fiscal performance difficult to match.
11.         The rate of growth of broad money supply declined from 28 percent in FY92 to
about 12 percent in FY94. During the same period, the foreign exchange market was unified
ahead of schedule and restrictions were eliminated. Nevertheless, in spite of adopting a flexible
exchange rate system, the Egyptian pound remained essentially stable against the US dollar at
about LE 3.3 per US dollar. Accordingly, inflation slowed significantly from over 20 percent
p.a. in FY91 to about 9 percent p.a. in FY94. Interest rates were liberalized at the beginning of
the reform, and declined from about 20 percent p.a. on 90-day treasury bills (TBs) to about 12
percent p.a. in FY94.  Real interest rates, which were negative before the program, turned
positive, and were more in line with real international rates by FY94.
12.         The balance of payments performed better than was initially projected. The
current account balance (including official transfers) swung from a deficit of US$2.6 billion in
FY90 to a surplus of $3.7 billion in FY92, and $0.2 billion in FY94. This has been due mainly
to the significant fiscal adjustment, the DDSR granted by the Paris Club and bilateral creditors --
but also because of strong foreign exchange earnings from tourism, workers' remittances and
Suez Canal revenues. Because of massive capital inflows, in part stimulated by the sterilization



5                             Main Report
policy pursued by the authorities, the overall balance of payments swung from a deficit of
US$1.2 billion in FY90 to a surplus of $5.9 billion in FY92, and $1.7 billion in FY94.
Accordingly, the level of international reserves held by the central bank amounted to US$18
billion, about 12 months of imports of goods and services in FY94. Finally, creditworthiness
improved dramatically as the foreign debt to GDP ratio declined from over 150 percent before
the SAL to about 70 percent in FY94 . More importantly, the net present value of the debt in
percent of GDP fell from more than 100 percent to about 60 percent, bringing Egypt to the
middle of the range characterizing moderately indebted countries. The debt service ratio
improved even more (declined from about 47 percent to 17 percent) during the same period
because of the debt restructuring and the dominant concessional component of external credits.
13.         Foreign rade. In the area of foreign trade, the Government's intention was to
dismantle non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and reduce the dispersion in tariff rates, while lowering the
average rate. At the start of the reform program, 37.2 percent of tradable output (agriculture and
manufacturing) was protected by import bans. Moreover, the tariff range on imports was 5-100
percent, with a large number of exemptions. By February 1993, the production coverage of the
import bans was brought down from 22.7 percent in 1991 to 10.1 percent, as compared to the
second tranche release condition of 10.6 percent. The tariff range was narrowed to 5-80 percent,
thus falling short of the original objective of the program of a 10-80 percent range. The
authorities were of the opinion that raising the minimum tariff rate at that time would have
adversely affected investment in physical capital, since the 5 percent rate applied mainly to
capital goods and intermediate products. The minimum tariffs were increased to 5 percent on
items which were not exempted under the SAL and were not among Egypt's tariff bindings with
the GATT. A number of items, including military imports, continued to be exempted from any
tariff. On the other hand, the Government went beyond its program targets in the reduction of the
number of tariff preferences, the number of items subject to prior approval, and in lifting export
bans and export quotas, and in eliminating the foreign exchange quota system for public
enterprises and the requirement of prior deposits on imports.
14.         After the completion of the first SAMP review, except for very few items, all
NTBs to trade were eliminated. In addition, NTBs on textile imports are expected to be phased
out according to the agreement reached under the Uruguay Round. Tariff dispersion was further
reduced to a 5-70 percent range, and the tariff schedule between 70 and 40 percent was reduced
by 10 percentage points. The quality control system on imports has become more transparent
and less discriminatory relative to the quality standards applied to domestically produced goods.
Duty drawback and temporary admission procedures for exporting have been streamlined.
GATT has been implementing the establishment of the safeguard, anti-dumping and
countervailing duties mechanism as supported by a Bank Institutional Development Fund (IDF)
grant set for that purpose. As a consequence of these measures, Egypt's foreign trade regime has
become significantly more transparent.
15.         Public Enterprise Reform. To remove key impediments and revitalize the public
sector companies, a new PE Law (Law 203) and its executive regulations were enacted to
establish an overall policy, institutional, organizational and financial framework. A new PE
Ministry, was established to oversee the entire PE sector. The Public Enterprise Office (PEO),
the operational arm of the PE Minister, was established in 1991, and the existing 27 Public



6                             Main Report
Organizations and 314 Public Sector Companies were converted into temporary HCs and
Affiliated Companies (ACs). Despite this progress, delays occurred, causing the second tranche
release date to be moved back.
16.         Nevertheless, in line with the agreements under the SAL, since September 1992,
the Government has moved on several fronts. The number of HCs has been reduced from 27 to
17, which should lead to significant reductions in overhead costs. Guidelines for performance of
PE managers, and for restructuring and liquidation of PEs, have been issued. Moreover, the
objective of HC portfolio diversification has been largely achieved, in that instead of being
mono-sectoral as many of the old HCs used to be, the new HCs have several sectors of activity.
17.         Privatization Program. Implementation of the privatization component of the
Government's ERSAP was a condition for the SAL second tranche release. The program
comprised the implementation of the 1991/92 Privatization Program and the adoption of a
comprehensive 1992/93 Privatization Program satisfactory to the Bank. The Government
adopted a privatization strategy of publicly-owned assets on a decentralized and selective basis.
In aggregate, since SAL Board Presentation and until the date originally set for the second
tranche release, a total of LE 1.1 billion (US$335 million) was sold to the private sector out of an
estimated book value of HCs' assets of about LE 72 billion (US$21.8 billion), representing only
5 percent. Since December 1992, the Government decided to bring to the POS 22 companies and
assets, including 6 wholly state-owned companies, for a total value of LE 1.37 billion
(US$415 million). This was thought to be indicative of the Government's determination to move
much faster on its privatization program. The completion of these transactions was to have taken
place by the third quarter of 1993. It was also decided in agreement with the Government to
extend the 1992/93 Privatization Program to cover the period ending in June 1994. Under the
program, the authorities had agreed to bring to the POS some 40 companies and assets. Their
combined asset value amounted to LE 9.1 billion (about US$2.8 billion), representing 12 percent
of total HC assets (historical book value). The Government had set as a target the sale of
LE 3.6 billion (about US$1.1 billion) by June 1994.
18.         As it turned out, the implementation of privatization suffered delays as the
Government was preoccupied with the enactment of the PE Law and reorganization of the HCs.
There were also delays in the selection of privatization candidates, and the work necessary for
preparing companies for sale took longer than expected. As a result, the performance under the
1991/92 Privatization Program fell short of expectations. However, the actions implemented
since December 1992, the larger scope of the 1993/94 Privatization Program, and its publication
indicated that the Government was acting to quicken the pace of privatization. Therefore, the
second tranche release which was recommended on the basis of the overall progress achieved,
included a waiver in view of the Government's partial compliance with the condition and
objectives of the Privatization Program.
19.         Private Sector Developmen. A number of factors hampered private sector
development, particularly in the industrial sector. As part of the reform the Government
liberalized cement and fertilizer prices, and lifted quantity restrictions on sales to any and all
customers, as well as all geographical restrictions on cement and fertilizer distribution, including
sales to traders. In this area, the authorities went beyond related agreements under the SAL.



7                             Main Report
20.         Entry by private firms was restricted through the maintenance of a long list of
activities in which investment was prohibited. In addition, private sector initiative was impeded
by restrictions on access to bank credit and foreign exchange, as well as various administrative
requirements, which included investment and production licensing. In line with key objectives,
licensing requirements were abolished, except for a reduced negative list of products. The
process of investment licensing by the General Organization for Industrialization (GOFI) for
non-negative list investments was reduced to a registration process. Furthermore, in order to
begin removing labor restrictions on private firms, the Parliament amended the Labor Law to
enable employers to advertise their employment needs, to seek the services of special offices in
recruitment, examine job applications, and assist in selection of qualified prospective employees.
21.         Price Liberalization.  Since 1990 important progress has been achieved in
liberalizing industrial, agricultural and energy prices; in several cases the achievements have
exceeded the program targets. In the industrial sector, except for pharmaceuticals and for ten
industrial products whose prices continue to be set on the basis of a standard cost formula, the
Government has gone beyond the objectives of its program and freed all other prices. For
pharmaceuticals, progress fell somewhat short of the goals of the Government's program because
of the special nature and socio-political sensitivity of the concerned products. With the
exception of sugar, all prices for agricultural products were liberalized.
22.         The Government started its price reform in the energy sector from a May 1989
base of 36 percent of international prices for petroleum product prices and 24 percent of long run
marginal cost for electricity tariffs. As of July-1994, the weighted average of petroleum products
had reached 100 percent of international prices, compared with 67 percent as a minimum ratio
for the SAL second tranche release. Electricity prices rose to 69 percent of their long-run
marginal cost (LRMC), in line with the second tranche release condition, while as of July 1994,
they reached 74 percent of LRMC. In the transport sector, the Government's program aimed to
raise tariffs charged by the Egyptian National Railways (ENR) such that its revenue coverage
ratio (RCR) would increase incrementally by about 5 percentage points a year to reach 75 percent
in 1992/93 and 100 percent by 1997/98. Although tariffs have been raised, and the 1997/98
target date remains in effect, the RCR for 1992/93 has reached about 62 percent, thus falling
short of the agreed target. In 1992, the authorities also introduced legislation that phases out rent
control in rural areas in five years (a measure not included under SAL).
Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
23.         The Government has had a significant incentive to implement its economic reform
program resulting from the conditional DDSR provided by Paris Club creditors. The overall
program including the DDSR offered Egypt a unique opportunity to improve creditworthiness
and restore sustainable growth while attaining social and price stability.
24.         Since the SAL program was comprehensive, its implementation experienced some
delays because of limits to the Government's implementation capacity. Substantial time was
spent at the beginning of the program to put in place the SAL Monitoring Unit, which consisted



8                             Main Report
of the technical secretariat to the Council of Ministers which coordinated program
implementation across sectors.  Loan effectiveness took some eight months after Board
Presentation because of the sensitivity of implementing one of the policy conditions, namely, an
increase in cotton prices. This delay and the institutional deficiencies noted above affected the
timing of implementation of second tranche release actions as well. By March 1993,
implementation was judged as satisfactory, and the second tranche of the Paris Club DDSR was
released in October 1993.
Project Sustainability
25.         There were a number of real, downside risks to the program. First, with economic
stagnation lingering on and unemployment on the rise, popular support for the reform program
declined. With the deepening of the reforms through SAMP, particularly in the trade area, strong
opposition to the reforms has developed among vested interest groups. Moreover, the increase in
the level of violence by extremist groups has alarmed the Government. These factors have
seriously reduced the Government's room to maneuver. Given the current social and political
climate in Egypt, the relatively high level of international reserves and comfortable BOP position
weakened the commitment to pursue structural reforms.
26.         Nevertheless, the Government is also aware of the risks to the economy over the
medium-term, if it does not proceed with the next phase of reform. Loss of credibility of the
reform program could lead to capital flight, and a decline in an already low level of private
investment. Egypt would also forgo access to the third tranche of the Paris Club DDSR. In sum,
while the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks, the Government will have to move
judiciously in order to ensure continued popular support for the reform program and social and
political stability in the short-term. The ultimate risk to the program would be failure of the
private sector to respond strongly to the structural reforms and the more stable macroeconomic
environment. Finally, by building on the significant achievements attained during the first phase
and beyond, the Government now has a unique opportunity to enhance the credibility of the
reform program and the prospects for sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth.
Bank Performance
27.         The Bank has assisted the Government in providing the necessary ingredients to
ensure the successful implementation of the program. It helped to mobilize donor support to
cofinance the SAL as well as the SDF and the technical assistance (TA) for privatization and
banking reform projects. The Bank helped obtain UNDP support for TA in implementing the
SAL Monitoring Unit, in strengthening the Capital Market Authority. In addition, the Bank
approved two IDF grants to support establishing the Safeguard, Anti-dumping and
Countervailing mechanism and to strengthen the insurance and pension systems.
Implementation and monitoring of SAL required continuous support to the Government.
28.         The Bank also geared its economic and sector work (ESW) to assist in the design
and implementation of the economic reform program under the SAL and SAMP. Formal reports



9                             Main Report
produced included two Country Economic Memoranda (CEMs, 1990 and 1995), and reports on
Poverty, Agriculture Strategy, Sugar and Cotton Sectors, Financial Policy for Adjustment and
Growth, Capital Market, Public Investment Review, Economic Deregulation, and Private Sector
Development. In addition, the Bank provided technical advice in response to the Government's
request. It is currently undertaking to produce a report on Rent De-control. Most of the tasks
were agreed as part of the support that the Bank would provide to the Government for the reform
program.
Borrower Performance
29.         The Authorities collaborated with all Bank Supervision missions, and technical
consultations between the Government and Bank teams took place on a continuous basis. The
Government chose to implement the majority of the actions related to tranche releases in batches
and usually with some delay. This created the impression that the Government was acting under
Bank and Fund pressure. It cast some doubt on program ownership and led to a 10 month delay
of the second tranche of the DDSR. Nevertheless, given the comprehensive nature of the reform
prograrn, the Government should be commended for the very impressive progress made towards
stabilization of the economy.
30.         An important positive outcome is the experience gained by the Government in
coordinating the design and implementation of comprehensive structural programs, such as those
supported under the SAL, and the subsequent EFF and SAMP.
Assessment of Outcome
31.         The Government has succeeded in macroeconomic stabilization, resulting in sharp
reductions in the budget and current account deficits -- thus initiating a major transformation in
the economy. Bank solvency and prudential regulation have been improved, the insurance
companies and capital markets reformed. Prices and interest rates have been liberalized and
subsidies significantly reduced. A market for treasury bills (TBs) has been established. The
foreign exchange market has been decontrolled and the exchange rate unified. A sales tax has
been introduced and the income tax code reformed. Almost all major barriers to trade and
private sector investment were removed. After some delay, the implementation of PE reform
began. Privatization of PEs, though accelerated in early 1993, has been slower than anticipated.
On balance, the SAL has resulted in a successful outcome.
32.         The second phase of the Government's program focused on completing the
transition from a controlled economy to a decentralized, market and outward-oriented economy.
The Government's vision is one of an economy with a rapidly growing private sector operating in
a competitive and stable environment, with a significantly down-sized PE sector operating under
the same rules as the private sector. Investment, output and pricing decisions in both the private
and public sectors would be made on the basis of market conditions. Financial services would be
improved. The trade regime would offer lower protection, resulting from a lower average tariff
and a less dispersed tariff structure; NTBs to trade would virtually disappear. Employment in the



10                             Main Report
private sector would expand relative to that in the public sector. Consumption subsidies,
previously available to all groups, would be narrowed in scope and targeted to the truly
vulnerable, while the adverse impact on workers stemming from economic restructuring would
be minimized through the strengthening of the social safety net. A great many policy actions still
need implementation to achieve this vision.
Future Operation
33.         The SAL was followed by the SAMP in conjunction with the IMF's EFF, but
financial support for the second phase of the reform program was not required because of the
highly improved BOP position. There are no current plans for a SAL or SECALs.
Key Lessons Learned
34.         The SAL was successfully implemented. The following factors contributed to the
success of the program:
* Timing. The SAL came at a time when the Government's reforms in support of private sector
development and away from public sector were well underway. This had its roots as early as
President Sadat's "openness strategy" first activated in 1972. In addition, the conditional
DDSR provided by the Paris Club and the participation of the IMF ensured leverage and
program consistency. Finally, the demise of the Soviet bloc leading to the decline of central
planning strategies and the ascendance of free market economies provided an extra impetus to
the Egyptian reforms.
* Content. The magnitude of the macroeconomic imbalances and the distortions in the incentive
system warranted a comprehensive approach to reform. The Government felt that strong action
was needed and demonstrated a commitment to implement such action. The reforms led to
substantial macroeconomic stabilization of the economy. On the other hand, the deeper reforms
under the EFF and the SAMP encouraged opposition from vested interest groups, which
prompted the Government to pursue a slower reform pace.
* Assistance. The Government received very substantial assistance from the Bank and the donor
community for implementing its economic reform program, both in terms of financial support
and technical advice. The close working relationship with the Government contributed to the
satisfactory implementation of a very ambitious stabilization and structural adjustment
program.
