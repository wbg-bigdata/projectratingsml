Vadodara - Halol Road                                   Executve Summary
Ei--XECUTIVESUMMARY
Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS)- awarded
M/s. Kirloskar Consultants Limited, Pune the job to carry out the
detailed feasibility study of the widening and strengthening of
Vadodara-Halol Highway project for implementation of the project on
a commercial format. This also involved the environmental viability
study which included environmental baseline data generation,
preparation of an integrated Environmental and Social Impact
Assessment Report (ESAR) documenting major social issues,
consequent risks and the suitable action plans and also Environmental
Management Plan outlining the measures for improving the
environmental  quality  and  budgetary  cost  estimation  for
implementation.
- 1.0      PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.1        Project Type
The total length of the project road is 33 km with the initial stretch from
km 8/300 to km 34/300 falling in Vadodara and Vaghodia tahsils of
Vadodara district while the remaining (km 3413= to km 40/300) falling in
Halol tahsil of Panchamahals district. This project being a highway and
bridge project has been classsified          r# as per The World
Bank categorization. The Roads and Building (R&B) Department,
::                    Govemrnment of Gujarat (GoG) and Infrastructure Leasing and Financial
Services Limited (IL&FS) have entered into a Memorapdum df
Agreement to develop and implement the widening / strengthening of
the Vadodara-Halol section of this state highway (SH87) on a
commercial format.
1.2        Need For The Project
The traffic studies identify that the-existing two lane carriageway
accommodates 18000 Passengers Car Unit (PCU) in a day, which
according to standards is close to capacity. The average journey speed
observed on the project road is 40 kmph which while considered with
limited scope for overtaking fix the level of service as 'poor. Delays are
experienced due to cattle crossing and all along the project road and
pedestrian crossing at the villages. The friction due to developments at
the villages contribute to the reduction in level of service and increase in
accidents at these locations. The single carriageway at the current level
of service where overtaking becomes risky, also contributes to the
reduction in level of safety on the project road.
" B Both these districts also wit*ss a high growth of Industries and Small
Scale Industrial (SSI) units on a consistent pace which could be largely

attributed to the attractive policies floated by the governments. As a
result of growth induced industrial policies, large scale investments have
been forthcoming at a rapid rate.
Addition of a two lane carriageway with directional segregation is
therefore necessary to enhance the levels of service and safety for
projected future traffic.
1.3        Project Components
The project mainly consists of strengthening the existing carriageway
with a flexible overlay formation with two additional lanes seperated by a
median and provision of paved and earthen shoulders and provision of
service roads on either side. The bridges and culverts on existing
alignment are proposed to be improved or reconstructed depending on
the condition. Bridges and cross drainage works are to be constructed
-on the new formation. The borrow areas have been identified. The
quarries are located at Savalia and Halol which are established quarries
for metal. Sand is proposed to be brought from Goma river near HaloL
The various alignment options were exai  for minimizing the social
and environmental impacts at villages - Jarod, Asoj, Khandewadi and
Baska and suitable one was recommended
2.0        BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS
The study area conmprised the area falling wi±in 5 km dJsaze on
either side of the proposed and existing alignment for the study of
various environmental attributes in general. For detailed studies an
area within 1 km distance on either side of the alignment was
considered. The Consultants had carried out Environmental Impact
Studies including baseline data ge.deration, secondary data
compilation to assess the impacts on environmental attributes during
construction and operation phase of the proposed project including the
impacts of quarrying operations.
The field studies were conducted for a period of one month from 24th
August to 25th September, 1996 to determine the existing conditions of
various environmental attributes viz., air quality, meterology, surface
and ground water quality, ecology, prevailing land use and industrial
activities along the project road and noise levels. Meterological data
was generated at Halol and Dhanjipura for one month.
Other studies such as land use pattem, socio-economic profile were
based on secondary data collected from various Government agencies
supplemented by limited field surveys carried out by the Consulatnts.
Comprehensive field observations were enlightened on evaluation of
alternative alignments at wherever there were problems of sensitive,

social and technical issues such as existing topography, surface water
bodies and villages or sensitive areas.
2.1        Air Quality
Ambient Air Quality Monitoring (AAQM) stations were set up at seven
locations viz., Dhanjipur, Jarod, Asoj, Baska, Anandapura, Baska, Paladi
(for background concentration) and Halol for sampling SPM and NOx at
eight hourly interval. In order to facilitate calibration of CALINE3, an air
dispersion model. a straight stretch of road of length 1.2 km was
selected at two locations viz., Anandpura and Baska villages. Hourly
samples for NOx. CO and HC during peak traffic flow were taken at
different distances from centre of the road for three days. Hourly traffic
counts were also monitored at these locations concurrently with the
continuous monitoring. AAQM stations were also set up at the
predominant downwind locations to cross check as well as to facilitate
-U                    the calibration of the model.
The observations are based on a perusal of *h field campaign resuJts
are summarized below:
The sampling locations in residential areas (Dhanjipur, Asoj, Anandpura
and Baska) at about 30 m to 60 m away from the existing road indicates
average 24 hourly concentrations for SPMA -in    ae of 62.2 to 82.4
j.g / m3 and NOx in the range of 18.8 to 22.13 Mg! i3. The baseline
location at village Paladi which is about 1.5 km from the existing r4oad
indicates average concentrations for SPM and NOx as 54.2 jig/M3 and
11.3 .ggmh Tespectively. The aveage 24 hourly concentrativi,fr SPM
at highway junctions at Halol town and village Jarod are observed to be
105.5 Pg/M3 and 51.6 Zg/m3 respectively. The same for NOx is 22.1
gg/m3 and 18.5 tg/m3 respectively. One (peak) hourly average CO
levels at all the locations in the upwind and downwind direction were
observed to be below detectable limit of 1145 tg/m3. The maximum
concentration for hydrocarbons was observed to be in the range of 0.20
to 0.27 ppm in the upwind location, and 0.29 to 0.42 ppm in the
downwind locations.
To conclude the ambient air quality levels observed during the study
period are found to be well within the standards prescribed by Central
Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for residential and and commercial area.
2.2        Noise Level Survey
The noise monitoring has been conducted at Dhanjipur, a representative
of residential locality with a temple being a sensitive area in the vicinity;
near Halol Naka, a representative of the traffic flow at junction condition;
and near village Jarod in view of residential spread. The monitoring was

also carried out at the at the stretch of the road near village Anandpura
where traffic is smooth flowing and near a sharp curve at village Bhaska
to facilitate the calibration of noise model noise levels during peak traffic
hours (4 pm to 8 pm) at a distance of 15 and 30 meters from the edge of
the road.
a)   Daytime Noise Levels (Lday)
Residential zone: The day time noise level at the two locations is
observed to be exceeding the prescribed limit of 55 dB(A) at Jarod (62.9
dbA) and at Dhanjipur (65.9 dbA). The noise level at Jarod recorded the
highest level at 65.6 dB(A). High background noise levels in the
residential zone is due to the traffic as well as other village activities.
-Commercial Zone: The day time noise level at the location (Halol Naka)
prone to traffic and commercial activities is observed to just exceed the
prescribed limit of 65 dB(A). The noise levels recorded at this station
indicates a level of 65.8 dB(A).
b)   Night time Noise Levels (Lnighd
Residential zone: The night time noise level at both the locations falling
under the residential zone are found to be aboe the prescribed limits of
45 dB(A). The noise levels at these locations ranges between 54.8
dB(A) to 67.4 dB(A). The high noise levfif we Gtributable to the traffic.
Commercial zone: The night time noise level at the location (Halol Naka)
prone to traffic and commercial activities is observed to be 62.7 dB(A)
WM& fxveeds the rnlœ ts55 dbA.
c)    Peak Hourly (Leq):
The continuous hourly monitoring of noise levels adjoining the road near
Anandpura and Baska villages falling under the residential zone are
found to exceed the prescribed limits of 55 dB(A).
2.3        Water Quality
For the water quality survey, four sampling locations viz., Ka\handewadi,
Asoj, Baniyara and Hami villages for surface water and one viz., jarod
for ground water were selected.
All tested parameters are found well within the permissible limits as per
IS:2296 except for suspended solids and thereby indicating the good
quality of surface water at all sampling locations. In case of ground
water, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) is observed to exceed the desirable
standard of 500 mg/l. All other parameters are found to be well within the
permissible limits of IS:10500.

Vadodara - Halol Road                                     Executive Summary
2.4         Landuse Pattern
The data on landuse which is normally available has been collected from
various secondary sources like District Census Handbook, Revenue
records, State and Central Government Offices is for the village revenue
boundary. Agriculture is the predominant land use along the road for
over 20 km out of the 33 km stretch i.e. for more than 60% of the length.
Nearly 90% of the length of the road has agricultural and open land as
the adjoining land use.
2.5         Soil Characteristics
Most of the area adjoining the road is under cultivation and agriculture is
the main occupation of people in mte study area. Soil samples were
collected from agricultural fields at four locations viz.. Dhanjipur near
Oden chouk, Jarod, Asoj and Baska to establish the baseline
characteristics and to assess the agricultural and afforestation potential
of the soil.
Soil colour is observed to be varying between black to slightly black
brown. The texture is observed to be predamWi'sty clay followed by
clayey soils. This soils being derived from the weathering of Deccan
traps are deep retentive and fertile.
The soils in the area is observed to be slightly to moderately alkaline.
The Electrical Conductivity (EC) is obseived to bearagve The NitrDgen
levels fall under the category of "better to sufficient". Similarly, the
Potassium levels fall under the category of "very low to 'aedium". The
levels of Phosphorus fanl under the category of 'less to average
sufficient". The levels of organic matter in the soils fall under the
category of "sufficient to average sufficient".
2.6         Geology, Hydrology And Hydrogeology
Major portion of Vadodara district in western part is covered by thick pile
of alluvium. A major portion of Panchamahals district in the central and
northern parts is covered by meta sediments while the southern parts
are found with formations which have been referred to as the
Champaner series. In the eastern part of the distnct, Deccan Traps
occupy a large area and at places on their fringes are found in Infra-
Trappeans.
The Vishvamitri enters Vaghodia taluka and flows past Asoj, Jarod and
Kamrol villages. The surva river flows past Kotambi, Bhaniyara and
Morlipura villages in Vaghodia taluka and passes near Amliyara, Kotali,
and Sukhlipur in Vadodara taluka. There are a number of medium and -
minor irrigation crossings on the existing highway road. The main
crossings are at km 32/2 for the Narmada main canal of about 110 m top

width, and km 10/4 for the branch canal. The statistics available for
1986-87 show that wells are the main sources of irTigation.
The hydrological tests conducted on tubewells have indicated that the
alluvial aquifers are capable of transmitting large quantities of
groundwater in general. In the hilly and undulating terrain in the east and
comparatively flat terrain in the west of Panchmahals, adequate supply
of water may be obtained in shallow bore wells piercing the porous
horizons of lava flows and in flows traversed by closely spaced joints.
2.7        Terrestrial Ecology
The objectives of ecological study is to characterize the environmental
components like land, water, fora and fauna and to identify susceptible
and sensitive areas. The area adjoining the existing highway
(approximately 1-2 km on either side) has been considered for the
primary survey to study the terrestrial ecosystem.
l  ^               The area depicts a manmade terrestrial ecosystem  with natural
vegetation limited to small patches at certain places. The bio-diversity of
vegetation in the area is not very high He     intense biotic pressure.
There is no reserved forest, national park, wild life sanctuary or
biosphere reserve in the core area.
Within the thirty-one km stretch out of 1621 trees recorded 464 were
small, 735 were medium and 1422 were large trees. The study revealed
the existence of thirty eight species in 31 km patch of road. In all 1621
pIwTt3 mported, highest percentage was cd 7geem  TM7o); All
subdominant trees shovwed      1ower density e.g. Borassus (7%),
Ficus bengalensis (6.6%6), Peltophorum (5.8%), Pithecolobium (5.5%6),
Acacia nilotica (5.43%), Prosopis spicigera (5.2%). Species like
Terminalia catappa, Terminalia chebula, Feronia limonia were the
rarest represented just by one tree each. The highest tree density was
found in kms 25, 17 and 12 and 8th km stretch did not have any large
tree.
The study reveals that most of the trees were in good condition (1230
and 313 out of 1621 in not damaged and partially damaged classes) and
78 were damaged probably beyond repair and are likely to remain
deformed and stunted even after protection and proper tree care. The
trees which are damaged were Neem and Ficus since both can be used
as a cattle or goat fodder in scarsity during summer.
The Neem and species of Ficus trees play a significant role, especially
during scorching summer months, in lives of local people, travellers
and even birds. Efforts should be taken to protecte existing well grown
trees, as much as possible, when existing carriage width is increased.-

Vadodara - Halol Road                                   Executive Summary
2.8        Terrestrial Fauna
Since there is no suitable habitat for occurrence of ecologically important
fauna in the area, no endangered species have been reported in the
study area. Since this, project does not pass through ecologically
sensitive area. the abundance of the fauna is of less significance.
3.0        IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The environmental impacts based on environmental baseline conditions
and analysis of the field data are categorized as either primary (direct) or
secondary (indirect). The details on impact of the project activity on each
of the environmental attributes is summarized below.
3.1        Impact On Air Quality
* Construction Phase Impacts
Burning of diesel will be the principal cause of air pollution during the
construction phase. Under adverse meteorological conditions like
stable condition during winter after the sunset, it is possible that the
NO2 standards (80 Jtg/M3 for 24 hourly average) may be violated in
the construction yard if the construction woTr is carried out round the
clock. There will be also be a rise in SPM levels due to the construction
activities. The SPM standards, however, are nor expected to be
violated as the background levels are very low and the particulates
tend to sette during the low wind and stable conditions which give rise
to highJerels of gaseous poJJutants.
O Operational Phase
The air quality predictions carried out by using the air quality model
CALINE3 developed by California Department of Transportation for
years 2000 and 2015, respectively, have been considered to project
future air quality scenarios to provide an indication of long term
variations in air quality.
CO Levels:
It is observed that the predicted CO levels at 10 m from ROW for cross
winds in the year 2000 range form 160-55 g.g/m3. The range is about 3
times higher for the year 2015 which is approximately the ratio of traffic
volume in the years 2000 and 2015 respectively. On comparison with
the hourly standard for CO of 4000 pLg/m3, it is seen that no violations
of CO standard are expected due to the project. The CO levels in fact
will remain well below the standards. The project therefore has
insignificant negative impact on ambient air quality in terms of CO.

Environmental Impact Assessment
Vadodara - Halol Road                                   Erecutive Summary
The 8 hourly predictions by assigning hourly stability class for the
period from 4 pm to 12 pm for the years 2000 and 2015 indicated that
the CO levels will remain significantly below the 8 hourly standard of
2000 I.Lg/m3.
NOX Levels:
One hourly simulations for NOx for the year 2015 are compared with
WHO standard of 400 pg/M3. It is observed that the standard is
violated up to a distance of about 35m from the Right Of Way (ROW)
- =                  limit. No violations of NOx standards are, however. expected in the
year 2000.
3.2       Impact On Noise Levels
*    Construction Phase
Construction activities are expected to produce noise levels in the range
of 80 - 95 dB(A). The noise produced during the construction will
however not have a significant impact on the existing ambient n;Me
levels near villages (where the existing ambient noise levels for
residential zone are already being exceeded) as the proposed alignment
bypasses the four villages and passes through agricultural and open
fields where very limited presence of population being exposed to noise
levels is expected. The workers in general aie 4kely to be exposed to an
equivalent noise level of 80-90 dB(A) in an 8 hour shift against the safety
limit of 90 dB(
D    'OperafionaPhase
VWith the operation of the proposed road the residential areas along the
highway on either side are likely to experience high day and night time
noise levels.
Lday (65 dB(A)) and Lght (55 dB(A)) standards confined to commercial
zone are expected to voilate upte a distance of about 45 m and 180 m
from the ROW boundary in the year 2000 whereas upto a distance of
about 130 m and 400 m from the ROW boundary in 2015 A.D.
respectively. Lday (55 dB(A)) standard confined to residential zone is
expected to voilate upto a distance of about 300 m and 680 m from the
ROW boundary in the year 2000 and 2015 A.D. respectively. Whereas
No LfMht (45 dB(A)) standard is expected to voilate upto a distance of
about 850 m in both the years. The data presented clearly reveals that
the residential areas are likely to be exposed to high noise levels
exceeding the prescribed standards levels during the day and night time.

experiences both Wight and  day violations in both 2000 and 2015 A.D.
for both the scenarios.
3.3        Impact On Water Quality
The construction and operation of the proposed highway project will not
have any major impact on the surface water and the ground water
quality in the area. Contamination to water bodies may result due to
spilling of construction materials, oil, grease, fuel and paint in the
equipment yards and asphalt plants. Impact on the ground water quality
is not anticipated from the project during the both construction and
operational phases as there is no case of dumping thereby leaching of
harmful ingredients down to water table.
3.4        Impact On Terrestrial And Aquatic Ecology
The initial constwction works at the project site involving land clearance,
cuffing, filling and leveling, will cause loss of potential agricultural
- v            productive land and loss of about 966 trees out of 1621 identified along
the road. Inevitably, there will be a shoi¶xteTn impact of availability of
nesting sites for the birds. Further, there is no sensitive ecological area
near the existing road, so the impact will not of significance. With the
landscaping after the project, the number of tees are expected to be
more than earlier numbers and will allow the short term impact to be
reversed.
Tre        of1 tf1eTbaeous v       rnd the se -* mdeas i ' the
top sQWeole'A y causes soil =rosion. The constructional activities lead
to inward migration of labour force in the area and thus there would be
pressure on trees in the area due to increase in fuel demand.
As the project is devoid of forest and trees, it does not harbor any fauna
of importance. Therefore, the impact of constructional activities on faur.a
will be negligible.
River overbridges are already beer envisaged over the rivers viz.,
Viswamitri, Surva and Narmada canal adjoining the existing bridges and
hence there will be no significant impact on the aquatic ecology of the
area due to the construction and operation of the road.
3.5         Other Issues
Transport of Hazardous Material
The spillage materials on the road near the ponds or rivers/canals may
cause loss of life or property as also adverse water quality impacts. As a
precautionary measure, Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), the project
supervising tentity, should obtain insurance cover to provide for loss of
property and life and also for the cost of cleanup operations.

Vadodara - Halol Road                                   Executive Summary
Issues Related to Proposed Alignment
Since the pond area whose portion is mainly dry during summer season
will be acquired, the land acquisition at Khandewadi (occupies about
10% of the pond) has no or little effect on holding capacity of the pond.
Whereas the land acquisition is likely to limit the holding capacity of the
pond, which may lead to flooding of adjacent areas during monsoon
season. This impact can be minimized by resizing the ROW
requirements in the pond area, and implementation of mitigatory
measures.
4.0         PROJECT AND NO PROJECT SCENARIOS
. A compartson of the "Volume to Capacity" estimation (V/C ratio) clearly
reveals a steady rise of traffic densities on the existing road in the
limiting and normal capacities with No Project Scenano. In the limiting
capacity scenario, the maximum rise in V/C ratio is likely to be at 3.36
against the present ratio of 0.55 with No Project Scenario. Similarly, the
ratio for With Project Scenanio wiU bg n 12 in the year 2030 with respect
to the existing ratio of 0. 13.
Whereas with the normal capacity, the rise in volume/capacity ratio is
likely to be at 6.79 against the present natio of 1.11 with No Project
Scenario. Similarly, the ratio for With Project Scenario will be 1.27 in the
year 2030 with respect to the existiri Idtcif TV:21.
'Cu, old iisio of T"No Pject T  scenario with the 'roposed Project" has
Pr   d Ihe followi findings:
o the projected travel time reduces from 36.3 minutes to 24.8 minutes
for each vehicle;
* the project is expected to provide an average 42.3% saving in fuel
requirement which will have a proportional positive impact on air
quality;
* The pollution load for NOx With This Project Scenario is found to be
almost 1.2 to 1.79 times greater than that of No Project Scenario. In
the mean time, This Project Scenario is expected to contribute a
very favourable pollution situation with a reduction rate of about
12% to 55% and of about 21% to 48.6% in daily total pollution load
of HC and CO respectively; and
* accident reduction of 25%  is estimated (though no research is
available in India for the same).
"This Project" Scenario fulfils the functions of providing relatively faster
and cheaper transportation, improvements in traffic management and

public transportation on existing roads, provides significant socio-
economic  benefits to  the  entire  region. With  the  proposed
improvements, in  alignments and  measures for environmental
improvements for similar traffic flows, the project will also reduce the
exposure level of air pollutants and noise in the project area.
5.0        ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN
The present project will however have some negative environmental
impacts on the ambient air quality and noise levels during the
construction phases. Other issues such as green belt removal and land
acquisition are also related to the project. Although some of these
impacts, especially air and noise impacts cannot be fully avoided,
measures can be taken towards reduction of these impacts by way of
mitigatory measures. The project has overall positive impacts by way of
ie5uction in travel time, congestion and accidents. Also, in terms of
prominent environmental impacts of road projects on air quality and
noise levels, the project brings considerable improvement to possible
exposure levels to population when cornpdwith no project scenario.
The probable impacts caused during t   sbruction Phase and
Operational Phase of the proposed project and the mitigatory
measures to be undertaken by the concerned responsible entity
have been briefly summarized in the f_z oA  tian Sheets 1 to 7
for each major environmental issue.
5.1         Risk Assessment
The proposed alignment bypassing the villages viz., Jarod, Asoj,
Khandewadi and Baska thereby limiting the adverse impacts of air and
noise pollution within acceptable limits reduces the social risk as there
are minimal Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) aspects to be
tackled. As the proposed project will be strengthening the existing Cross
Drainage (CD) works and proposing new ones adjacent to the existing
ones, hence the CD works is not an issue of significance in this project.
It is recommended that the following back-up facilities be provided as a
part of the project in the event of an accident due to continued and
increased transportation of hazardous substances;
i.   ambulance stationed at the toll booth
ii.   tow truck for removing damaged vehicles
iii.   communication facilities at each (and in between) ends
iv.   access to fire-local (district) fighting facilities.

EnvWronmental Impact Assessment
Vadodara - Halol Road                                    Executive Summary
6.0        OBJECTIVES OF SOCIAL ASSESSMENT STUDY
The main objective of the social assessment exercise is to assess the
social impact of the project, identify issues and consequent risks in the
resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) of the project affected persons
(PAPs), outline R&R measures to mitigate any negative impact of the
project. In otherwords, the exercise has three main components: (i) a
General Social Impact Assessment, (ii) Public Information and
Consultation (PIC), the results of which will become the base for (ii) a
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP).
6.1         Benefits From The Project
All the road users, including the PAPs, will be benefited from the
proposed improvement on accout of comfort, safety, reduced travel
time, saving on vehicle operating costs due to enhanced speed, better
geometrics, and smooth surface. The project will upgrade linkages to
national highways and open up the area for increased economic
activities. A significant economic benefit of the project is the generation
of employment opportunities in the construction activities which will be
available to the people, including affected community.
7.0         SOCIO-ECONOMIC  ASPECTS  OF *TE  VILLAGES  IN  THE
PROJECT AREA
Villages within the 1 km stretch of the 9=iei study area on the either
side of the proposed alignment have been considered for socio-
-economic studtes. As per te village boundary maps depicted in 1991
Census handbooks, there are 12 villages in Vadodar (,iz..
Hami+Dhanjipura  mnd Amaliyara in Vadodara Tatisil; lKumetha.
Bhaupura, Bhaniyara, Kotambi, Kamrol, Jarod+Jarodiyapura, Lilora,
3J                        Panchdevia, Asoj+lshwarpura and Khandewadi in Vaghodia Tahsil) and
2 in Panchmahals districts (Viz., Bhaska+Anandpura and Nurpura).
therefore 14 villages in total falling within the study area.
The total population of the villages under consideration is observed to be
23,598. The males and females-onstitute to about 52.88% and 47.120,
of the study area population respectively. The density population reveals
that the study area has an overall density of 282 persons per km2. The
high density of population in the study area could be attributed to rapid
industrialisation and urbanization in the area.
8.0        SOCIAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS
The social assessment was initiated with the verification of structures.
lands coming within the project area. The social assessment process
involved the following activities:
i)    Verification of all structures I lands coming within 60 mtrs of the
proposed road;

ii)   Conducting socio-economic survey among the potential PAPs in
31.5 Kms; and
iii)   Preparation of RAP in consultation with the PAPs, government
officials and others concerned.
8.1        Measures Taken To Minimise Resettlement
In order to reduce the R&R issues. the design option included taking
bypasses to skirt the villages with a new 4 lane carriageway. The
Consultants have  proposed following measures to minimise the
resettlement and to avoid the loss of public utilities and cultural
properties like temples, mosques, etc.: 1) Bypasses at Jarod. Asoj,
Baska and near Halol; and 2) Restriction of carriageway at
Khandewadi.
8.2        Coverage of Public Information And Consultation
Keeping in view the draft version of RAP, an exercise is initiated (1) to
understand in depth the sentiments and the feelings of the people
losing their assets in the project and (2) lo identify the social and
environmental issues/problems at large so that no such issue remains
unaddressed as well as to take care of the -  ms as perceived by
the people losing their assets due to project implementations.
Since the proposed project is linear in nature and very few structures
come in the proposed ROW except for the villages Jarod, Asoj and
Baska, Public Information and Consultation  was conducted at at
villages viz, Bhaniyara, Jarod, Asoj, Khandewadi, Baska and Halol.
This  e   i%stfd  in ae mce of the propoend -
identification of community conoofn  4acge and possibe acceptable
solutions, both at individual level and community level.
The PIC conducted through participatory approach has led to following
major modifications in the RAP:
.  Free toll for project land owners4PAPs) whose land is acquired.
This may be regulated by allowing only one commercial and one
non-commercial vehicle per affected family;
. Private lands and houses which get isolated or cut off due to
acquisition of land in the project, will be acquired if the owner gives
his / her consent to such acquisition. This would, however, apply
only to oustees who can no more make suitable economic use of
their non-acquired assets;
* Provision of underpasses across the road in three project villages
for safety of the villagers and animals crossing the road:
* The alignment of Asoj bypass was modified to minimize the impact
due to land acquisition to the land owners; and
. Number of road crossings were added to meet the community
needs at appropriate locations.

Environmental Impact Assessment
Vadodara - Halol Road                                   Executive Summary
It needs to be mentioned here that discussions with each PAP should
be done as a follow-up by the NGO, exploring the available solutions
suiting the individual considering his/her socio-economic background
so as to ensure adherence to the R&R policy of IL & FS.
9.0        SOCIO-ECONOMIC SURVEY
9.1        Families Affected
For initial alignment 594 structures in 31.5 kms road length were
identified. These consisted of 225 structures being used for residential
purposes, 245 commercial establishments, 59 community or public
infrastructure (including 19 temples) and 65 other structures. This
would have resulted in a major relocation problem in addition to huge
amounts of compensation payable to the owners of the structures. At
the same time this would have significantly disturbed the economic
living of the people. However after realigning the project road by
providing bypasses, subsequent to the socio-economic survey, only 10
structures mainly used for residential purposes are coming within the
ROW  (including bypasses) which need to be relocated outside the
project boundary. Two tenants and 1 squatter are residing in three
houses. Besides through these maaevs it was possible to avoid the
loss of many of the public utilities like bus stand, handpumps, water
tanks, panchayat biuldings etc. and cultural properties like temples
except three bus-stops and 7 small temples. The only commercial
structures requiring relocation are 11 movable shops. There are 10
residential structures and one defunct factory at Baska bypass coming
in the project area.
10.0       RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
The basic objective of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is to ensure
that the PAPs from the 'corridor of impact' of VHRP get adequate
comperisation and assistance so as to achieve or improve their pre-
project economical status in th.eshortest time and retain their potential
for further economic growth. The major components of the RAP are
described in following sections.
10.1       Loss of Land
Considering the project design and its deviations from the ROW, the
VHRP covering 31.5 km of road improvement will require acquisition
of an estimated 107.93 ha of land in Vadodara and Panchmahal
districts.
In the absence of information about the profile of land tenants, the
entitlement for tenants is based on the estimated land under tenancy
from the plot numbers identified. The total land under tenancy is
estimated as 25.45 ha (16.72 ha. - irrigated and 7.73 ha.- un-irrigated).

Environmental Impact Assessment
Vadodara - Halol Road                                   Executive Summary
Since only severely affected tenants are to be provided land equal to
MEL, it is assumed that such requirements will be limited to 10 tenants
and the remaining will be assisted through loans.
Only one case of industrial land loss of a defunct factory at Baska
village exists. The compensation will be paid after its engineering
valuation.
In case of the govemment land, since the GoG is a member
(shareholder) of SPV, and since the project (road) will be transferred
back to the government, no compensation is proposed to be paid for
such government lands. As the gram panchavat / government land
holding is yet to be identified through Joint Measuring Survey (JMS), it
is proposed to pay compensation to the Gram Panchayat as alienation
charges from the contingency provision.
10.2       Loss of Structures
As per IL&FS policies, all house owners are compensated by a house
-2            ~ of area equal to the area of the lost structure. In case the area of the
house is less than the minimum government norm for single family
dwelling, a house of minimum area is provided findira Awas Vikas
Yojana). For squatters, irrespective of the size fcr the present dwelling,
an ownership house of minimum area as per government norm is
provided. The beneficiary under this case however cannot sell the
house till completion of the concession period of the project.
In the case of tenants, it is expected that they will re-establish
themselves elsewhere and the IL&FS policy entitles them only for a
shff&QaanCe. However inte present cases. the tenar snrD
ecorn-3vnally weaker sections anid 9amviig in damaged;muffs due to
financial constraints. It is difficult to envisage that they will be able to
shift to altemate accommodation and re-establish themselves. As a
special case, therefore, these tenants will also be provided with a
dwelling unit of minimum area. The house owner will be compensated
for the land and structure based on valuation.
A shifting allowance of Rs. 1000 will be provided to each of the 10
PAPs.
10.3       Institutional Arrangements
There is a need to focus on two main issues:
* Issues related to LA and alternate land allocation for severely
affected PAPs; and
v  Issues related to Economic Rehabilitation (ER) of PAFs.
Land acquisition (LA) is primarily the government responsibility and a
mutually acceptable compensation at market rate is to be arrived at
through negotiations. The SPV is committed to pay the difference
Kirloskar Consultants Limited

Vadodara - Ha/al Road                                   Executive Summary
between the compensation amount as per govemment rates and the
negotiated settlement price of the land. The procedure therefore will
involve interaction and consensus building with the PAFs on an
agreeable fair rate of compensation. LA for the project is the
responsibility of the Revenue Department which is done through a
Special Deputy Collector or District Land Acquisition Officer (LAO) at
the district level. Thus, a district-wise Compensatory Land
Procurement Committee for each of the two districts is proposed to
facilitate identification, purchase and transfer/allocation of land to the
severely affected PAPs.
Economic Rehabilitation (ER): This is one of the critical areas of
project implementation. It is proposed to set up two committees: (i)
Project Level R&R Monitoring Committee to ensure that the pronosed
ER measures are being implemented as planned, make policy
decisions to facilitate implementation of the same and give necessary
administrative decisions/directions as required; and (ii) District Level
R&R Implementing Committee to implement the identified ER program.
In this context, it is necessary that a NGO experienced in tA
procedures and in implementing income generation schemes work
closely with SPV and governmern. Thus the implementation
responsibility through an institutional arrangement will need to be
developed around the SPV, GoG Representative and NGO
involvement.
10.4       Implementation Schedule
The first activity of the project, as far as LA is concemn4 is the issue of
a notification u/s 4(1) of the LA Act, 1894 as amended in 1984.
Compensation needs to be paid to the PAPs before the start of actual
project construction. In case of any delay in LA proceedings, R&B will
take lands from their owners on 'consent basis'. The implementation
schedule is reflected in the annual phasing of budget funds wherein it
is assumed that 75% of land acquisition and related ER will be done in
the first year itself, while the bafince will be done in the second year.
10.5       Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) will be done simultaneously with the
implementation of the LA & RAP. Besides conventional government
monitoring, an extemal agency will be engaged to meaningfully and
realistically evaluate R&R programmes on periodic basis. Further
arrangements for M&E will be at project level (by SPV) and district
level (by  District Level ER  Implementation  Committees  and
Compensatory Land Acquisition Committee).

Vadodara - Halol Road                                         Introduction
1.0        INTRODUCTION
1.1        BACKGROUND
The Vadodara - Halol Road which links Vadodara city to the industrial
town of Halol had been identified as one of the most important State
Highways in the State of which requires immediate upgradation by the
strategic options study of the state road network instituted by the
Government of Gujarat in 1995. This road also forms part of the route
to the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi from southem
parts of Gujarat and Maharashtra. The Roads and Building (R&B)
IF =Department, Government of Gujarat (GoG) and Infrastructure Leasing
and Financial Services Limited (IL&FS) have entered into a
Memorandum  of Agreement to  develop  and  implement the
widening/strengthening of the Vadodara-Halol section of this state
highway (SH87) on a commercial format. The project road extends
from the intersection of Vadodara bypass to the intersection of the
Halol bypass. The IL&FS had made a preliminary feasibility study of
the proposed project in early 1996 with technical assistance from
Kirloskar Consultants Limited. The preliminary feasibility study covered
limited traffic surveys, estimation of tiravff;e h rates, collection of
road inventory data, rough cost estimation, assessment of willingness
.to pay toll, determination of toll, financi mid economic analysis,
preliminary environment and social assessme= and identification of
risk parameters. The preliminary feasibility study has concluded that to
service the projected traffic, four laning of &,-e road is needed and the
project is economically viable. The preliminary financial analysis
indicated that the project can be taken up on a commercial format.
%fl1sk=C==ftants Limited is retained by the IL&TS to cXany out the
4etaw4ed 4easibility study of this ,,.jtfor implemerntation of tiL project
on a commercial format. The setting of the Project Road and the study
area are shown in Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2 respectively. The project
proposal involves enhancing the carriageway capacity to provide a high
level of service to the traffic. The users will be charged a toll to recover
the cost of implementation of the project.
Besides examining the technical, economical and financial feasibility of
the proposed project, the study aims at carrying out environmental and
social impact assessment of the proposed project to ascertain if any
alignment modification is required, to identify environmental and social
risks involved and the mitigation measures thereof.

1.2        OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE DETAILED FEASIBILITY
STUDY
The main objectives of the study (which includes traffic studies with
preliminary engineering for technical options, environmental impact
assessment) as defined in the Terms of Reference (TOR) are:
to carry out a feasibility study for the proposed road project to establish
its technical, environmental, economic and financial viability; and
.  to undertake risk identification and -assessment, including risk analysis.
The technical studies involve necessary field investigation and surveys
for. preparing preliminary engineering design of the project and
estimating the project cost to a level of accuracy of +/- 10%. The
environmental impact assessment study is expected to prepare a well
researched and documented environment impact assessment report
(EIA) with due consideration to public opinion and sensitivities. The
EIA  Study follows the guidelines stipulated by the Ministry of
Environment and  Forests  (MoEF), Government of India for
environmental impact assessment of highway projects.
1.3        SPECIFIC SCOPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (EA)
STUDY
A 5 km radius area along the proposed and existing alignment is
considered for the study of various environmental attributes in general.
For detailed studies an area within 1 km distance on -either side o7 the
alignment is considered.
The broad scope of the study is:
to conduct a literature review and to collect additional data
relevant to the study area;
*    to undertake environmental monitoring so as to establish the
baseline environmental status of the study area;
*    to assess the impacts on environmental attributes due to the
construction and operation of the proposed project road including
the impacts of quarrying operations on the existing environmental
status of the area;
* .    to prepare an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) outlining
the measures for improving the environmental quality and
budgetary cost estimation for implementation;

monitored subsequent to the implementation of the proposed
project; and
to document suitable Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the
Project Affected Persons (PAPs).
1.4        THE PROJECT AREA
The proposed project road passes through two districts viz., Vadodara
and Panchmahals of Gujarat state. Vadodara district is situated in
eastem Gujarat between rivers Narmada and Mahi. Vadodara is the
12m" largest district in the state. Measuring 7,788 sq.km. and
accounting for 3.97% of the state's total geographical area, it lies
betwen 210 00' and 230 00' North and 740 00' and 740 10' East
longitudes. It is bounded on the north by Panchmahals district, on the
north-west by Kheda district, on the south and south-west by Bharuch
district, on the east by Madhya Pradash Sate and the south-east by
the Dhulia district of Maharashtra state. The district is formed by twelve
talukas including Vadodara. Situated on t   g .-k of Vishvamitr,
Vadodara city is the third largest city in the state with an area of 670
sq.km constituting about 8.6% of the district area. The district takes its
name from its only city and its largest urban center, Vadodara city.
The district Panchmahals is called so, because it originally consisted of
5 mahals, viz., Godhra, Kalol, Halol, Dohad and Jhalod. It
approeimately lies between 730 15' and 740 30' East loaguiMde and 200
30' and 230 30' North latitude- Jt ba an area of 8866 sq.km and 11
tahsils including Halol and Godhra. It is bounded on the north by
Sabarkantha district of Gujarat state and the Banswara district of
Rajasthan, to the west by Vadodara and Kaira districts, to the south by
the Vadodara district and the Madhya Pradesh.
On the basis of physiographic setup, Vadodara district has been
divided in two zones viz., the eastiem hilly zone comprising Chhota
Udeour, Jabugam and Navadi talukas and the rest level plain and
undulating area. Except the westem part comprising Kalol and parts of
Halol, Godhara which constitute a plain country, Panchmahals district
is a hilly tract. Near Halol the plain is dissected by rivers and breaks
into the spurs and ridges, that latitudes centers in the massive hill of
Pavagadh (829.36 m above MSL).
The climate in the districts is characterized by a hot summer, and
general dryness except during the monsoon season. The average
annual rainfall in the districts vary between 953.8 mm to 988.0 mm.

Vadodara - Halol Road                                          Introduction
1.5        STUDY APPROACH
Reconnaissance survey was conducted by the consultants to identify
the major environmental issues. Accordingly field surveys were
undertaken to determine the ambient air quality, meteorological
conditions (concurrent to the air quality studies), water quality,
ecological status, noise levels, soil characteristics, prevailing land use
and collection of data on existing industries along the project road. The
field studies were supported by data collection from secondary sources
for meteorology, land use, hydrogeology and socio-economic aspects.
The sampling locations were identified on the basis of:
* predominant wind directions in the study area as recorded by Indian
-Meteorological Department (IMD) at Vadodara;
* existing topography and location of surface water bodies like ponds,
canals and rivers;
-  location of villages/towns/sensitive areas;
- areas which represent baseline conditions and pollution pockets in
the area;
* accessibility of the sites and availabi4 gf power for the monitoring
equipment; and
. collation and analysis of secondary data on baseline conditions for
various environmental attributes.
The field studies wem conducted for a peTii tf orn mDnth to
determine the existing conditions of various environmeniaibutes as
outlined in Table-1.1. The monitoring stations were commissioned on
24h August, 1996 and were operated till 25t" September, 1996.

* assessment of the existing baseline (pre-project) environmental
status;
* identification of the extent of incremental impacts on community and
natural resourcez,; and
*  identification of mitiaation measures and monitoring fequirements
during construction and operational phase.

process is an integral part of the business operations of IL&FS. The
overall goal is contribution to sustainable development. To achieve
this, the Institution commits each project to the following three cardinal
principles:
* enhance quality of life and environment in -and around the project
area by conserving natural resources and addressing the legitimate
concerns of relevant stakeholders, especially project affected
persons;
* prevent adverse environmental and social situations: and
. mitigate possible adverse environmental and social impacts.
The EIA has been prepared by the consultants within this policy
framework of IL&FS. It also addresses the legal issues on environment
and social aspects applicable to the project.
1.6.2       Key Environmental Legislation
The principal Environmental Regulatory Agency in India is the Ministry
of Environment and Forests (MoEF), New Delhi. MoEF formulates
environmental policies and accords environmental clearance for the
large projects (sector-wise listing done by MoEF'.
Many State and Central legislation have a ½a.ing on environment.
Laws on "environment protection" can be broadly classified in terms of
focus areas viz,
;  .  Polion;
*     Natural resources; and
.  .  Linkage between pollution and natural resources.
The status of key environmental legislation in India is given in Table-

Movement of hazardous chemicals by road is governed by Central
Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 (rules 129 through 137). Besides
regulations and precautions to be taken while transporting such goods,
the rules stipulate availability of a Transport Emergency Card
(TREMCARD) with the driver of the carrier which shall provide
information on hazardous nature of the chemical carried and also
precautions required to handle emergencies such as spillage and fire.
The carriers are also expected to prominently exhibit warning signs to
inform the public about the hazardous character of their cargo.

description and objectives of the project, description of the project area,
scope and methodology of the study. It also provides information on key
environmental legislation and the standards relevant to attributes of
concern in the project.
Chapter 2  -    Project Details
This chapter bnefly presents the bacdiu-d fntmnation on the project
altematives evolved through engineering design considerations. The
altematives were screened for environmental and social impacts. Some
of those which were likely to result  in adverse impacls of larger
magnitude, where options were also available, were omitted. The
suggested altemative - She Project" - based on these considerations is
discussed in this chapter giving its major components. The design
standards and construction methods are also included. Traffic
projections are also summarised in this chapter.
Chapter 3  -    Baseline Environmental Status
This chapter presents the methodology and findings of field studies
undertaken with respect to ambient air, water, soils, noise levels and
ecology to define the existing environmental status in the area. It also
presents the meteorological conditions which govern the air quality
impacts, a major concem during the construction and operation of the
road. The location of industries along the existing road and the existing
land use are depicted based on a reconnaissance survey. Other relevant
secondary data are included on geology, hydrology, hydrogeology and
ecology from published information. The major social issues are also
discussed with specific reference to socio-economic aspects and land
acquisition.

2.0         PROJECT DETAILS
2.1         NEED FOR THE PROJECT
The traffic studies identify that the existing two lane carriageway
accommodates 18000 PCU in a day, which according to standards is
close to capacity. The average journey speed observed on the existing
road is 40 kmph, which when considered with limited scoc:e for
overtaking, fix the level of service as 'poor'. Delays are experienced due
to cattle crossing all along the project road and pedestrian cross ng at
the villages. The friction due to developments at the villages contrinute to
the reduction in level of service and increase in accidents at *hese
locations.- The single carriageway at the current level of service .vhere
overtaking becomes risky, also contributes to the reduction in level of
safety on the project road. Addition of a two lane carriagewa, with
directional segregation is therefore necessary to enhance the le.-els of
service and safety for projected future traffic.
-   2.1.1      Industrial Activity
Due to growth inducing industrial policies enforced by successive state
govemments, Vadodara district shows subs;i  rowth in working
factories between 1970 and 1980, a stagnation between 1980 anc 19990
and significant growth since 1990. The district of Panchamahals snow a
significant growth between 1980 and 1990 wlar-h is naintained n 90's
also.
Both these districts also witness a high growth of Small Scale Inaustrial
(SSI) units at a consistent pace which could be largely atnrhuted to the
attractive pblicies floated by tte gvnm ents. But, they do not show
prominence of any specific industry group. There are large number of
chemical, metal and engineering units in these districts.
2.1.2       Future Industrial Growth
As a result of growth induced industrial-policies, large scale inves-rnents
have been forthcoming at a rapid rate. As of now, about 2200 projects
with an estimated investment of Rs. 899.73 billion generating 420.000
jobs are under implementation in Gujarat. Among the project inf iJence
districts, Vadodara tops with a share of 170% of projects. Panchar-rahal's
share is about 3.5%.
2.1.3       Traffic Projections
The unrestricted growth traffic forecast indicates that the tota! traffic
volume will reach a level of 178,494 PCU by the year 2030. The details
are indicated in Table-2. 1 and also depicted in Figure-2. 1.

Vadodara - Ha/ol Road                                          Project Details
The objective of the project is to enhance the level of service of the
Project Road from  the current poor' to good' and sustain it at
acceptable levels in the next 20 to 30 years. To prepare a project
design which would meet the project objective, examination of the
technical / engineering alternatives for the following is considered
essential:
* Level of service criteria:
* Alignment options based on
- geometrics
- environmental and social aspects,
- Intersections;
*  Highway crossing;
* Pavement; and
& Cross drainage works.
Three options (see section 2.2.2 below) are also discussed therein to
increase the Level of Service and Safety by addition of a two lane
carriageway (to the existing two lane highway) with directional
segregation so as to provide a 4-lane dividtd =T-riageway with a design
speed of 100 kmph and also control access to the road and implement
the tolling concept. Alternatives arising o¶ vf engineering design
considerations are discussed in the Main Repot.
2.2.2       Project Options
The traffic studies identify that the existing two lane carriageway
accommodates 18000 PCU in a day, which according to standards is
closew to  Xc     and much above the design servioe   ke. The
average journey speed observad on Xhe Project Road is 4D kmph,
which, while considered with limited scope for overtaking, fix the level
of service as 'Poor'. The friction due to developments at the villages
contribute to the reduction in level of service and increase in accidents
at these locations. The single carriageway at the current level of
service, where overtaking becomes risky, also contributes to the
reduction in level of safety on the ProLect Road.
The initial project concept involved widening and strengthening of the
existing road to a 4 lane divided carriageway with a design speed of 100
kmph and recovering the cost through charging toll. Later the project
concept has been broadend to include provision of service roads to
provide added benefits to the local users.
Addition of a two lane carriageway with directional segregation will
enhance the levels of service and safety to very good standards for the
existing traffic. It is estimated that this addition will sustain a fair level
of service for about 20 years based on the traffic forecast. From the
points of view of the effect of direct access on the level of service,
segregation of slow moving vehicles and the requirements of the local

population, there are primarily two options of carriageway configuration
(variants to these primary options are considered to address the toll
concepts) for accomplishing this expansion.
Options of carriageway configuration:
Option 1, envisages strengthening and widening the Project Road to a
4-lane divided carriageway with provision of service road only at
locations with continuous development, as in villages and in a cluster of
factories. This will entail partial access control. The right-of-way
requirement and the organisation. of various ROW  elements of the
Option 1 are shown in Figure-2.3.
Option 2, envisages provision of a service road of single lane
carriageway on either side for the full lenqth of the Project Road. This
will. provide full access control and segregation of slow moving
vehicies. The full access control and traffic segregation will improve the
level of service and safety. The right-of-way (ROW) requirement and
the organisation of various ROW elements of the Option 2 are shown
in Figure-2.4.
There is a road side development at few locations along the Project
Road where restriction to ROW  requiO ts may be warranted to
minimize the displacement of people/struc±w-s. The ROW requirement
at such locations may be limited to 36 m as shown in Figure-2.5.
Option 3 will have the same specifications as in Option 2 for the main
carriageway, but the provision of service rad will not be for the full
length but only at places required to meet the access control
requirements and the movement of local trips of non-commercial
vehicles and trips within the Project Road limits. As in the case of
Option 2, it is observed that for Option 3, the carriageway of 60 m is
required and needs to be reduced to 36 m at few locations (Figure-
2.5).

Vadodara - Halol Road                                           Project Details
Examination of the alignment altematives in the context of social and
environmental impacts is of significance at this detailed feasibility stage
since the realignment arising out of R&R and environmental issues was
not addressed at the prefeasibility stage.
The section below summarizes the initial assessment from
environmental and social angle for the alignment along the existing
carriageway as originally suggested by GoG. It is observed that out of a
total stretch of 33 kms., except at four road sections totaling
approximately 5 kms., highway for 28 kms can be designed to run
along the existing carriageway. However at villages viz., Jarod, Asoj,
Khandewadi and Baska, major difficulties arising due to the following
reasons were anticipated:
1. friction due to pedestrian interferences;
2. loss of residential, commercial and religious structures leading to
Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) issues; and
3. environmental and social impaiaes.
The environmental and social impacts aig out of the improvement at
curves on the horizontal alignment along the existing carriageway
running through Jarod (Figure-2.6, Asoj (Figure-2.7), Khandewadi
(Figure-2.8) and Baska (Figure-2.9) with restricted ROW of 36 m and
fulfilling the requirement of the design speed of 100 kmph have been
summarized in Table-2.3.

The observations in Table 2.5, indicate very low level of community
activity near the pond and therefore reduction of level of service
due to friction from the proposed development is expected to be
low. However, in future the useage of the pond may become more
intensive and cause higher friction with the traffic. It is thus
recommended that for running the alignment to the right of existing
_                  road, that the following measures4argeted
* to maintain the storage capacity and the surface area of the
pond by expanding the pond on the opposite side and
a to reduce the need for road crossing by the community by
providing an overhead water tank and bathing facilities on the
same side (towards habitation) of the road should be
undertaken

magnitude for any of the alternatives and do not lead to a preference of
any particular alignment over the others
2.3         RECOMMENDED ALIGNMENT FOR THE PROJECT
The horizontal alignment for the Project has been recommended based
on the detailed studies on alignment in the preceding sections and other
engineering considerations. The subsequent Environmental Assessment
is done with respect to this as the 'Project' and is considered as "Build
Option". A comparison of the "Build" and No Build" options is presented
in Chapter 5 after assessing the -environmental impacts of the Project
Road. Option 3 has been found suitable and thus selected for the
carriageway.
2.3.1       Project Components
The project mainly consists of strengthening the existing carriageway
with a flexible overlay formation with two additional lanes separated by a
median and provision of paved and earthen shoulders. A typical cross-
section is for the base case shtn_ -in jFigar-2.4. In the base case in
addition to the above service roads of single lane carriageway will be
provided on either side. The geome. -:fovements require total
realignment at few locations.
2.3 2       Earthwork
Since there is no cut areas, the soil required for the Project needs to be
obtained locally from borrow areas. The probable boro am-as
identified in the close vicinity along the existing highway through
reconnaissance survey are shown in Figure-2.10 and given in Table-2.6
(the suitability or otherwise of the soil of these areas has been
confirmed through laboratory tests).
The overall material requirement for earthfill material and stone
aggregates for Option 3 have been estimated to be about 0.7 million
tonnes and 1.2 million tonnes respectively. The stone aggregate will be
taken from the established Sawaliya quarry which is located at about 30
km from Halol. In addition to the above, sand (0.4 million tonnes) will be
taken from Goma river which is about 15 km from Halol towards
Pavagadh.

Vadodara - Halol Road                                         Project Details
All the borrow areas identified are in land under the possession of the
government (either state or local-self government). Five such areas fall
on land where there is no cultivation. For the areas at the boundaries of
tanks in each village, the village chiefs want the tanks to be expanded
for enhancement of storage and if it could be established at no cost to
the Panchayat they would be prepared to allow removal of soil from the
area adjacent to the tanks. It is desirable to avoid borrow pits in the
ROW as the pits, if not restored to the original condition, can affect the
subgrade and the pavement, should water accumulates in the open
borrow pits.
2.3.3       Design Provisions for Access and Crossing
Access to lndividual Properties:
In the case of Option 3, the access between service roads must be a
grade separated facility, one in every five kilometres approximately.
Alternatively, the crossing can be provided by manned crossings where
the expected crossing volume is very low. Accordingly, grade
separated crossings are proposed at km 11/250 and two each at the
three villages of Jarod, Asoj and Baska. At-grade manned crossings
are proposed at km 18/0 and km 33/300. Al a-gabe crossings, traffic
from service road will not be allowed to enter the main carriageway. A
secondary toll plaza is proposed in the Option 3 at km 22/500 where
..avli Road and Waghodia Road joins the Project Road.
Access Between Carriageways:
In Option 3, the access between the carriageways through median
openings need to be very limited because of the service road provision.
2.3.4       Bridges And Culverts Design Options
There are 17 RCC pipe drains, 12 RCC slab drains, 3 minor bridges
and 3 major bridges along the existing roaa. The project involves work
of the following types as far as the cross drainage works and bridges
are concemed:
. Repair of existing CD works and bridges. including widening of
. carriage-way;
• Reconstruction of existing bridges CD works where warranted;
* Construction of new bridges and CD works for the additional two
lanes;
* Construction of new bridges CD works for the service roads;
* Construction of additional CD works if warranted; and
. There are 20 additional balancing culverts proposed to effectively
address the drainage issues.

2.3.5       Designated Pedestrian Crossings
There are 14 villages along the Project Road and the people in these
villages cross the road for various purposes such as for water, cattle
feeding, agricultural needs, using the ponds etc. There are four cart
tracks crossing the bypass alignment at Jarod village. The Project
Road is proposed to be improved to have a travel speed of 100 kmph
which increase the danger to pedestrians crossing the Project Road.
Two alternatives have been considered and they are (1) pedestrian
underpass I overbridge and (2) designated pedestrian crossing. The
provision of pedestrian underpass/overbridge is costly and its utilisation
is debatable and hence the Consultants recommend provision of
designated pedestrian crossing or underpasses. The traffic shall be
warned of designated pedestrian crossings with traffic signs and
-focused lighting arrangement. The focused lighting arrangement wMil
reduce the possibility of accidents in the night. It is proposed to
determine the need and location of such crossings through Public
- Information and Consultations and supplemented by a reasonable
criteria of providing such crossings in the absence of specific demand.
2.3.6       Otlher Requirements
The approximate quantum of water required for the project is 330
million liters. The precise source of watertias not been identified in the
feasibility study, but it is assumed that the lead for water is within 2
kms. Considering the use of ponds ~a Asoj and Khandewadi.
exclusions are suggested in the environment management plan.
The total labour requirement is about 60,000 man days, whici is about
250-300 persons per day during the peak period. There .eeds to be
minimum of two labour camps with 100-1 50 people. However, details like
the number of labour, location of the labour camps, location and number
of asphalting plants etc. can only be decided on finalization of the
contract (when schedule of execution of the work based on capacity of
the contractor(s) to take up different sections at the same time, type of
equipment used etc. are known).-
2.3.7       Schedule for Implementation
The construction period for the project is expected to be two years..
Detailed schedule of major construction activities is given in the Table-
2.7. This was proposed to be started in Nov. 97 as per the original
schedule. However, the revised schedule will be on similar lines after
completion of the pre-project formalities. Thus the table is only indicative
of the nature of the activities and their likely duration.

3.0         BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS
3.1        INTRODUCTION
This chapter incorporates the description of the existing environmental
setting in the study area for the project which extends upto a distance of
1 km on either side of the alignment for conducting detailed studies and
5 km on either side of the alignment for collecting data from secondary
sources. The total length of the project road is 33 km with the initial
stretch from km 8/300 to km 34/300 falling in Vadodara and Vaghodia
tahsils of Vadodara district while the remaining (km 34/300 to km
40/300) falling in Halol tahsil of Panchamahals district.
Reconnaissance and survey of the study area was carmed out by the
consuTtants team in the month of August, 1996 for the selection and
finalization of the sampling locations. Field monitorina for various
environmental attributes started from 24h August, 1996. Continuous
monitoring of meteorological parameters has been carned out for a
period of one month at two stations to establish the meteorological
conditions existing at the time of the sut-ve. VvriitoTing for ambient air
quality, noise levels and continuous monitoring of NOx. CO and HC
levels during peak traffic periods was carried wit -at various locations at
selected sampling frequencies. Traffic count sturIies also formed a part
of the field surveys which were helpful in conrelating the monitoring
results. Samples for water and soil w-a- ro4lw-t  Surveys were
-             conducted for assessing the ecological status and location of industries
along the alignment. Data from secondary sources has been compiled
for hydrogeology, landuse socio-economic and cultural aspects aspects
to supplement the field data in presenting.the baseline envifonmental
status of the area.
3.2         METEOROLOGY
The micro-meteorological parameters regulate the transport and
diffusion of pollutants released into the atmosphere. The principal
variables which affect the micro-meteorology are wind speed. wind
direction, atmospheric stability, inversion conditions and topography of
the area.
The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) broadly divides the year
into four seasons as under:
Winter season -         December to February
i:::J*  Pre-monsoon season -    March to June
Monsoon season -        June to September
.     Post Monsoon Season -   October to November
Meteorological data collected from secondary sources (nearest IMD
station) provides long term data which is good for averaging purposes,
while the data generated at site is useful to characterise the

3)    Cloud Cover
Clear bright weather prevails with clear to lightly clouded (1-2 octas)
skies for more than 24 days in a month during post monsoon season
(October - November) and winter season (December - February), During
early premonsoon season (April - May) a similar situation prevails. It is
only the monsoon period (June - September) that moderate (3-5 Octas)
to heavy (6-8 Octas) clouded skies are commonly observed for more
than 20 days in a month due to the southwest monsoon. Monthly
variations of cloud cover is presented in Appendix 3. 1
4)    Upper Air Data
The upper air climatological data assumes significance as the
assessment of air pollutants dispersion is influenced by these conditions.
The nearest station to Vadodara recording upper winds, is Ahmedabad
situated at a distance of 80 km in the North of Vadodara and the same
data has been presented for the analysis as the upper air data will not
change significantly at this distance for the present case.
Appendix 3.1 presents details of data available on the following:
* ground based inversions
* elevated inversions
* mixing heights
Data lor The oc=.rrence of ground based inverskns is available for 00
GMT i.e., 5.30 am and 12 GMT i.e., 5.30 pm for Ahmedabad. Ground
based inversions tend to prevail more at 5.30 am in post rnons on and
winter seasons (November - March) and least in the monsoon period. In
the evening, however, the ground based inversions are almost absent.
Elevated inversions at Ahmedabad whose base starts at heights below
100 m tend to occur more at 5.30 am in the months of October and
February - April. The same are almost absent in the evening at 5.30 pm.
Secondary data on mixing heights for Ahmedabad compiled by Mr. B.
Satyanarayana, Department of Meteorology and Oceanography, Andhra
University are available for morning at 8.30 am. The mean monthly
mixing height is the least in the month of December (90 m) while it is
highest in the month of August-September (210 m).
i'       3.2.3       Meteorological Survey at Site
The methodology adopted for monitoring surface observations was as
per the standard norms laid down by Bureau of India Standards (BIS)
and India Meteorology Department (IMD).
Meteorological measurements were recorded at village Dhanjipur at km
8.4 and Halol at km 41.6 for a period of one month from 24th August

1996 to 25th September 1996. At Dhanjipur the Meteorological station
was established on top of the P.W.D. store laterally at a distance of
about 25 m from the edge of the road near Golden chowk. At Halol town,
the station was setup on top of P.W.D. quarters laterally at about 40 m
away from the centre of the road. Hourly data was recorded continuously
for 24 hours at both the locations. The data generated has been
compared vis-a-vis the meteorological data generated by IMD
meteorology station at Vadodara for ascertaining its validity. On site
monitoring was undertaken for various meteorological parameters listed
in Table-3.3 in order to generate the site specific data.

Vadodara - Halol Piad                               Baseline Environmental Status
3.2.5       Observations Based on Field Campaign
The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) records the data at two
times a day viz., 0830 hrs and 1730 hrs. The site specific data have
been recorded at hourly interval. On comparison of site specific data
generated for one month vis-a-vis the IMD data, slight variations were
found. The following observations are brought out:
*    The temperature recorded on site compared vis-a-vis the 10
years [MD data, slight variations in temperature levels were
*                          found. The temperatures recorded at site were in the range of
30.4°C to 32.5CC. whereas the value recorded at (MD is 31.5-C.
Evaporation rates in the range of 5.4 to 6.1 mm/day were
recorded at site during the study period, whereas the values
recorded at IMD is 4.6 mm/day;
Slight variations ware observed in case of wind speeds and
direction. The variations may be due to location, frequency and
time of recording and height of the station, which is different
nif  iiviv dan; ard
*    The data generated at continuous monitoring station when
compared with the data recorded al 4AD are found to be fairly
consistent. Based on the above analysis, one can conclude that
data generated on site is    dtaypatible with the regional
meteorology and therefore, data collected from IMD station can
be used for predicting air pollution level during the initial period.
3.3         AIR OIJALf¶Y
The ambient air quality with respect to the study zone of 5 km
surrounding the existing and proposed road forms the baseline
information The study area represents mostly rural environment with
about 40 industrial establishments along the road. The various sources
of air pollution in the region are vehicular traffic, dust arising from
unpaved village roads, domesfic fuel buming and industrial emissions.
The prime objective of baseline air quality survey is to assess the
existing air quality of the area. This will also be useful is assessing the
conformity to standards of the ambient air quality during the operation of
the road.
This section describes the selection of sampling locations, including the
me-hodology of sampling and analytical techniques with frequency of
sa mpling. The results of the survey are also presented.

3.3.1       Methodology
3.3.1.1    Selection of Sampling Locations
The baseline status of the ambient quality has been assessed through
an ambient air quality monitoring network. The design of monitoring
network in the air quality surveillance programme has been based on the
following considerations:
0  *    meteorological conditions:
*             *    topography of the study area: and
*    likely impact areas.
Location of the ambient air quality monitoring stations were selected on
basis of the wind pattern recorded at IMD, Vadodara over past 30 years
to represent upwind and downwind air quality status with respect to the
road. Locations were selected to represent highest impact area due to
road traffic or to represent background concentrations and for model
calibration.
Ambient Air Quality Monitoring (AAQM) stations were set up at seven
locations for sampling SPM and NOx at eigit' imudy *ierval. . Hourly
observations for NOx, CO and HC during peak t±afic flow period along
with concurrent traffic count were also made to ascertain air quality
levels along the project road at two I n~i- -mdpSa and B--ka
villages. At each station, monitoring was carried out at one location in
the upwind direction and at two locations in the predominant downwind
direction. The predominant wind direction at both locations was decided
based on The results obtained from the meteorological survey carried out
at both locations. AAQM stations were aiso set up at the predominant
downwind locations. The locations of the selected AAQ stations and their
environmental setting is given in the Table-3.5 and Figure-3.8.

Vadodara - Halol Road                            Baseline Environmental Status
3.3.2       Instruments Used for Sampling
High volume samplers of Envirotech instruments were used for
monitoring Total Suspended Particulate Matter (TSPM), and NOx. Mylar
bags with pulse pumps were deployed for collection of eight hourly
samples of Carbon monoxide (CO) and Hydrocarbons (HC). Gas
chromatography techniques have been used for estimation of CO and
HC.
3.3.3      Sampling and Analytical Techniques
1 ) Total Suspended Particulate Matter, and NOx at Monitoring
Stations:
TSPM present in ambient air is sucked through the cyclone. Samples of
gases are drawn at a flow rate of 0.2 liters per minute and are analysed
on the same day of sample collection in the field laboratory located at
Vadodara.
TSPM have been estimated by gravimetai= 4nalbo  Jacobs-Hochheiser
method (IS-5182 Part VI, 1975) has been adopted for estimation of NOx.
Calibration:
Calibration charts have been prepared for all gaseous pollutants. The
calibration is carried out when new absorbing solutions are prepared.
2)    CO and HC at Monitoring Stations:
Mviar bags with pulse pumps    w e   for collection sef -eigt 4thomly
samples of Carbon monoxide (CO). The CO levels were analysed by
Gas-chromatography.
Calibration of Gas Chromatograph:
Calibration has been carried out wjth known gas concentrations and
chromatographs have been taken. The area under the curve
corresponding to the peak of specific gas gives the concentration. The
determined concentration is cross checked with the known value of that
particular gas.
3)    NOx at Continuous Monitoring Station
The continuous NOx instrument operates on a chemiluminescence
technique. When flowing through the converter, the chemiluminescence
measured  within  the  reaction  chamber  represents  the  NOx
concentration. The instrument records readings at every 5 seconds
interval and finally displays 30 minute average.

Vadodara - Halol Road                              Baseline Environmental Status
Calibration of Continuous NOx analyzer:
Calibration was undertaken by using precision calibrator 102 NS
manufactured by Thermo Environmental Instruments Inc. USA. The
calibrator has both S02/air cylinder and a NO/NO2 cylinder attachment
to accommodate calibration of two types of gases with one calibrator.
The restructures or capillaries are chosen to provide a dilution ratio of
approximately 100 to 1. Once the dilution ratio is established, a cylinder
of gas is selected with a known concentration when diluted will give a
value of gas necessary to calibrate the analyzer in question to 80% of
the full scale range being used.
A zero air supply capable of delivering upto five liter per minute of zero
air at approximately 10 psi is required. A high concentration of S02/air or
S02/N2 obtained from a compressed cylinder, whose concentration is
determined by the dilution ratio and the value of S02 desired.
NOx:
Sample output of calibrator is connected to NOx analyzer. Calibration is
carried out (1) upon interruption of normal instrument operation for more
than a few days. (2) after any major repair or (3) whenever the span and
zero shift is more than 15% i.e. while passing zero air, the display of the
instrument should be within 0.015 ppm; and while passing NOx of known
concentration, the display of the instrumert stioud be within + 10% of
the known gas concentration in ppm.
-  33.4     Presentation of Results
The detailed results of ambient air quality monitoring are presented in
Appendix 3.2. Table 3.6 summarizes the daily average (24 hour) SPM
and NOx monitored results based on the three continuous eight hourly
periods over 24. hours giv#3n in Table-A3.2-1. These are depicted in
Figure-3.9.

3.3.5          Traffic Studies
Along with the continuous air quality monitoring, traffic studies were also
carded out concurrently to characterize the type, category and number of
vehicles observed during the survey to correlate with the air monitoring
results. Table-3.7 and Table-3.8 illustrate concurrent traffic volume
counted near the road stretch near Anandpura and Baska.

3.3.6      Observations Based on Field Campaign
The observations are based on a perusal of the field campaign results
(Table-3.6 and Appendix 3.2) are summarized below:
Fixed Locations
The sampling locations in residential areas at about 30 m to 60 m away
*  from the existing road indicates conceatmi^- fer SPM in the range of
39.9 to 132.3 pg/M3 and NOx in the range of 7.8 to 30.4 pg/m3.
The baseline location at village Paladi which is about 1.5 km from the
existing road indicates 24 hour average concentrations for SPM and
NOx as 54.2 pg/M3 and 11.3 pg/M3 respectiveh,.
The concentrations for SPM and NOx at highway junctions al ai tSawn
and village Jarod are observed to be in the range of 30.2 to 115.3 pg/r
-   1.1 It  .9 ,g/m3 respecvely.
- e Continuous Monitoring for NOx, CO and HC
The continuous monitoring of NOx in the two downwind directions at 18
m and 33 m near Anandpura indicates maximum concentrations in the
range of 30.08 to 46.99 pg/M3 with the average levels in the range of
15.63 to 28.73 pg/mr  . Similarly the-eoncentrations in the upwind location
at 70 m indicates maximum concentrations in the range of 11.28 to
3
15.04 pg/rn with minimum concentrations in the range of 3.51 to 4.64
pt/m3. CO levels at all the locations in the upwind and downwind
direction were observed to be less than non detectable limit of 1145
,ug/r3. Whereas the maximum concentrations for hydrocarbons was
observed to be in the range of 0.15 to 0.27 ppm in the upwind location,
with 0.26 to 0.38 ppm in the downwind location.
Similarly the concentrations of NOx in the downwind directions at 15 m
and 30 m near Baska village indicates that maximum concentration
levels are in the range of 26.32 to 37.59 pg/r3 and 48.87 to 65.79 pg/m3
respectively whereas their respective average concentration levels are in
the range of 13.22 to 20.24 ig/m3 and 24.87 to 32.46 pg/m3. Similarly

the concentrations in the upwind location at 63 m indicates that
maximum concentration is in the range of 9.4 to 13.16 Pg/m3 with
average concentration in the range of 3.01 to 5.01 Pg/m3. CO levels both
in the upwind and downwind locations were observed to be less than
non  detectable  limit of 1145  pg/m3. Whereas  the  maximum
concentrations for hydrocarbons was obsenred to be in the range of 0.15
to 0.20 ppm in the upwind location, with 0.29 to 0.39 ppm at about 15 m
downwind and 0.21 to 0.29 ppm at about 30 m downwind.
To conclude. the AAQ levels observed during the study period are found
*                     to be well vw'ithin the standards prescribed by CPCB for residential and
commercial zones.
3.4         NOISE LEVEL SURVEY
The assessment of impact of noise sources on surrounding community
depends on:
i  *    Characteristics of noise sources (instantaneous, intermittent or
continuous in nature). It can be observed that steady noise is not
as annoying as one which is continuously varying in loudness;
*         The time of day at which noise occurs, for example high noise
levels at night in residential areas are not acceptable because of
sleep disturbance; and
i    The location of the noise source, with respect to noise sensitive
landuse, which determines the loudness and period of exposure.
The environmental impact of noise can have several effects a&yng from
Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) to annoyance depending on
loudness of noise levels.
The main objective of noise monitoring in the study area is to establish
the baseline noise levels, and assess the impact of the total noise
expected to be generated by the proposed highway construction
activities in the villages around it
Noise survey has been conducted in the study area covering residential,
commercial (transportation) and sensitive zones. Noise monitoring has
been undertaken for 24 hours at each location.
3.4.1       Selection of Sampling Locations
A preliminary reconnaissance survey has been undertaken to identify
the major noise generating sources in the area. Noise at different noise
generating sources have been identified based on the activities like
vehicular traffic in residential and commercial land set up.

Vadodara - Halol Road                             Baseline Environmental Status
The noise monitoring has been conducted for determination of noise
levels at three locations in the study area. These levels were recorded
for a continuous 24 hour period. The locations where monitoring were
carried out are listed below and shown in Figure-3.10:
*    At Ohanjipur near Golden Chowk at km 9/200. representative of
residential locality with a temple being a sensitive area in the
vicinity;
*     Near Halol Naka at km 38/800 representative of commercial zone
and traffic flow conditions at a junction; and
f  *  Near village Jarod in view of residential spread.
In addition to above, in order to identify variation of existing traffic
ambient noise levels with distance, observations were also made on
noise levels for a period of four hours during peak traffic hours (4 pm to
8 pm) at a distance of 15 m and 30 m from the edge of the road at
Anandpura and Baska. The monitoring was carried out for following road
conditions at these locations:
at the stretch of the road near village Anandpura where traffic is
smooth flowing; and
*    at the stretch of the road near a ehairp -*w     viie Baska.

3.4.2       Method of Monitoring
Sound pressure level (SPL) measurements were automatically recorded
in the instrument every 10 seconds to give the equivalent noise level for
every hour for 24 hours.
Hourly and 24 hourly values for various noise parameters were tabulated
from above. The day noise levels were estimated for the period 6 am to
9 pm and night levels during 9 pm to 6 am.
Hourly noise levels were also used to estimate the equivalent noise
levels at 15 m and 30 m distance for the four hour peak traffic period at
Anandpura and Baska..
3.4.3       Statistical Analysis of Measurements
' * 4s,       For -noise levels measured over a given period of time interval, it is
possible to describe important features 'i XTie using statistical
quantities. This is calculated using the percent of the time certain noise
levels are exceeded during the time interval. The notation for the
statistical quantities of noise levels are described be4ow:
L,0 is the noise level exceeded 10 per cent of the timre-
L50 is the noise leve4 exceeded 50 per cent of the time, and
L9o is the noise level exceeded 90 per cent of the time.
Equivalent sound Pressure Level (Leq): The Leq is the equivalent
continuous sound level which is equivalent to the same sound energy as
the actual fluctuating sound measured in the same period. I-his is
necessary because sound from noise source often fluctuates widely
during a given period of time. 
This is calculated from the following equation:
(Lt -90)2
Leq =L50 +-
60
Lday is defined as the equivalent noise level measured over a period of
time during day (6 am to 9 pm).
Lnight is defined as the equivalent noise level measured over a period of
time during night (9 pm to 6 am).
A noise rating developed by Environmental Protection Agency, (US-
EPA) for specification of community noise from all the sources is the
Day-Night Sound Level, (Ldn).

Vadodara - Halol Road                               Baseline Environmental Status
Ldfl: The noise rating developed for community noise from all sources is
the Day-Night Sound Level(Ldfl). It is similar to a 24 hour equivalent
sound level except that during night time period (9 pm to 6 am) a 10
dB(A) weighting penalty is added to the instantaneous sound level
before computing the 24 hr average.
This night time penalty is added to account for the fact that noise dunng
night when people usually sleep is judged as more annoying than the
same noise during the day time.
The Ldn for a given location in a community may be calculated from the
hourly Leqs, by the following equation.
Ld, = 10 log {1/24[15(10    ) + g9(,o   v0)11
Where Ld is the equivalent sound level during the day time (6 am to 9
pm) and Ln is the equivalent sound level during the night time (9 pm :* 6
am).

presented in Table-3.9 and depicted on the project area map in Fioure-

3.4.6       Observations Based on Field Campaign
a)    Daytime Noise Levels (Lday)
Residential zone: The day time noise level at the two locations is
observed to be exceeding the prescribed limit of 55 dB(A) at Jarod (62.9
dB(A)) and at Dhanjipur (65.9 dB(A)). The noise level at Jarod recorded
the highest level at 65.6 dB(A). High background noise levels in the
residential zone is due to the traffic as well as other village activities.
Commercial zone: The day time noise level at the location (Halol Naka)
prone to traffic and commercial activities is observed to just exceed the
prescribed limit of 65 dB(A). The noise levels recorded at this station
indicates a level of 65.8 dB(A). High noise level is due to traffic and
commercial activities.
b)    Night time Noise Levels (Lnight)
Resdential zone: The night time noise level at both the locations falling
underthe residential zone are found to be above the prescribed limits of
45 dB(A). The noise levels at these locations rances between 54.8
dB(A) to 67.4 dB(A). The high noise levels are attributable to the traffic.
Commercial zone: The night time noise level at the location (Halol Naka)
prone to traffic and commercial activities is observed to be 62.7 dB(A)
which exceeds the limits of 55 dB(A).
e)    Pevu a MyfL)
The continuous hourly monitoring of noise levels adjoining the road near
Anandpura and Baska villages falling under the residential zone are
found to exceed the prescribed limits of 55 dB(A).
3.5         WATER QUALITY
Selected water quality parameters of surface and ground water
resources along the existing highway have been studied for assessing
the water environment and evaluate anticipated impact of the proposed
project. Understanding the water quality is essential in preparation of
Environmental Impact Assessment and to identify critical issues with a
view to suggest appropriate mitigation measures for implementation.
The purpose of this study is to:
*     assess the water quality characteristics for critical parameters;
*     evaluate  the  impacts  on  agricultural productivity, habitat
conditions, recreational resources and aesthetics in the vicinity;
and
*     assess impact on water quality by the construction of road and
2.1                      related activities.

A primary survey was done as discussed below.
3.5.1       Methodology Adopted for Primary Survey
Reconnaissance survey was undertaken and monitoring locations were
finalized based on:
*     location of water courses;
*     location of residential areas representing different activities / likely
impact areas; and
*     likely areas which can represent baseline conditions.
For the water quality survey, four sampling locations for surface water
and one for ground water were selected (Figure-3.12).
Surface Water:
*     SW  1: Khandewadi Village (Pond) : Right side of the road at a
distance of 20 m from the edge of the road;
a     SW 2: Asoj village (Pond) : Right side of the road at a distance of
50 m from the edge of the road;
*     SW  3: Baniyara village (Canal): Culvert crossing the existing
a-lgnment; and
=     SW 4: Harni village (Pond): Left side of the road at 30 m from the
edge of the road.
Ground Water:
-     Dug well at Jarod Village, left side at about 80 m from the
edge of the road in the compound area of P.W.D. store.

3.5.2      Presentation of Results
Ground and surface water sources were examined for physico-chemical,
heavy metals and bacteriological parameters in order to assess the
effect of domestic and surface runoff from the existing carriageway on
surface and ground water. The samples were collected and analyzed as
per the procedures specified in 'Standard Methods for the Examination
of Water and Waste Water' published by American Public Health
Association (APHA). Samples for chemical analysis were collected in
polyethylene carbuoys. Samples collected for metal content were
-                   acidified with 1 ml HNO3. Samples for Bacteriological analysis were
collected in sterilized glass bottles. Selected physico-chemical and
bacteriological parameters have been analyzed for projecting the
existing water quality status in the study area. Parameters like
temperature, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and pH are analyzed at the time of
sample collection.
The results for the parameters analyzed for surface and ground water
sampling is presented in detail in Appendix 3.4. The results of S:wLoe
water are compared with Class 'C' water quality (fit for drinking after
n.wanhonal treatment) as per IS:2296-1982 "Tioerance Limits for Inland
Surface Waters subject to Pollution". The ground water results are
compared with standards for drinking water as per IS:10500-1983
'Specifications for Drinking Water".
Surface Wa±arflalWi
The analysis results indicates pH ranges between 7.14 "tn 7.85 while
temperature varies from 280C to 290C. The TDS ranges from 42 to 122
mg/l where as total suspended solids ranges from 124 to 221 mg/l. Total
suspended solids are observed to exceed the standard of 100 mg/I.
BOD levels were observed to be in the range of 15 to 32 mg/I with
dissolved oxygen in the range of 6.9 to 7.8 mg/I. Nitrates (Nil) and
Fluorides (<0.01 mg/I) were observed to be within limits. Total coliform
ranged between 11 to 24 MPN71 00 ml. Heavy metals are observed to be
either absent or below detectable limits. All tested parameters are found
well within the permissible limits as per IS:2296 except for suspended
solids and thereby indicating the good quality of surface water at all
sampling locations.
Ground Water Quality
The analysis results indicates pH at 7.28, TDS at 900 mg/I, Suspended
solids at 65 mg/[, BOO at 12 mg/I, DO at 5.5 mg/I, Nitrates at 24 mg/l and
total hardness at 310 mg/I. TDS is observed to exceed the desirable
standard of 500 mg/I. All other parameters are found to be well within the
permissible limits of IS:10500.

3.6        LANDUSE PATTERN
3.6.1      Methodology
The data on landuse which is normally available has been collected from
various secondary sources like District Census Handbook, Revenue
records, State and Central Government Offices is for the village revenue
boundary. In the context of this project, as the impact area will be
adjoining the road, the data on the type of land use adjoining the length
of the road is considered to be more relevant. This is presented below.
3.6.2      Landuse Adjoining the Existing Road
Table-3.10 below gives detailed particulars of current land use adjoining
the existing road. The total length of the road of 33 kms has been
walysed for the type of land use on the left and right side of the road.
Table-3. 10

TOTAL                     33.00           33.00
It can be seen form the above that agriculture is the predominant land
use along the road for over 20 km out of the 33 km stretch i.e. for more
than 60% of the length. Nearly 90% of the length of the road has
agricultural and open land as the adjoining land use.
3.7         SOIL CHARACTERISTICS
3.7.1      Introduction
Most of the area adjoining the road is under cultivation and agriculture is
the main occupation of people in the study area. Soil analysis has been
carried out to assess the agricultural and afforestation potential of the
soil. Roadside soils were also collected and analysed for lead content.

The district has various types of soils, i.e., deep black cotton soils, besar,
goradu, alluvial, sandy loam, undulating and hilly soils. Black soils are
met with in the southern and south eastern parts and gorat in the
northem parts of the district. The soil cover in the area is of varied type
and thickness. The soils are derived from the weathering of Deccan
traps. The predominant rock formation of the district is associated with

3.7.5       General Observations
Soil colour is observed to be varying between black to slightly black
brown. The texture is observed to be predominantly silty clay followed by
clayey soils. This soil is from trap and is deep retentive and fertile. The
impervious nature of underlying trap at shallow depth makes the soif
extremely retentive of moisture which is found lo be particularly suitabie
to the type of crops grown in this area.
The soils in the area is observed to be slightly to moderately alkaline.
The EC is observed to be average. The Nitrogen levels fall under the
category of "better to sufficient". Similarly, the Potassium levels fall
under the category of "very low to medium'. Whereas, the levels of
Phosphorus flJ undr Mte zategoy of "less to a-age sufficient". The
levels of organic matter in the soils fall under the category of "sufficient
to average sufficient".
3.7.6       Crop Pattern
Agriculture in the area is monsoon dependent and soil is particularly
suited to the dry field crops, such as bajri, tabacco, paddy, cotton, juari,
wheat and vegetables. The main crops grown in the area are cotton,
-      -                 wheat, paddy, groundnut, tobacco, maize, Rabi jowar and tur. Crops
grown on the black soils are cotton and Rabi jowar through paddy is also
grown in fields under irrigation, rotated by wheat in the Rabi season.
The cropping pattem in the western taluks of Panchamahals consists of
mainly cotton, ground nut, jowar, tur and paddy, while the hilly talukas
grow manly maize in the lighter soils and paddy in the low lying areas. A
fairly large acreage is under gram, a crop which is grown as a second
crop after harvesting paddy and maize in the hilly talukas.
The yield per hectare of the principal crops during 1991 to 1992 is given
in Table-3.15.

Vadodara Taluka is shown in Figure-3.13 (geology map of the other
talukas were not readily available).
A major portion of Panchamahals district in the central and northern
parts is covered by meta sediments with the extension of the main
Aravalli group of rocks in Rajasthan, while the southem parts are found
with formations which have been referred to as the Champaner series.
These metasedimentary groups of rocks are separated by intrusive
granites and gneisses. In the eastem part of the disirict, Deccan Traps
occupy a large area and at places on their fringes are found in Infra-
trappeans.
The geology of the eastem part of Panchamahals consists of dark

by basaltic lava flows known as "Deccan Traps" of upper cretaceous to
lower Eocene in age. The lava flows were poured out of the long and
narrow fissures in the earth's crust and are spread in the form of
horizontal sheets constituting numerous spurs, hills and hill ranges.
broad flat topped ridges, and lofty peaks. One such is near Pavagadh
hills.
The spheroidal weathering of the Deccan trap is very common yielding
soft friable murrum. The recent and sub-recent formations are
represented by laterite, kankar, soil etc. The mechanical and chemical
disintegration of the lava flows have resulted in the formation of laterite
and bauxites. The formation is usually reddish to yellowish in colour and
shows vermicular and tabular cavities often stained with dark brown
ferruginous solution. Laterites are seen on plateau tops. The thickness
of the laterite varies from a few meters to 20 meters.

3.8.2       Hydrology
The Narmada and the Maui are the major rivers in Vadodara district.
Besides these two rivers, the Jambuva, Surva, Vishvamitri and Dhadhar
flow through the district and empty into the Gulf of Cambay. The Unch,
Orsang, Sukhi, Heran, Dev, Karjan, Ashwan and Bhukhi, etc., are
tributaries of the above two major rivers. The river Mahi traverse a
course of about 115 km in this district through Vadodara and Padra
Talukas. Narmada traverses for about 128 km through six talukas in
- *9  =            Vadodara district, viz., Chhota Udepur, Nasadi, Tilakwada, Dabhoi, Sinor
and Karjan.
The Panchmahals district is drained by seven important rivers, viz.,
Mahi, Goma, Kun, Panam, Meshri, Karad and Kali. Many of them take
their rise from the hills of Pavagadh which is about 7 kms away from
i-alol. The Vishvamitri enters Vaghodia taluka and flows past Asoj, Jarod
and Kaamrol villages. The surva river flows past Kotambi, Bhaniyara and
Morlipura villages in Vaghodia talka and passes near Amliyara, Kotali,
and Sukhihpr in Vadodara talka.
There are a number of medium and minor itrigation crossings on the
existing highway road. The main crossings axe at km 32/2 for the
Narmada Main canal of about 110 m top width, and km 10/4 for the
branch canal. As per the figures available for -1986-87, the various
sources of irrigation in Panchamahals are Govemment canals (12400
ha), tanks (1900 ha), weUls (25300 ha). This show that welfs are the main
sources of irrigation.
3.8.3       Hydrogeology
The occurrence, nature and movement of ground water (GW) in the
taluka is entirely dependent upon the topographical setting of the area
and the geological formations encountered. The ground water in rocky
areas is mainly confined to cracks, fissures, joint planes and zones of
weathering. Even the sandstones do not constitute good aquifers since
they are hard, compact and silicious. The basalts do not possess any
primary porosity. The massive traps are hard, compact and
impermeable.
The water levels in rocky terrain varies between 6 m to 15 m below
ground surface, while in alluvial formation the levels vary between 6 m to
27 m. The thickness of the weathering in the area is about 6 m to 15 m.
Out of the total tubewells drilled in selected blocks, about 75.7 % are
successful and 24.3 % have failed either due to poor discharge or
occurrence of hard rock at shallow depth. The yield normally varies
between 15,000 to 40,000 gallons per hour at varying drawdowns
between 9 m and 15 m.
The hydrological tests conducted on tubewells have indicated that the
coefficient of transmissibility of aquifers varies between 78,000 to

1,30,000 gallons/day/foot and the coefficient of permeability varies
between 680 to 2,000 gallons/day/sq.ft. In general the alluvial aquifers
are capable of transmitting large quantities of groundwater.
In Panchmahals, the hilly and undulating terrain in the east and
comparatively flat terrain in the west are the two regions where
percolation of rainwater and movement of ground water varies markedly.
Adequate supply of water may be obtained in shallow bore wells piercing
the porous horizons of lava flows and in flows traversed by closely
spaced joints. Such wells may yield as-much as 20,000 litres/hour.
From the study of the pre and post monsoon water levels in the
observation wells, which are fixed in all the watersheds depending upon
the morphological units, it is observed that high fluctuations are
observed along the foothills, moderate in the plain.
3.9        '1EMBESTRIAL ECOLOGY
An ecological study of the ecosystem is esseniial to understand the
impact of development activities related to industrialization, urbanization
etc., on existing flora and fauna of the area. The objective of this section
is to characterize and understand the present stars of the ecosystems
in the study area.
The present study was undertaken to understand the present status of
ecosystem along ttie existny tiighway and to compare it with the past
condition with the help of available zl=a, to predict changes as a result of
present activities and to suggest maasures for maintaining the
conditions.
Thus the objectives of ecological study is outlined as follows:
*     to characterize the environmental components like land, water,
flora and fauna; 
--  *  to understand their present status; and
*     to identify susceptible and sensitive areas.
3.9.1      MNethodology of Data Collection
The area adjoining the existing highway (approximately 1-2 km on either
side) has been considered for the primary survey to study the terrestrial
ecosystem. Data from secondary sources have been compiled for the
area. Following methods are being adopted for the ecological study:
* s   Generation of primary data through undertaking systematic
ecological studies along the existing highway and in the study
area;

*     Secondary  data  collected  from  publications  of  various
Govemment agencies like  Forest Department, Agriculture
Department etc.; and
Consulting local people for gathering information on ethnobotany,
local plants and animals.
This section describes terrestrial ecology of the area based on
reconnaissance survey and information gathered from secondary data
available for the area.
3.9.2       Reconnaissance Survey of the Area for Flora
A reconnaissance survey was done to have an overviev. of the terrestrial
ecosystem of the area. The area depicts a manmade ecosystem with
natvral vegetation limited to small patches at certain places. The bio-
diversity of vegetation in the area is not very high due to intense biotic
pressure.
There is no reserved forest, national park, wild life sanctuary or
biosphere reserve in the core area.
3.9.3       Phytosociological Studies
In order to carry our quantitative analysis of terrestrial flora, ecological
sampling was dme  i    the existig 'highway. The phytosociological
studies like relatve dormiance for woody, shrub and   Srlbaeous
species are considered.
Methodology adopted for the study
The most widely used technique of sampling vegetation is that of sample
plots or quadrate. This technique been used for the present project, care
was taken to insure that the sample is adequate to represent the entire
stand. Choice of size, shape, number and distribution of the sample
plots or quadrate changes from the types of plant species and their
distribution. The quadrate sampling technique is applicable for all the
types of plant communities.
The size of the quadrate used for the study was 10 m x 10 m. Smaller
quadrate of 1 m x 1 m was used for smaller plants especially grasses.
The common practice to place major importance on the common
species and count only individuals that are rooted within the plot was
used.
Estimations of, relative density and relative dominance of species were
done as per Mueller-Dombois-Ellenberg. Apart from the above field
sampling, secondary data available for the area has been collected from
the Govemment departments.

3.9.4       Review of Primary Survey Data
The plant life of an area shows certain affinities with the environmental
setting and between the plant species. Normally vegetation analysis is
directed towards the natural plant communities as they relate to the
various site factors. Disturbed areas often have fragmented plant
associations having no community structure or integrity. But in either
case, the analysis considers the dominant species that characterize the
site, -the sensitivity of the vegetation to impact, and presence of rare and
endangered species.
The vegetation along the highway course shows sparse density of
vegetation. A sample survey of the area was carried all along the
highway.
Plant Survey:
'Plants have been assessed in several descriptive ways:
a)    A "species list" includes both local and scientific names of the
plants found in the study area. This list is made by site visits and
by consulting published literature. Secondary sources are
particularly important for out of season annual species or for
pssible rare or endangered plant species Such wurces have
been referenced.
b)   TJbe "a"be of plants" proves information on the  irpvition,
vegetation pattems, and relatiie dabwdance of each species in
the area. Such information has allowed comparison to be made
between stands of the same type or with other vegetation stands
of different types in order to establish commonness or rarity of
species of vegetation types on or near the study sites.
3.9.5       Quantitative Plant Assessment
Since plants occur in recognizable associations and interact with one
another, special quantitative methods are used in assessing the
vegetative parameters. Beyond considering the species composition of a
vegetation, these methods provide information on the role and relative
importance of individual plant species (such as dominance and rarity),
relationship between plants, species distribution and spacing, number of
individuals of each species, and structure of plant community.
Quantitatively the vegetation can be analysed in several ways, out of
which 'sample plot' method was selected for the present project.
Trees of Mangifera indica and Madhuca latifolia are found dotting the
agricultural lands and Acacia nilotica trees occupy bunds of some fields.
Species such as Lantana camara, Prosopis juliflora, Impomea SP,
Cassia tora, Xanthium strumarium, Parthenium hysterophorus etc. are

encroaching on village commons. The list of species observed along the
highway and the analysis of the same are brought out in Appendix 3.5.
3.9.5.1    Vegetation
The vegetation is influenced by dry and hot summer which sets in April
and lasts till June. April and May the hottest months. Monsoon rainfall
is restricted to June to October, July and August being wettest months.
Winter starts in November and lasts till February. Rainfall ranges from
600 mm to nearly 1500 mm, a-verage being around 1000 mm. The
temperature varies from 140C to 46 C.
All these factors define the nature of vegetation and ecosystem in this
area in general.
The Vadodara-Halol road passes through plains which are
characterised by fertile agricultural fields and human settlements. The
^   _              ae systlem  is under considerabie numan interference especially
grazing, agriculture, lopping for firewood and fee and urbanisation.
Barring human interference, the natural composi¶in of vegetation in
such an ecosystem would be dominated by Acia nilotica, Prosopis
spicigera, Capparis decidua, Butea monosperma, Borassus flabellifer,
Phoenix  sylvestris,  Zizyphus  spp.,  Pitheembbnjm   duke  and
occasionally occuring Mangifera indica. Shruby vegetation would be
dominated by Caotfropis gigantea and Cassia occidentaIis. But the
intensive agriculture has changed the characieristics of vegetatJon and
is now dominated by weeds, exotoc species esp. omameriSaLs and
economically important plants restricted to field bunds.
The economically important plants like Teak and Ain which should be
forming an important component of this ecosystem are missing, but
few cultivated patches of Teak.
After through survey of this area the ecosystem can be categorized
into 5 different types of communities.
a)    Roadside vegetation
b)    Ravines and streambed vegetation
c)    Field bund vegetation
d)    Plantations on private lands
e)    Vegetation around human settlements.

Vadodara - Halol Road                             Baseline Environmental Status
a)    Roadside Vegetation
Along the sides of existing Vadodara-Halol road, very old avenue trees
like Ficus bengalensis. Ficus retusa, Azadirachta indica and
Tamarindus indica are seen. Most of these are large trees above 200
cm GBH. It has been on record that these trees were planted by
Maharaja of Baroda State His Highness Sayajirao Gaikwad. As we
move from Baroda to Halol, first half is dominated by Azadirachta
indica i.e. Neem or Lindo and laterhalf by two species of Ficus - F.
retusa and F bengalensis. Babul i.e. Acacia nilolica, Shami i.e.
Pnosopis spicigera are common associates. Pithecolobium has been
first planted and then naturalised is found abundant between 29th and
31st km stretch. An omamental large tree Peltophoram which has
recently been planted is observed in thick clusters in km 2,3 and 27
and 28. Similarly Delonix is also found in 4th and 27th km stretch. A
p-n,nent row of 24 full grown Ashoka trees - Polyalthia longifolia is
observed at 28' km stretch.
Along the sides of roads and nearby field bunds Lawsonia, lpomesea
fistulosa and at few places Euphorbia and dominates. In
several stretches, a noxious shruby weed, Prosopis juliflora forms
significant patches. All these shrubs are not palafible and hence not
grazed by cattle and form a good natural fence. On degraded open
lands especially at the Ist stretch prosopis julifiora has become a
dominant weed and is spreading fast.
b)   Ravinues and Streambed Vegetation
Degraded lands, waste lands, ravines, streambeds show mainly,
growth of Prosopis juliflora esp. between 30 and 31St km stretch. Along
with Prosopis, Cassia occidentalis, Zizyphus spp. and Capparis are
observed.
c)    Field Bund Vegetation
Protected field bunds mainly have Acacia Prosopis spicigera, Butea
monosperma and Mangifera indica as natural vegetation. In addition to
this, people have planted Enealyptus. Cassias, Banhinia and Mango.
Between km stetches 19 and 20 and 25 to 28 well grown groves of
Borassus - a palm, are found. Most of these palm trees show
association with Ficus species.
d)    Plantations of Private Lands
At few places, agroforestry activity is seen. Recently 3-4 years back, at
8 km stretch and 13 and 14h km stretch Eucalyptus has been planted.
the plantation is close spaced with average height of 5 cm.

Near Panchdeola village, 15-20 year old teak plantation is observed.
Within the compounds of private farms, industries etc. near Sarpej
village, Eucalyptus, Gaura, Mango, Spathodia, Cassias, Polyalthia,
have been commonly planted. At Basaka village at 28 km a new
plantation of Mango has been undertaken.
e)    Vegetation Around Human Settlements
In the open spaces of villages and village roads Prosopis juliffora,
Cassia glanca, Cassia siamea, Bauhinia, Enealyptus, Spathodia,
Loueeana (subabul), Peltophorum, Parkinsonia, Pithe colobium and
Neem are observed. Most of the trees of ornamented value like
Spathodia, Cassias, Peltophorum and Neem have been planted. The
village wastelands show a fairly good cover of Proposisjuliflora.

3.9.5.3       Status of Roadside Vegetation
The quantitative assessment of vegetation was done to understand the
present status of vegetation along the Vadodara - Halol road. All the .
trees above 30 cm GBH and those fall within proposed aqisition have
identified, counted and their degree of damage have been noted.

Vadodara - Halol Road                             Baseline Environmental Status
On the basis of their girth classes, trees were divided into 3 classes.
Trees with < 1 00 cm GBH           -    Small
Trees between 101 and 200 GSH      -    Medium
Trees above 201 cm GBH             -    Large
Within the thirty-one one km stretch out of 1621 trees recorded 464
were small, 735 w^;ere medium and 1422 were large trees.
The study revealed thirty eight species in 31 km patch of road. In all
1621 plants were reported. Highest percentage was of Neem (36%);
All subdominant trees showed much lower density e.g. Borassus (7%),
Ficus bengalensis (6.6%), Peltophorum p5.8%). Pithecolobium (5.5%0),
Acacia nilotica (5.43%o), Prosoppis spicigera (5.2%).
The Borassus palms were found in clusters and are located in km 19,
20, 25, 26 and 27. Pithecolobium was abundant within 29-30 kms.
Aeacia nilotica dcminated vegetation within 28-30 kms. Peltophorum
appear onfy near habitations in km 2,3, 27 and 28 and is planted. The
ornamented plant - Delonix is found close to existing road and is
common in km 4 and 27. Mango trees, though few appear to be very
old trees along road planted in the past as average trees, are now
found in small groups or on field bunds in farms. The true avenue trees
which fort old plantations are Neem - unifo=mly distributed, Ficus
bengafensis - frequently seen after 13th km, Tamarindus indica - few
p1arnt widely spaced, form a characteristic feature of this road. Other
characeristic patare Acacias and Prosopis spicigera (Shami) these
are uniformly spread and represent natufal vegetation. A another
species of Ficus, Ficus retusa is an important species which looks like
Banyan tree but branches are not much horizontally spreading, no
significant proproots. This is important road side tree which is better as
an average tree than Banyan (Ficus bengalensis). About 43 full grown
trees of this species were observed.
--:          Species like Terminalia catappa, Terminalia chebula, Feronia limonia
were the rarest represented just by one tree each. The highest tree
density was found in kmis 25, 17 and 12 and 8' km stretch did not
have any large tree.
3.9.5.4    Other Minor Vegetation
Most common hedge along the roadside and agricultural fields were
Lawsonia, lpomoea Fistulosa and Euphorbia antiquorum. An exotic
shrub which is a common need Prosopis juliflora is abundant in several
patches. In 8th km and in 13-14 km patches there were new
Eucalyptus plantations grown to a average height of 5 feet. Near
temple of Panchdeota village (20th km stretch) there is a 10-12 years
old teak plantation wherever Borassus palms were found
(19,20,25,26,27 and 28th) they were interestingly associated with Ficus
species. Well developed plantations are found near Urja Engineering

Pvt. Ltd. at Asoj village and also at Sarpej village. In village Baska a
grove of Mango is seen.
Since trees on the sides of road suffer greater impact from human due
to lopping for firewood, foliage for cattle and goats and even trimming of
the branched for safety, survey was made to find out the status. On the
basis of extent of damage caused trees were classified as:
Not damaged           -      Showed natural growth.
Partially damaged      -     Have capacity to gegenerate if further
damage is checked, are infected by
fungi, lopped  by man, foliage is
regularly removed.
Damaged                -     Severely damaged, are not likely to
grow to their natural form even with
-i~   -                                               protection. Stems damaged, infected
by wood roots.
This data reveals that most of the trees were in good condition (1230
and 313 out of 1621 in not damaged and partiaiflyamaged classes) and
78 were damaged probably beyond repair and are likely to remain
deformed and stunted even after protection and proper tree care. The
trees which are damaged were Neem and Ficsv -lnce both can be used
as a cattle or goat fodder in scarcity during summer.
3.9.6       Secondary Data
The data available from secondary sources is also presented in
Appendix 3.5. Since the primary survey is site-specific, it is of more
relevance than the secondary data.
3.9.7      Summary Remarks on Vegetation
This region represents a completely modified dry deciduous forest
ecosystem into typical rainfed agro ecosystem. Within a range of 20
km on eitherside of road there doesn't exist any natural forest. Nearest
protected forest is at Pavagadh range at about 5 km from Halol.
Vegetation is mainly restricted to roadsides and field bunds, the trees
are either economical important species protected on field bunds like
mango, teak or terminalia or weeds like thorny acacias and prosopis.
Most of the Avian fauna that is found is associated with agriculture and
human habitation, except few common migratory birds which roost
enroute of their winter migration. Otherwise birds fauna is dominated
by grainivores, insectiones and ommirores. Raptors' density is less.
Since there is no significant forests around, the trees and shrubs on
field bunds and roadsides provide important roosting, brooding and
Derchina sites. The tress Ficus SDD. and Neem on Vadodara - Halol



Environmental Impact Assessment                                   Chapter 3
Vadodara - Halol Road                             Baseline Environmental Status
road provide important feeding and roosting sites for birds especially
when no food is available elsewhere in summer.
Being an highly disturbed ecosystem area does not harbour any
residential large mammals except common squirrels, hares and few
foxes. And since there are no large patches of protected forests on
either side of road, any road development activity will not cause loss
any corridors/bridges of migration of animals. Ecosystem is being
rapidly invaded by a noxious weed Prosopis juliflora which is altering
this ecosystem rapidly.
Protection of Existing Avenue:
Mostly the Neem and species of Ficus form well grown avenues of
existing Vadodara-Halol road. These trees play a significant role,
especially during scorching summer months, in lives of local people,
travellers and even birds. Efforts should be taken to protected existing
wefl grown trees, as much as possible, when existing carriage width is
incmased.
3.9.8      Terrestrial Fauna
There is no suitable habitat for occurrence ecologically important fauna
in the wea. The list of wild and domestic animals, and avifauna sighted
in the area are given in Appendix 3.5. No endangered species have
been reported in The study area. The mammalian fauna is limited and
does not show much diversity. They mainly constitute ftmeslated
animals and rodents. The area hapbo-rs grainivorous avian fauna
because agricultural grains in the field provide food for such birds (See
Appendix 3.5 for the list). Amphibian and reptilian fauna is poor and they
are represented by toads, lizards and snakes.
Since this project does not pass through ecologically sensitive area, the
abundance of the fauna is of less sigpficance.
3.10       AQUATIC ECOLOGY
The important surface water bodies like ponds, irrigation canals situated
albng the existing highway were identified for field sampling. These
surface water bodies may exhibit ecological changes due to the
proposed construction activities.
3.10.1     Primary Survey
To assess the baseline conditions with respect to phytoplankton and
zooplankton, four locations were selected for sampling. The details of
the sampling locations are brought out below:
Khandewadi Village (Pond) : Right side of the road at a distance
of 20 m from the edge of the road;

Asoj village (Pond): Right side of the road at a distance of 50 m
from the edge of the road;
*     Harni village (Pond): Left side of the road at a distance of 30 m
from the edge .of the road; and
*     Baniyara village (Canal): Culvert crossing the existing alignment.
3.10.2      Presentation of Primary Data
- *   Phytoplankton
Altogether 22 species of phytoplanktonic organisms were identified of
which 13 species belonged to BacilJariophyceae and 9 species were
from the group chlorophyceae. Bacillariophyceae represented by
Nitzschia sp., Bacillaria sp., Navicula sp., Dentatium sp., Meridion sp.,
ancd Amphipleura sp., constituted 67.5°o while closterium sp., Hormidium
sp.,  Cosmarium   sp.,  Trochiscia  sp.,  Planktosphaerium   sp.,
TeTmenrome us  sp.,  Volvox  sp.,  Dictyosphaerium   sp.,  under
chlorophyceau contributed remaining 32.5% of the phytoplankton
population. The density of plantation was quiteJa at both the locations
with little spatial variation.
Zooplankton
The sample consisted of species of zooplankions.s FlD1iftea (Lindia sp,
Polyarthra sp., Wigrella sp., Colurella sp.,) contributed 40% of the
mopfanktr mpupidtion, while copepods (Cyclops sp. I0%), ;'hzopods
(Euglypha sp.-10% and Turbellaria (Castrella sp.,) together represented
30% and rest were anuelid worms and crustacean eggs. The density of
zooplankton was extremely low and the density of spatial variation in
their densities was insignificant.
Pond Vegetation:
Most of the ponds on the roadsides were seasonal and they dry-up in
early summer. General survey of aquatic macrophytes and surrounding
marsh flora revealed following important species.
Aponogeton natans
Alternanthera sessilis
Ammannia baccifera
Ceratophyllum demersum
Cyperus alopecuroides
Cyperus corymbosus
Cyperus iria
Cleome cheliclonji

.  3.11.1     Existing Industries along the Project Road
Due to growth inducing industrial policies enfo  z7yQicessive state
governments, Vadodara district shows substantial growth in working
factories between 1970 and 1980, a stagnation between 1980 and 1990
and significant growth since 1990. The distrct of Panchamahals show a
significant growth between 1980 and 1990 which 4s maintained in 90's
also.
Both these distficts aiso witness a 1ih growth of Small Scale Industrial
(SSI) units on a consistent pace which coufd be largely attributed to the
attractive policies floated by the govemments. But, they do not show any
prominence of any one industry group. There are large number of
chemical, metal and engineering units in these districts.
The inventory of existing industrial units all along the existing highway is
presented in Table-3.18 and their approximate locations are depicted in
Figure-3. 14.

3.12.1      Methodology Adopted For The Study
The methodology adopted for the study is based on the following:
Villages on the either side of the existing alignment have been
considered for socio-economic studies. According to 1991
census, there are 14 villages in the study area. All these villages
form a part of the rural area despite being very near to the urban

-The present chapter identifies and appraises various impacts from the
proposed project based on -environmental baseline conditions and
analysis of the field data as discussed in the earlier chapter.
The environmental impacts are categorized as either primary (direct) or
secondary (indirect). Primary impacts are those which are attributed
-directly by the project whereas secondary impacts are those which are
indirectly induced and typically include the associated investment and
[S    -changing patterns of social and economic activities due to the proposed
action. Typically, the potential direct and indirect impacts of such
thighway pfbjects are summarized in Table-4.1.

meteorological.conditions after the sunset tend to become stable. The
overall meteorological parameters thus constitute adveirse conditions for

Vadodara - Halol Road                                   Impact Assessment
The air quality predictions in the present application have been carried   '  -'
out by using the air quality-model CALINE3 developed by Califomia
Department of Transportation. The model is based on Gaussian
diffusion, equation and uses: a mixing zone concept to characterise
pollutant dispersion over the toadway. The model has been extensively
tested for its predictive capability for traffic related air quality impacts.
Given  source -strength, meteorology, site  geometry  and  site
characteristics the model can reliably predict pollutant concentrations
for receptors located within 150 meters of the roadway, the most
important region for estimating the impacts of road project due to the
low elevation emissions.
The seasonal dependence of model outputs, primarily due the
r-Xt                         variations. in meteorological conditions over the year, has been'
C]      'accounted for by developing the predictive scenarios for the winter
months during which the air quality is poorest due to low dispersion of
the pollutants.
The long term variations in air quality scenarios during the project life
f!          '        '' '    are expected due to the change in traffic on the project road with time.
L..                          The traffic volumes for the year 2000 and 2015, respectively, have
been considered to project future air quality scenarios to provide an
indication of long term variations in air quality. A longer time horizon
has not been considered because -of uncertainty in ascertaining the
emission factors for various categories of vehicles beyond the year
2015 due to the probable change in technology and fuel use.
To account for the effect of the diurnal variations in model inputs
(vehicular emissions and meteorological conditions), the averaging
time for model predictions has been restricted to 60 minutes. The
averaging time is so' selected because the primary meteorological
factors that inflience the air quality predictions i.e. wind speeds and
directions do not remain steady for longer time periods. Also, during
the peak  traffic hours, traffic volumes typically show significant
variations over periods longer than one hour.
Due to averaging time of 60 minutes, the project impacts on air quality
are essentially assessed based on one hourly standard for CO. CO
standard for 8 hourly average concentration has also-been compared
with the predicted levels by averaging the hourly estimates of predicted
CO levels for eight hours (4 prn to 12 pm) which are critical due to- 
higher traffic volumes, lower wind velocities and adverse dispersion
conditions.

wind is blowing in the same direction for all 24 hours - which is not a
practical assumption. NOx levels however have been developed for
peak traffic conditions and compared with WHO standlard of 400 gg/m3
for hourly average. -
HC and SPM, although contributed by the vehicular mnovement, were
- not modelled. For HC, the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 does
not specify the ambient standards and therefore it would have not
been possible to interpret the modelling results meaningfully. In case of
SPM, vehicle SPM emission levels have not been specified by the
Indian Institute of Petroleum. Also, SPM contributions are dominated
by background concentrations as well as traffic induced resuspension,
both of which are difficult to quantify.,
;Carbon Monoxide Levels:
The source emission levels for CO were estimated by using the peak
hourly traffic volumes for vehicles of five categories i.e., trucks and
.-buses, LCVs, cars, two wheelers and three wheelers. The traffic
volumes for-these categories of vehicles were obtained by distributing
'the total daily predicted traffic volumes for respective vehicle types for
the years 2000 and 2015 over the 24 hours according to the hourly
proportions observed during. the traffic count in 1996, Thus, the ratio
factors of hpurly traffic to average daily traffic for each categories of
-vehicles obtained for the year 1996 have been used for the years 2000
and 2105 to estimate -the corresponding projected hourly traffic of the
respective vehicle types by considering the average traffic in the
respective years. The ratio factors estimated for trucks were assumed
to be applicable for and similarly of cars to two and three wheelers
-because of their nature. The Table-4.3 presents the estimated counts

studies. This data was not useful for developing the air quality
scenarios for the winter months. Also,. no other data which could have
A e  --                            been used to represent the local hourly variation in wind during the
! winter was available. In order to overcome the data limitation, air
- quality scenaros were developed for all stability classes for a low wind
speed of 1 m/s.
I: :Mp   g  t   \    0                 The ROW (Right Of Way) of existing highway of 7 -m road width has
been found to be of 24 m with marginal increase at some sections. The
-ROW for 'With Project Scenario' are considered to be 60 m. For model
computations for 'Do Nothing Scenario', ROW  of 24 m has been
considered for perusal of violations of standards aind accordingly  -
receptor locations were chosen to account for its location with respect
*     I o+++-o; 9t-rg   7              'to edge of ROW of 24 only. Hence, the receptor locations from edge of
, _n-A,,= .A . the ROW will correspondingly change for both scenarios.
The scenarios were modelled for two distinct wind cases viz., parallel
and cross wind cases while developing the air quality scenarios. The
results of these simulations for peak hour (i.e 1800 hour) for the year
2000 and 2015 are presented in Appendix 4.1 (Figures-A4.1-1, A4.1-3,

depicted in Appendix 4:1 (Figures-A4.1-2, A4.1-4, A4.1-6 and A4.1-8)
;^ - for Do Nothing Scenario'. The peak -hourly predicted results for CO
have.been summarised in Table-4.5 and Table-4.6 for the years 2000
-and 2015 A.D respectively.
The general observation from all the figures depicted reveals that the
cross wind case predicts higher CO concentration at all receptors than
-parallel wind case at all stability classes.

The predictions were extended for a period of B hours by assigning'
hourly stability class for the period from 4 pm to -12' pm. The vehicular
volumes for respective categories of vehiclet and hour of simulation
were taken as per the Table-4.3. The results of simulation for the years
2000 and 2015 are-presented in Figure-4.1 and 4.2 respectively. With
the prediction for 'Do Nothing' scenario being higher, the prediction
trend for both the years showed more or less similarity.
A It is observed that the CO levels will rerrlain significantly below the 8
'hourly stahdard of 2000 pg/m3 for both With and Without project
-scenarios.
NOxLevels:
Similar to emission factors for CO, values for NOx were obtained from
the standards proposed by IIP and corrected for the variations in speed
using WHO' guidelines. The emission factors thus derived are also
presented in Table-4.4. One hourly simulations for NlOx were carried
out on Ahe lines similar to CO. The adverse stability classes were
. -considered for both wind cases in -the view of the maximum
D ffi -, tS ^            --- --  7 - concentration predicted for the particular stability classes. Thus,
' '14    a      0   Xt i stability classes E and F were considered for parallel and cross wind
cases respectively.

The results for 1 hour average values for NOx'for the years 2000 and
-201 5 are presented in Figure-4.3 and 4.4 respectively. When
compared toWHO standard of 400 ng/m3, it :is observed that under
cross wind conditions the standard is expected to get violated up to a s
distance -of about 35m from the ROW limit only in thie year 2015 for
'With Project scenario.-The prediction for 'Do Nothing' scenario were
observed to be lower than that of 'With Project' scenario in both the
years of prediction. No violations of NOx standards are! expected in the
year 2000.     - - -'
Due to unavailability of data on Xmeteorological conditions. 24 hourly
-average simulations have not been possible. Regions of probable.
violation of Indian Standard of 80 pg/m3 for 24 hour average levels
therefore could not be stated. Considering the fluctuation in the wind
,-  ,-; -. :X   ,,-directions over a period of 24 =hours during the -winter, however, it is
safe to assume that such violations will -not be more than the violations
of 1 hourly average standard of 400 pg/M3.
When viewed with respect to the short term -standard for NOx, on an
average violation cis 12-15 %. The traffic ;'figures used in predicting are *
-estimated peak hourly traffic which lasts for about 1-4 hours.

L-                             For this violation to continuously occur, crosswind conditions also need
to simultaneously occur. In view of this observation it may be
r                             concluded that the project would not lead to significant violations
atleast upto the year 2015. During later years it is expected that
technology interventions may reduce the source NOx levels limiting the
l                             exceedence.
This impact zone, however, will be prominent only at places of existing
II._                          settlements as no new developments up to 45m from the centreline of
the proposed expressway will be permnitted under the existing rules.

4.4.2      Impact dn Noise Levels
COnstruction Phase
During the construction, the major sources of noise pollution are
- tmovement of vehicles transporting the construction material to the,
construction yard and the noise generating activities at the yard itself.
Concreting, mixing, casting and material movement are primary noise
generating activities in the yard and will be uniformly distributed over the
entire construction period. Construction activities are expected to
- -  SZ      -produce noise levels in the range of 80 - 95 dB(A). The major work will
be carried out during the day time. The noise produced during the
construction will however not have a significant impact on the existing
ambient noise levels near villages (where the existing ambient noise
levels for residential zone are already being exceeded) because:  -
the proposed alignment bypasses the four villages as
discussed in Chapter 2; and
the predominant land use along  the alignment is
agricultural and open fields due to which lthere will be very
limited presence of population being exposed to noise
levels.
The construction equipment will have high noise levels which can affect
the personnel operating the machines. Use of proper personal protective
equipment will mitigate any adverse impact of the noise generated by
such equipment.
The noise levels in the working environment are compared with the
- -- - : :4   ~             q i  standards prescribed by Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA-USA) which in-tum are being enforced by Govemment of India
through Model rules framed under the Factories Act. The acceptable
limits for each shift being of 8 hour duration, the equivalent noise level
exposure during the shift is 90 dB(A). Hence noise generated due to
various activities in the construction camps may affect workers, if
equivalent 8, hour exposure is more than the safety limit. ACGIH
* (American Conference of Govemment Industrial Hygienists) proposed
- ~. - an 8 hour L4 limit of 85 dB(A). Exposure to impulses or impact noise
should not exceed 140 dB(A) (Peak acoustic pressure). Exposure to
10,000 impulses of 120 dB(A) are permissible per day.
The noise lkely to be generated during excavation, loading and
-- {i- - ;transportation of material near the borrow areas will be in the range of 90
to 105 dB(A)1and Shis -will-occur only when all the equipments operate
W-;                        i ~--Iogether and- simultaneously. This will be a remote possibility. The
workers in general are likely to be exposed to an equivallent noise level
- I-, X i                        of 80-90 dB(A)'in an 8 hour shift for which all statutory precautions as .
per 'B' laws should be taken-into consideration.

Uninterrupted movement of heavy and light vehicles at high speeds will
have give rise to increase in ambient noise levels along the roadway. It
may have negative environmental impacts on the sensitive receptors
located within the zone of influence. In order tQ estimate the noise
L                              impacts with respect to existing situations, noise monitoring was
undertaken at Dhanjipur and Jarod, two roadside villages in the project.
It was observed that the observed day time and night time equivalent
i                              noise levels were more than the prescribed permissible limits at the
villages monitored for noise levels.
At these villages, the day noise levels ranged between 62.9 dB(A) to
65.6 dB(A) with the night noise levels in the range of 54.8 dB(A) to 67.4
dB(A).
L                             -With the operation of the proposed road the residential areas along the
highway on either side are likely to experience high day and night time
noise levels. The impact of noise levels from the existing and the
L.                            proposed highway on the neighboring communities is addressed by
carrying out computations using Highway Noise Model developed
based on the guidelines suggested by Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA). The details of the model and the model computations are

The Sound-Pressure Level (SPL) generated by noise sources decreases
with increasing distance from the source due to wave divergence. An
additior-.3 decrease in SPL with distance from the source is expected
.due to atmospheric effect or its interaction with objects in the
transmission path.
Estimating highway noise impact involves complex process. which will
require a large computer analysis to model in detail. However, the
methodology presented below is a general highway noise model, that
predicts the equivalent noise level (Le) and is adequate for most noise
assessment requirements. The advantage of the model which predicts
Leq is that Lq is the "Energy Average' noise level and as such is not
dependent on the statistics .of the traffic flow. In contrast, the noise
descriptors LIo, L50, Lgo can be very sensitive to the flow characteristics
r;                           of the traffic. Further, the model presented below can be applied equally
well to high and low traffic volume roadways.
,The Highway Noise Model presented below is for calculating the one
hour Leq. The model is based upon calculating the hourly Liq for

the years LCVs 2000 and 2015 in free flow condition respectively.
Whereas in case of restricted flow condition, traveling speed of 80
km/hr and 25 km/hr was considered. With seeing the Table-4.5, the
reference noise levels for the traveling speed of 28 kmlhr were
assumed to be at 57.0, 73.0, 73.0, and 58.0 dB(A) at 15m for cars,
trucks, buses and 2/3 wheelers respectively. For the vehicular speed of
25 km/hr in the restricted flow condition, noise levels were assumed to
oe at one dB(A) lower to that of at 28 km/hr for each vehicle type.
Since new (designed for less noise) cars can be foreseen in the year
2015, their reference noise level has been reduced by 5 dB(A).

the standard prescribed for residential zone in both the scenarios. And
1Lnight values for 'With Project' Scenario are predicted higher even than
L                               Lt.ght values of 'Do Nothing' scenario in both the years.
'The existing noise levels at some locations are monitored to be
exceeding the Ltay and Lnight standards. In the background of this
prevailing high background noise, the noise levels are predicted higher
even without the project. Since most of the villages along the highway
IL               -are situated within a reach of about 150 m from the existing road. Lday
standard for residential zone is violated upto a distance of about 150 m
.-and 250 m from the edge of ROW in 2000 and 2015 A.D. respectively
during 'Do Nothing scenario'. Whereas L ght standard for residential
-zone is violated upto a distance of about 700 m. from ROW in both the    I
modeled years. Lay -violations are not expected to occur in the    F. -
-commercial zone in both the modeled years. Since there will be no
commercial activity at night, Light violations for commercial zone are
not considered.
The proposed project is expected to violate 14,y standard for residential
zone upto a distance of about 300 m and 700 m in 2000 and 2015 A.D.
respectively. Whereas Lffi standard for residential zone is violated
upto a distance of about 700 m in both the modeled years. I-day
violations are. expected lo occur in the commercial zone upto a
-distance of about 45 m and 125 -m from ROW in 2000 and 2015 A.D.
respectively. However, with the provision of bypasses across two major
residential areas viz, Jarod and Asoj, noise levels are less likely to
violate the respective standards. If any new land developments are
restricted only beyond 45 .m .from centre of the road, the noise
L  -      violations would not be all that significant.
The school existing at a distance of about 100 m from ROW boundary
at village Jarod -is classified under a 'Silence Zone'. During 'Do
Nothing' scdnario, .it is likely -to experience day noise levels (Liy) of
56.8 dB(A) and .58.5 .dB(A) in 2000 and 2015 A.D. respectively.
Whereas during 'With Project' scenario, the Lday noise levels at school
would be 61.3 .dB(A). and 66 dB(A) in 2000 and 2015 A.D. respectively
(against Lday standard for silence zone of 50 dB(A)). The noise levels
would be attenuated by 5 - 8 dB(A) with boundary wall raised to 3 m
and provision of landscaping..
The computations carried out gives an indication of noise levels in an
worst case scenario, i.e. without taking into consideration the local
features like landuse, barriers etc. In reality, the noise levels are
expected to be on lower side due to these considerations. Moreover the
F                             noise levels monitored in the villages viz., Jarod, Halol naka, Dhanjipura
have recorded high levels in the range of 62.9 dB(A) to 65.6 dB(A)
during day and 54.8 dB(A) to 67.4 dB(A) during night. This is mainly due*
to local activities and high background levels.

4.4.3      Impact on Water Quality,
'The present water quality has been assessed by studying four surface: .
waters and one ground water samples. The results are presented in-
Appendix 3.4. The summary of the same is presented below:
Impact on Surface Water Quality                        t i
All tested parameters are found well within the permissible limits as per,1
;!' ,         -                -      IS:2296 and thereby indicating-the good quality of surface water at all'-
sampling locations.
The construction and operation of the proposed highway project will not
''have any-.major impact on the surface water and the ground water
quality in Ahe area. Contamination to water bodies may result due to:
spilling of construction materials, oil, grease, fuel and paint in the;
equipment'yards and asphalt plants. But, the quantities of such spills is
very negligible.
Care, however needs to be taken to provide adequate sanitary facilities
and drainage in the temporary colonies of the construction workers.
Provision of adequate washing and toilet facilities with septic tanks and
appropriate refuse collection and disposal system  ishould be made
obligatory-.
'The water-quality -of the existing surface water bodies vfiz, ponds, rivers,
irrigation canals are observed to be potable. The ponds at villages Asoj,
Khandewadi and Baska are basically used by the nearby habitants for
domestic purposes. During construction care should be taken not to alter
the odginal water quality status of the ponds. This can be achieved by
2- 1-;1 ' i       - ---  X  0- ' 0 ;;' excluding these ponds as a source for water during construction -
'-w                             ' (including that for the construction camps) providing water and sanitary
facilities in the construction camps etc.
An adequate foresight and creation of'physical facilities; will minimize the
above problems. This should form an integral component in the planning
stage before commencement of construction activity.
Impact on Ground Water Quality
Ground water pollution can take place only if a dump contains chemical
substances,- which will get leached by precipitation of water and
percolate to the ground water table. This is not the case with the present
project as the activity does not contain any harmful ingredients which

4.5        IMPACT ON ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES
The baseline flora and fauna has been depicted in Section 3.9, Chapter-
;L  ~   ^ #  - 3. Accordingly, there is no wildlife sanctuary, reserved or protected forest
in the close vicinity of the proposed highway. The area in a radius of 50
-'- --        -            - ~km hosts small patches of forest land, which mainly consists of few
scrubs and trees. There are no endangered or rare species in the forest
patches. The ecological impacts are briefly described in the following
sections.
4.5.1      Impact on Terrestrial Ecology
The initial construction works at the project site involving land clearance,
cutting, filling and leveling, will cause loss of potential agricultural
productive land and loss of vegetation. A total of 966 trees out of 1621
(identified along the road - see Table -3.15) are required to be cut down
for the construction work.
Li 8 -  -    -         -    Inevitably, there will be a short term impact of availability of nesting sites
for the birds. -Since the area harbors mainly local grainivourous avian
fauna, this should not affect their nesting requirements. Further, there is
no sensitive ecological area near the existing road, so the impact will not
be of significance. With the landscaping after the project, the number of
trees are expected to be more than earlier numbers and will allow the
L:                          short term impact to be reversed.
Li
The ROW  requirements and the borrow areas does not involve any
reserved/protected forest land and therefore project impacts in the forrn
i .                          . - - - of loss of forest cover do not exist. ;;
[l .' -- The barren / grassland areas covered by the alignment have little or no
tree growth.                           ;--
I-                          The removal of herbaceous vegetation from the soil and loosening of the
fcj.                        top soil generally causes soil erosion. However, such impacts would be
primarly confined to the,project.site during initial periods of the
construction phase and, would be mirinimized through adoption of
L:         -  - -      .   mitigative measures like paving and. surface treatment, water sprinkling
and appropriate plantation program. The project site will be landscaped
with the development of green belt consisting of a variety of trees which
would enrich the ecology of the area and add to the aesthetics.
-    -- -                  The constructional activities lead to inward migration of labour force in
the area and thus there would be pressure on trees in the area due to
increase in fuel demand. ln order to prevent felling of trees in the
neighboring areas, adequate alternate fuel should be arranged to meet
the fuel requirement of labour.force.   --

Vadodara - Halo/ Road                                       Impact Assessment
Wild Life
No rare or endangered species have been reported from the area
covered by the proposed alignment. No wild life travel routes of t
significance'have been noted/recorded along the alignment. The wild life
in these area do not confer any significant benefit on the local
population.
The increased vehicular traffic coupled with higher noise levels due to
various constructional activities may drive away the local fauna from the
project site to the neighboring area. As the project is devoid of forest and
trees, it does not harbor any fauna of importance. Therefore, the impact
of constructional activities on fauna will be negligible.
4.5.2       Impact on Aquatic Ecology
The -proposed road would pass over three rivers viz. Viswamitr,
Narmada Canal and river Surva. River overbrdges aire planned over -
these rivers adjoining the existing bridges. No signifiicant impacts on
aquatic ecology of the area are perceived due to the construction of
-  f   ; --    t    these bridges.
4.6         IMPACT ON HUMAN USE VALUES
4.6.1       Soils
The impact on soil due to this project is in terms of top soil erosion.
Considerable care should be taken while locating the camps buildings,
borrow pits, quarries, spoil and disposal site which will minimize the soil
erosion. The impact of construction would be minor as a very small area
is susceptible to excessive soil erosion. Soil pollution would take place to
-a negligible extent due to spillage of construction material, oil, fuel,
'4            L        ~         'grease and-asphalt around the construction yards.
:4.6.2  ;    Land Use Development
,The.-development bin the study area will definitely bring substantial
changes in the-landuse pattem. In this process, areas presently under
agriculture and vegetal cover will be diverted for development and for
other usagei The acquisition of less fertile fallow lands mostly covered

in the immediate vicinity of the proposed.project area.
- The proposed project includes landscaping tree plantation all along the
road alignment which will add to the quality of life and aesthetics of the
area. Diversion of road sections away from the  inhabited areas in
major enroute towns and villages will also lead to improved air quality
and noise levels.

the management plan, the pit sites are required to be restored and
reclaimed in a satisfactory state on completion of mining operations. -
During the operation of mine, the lessee is required to take adequate-
care not,to deprive -local water users of their requirements for domestic
and agricultural use and also not to pollute the surface water sources in
the vicinity- of the mining area. As the quarry will be restored and
reclaimed-by the lessee impacts on local environment are therefore not
envisaged;due to stone aggregate mining of the project.
Further it needs to.be noted that the existing quarries are being utilized
for supplying material to Vadodara and Halol districts, they do not cater
x s ii                            to the need of only this project.
4.7        OTHER ISSUES
4.7.1      Transport of Hazardous Material
As brought out in Chapter 2, during the road side sunrey, it was found
that about 23.9% of the commodities transported through the existing
road are of hazardous type comprising of petroleum products (0.6%),
industrial raw materials (95%), petrol and oil (7.0%) and chemicals and
fertilizers (6.8%).
After the i(nplementation of the proposed road, increase in traffic is
envisaged due to development of industries and other allied activities in
the close vicinity. On the other side, congestion problems and probability
of accidents will reduce considerably due to the better design service
Jevel.
'The spillage materials on the road near the ponds or rivers/canals may
cause loss of life or property as also adverse water quality impacts, if the
materials find their way into -surface water bodies. 1ransport of the
hazardous materials by road is regulated by Motor Vehicle Act 1989,
which provides precautions to be followed by the consignor, owner of the
.goods carrier and its driver to minimize the risk of accidents and damage
control in the event of mishap. As a precautionary measure, the nearest
fire brigade stations should be upgraded adequatelyt to handle the
emergencies arising from accidents involving spillage, of hazardous
materials.  -
4.7.2      Issues Related to Proposed Alignment
-A-review of the proposed alignment at Jarod, Asoj, Khandewadi and
Baska villages indicates the recommended alignment will bypass the
villages (at Asoj options of passing only the new 2 lane carriageway

relocation of families, permanent and temporary structures and
business, trees, place of worship and encroachment of surface water
bodies.
The proposed alignment -at Khandewadi occupies about 10% of the
pond area (about 15 m wide and about 100 m length), which is located
just adjacent to the existing carriageway. The village is situated on the
opposite side of the pond. Pedestrian and cattle crossing the existing
carriageway from the village for using the pond is observed. A survey of
utilization of pond for various-uses has been carried out and the findings
of the same is presented in Table-2.5 (chapter 2).
A perusal of the data presented in the above table reveals that on an
average about 190 persons use the pond facility daily for various
purposes. About 42.6% of them use pond for bathing, 16.8% for cloth
washing and the remaining (40.6%) use for other- purposes. The data
shows that the local in-habitants are dependent on the pond facility.
The land acquisition -is likely to limit the holding capacity of the pond,
which may lead to flooding of adjacent areas during monsoon season.
This impact can be minimized by resizing the ROW requirements in the
pond area, and implementation of mitigatory measures like deepening of
the pond, bank 'improvement works or provision of altemative water
supply by borewells to the local in-habitation near the village, which will
further reduce dependence of villagers on the existing pond and reduce
pedestrian crossing of the road.
However, it is important to note that the areas to be reclaimed from the
Vi    -ponds do not lie on their perphery and includes only those area which
remain dry except for the monsoon. The reclamation, therefore, would
not have any significant impact on the ecology of the ponds, once,, the
holding capacity of the ponds is restored.
4.7.3      Severance Issues
There are few utilities like telephone, electric poles and fibre optic cables
which need to be relocated.   -  :     -
- As regards cattle and pedestnan since the proposed alignment bypasses
the villages, during the course of public consultation, specific needs
expressed by the villagers are incorporated in the projedt design. These
designated -pedestrian crossings thould be provided with traffic signs
with'-focused- lighting arrangetnents. Table-4.11 summarizes the
proposed provisions. -

jeep. van, etc.), tractors and light commercial vehicles.
However, heavy commercial vehicles will have to enter the main carriageway and use the U turn faciliiles to cross the main carriageway.

Vadodara - Halol Road                                   Impact Assessment
4.7.4      Cross Drainage Works
The existing alignment has 17 RCC pipe drains, 12 RCC slab drains, 3
minor bridges and 3 major bridges. The existing waterways are
functioning normally apart from local scouring near the unprotected -
foundations. Even though the waterways are blockedl by vegetation at
many locations, there is no record of flooding or overtopping of
embankment.
The proposed project envisages repair/reconstruction of the existing CD
works and bridges where warranted and construction of new bridges and
CD works Qadjacent to the existing ones (due to widening of the
carriageway). Hence impact of CD works is not considered to be of
significance.
4.8        SUMMARY OF IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT
The potential impacts of typical highway projects was given in Table 4.1.
The Table-4.12 below summarizes the impacts specific to this project
considering the present environmental setting.

Vadodara - Halol Road                                    Project Altematives
:5.0       'PROJECT AND NO;PROJECT SCENARIOS                               -
L<,. :: ~. :.  a. . :-    5.1     BACKGROUND
The Vadodara - Halol road which links Vadodara city to the industrial
-town of Halol has been identified as one of the most important State
. - r . 3 T         ;      -    Highways in the State of Gujarat which require immediate upgradation
by the strategic options study of the state road network carried out by
the Govemment of Gujarat (GoG) in 1995. The need for the project is
summarised in Chapter 2. The main objective of the proposed
Vadodara-Halol highway project is to provide a faster and reliable route
to cater to the heavy traffic on the existing highway by providing an
additional carriage way that upgrades the link to a four lane divided
carriage -way from  the present two lane individual link. As the
Vadodara-Halol road is a imminent link and the traffic is expected to
grow at a fast rate, the proposed project is a key to improved traffic
management in the region.
The present highway passes through villages, has substandard curves
which requires improvement at 35 locations (out of 43) to achieve a
higher level of service, experiences traffic congestion and lack of safety
due to which the air and noise pollution as well as accidents are on the
rise. The engineering designs evolved out widening of the carriageway   .'
and improvement of geometrics resulted in various altemative
F.                            - alignments. These altematives were assessed based on social,  ,.:
-,,,environmental -and engineering considerations. The recommended   -
alignment which minimis&s the social and environmental impacts (land   :
L :-X-    :    i .0   -:       .acquisition,. R&R -issues, pond encroachment, increased safety,   [
reduced noise and air pollution) is recommended (Chapter 2 provides
the details).      : 
It is on this background that In the present chapter, two scenarios viz.,
the "No Project" and "This Project' scenarios have been discussed.
5-   ^  :.2  NO PROJECT SCENARIO
The present Vadodara-Halol highway is heavily loaded with traffic.
A three day average traffic volume counts carried out at two locations
viz., one near Vadodara and, the second near Halol in early 1996
indicates that nearly 50% of vehicles are goods vehicles.
Classified traffic volume count survey conducted for seven days
conducted at two locations on the existing project road indicates that
goods vehicles constitute nearly 45% of the traffic. Car traffic is about
L;                         *   20%, whereas buses constitute a mere 6%.                            - -
The seasonal variation in traffic flow studied using the past 10 years*
month wise toll collection revenues indicates that traffic is lowest in the
--month -of August. and maximum in January due to more local traffic

being included. There is about 25% variation between the traffic o
January and August. However, the weekly variation is only margina
with Sunday and Monday showing lower traffic than other days. witi
Monday being a local holiday for many industries.
The traffip forecast studies indicate that the total traffic volume will reach
a limiting capacity by the year 2008. The details of traffic projections are
given in Table-5. 1.

The No Project scenarios estimates that the existinc two lane road will
reach a limiting capacity of 40,551 PCU/day in the year 2008. With an
addition of shoulders, this can be increased by a maximum of 20% to
about 48,000 PCU/day.
The heavy traffic on the existing road have led to congestion, delays
and accidents. Congestion results in excessive fuel consumption and
increased air pollution due to auto exhaust emissions.
The 'No Project' (No Build) scenario may only preivent the marginal
rise in the ambient air quality and noise levels during the construction
phase of the proposed highway which may not be -very significant.
- -   -  -     ~    However, in the operation phase, the result of increased traffic through
the village will lead to increased population exposure to air and noise
pollution. It also will result in:
-  -  ,                          .    increased travel time;
I - . increased vehicle operating costs; and
increased accidents.
The 'No Project' scenario would in fact be a major setback to an
effective solution to traffic hazards and associated problems. It would
arrest  the  possible -significant  enhancement  and  economic
development of the entire region.
5.3        THIS PROJECT SCENARIO
The proposed road (second carriageway) runs adjacent to the existing
highway and provides better level of service like high design speeds for
-similar traffic volumes. The project would help reduction of the traffic

A perusal of the data presented in the above table clearly reveals a
steady rise of traffic densities on the existing road in the limiting and
normal capacities with No Project Scenario. In the limiting capacity
scenario, the maximum rise in VIC ratio is likely to be at 3.36 against the
present ratio of 0.55 with No Project Scenario. Similarly, the ratio for
With Project Scenario will be 0.82 in the year 2030 with respect to the
existing ratio of 0.13.
Whereas with the normal capacity, the rise in volume/capacity ratio is
likely to be at 6.79 against the present ratio of 1.11 with No Project
Scenario. Similarly, the ratio for With Project Scenario will be 1.27 in the
year 2030 with respect to the existing ratio of 0.21.
Comparison of "No Project" scenario with the "Proposed Project" has
emerged the following findings:
the projected travel time reduces from about 36 minutes to 25
minutes for each vehicle;
:-       the project is expected to provide an averag e 42.3% saving
in fuel requirement which will have a prolportional positive
impact on air quality;
the project implementation will bypass the main villages along
the route and would reduce the populatiion exposure to-
pollutants; and

Vadodara - Halol Road                   Environment Management Plan
6.0        ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN'
[                   6.1        INTRODUCTION
An  Environmental Management  Plan  (EMP)  has  been
recommended in this -chapter which highlights all concemed
environmental issues, mitigatory actions to be taken and the
agencies responsible for implementation of these measures.
The  present project will however have  some  negative
environmental impact-s on the ambient air quality and noise levels   -- 
during the construction phases. Other issues such as green belt
removal and land acquisition are also related to the project.
Although some of these impacts. especially air and noise impacts
cannot be fully avoided. measures can be taken towards
reduction of these impacts by way of mitigatory measures. The
project has overall positive impacts by way of reduction in travel
time, congestion and accidents. Also, in terms of prominent
-environmental impacts of road projects on air quality and noise
levels, the project brings considerable improvement to possible
zexposure levels to population when compared with no project
scenario.
6.2        IMPACT DURING CONSTRUCTION PHASE
6.2.1      Impact on Air Quality
During construction period the impacts on air quality are mainly
due to the material movement and the actual construction         !  -
F,                            activities.
Due to material movement air quality over a large area is affected
though, not in significant levels. There is an increase in the dust
levels all along the haul roads, the borrow areas and the dumping
areas.                                       -
L,:                           The emissions from the construction machinery are the major
source of -ambient air-pollution;during the actual construction.
* Continuous use of construction machinery and generator sets
may cause rise in -ambient air pollution levels. The degree of
impact may be higher during winter season and during night time.

Mitigation Measures
Mitigation Measures for Mobile Source Emissions
In prder to curb the increased fugitive dust emissions in the
area due to vehicular movement and raw  material
'transport, provisions should be made for sprinkling of
water on all the haul roads in the area. Sprinkling of water
should be carried out at least twice a day on a regular
basis during the entire construction period especially in the
winter and summer seasons. Special attention should be
given to all the haul roads passing through residential
areas in the region. Daily inspection at hali roads and at
construction site should be carried out to ensure removal
of construction debris to the landfill sites;
Dust covers should be used over the beds of trucks which
will be used for the transportation of materials prone to
fugitive dust emissions. Additionally any of these materials
which may collect on the horizontal surfaces of these
trucks  during - loading  should  be  removed  before
transportation;
Construction requiring street closings in heavy traffic areas
should be performed during off-peak hours;
Idling of delivery trucks or other equipments should not be
permitted during periods when they are being unloaded or
.. { -            ...                     . are not in active use;
- ..;.*  Concrete should be supplied from an on site batching plant
in order to reduce travel distances of concrete delivery
trucks; and
---*  -Low emission (diesel) construction vehicles and generator
-     f; -                      .             sets should be used wherever possible.
-Mitigation Measures for Fixed Source Emissions
* -DLmNOx emission from the construction yards iis expected to
have a some  influence- up to 1 km distance on the
downwind side under adverse meteorologic,al conditions.
Hence, it is desirable that construction yard should not be
located within 1 km of major villages like Jarod, Asoj.
: ~- ;+.i                                    Khandewadi and Baska;
; i - Within the construction yard the stationary equipments
should be located as far as practicable from  receptor
locations in order to allow dispersion of emitted pollutants;

L-              Refer Action Sheet- 1 and 2, Table-6.3 and 6.4
6.2.2       Impact on Noise Levels
f       -    -                 The pri.fne sources of noise levels during the construction phase
are the construction machinery and the vehicular noise due to
material movement at the site. Though the effect of noise would
be insignificant during daytime, -the residential areas located in
L.                             the near vicinity of the construction site may experience increase
in the night time ambient noise levels. (Refer Action Sheet - 3,
Table-6.5).
Mitigation Measures
Li                            .      Construction  contracts should  specify   that   the
construction equipments should meet the noise and air
'~j /  -            -emission levels as pe'r-EPA Rules, 1986.
The siting of construction yards sites should be done
leaving at least 100 m distance from any residential areas
in the project area except at major villages like Jarod, Asoj,
Khandewadi and Baska where it desirable that it should be      F:
i                           - - -    1 'km; away due-to air pollution control requirements and
specifi6ally at least 250 m away from the school at Jarod
which will allow noise to attenuate; and
L                         - . -      The main stationary noise producing sources such as the
generator sets'etc. ~should be-provided with noise shields
around them.''The noise shields can either be a brick
L                   -    -   -  -  masonry structure '-or-any other physical barrier which is
effective in adequate'attenuation of noise levels. A three
meter high enclosure made up of brick and mud with
- ^ - --      - internal plastering-:of a non-reflecting surface will be very
effective in these regards. For protection of construction
workers, ear plugs should be,provided to those working
-very close to the noise generating machinery.

6.2.3      Impact on Water Quality
The proposed project will not alter the existing water quality on a
permanent basis, but during the construction phase extent of
surface runoff and silt load may increase giving rise to a negative
impact on receiving natural water bodies.
Mitigation Measures
Runoffs from the construction site should be passed
through silt traps.
6.2.4      Sanitation at Workers Colony
Sewage.. and the domestic solid waste generated at the
construction workers colony would have a negative impact on the
aesthetics and environment of the surrounding area, if not
disposed off in.an efficient manner.
Mitigation Measures
The worker's camp must not be located within 1 km of the
villages Jarod, Asoj, Khandewadi and Baska; and
The construction.workers should be allotted a specified
area of land on which the workers temporary colony
should be built. Adequate sanitary facilities, drainage,
washing and toilet facilities with septic tanks and refuse
collection and disposal should be provided to the workers.
The provision. of water supply and toilet facililies should be
made as per the stipulated guidelines in Indian Labour Act.
'..   '.Refer Action Sheet - 4, Tables-6.6
6.2.5      Impact On Natural Pond At Khandewadi Village
Another negative environmental impact would be due to the
alignment'at Asoj and Khandewadi villages which occupies about
10% of the surface water pond located just adjacent to the
existing carriageway. The .pond area of about 7339 sq. m. and
.1324 sq. m. -would be acquired at Asoj and Khandewadi
respectively. The villages are situated on the opposite side of the

6.2.6       Removal of Trees and Landscaping
About 966 trees (out of 1621) would be felled in the area for the
L                             construction of the road.
Mitigation Measures
L    . Landscaping should be done with a lag of 3-4 months from
the start of the work on any section. The section should be
r                                deemed to be complete'When the landscaping is over. An
agency must be appointed thereafter to maintain the survival
of plants and paid on plant survival rate;
* -Plant species suitable for, the area should be planted at the
r-onset of monsoon season. The plants should -be provided
adequate - protection 'from  animals and proper monitoring
- -  -     should be carried out to assure their growth; and
A plantation plan of 5950 trees inclusive of all-tree species
(two rows along the cariageways and service roads and
- ;   -  - median) per, kilometer stretch -of the highway has been
0           envisaged for-this project. Thus a total of 1,96,350 trees will

6.3        IMPACT DURING OPERATIONAL PHASE
- The. operation -of the proposed highway would be socio-
-    -, o-;    -  - 0   -~~economically beneficial to the entire area due to a reliable and
fast transport- facility with a high level of service. Traffic
congestion and  resulting delays and acciidents would be
minimized on all other roads of the area.
A rise in air pollution in the areas  adjacent to and in the
ii J -- =downwind direction of the road will be observed as the traffic
grows in future. The observed levels will be however lower than
the expected levels as smooth traffic flow will reduce the emission
levels per unit distance traveled. Also noise levels will be lower
due to re-routing of the alignment away from the population
centers.
6.3.1      Impact on Air Quality
After the project implementation the ambient air quality levels in
future years will be better with respect to without project scenario.
However, as the traffic increases, the ambient iair quality levels
will also increase marginally. The effect will be more pronounced
during winter season when -night time ground level inversion are
observed in the area.
Mitigation Measures
-  ~*    The most effective -control methods of air pollution due to
vehicular emissions is to use fuel efficient engines,
introduction of catalytic converters for petrol vehicles and
use of smoke traps for diesel vehicles;
~-     ;i*    It should be made compulsory for all vehicles to adhere to
the engine maintenance schedules and CPCB standards
-o reduce -air pollution due to vehicular emissions.
Considering the fact that buses from a low percentage
,         .         ;  z      3 3 - ^ ;~   (6%) of existing traffic, there is a scope to improve public
ItrAnsport which may reduce the two wheelers traffic and
thereby the air emissions;
-     Along the highway plantation of trees such as neem which
- has known properties to absorb HC is recommended. Care
- should however be taken to space the trees so as not to
restrict movement of air; and
- --. ,Development of landscape along the main road can bring
about 30 percent reduction of concentration of pollutants
at the ground level. It is therefore recommended that the
area available on both sides of the highway should be
used to develop a green belt  with dense canopy to

During the operation stage. there would be an increase in the
ambient noise levels of the region due to continuous traffic
movement.-Ambient night time noise levels would experience
- -      high levels due to movement of heavy traffic. However due to
provision of the bypasses -at Asoj, Baska and Jarod, there will not
be  any  population  within the  impacted  zone. After the
implementation of -the project, the population along the existing
highway.will at best be -exposed to the local traffic only. Further
the noise levels from the proposed expressway will be attenuated
upto 5 dB(A) due to the plantation and landscaping thereby

Use of air horns should be minimized on the highway
during night time. During daytime use of homs should be

-Environmental   monitoring    and    institutional
arrangements
The mitigation measures suggested in Table-6.1 requires
-monitoring of ambient air quality and noise levels during winter
and peak conlstruction activities at the construction yard
-      . respectively. The monitoring requirements can be adequately met
by sub-contracting the assignment to an organization undertaking
ambient air quaiity and noise monitoring.
It will be desirable to formalize a mechanism for the incorporation
V                               and supervision of recommended mitigatory measures during the
construction. As a first step the mitigation plan should be made a
part of bid document to enable the prospective contractor a good
understanding   of  recommended   measures   and   his
responsibilities towards their implementation. To supervise
effective implementation, SPV should take the following steps
L -                             during construction phase of the project.
Assign all supervision to an official conversant with
environmental and social issues related to the project;
Constitute Citizens' Committee with due representation
from women, Non Govemment Organizations (NGOs) and
elderly residents to provide regular feedback on adequacy
'of mitigatory efforts,
L.                              .     Arrange for monthly report from the contractor on steps

If the Environmenit Management Plan is implemented completely,
there will not any environmental risk in the implementation of the
project. The proposed alignment bypasses the villages Jarod,
Asoj, Khandewadi and Baska as also the other villages thereby
limiting the adjerse impacts of air and noise pollution within
L                              acceptable limits; This also reduces the social risk as there are
minimal R&R a.zpects to be tackled. This is an existing highway
where the cross drainage works provided have been found to be
effective (inspite of blockages in the drainage no flooding have
been recorded). As the proposed project -will be strengthening the

However, as the proposed project road will lead to continued and
increased transportation of hazardous substanc:es, even if they
are expected to follow the Environmental Regulations regarding

some back-up facilities in the event of an accident.  It is
recommended that the following facilities be provided as a part of
the project:
- i. ;ambulance stationed at the toll booth
ii.  'tow truck-for removing damaged vehicles
ii-.  -communication facilities at each (and in between) ends
iv.   access to fire-local (district) fighting facilities.
In the current operation scenario of the project, it is necessary for
the project operator to undertake additional responsibility for
above backup facilities in view of the stakes involved in operation
of the toll road. However, like any other nationaVstate highway,
the operator's responsibility is nevertheless limitedl since it is the
district administration's job to highway accidents.
6.7        BUDGETARY  COST  ESTIMATES  FOR  ENVIRONMENT
PROTECTION
The mitigation measures suggested in Table-6. 1 and Action
Sheets - 1 to 7 requires monitoring of ambient air quality, noise
levels and--provision. of sanitation facilities, alternative bathing,
washing and toilet facilities at Asoj and Khandewadi villages and
development of green belt (Landscaping) along the proposed
highway. The monitoring requirements during the construction
phase can be adequately met by sub-contracting the assignment
to an organization undertaking these studies by SPV. The cost
estimates, presented in this section (Table-6.2) are for the
:  ---M:,1                 i-- -i mitigation measures brought out above. These cost estimates
give only a an u idication of likely cost.

;   ',, 1.1  :   .Objectives Of Social Assessment Study
Road improvement includes realignment of road at certain chainages
which may involve expropriation of land from the current owners/users.
Expropriation of land, eviction of squatters and removal of agricultural
-encroachments from  Right Of Way (ROW) gives rise to social
L -                        disruption and economic loss to the persons and families who derive
economic benefits from those -assets.
According to detailed pre-feasibility study carried out by IL&FS, the
existing ROW of state highway between Vadodara and Halol is 24 m
!--  :   :                except at the curve -points where it extends upto 30 m. The proposed
L, ?-:    ':   '           fwidening and road improvements require 60 m wide strip of land at the
straight sections and upto 70 m wide strip at the curves. This additional
area betw6en the existing ROW and land required for the widened (i.e.
a strip of 36 m all along sections running along the existing road) and
improved road is defined as "Corridor of Impact" and forms the basis
for identification of Project Affected Persons (PAPs).
The main objective of the social assessment exercise is to assess the
social impact of the project, identify issues and assess consequent risk
to the project due to acquisition of land and assets as well as negative
social impacts, outline  Resettlement and  Rehabilitation  (R&R)
measures to mitigate.the negative-impacts and risks due to the project.
The remedial measures suggested in the mitigation plan must ensure
that all the> PAPs have their income levels after the project
rF                        implementation improved or at least :restored to the pre-project levels.
This leads to visualise the whole exercise as composed of three main
components viz (i) a General Social Impact Assessment, (ii) Public
Information and -Consultation, the results of which will become the
-.base for (iii) a Resettlement Action 'Plan (RAP).
r      -        -  1.2   Study Process
The process. of social assessment involves primarily the following
steps:
L                         1.   General Assessment    This process  involves enlisting
chainagewise -all Ihe PAPs' 'iPublic and  Privately owned
;  i- ;    (movable and fixed) structures, Trees (fruit bearing and non-fruit
- E ;S  . bearing) -belonging to the land owners etc. and their exact
distances -from the- central line of the existing ROW. The
V                -                f . d outcome- of this exercise' gives the idea about the chainagewise
amount of the losses involved in the.project implementation and
.. . - serves"as- the first order'approximation to the final risk

The social assessment study was initiated in August 1996 and the
focus was on the general assessment, identification and profiling of the
> - -5,: .";'! ~ '' , ' structure  PAPs.--, ..... ,.-----
A set of PIC was conducted in March 1997 to assess the project
.,awareness among the villagers of the project area, to inform them
about the project design, to understand their general views, opinions,
sentiments pertaining to the project, to identify major issues and issues
in commonality and obtain consent on draft R&R measures. The major
outcomes of PIC exercise are briefed in Annexure II.
1.4         Minimisation Of Adverse Social Impact
The initial verification exercise carried out by the consultants identified
594 structures in 31.5 Kms road length. Since 395 structures (66.5 %)
of the total, structures. (594) are coming in only thiree villages viz.,
Jarod, Asoj and Baska, it has been proposed to bypass these villages
in mutual consultation with local population in these villages.
- The resettlement issues at another enroute village Khandewadi were
minimized by reducing the proposed ROW  of 60 m to 36 m and
acquiring the land on the east of the existing carriageway in order to
avoid the demolition of a settlement of huts (44).

The Consultants, in consultation-with IL&FS officials and GoG officials,
adopted the above measures which led to minimization of  the

1. The resettlement owing to -demolition of residential structures has
~been reduced from 225 PAFs to 10 PAFs;
2. The requirement-of restoration of commercial structures has been

3.The requirement of shifting of temples has been reduced from 19
to 7;and                                                       i, .

The land records will be updated for the project area by the LA
proceedings which have been initiated with the publication of Section
4(1) notification-under LA Act, 1894 and amended in 1984. The PAPs
entitled for the compensation against land acquisition will be identified
rightfully only when the claims of parties having interest in the notified
lands are invited and settled u/s 9 of the LA Act. All LA notifications u/s

[               1.6          Legal Procedure for LA
For.any LA, the Act under section (u/s) - 4(1) stipulates publication of a
notification to that effect in -the official Gazette and in two daily
L~ 0          R       7     newspapers circulated in the locality of which at least one shall be in
the regional language. Such a notification enables the concemed
authorities to enter upon the land, make preliminary survey, ascertain
L                   <       its suitability, and determine,the exact portion of the land to be
acquired. The substance -of this notification is given as public notice at
a convenient place in the locality in which the land to be acquired is
located. Such a notification provides an opportunity to the parties
interested in the land to file-objections if any, u/s-5A to the proposed
acquisition.
'in order to proceed, with the.acquisition of the notified land or any
portion of it, a declaration u/s-6 of the Act specifies the precise
L,                          boundaries of -the area of the land to be taken and has to be issued

1.7-        R&R Policy
R&R policy for the project has been formulated in accordance with the 
World Bank Guidelines on Involuntary Resettlemenit (OD 4.30) and'
Environment and Social Report ( a policy statement on environmental
.   and social issues) of the IL&FS. The VHRP lpolicy takes into
consideration those coming within the 'corridor of ne.gative impact' of'
the project: Essentially they are in two broad categoriies.
*  those with private ownership of land and other immovable
assets; and
-encroachers on government land and squatters within the
corridor of impa'ct.
The main objective of deriving, the entitlement through compensation
and assistance to-be given to the PAPs during R&R is to ensure that
.*.   heir standards of living is. at least restored to the pre-project level and
preferably improved above the levels they enjoyed before the
implementation of ihe project. In the absence of any legal regulatory
framework to govem such entitlements associated with resettlement
and rehabilitation projects, IL&FS has adopted its own standards for
entitlement framework as furnished below in Table - 2.

1.8        Coverage Of Socio-Economic Profile Survey Of PAPs
The exercise of conducting  a socio-economic survey of the PAPs
generated socio-economic profiles of PAPs who were categorized in to
three main groups, viz., (1) Land holders, (2) Tenants working on
agricultural lands and  (3) PAPs loosing  residentiaUcommercial
structures but not fatling under categories (1) or (2) above to ascertain *;
their pre-project socio-economic status so as:
-  to ensure that the entitlement for each PAP is in line with the R&R I
policy; and
to provide the baseline economical status for post-project
monitoring of the implementation of the R&R measures.
Due to the difficulties experienced in identifying the land owners, as the
land records were not updated, the survey was unidertaken for only
those 50 PAFs (owning 66 plots) who could be corresctly identified as
the land owners. This needs to be followed up by a separate survey of
each PAF when the correct status of the land ownership is established.
In the case of tenants working on agricultural lands, these people
manage the lands on a seasonal (or longer) basis. The period of the
observation was in non- cropping season and therefore the tenants
were not available at the agricultural fields. As their place of residence
'and  location of agricultural lands is often different and they were
engaged in other occupation during the non-cropping period, the
tenants could not be contacted. However, extensive inquiries with the
-i    -     . - :villagers helped to generate partial list of the tenants. Accordingly, 56
land tenants were identified cultivating on 68 plots in six villages.
In'case of 10 PAFs ioosing residential structures, their socio-economic
-profiling has been done.,
A complete profiling of all the remaining commercial and public
-structures has been done which largely falls into categorizes:
* movable shops
damage to fencing and compound wall
community structures.

1. Development of an entitlement package that provides details of  . -
- compensation and rehabilitation assistance;                    ,-
-2. Integration of RAP implementation with the project execution;
3. Provision of institutional set up; and                         t,.

L  i ,,,,., 40 S  1.11    Entitlement Package-
1.11.1     Loss of Land
Considering the project design and its deviations from the existing
L   0        --::       ROW, the VHRP covering 31.5 Km of road improvement will require
acquisition of estimated 79.16 Ha of land in Vadodara district and
28.77 Ha in Panchamahal districts (total 107.93 Ha) from the private
land owners. The details of the extent of land to be acquired are given
in Table - I
Land Owner PAFs
For developing the entitlement for the land owner PAFs, the socio-
economic data was analyzed for individual families and details on the
following parameters were extracted:
I=;                        *  family size and number of adult members in the family;
.  agricultural, non-agricultural and total income;
*  loss of land to project, compensation for land and balance land
holding after.LA;
-  post-LA income with and without interest eamings accruing from
F        -R:      0;          compensation and gain/loss with respect to pre-LA income; and
vulnerable families/members in a family such as widows, aged
,  persons 'and woman headed family.                             I
With the reported cropping pattem and general yield, while analysing
the data on income, it.,was observed that some families reported
p: \                      income which prima facie appeared to be lower than that which could
have been obtained from their land holdings. Therefore the size of the
Iand holding -and absence of non-agricultural income were considered
as the main parameters for ca'tegorizing the PAPs into category 1, 2
>L: t                        - . ; . - X - .and 3 corresponding to marginally, moderately and severely affected

Land Tenants
In the absence of information about the profile of land tenants, the
entitlemeht for tenants is based on the estimated land under tenancy
from the plot numbers identified. The total land under tenancy is,
estimated as 25.45 ha (16.72 ha. - irrigated and 7.73 ha.- unirrigated).
The patter of land plot sizes is assumed to be similar to the land-
holdings under LA from private owners. Since only severely affected
tenants are to be provided land equal to MEL, it is assumed that such
requirements will be limited to 10 tenants and the remaining will be
assisted through loans / grants.
Industrial Land
Only one'case of industrial land loss of a defunct factory exists. The
compensation will be based on the land value estimated through
inquiries with Gujarat Industrial Development Boarcd (being industrial
land).
Loss of Village Land
The public land acquired within the revenue boundary of the village can
belong to either the Gram Panchayat or the Revenue Department,
GoG. In case of the govemment land, since the GoG is a member
(shareholder) of SPV, arnd since the project (road) will be transferred
back to the govemment, no compensation is proposed to be paid for
-   :                       ~       such govemment lands. As the gram panchayat / government land
holding is yet to be identified through JMS, it is proposed to pay a price
to the Gram Panchayat for such lands at the government rate from the
contingency provision.
1.11.2     Loss of Structures
Residential Houses
Ten houses are to be demolished for the proposed rcad improvement.
Seven of these houses are occupied by the owneirs themselves, 2
houses -have been rented to tenants and 1 house! is owned by a
squatter.
As per IL&FS policies, all house owners are compensated by a house
of area equal to the area of the lost structure. In case the area of the
house is less than the minimum govemment norm for single family
dwelling, a'house of -minimum area is provided (Indira Awas Vikas
Yojana). For squatters, irrespective of the size for the present dwelling,
an ownership house of minimum area as per govermment norm is
provided. The beneficiary under this case however cannot sell the
house till completion of the concession period of the project.
In the case -of VHRP all residential structures are below 32.5 sq.m.
(350 sq.ft.) in.area and therefore all entitlement are restricted to houses
with built-up';area of 32.5 sq.m. and surrounding open area of equal
dimension.       -.
In the case of tenants, it is expected that they will re-establish
themselves elsewhere and the lL8FS policy entitles them only for a

1.12        Institutional Arrangement For Implementing The RAP
1.12.1      implementation Responsibility
It is primarily the responsibility of the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to
ensure successful implementation of the project. The construction of
L         - '7f X -   <  the project mainly involves acquisition of private agricultural land to the
extent of  more than 85% of the total requirement. The entitlement
fi   e:; . - -.  - . . -: C    package developed -for individual PAFs indicate that about 20%
families will require -a grant/loan/alternate land for restoration of their  L;  :
pre-project  status.  Adequate  institutional  arrangements  for
operationalizing the 'mechanism  for assistance is necessary for
-successful-implementation of RAP. Therefore there is a need to focus
on two main issues:
*  Issues related to LA and -alternate land allocation for severely
affected PAPs; and ,.-
*  Issues related to Economic Rehabilitation (ER) of PAFs.
Land acquisition (LA) is primarily the government responsibility and a
mutually acceptable compensation at market rate is to be arrived at
-   through negotiations. The SPV is committed to pay the difference
between the compensation amount as per govemment rates and the
negotiated settlemenf price of the land. The procedure therefore will

involve interaction and consensus building with the PAFs on an
agreeable fair rate of compensation.
Economic Rehabilitation of PAFs is also necessary so that their pre-
project income levels are enhanced-or at least retained. It is essential
that the compensation paid to the PAFs is utilized to build assets for i
substituting'the loss of income to the PAFs. Since grants and loans are
proposed to be given to the severely affected PAFs as means to raise
the income levels, in addition to compensation for land (cash or land;
equal to MEL), it is necessary to identify.local business activities or
provide vocational training to utilize these grants/loans to build assets.
It is proposed to set up a committee as under:
Project Level R&R Implementation and Monitoring Committee
to ensure that the proposed ER measures including awards of
compensations are being implemented as planned, make policy
decisions to facilitate implementation of the same and give
necessary administrative decisions/directions as required.
In this context, it is necessary that a NGO experienced in LA
procedures and in implementing income generation schemes work
closely  with SPV  and- govemment. Thus the implementation
responsibility through an institutional arrangement will need to be
developed  around  the  SPV, GoG  Representative  and  NGO
involvement.
1.12.2    liWlementation Schedule
The implementation schedule depends largely on the decision of
contracting the project in two or more stretches. The schedule
proposed below assumes that i will be taken up in two stretches
simultaneously. Land should be taken into possession and handed
over to project authorities (preferably free from all encumbrances) for
carrying out constructional activities.
The first activity of the project, as far as LA is concemred is the issue of
.a notification u/s -4(1) of the LA Act, 1894 as amended in 1984. LA
takes minimum of 9-months to complete and it was initiated in October
1996. However, its further follow-up as described in clhapter 9 is yet to
-  commence. Compensation needs lo be paid to the IPAPs before the
- start -of actual project construction. In case of any delay in LA
:proceedings, R&B will take lands from their owners on 'consent basis'.
The implementation schedule is reflected in the annual phasing of
budget funds wherein it is assumed that 75% land acquisition and
-'related ER will be done in the first year itself, while the balance will be
done in the second year. Implementation schedule of 2 years has been
worked out on-the general-LA proceedings. Delays if any in the LA
cannot be specifically addressed. However, to accelerate the process
of acquiring land, negotiated settlement can be given top priority.
The activities.to be taken on an immediate basis as al part of initiating
the implementation of the RAP are as follows:

corrective measures.
F V                1.12.3     Monitoring-And Evaluation
The M&E will be done simultaneous with the implementation of the LA
& RAP. Task for M&E would include quarterly review of LA & R&R and
annual survey among PAP would establish trend in socio-economic
status. Further arrangements fcr M&E are discussed below:
Project Level Monitoring
The SPV will be responsible for setting up and putting in place a
monitoring framework for the R&R implementation of the RAP. Since
L                             M&E will be simultaneous with the initiation of R&R activities, the SPV
will beforehand develop a prescribed proforma for monitoring at
different levels - project and district. Such a monitoring system will help
L                             in developing quality control and planning for remedial measures to
overcome  implementation  problems and  build  them  into  the
programme of activities. Besides various physical and financial
L;                          . aspects, preparation of quarterly progress reports,on the progress of

their assets due to project implementation.
1.2        PIC Process
rn'                        Since the proposed project is linear in nature and very few structures
I.;                        come inAthe proposed ROW except for.the villages Jarod, Asoj and

PIC in the respective village. A pamphlet in Gujarati language (local
language) -was carefully prepared detailing major aspects and      .:

All the members of the group were invited to express themselves in
various capacities. The opinions of the group members were extremely-,

whole after classifying and analysing each and every group member's'
opinion. Various altematives for mitigation measures on general
environmental & social issues were also worked out.
Also on an individual basis wherever possible alignment of road was_
given a thought for all possible modifications.
A number of PAP-specific mitigation measures were evolved,_
discussed, evaluated and documented on the spot. Major social and..'
land acquisition related issues were discussed at an individual basis
and perceived need based solutions were suggested.
Thus the PlC process resulted in a general understanding of the'
project needs and constraints and gave confidence to the group that
they were important partLiers in the development process. A win-win'
situation wherever feasible was evolved which is intended to serve as
a guideline while developing the RAP.

such did--not have much  scope for direct employment. The
rehabilitation  measures, however, will be  developed  through
professional advise and will be compatible with the skills and market
conditions in the project area. One road crossing at the village is
considered essential and the consultants have been asked to propose

i                   -    The village is largest village- enroute the project road. The main
concem was the possible loss of business due to construction of the
project road bypassing the village resulting in diversion of traffic away
from the village. At the beginning of the meeting while expressing their
concems, villagers expressed preference for maintaining the present
alignment aand not to bypass the village. Villagers also expressed
strong opposition to the bypass due to the loss of agricultural property
LI;      ;       S         and a housing scheme in the advanced stage of planning.
Some village representatives, however, brought out the fact that village
economy had considerable dependence on transport business arising
due to locally owned transporf'vehicles which required parking and
repair/maintenance facilities. Ttiey expressed a concem that if the road
passed through the village, the transport business will suffer as there
will not be any space left along fhe road for parking the vehicles

The findings on negative environmental and social impacts of retaining
the existing alignments for-the widened road in terms of increasei
noise and air pollution, difficulties in road crossing and loss of a larg(
number of structures were explained. It was also explained that thi
traffic volumes on the project road were likely to incirease many folds ir
future years and the number of vehicles halting (passenger traffic, loca
truckers and locally generated traffic) at the village were not expectec
lo reduce from the present level. It was also told to the communits
representatives that adequate entitlement package addressing losses
and needs of individual PAPs will developed through a participatory
process. tThe consultations helped in reducing the concem for loss ol
business-and property and helped in reaching a consensus in favour of
the bypass.
-  4  The concems of all present landowners were individually discussed
and mutually acceptable course of action arrived at. The outcomes
with referepnce to the location specific plots are presented below
i..: M.P. High School : The bypass commences just near the
school. As a result, a part of school playground needs to be
acquired for extending the ROW along present alignment and
- - also a part along the bypass. As the significant area from the
school property will be lost for the proposed project, consultants
will examine the possibility of minimizing the land acquisition by
reducing the ROW to 45 m (from 60 m).
-  ii.   - -Survey no. 707  'Proposed Janata Co-operative Housing
Society (Mr. Adambhai Gafoorbhai Vora) - The entire land
-holding has been given the permission for property development
as Non-Agricultural (NA) land. The housing scheme has been
approved by the Taluka Development Officer. Although some
other pernissions required for property development are still
required, the permissions would have been granted by the
relevant authorities if the bypass was not planned. The bypass,
therefore, result in considerable loss of business to PAP. The
i  options discussed to minimize the perceived loss were:
* Reduce the ROW from 60 m to 45 m
--  Provide assistance in utilising the compensation amount to
-   ;; *  -   purchase adjacent land to overcome loss of area of housing
scheme due to the project
-  Provide assistance in obtaining the NA (non-agricultural use)
permission for the land

The village is the fourth largest village enroute the project road and has
a population of about 1818 as per 1991 census. Thie prominent village
is located at about 600 m south of the proposed bypass. The mair
concem of the villagers was transparency in the compensation policy.
The villagers expressed their opinion about land compensation by
-suggesting that equivalent amount of land in nearby area be provided
ensuring that an altemative source of income was available to all those
who will fully dependent on his / her limited agricultire land. During the
PIC, villagers realised the need for an underpass for the villagers and
tractors and such other vehicles to enhance their saifety. The details of
the discussions -are presented below:
a.   Clarifications on the compensation policy for proposed/approved
development housing/commercial schemes on NA land were
asked.
-  -   ~-                  -        ; b.   A uniform- fequest by all participants for relaxing the distance
limit for development (under Urban Development Flules, 45 m
,: ,    ,'.J   '  ,  ,_ .for residential development and 75 m for industrial development
from the centreline of the highway) along the existing highway.
Considering that after the proposed bypass at Asoj village, the
status of the existing highway may be chaunged from 'State
-   ;  --  -  -     -- -   Highway' -to 'other District Road", the change  in the
development rules may be possible. This matter can be taken
up with the R&B authorities by IL&FS.
c. - Land acquisition related specific concems were discussed with
some of the individual affected persons present. This is given
below with reference to the location specific plots:
SurveV no. 263/247 - Mr. Ghanashyambhai Pttel
ii   Survey no. 231 t0.375 acres) and 232 (2.5 acres) - Mr.
Bhikhabai Patel
iii   Survey nos. 223 - Mr. Ranchodbhai K. Patel : The land is partly
used by Air Command. Apart from the present land which will be
acquired partly, the owner has 14 acres land elsewhere. The
options discussed to minimize the land loss were:
-  the remaining land between the two highways also be
- procured as it serves little utility in future development
(planned to construct a colony on the land and NA obtained).

Ashwinbhai Sheth (total land to be acquired 1.36 Ha.): The
''~ -agricultural land (65 acres) belongs to a joint family having
substantial land provides a source of income. The proposed
alignment divides the land into two unequal parts limiting its
utility, especially the 'triangular portion between the existing  l
;K,,                             highway  and  proposed  expressway.  The  options  for
compensating the land'discussed were:
'review the geometrics of the proposed alignment and identify
a possible alternatives for straightening the curves on the
alignment and reducing the ROW  to 45 m, so that the
affected triangular portion is enlarged. The option most
agreeable to the owner will be chosen in consultation with the
owner [Note : the option of bypassing the land behind the
Kathiavari lodge was examined and prima facae it cannot be
done since there are many industries on the Halol side
subsequently which also need to be bypassed making the
proposal very costly;,
l        -  ;    -: -'         : provide a separate underpass (for access between the
divided portions) admeasuring approximately 3.75 m height x  -;
4m width for passage of loaded tractor;
* the possibility of changing the existing highway status to
' Other District Road",so that part of the divided land adjoining
the existing highway -can be usefully used in commercial
developments (the minimum distance rule presently forbids).
c    Kathiavari Lodge Owner: The main concem was the possible
loss of bu,siness due to construction of the expressway in case
traffic from both directions could not have access to the lodge
premises. However, it was explained to him that his business
-will not be affected because of the likely increase in the levels of
traffic, especially after tle year 2000.

The village is second largest village enroute the project road and has
population of about 2630 as per 1991 census. The main village i!
located at about 200 m north of the proposed road. The initia
impression was that the proposed expressway alignment would pas.
through the village and would result in 'more than 1000 PAPs. The
following was discussed:
a.   When it was informed that the proposed alignment will bypass
the tvillage, there was immediate acceptance of the alignment.
b.   The major issues discussed with the villagers are as follows:
--' i.    Mrs. Maniben, a widow residing in the hut with 6 other family
members, eaming livelihood through daily work, was explained
about the need to relocate the hut through project funds. The
sarpanch offered. to identify land closeby and the lady was
willing to be relocated. The options discussedl were:
compensate for the loss of hut by rebuildinc a pucca house in
the land to be identified with the assistance of the sarpanch.
providing assistance to the affected adults by way of vocational
training for better employment opportunity.
ii.   The three houses occupied by tenants: As informed by the
sarpanch, -Mr.- -Chauhan, the owner had expressed  his
willingness to co-operate -in the relocation of the houses
provided adequate-compensation is given or the reconstruction
on the adjoining portion of the unaffected landl.
'iii. - -  In-case of the defunct factory (furfural chemical products), the
issue needs to be taken up with the new factory management
(who propose to set up a new plant on the available area).
Discussion has been initiated with new owner, Mr. P.V. Munshi.
General -lanager, Gujarat Petro Synthesis Limited, based at
Vadodara. The options to be examined are:
1. Compensate for the existing structures and machinery of the
-defunct Furfural plant after due valuation.
2. While calculating cash compensation consider the said land
as an industrial land instead of agricultural land and acquire the
entire plot as the bifurcated land ic of no value for proposed
industrial development or provide an altemate plot for the new
factory (approximately 6.25 acre) in the vicinity.

-v.   Need for relocation of a group of houses adjoining the factory
boundary has been avoided by reducing the ROW at this place.
('                               Yet the comer of one house appears to be in the ROW. An
exact survey should be' done while fixing the ROW so that this
comer is not falling in the ROW. If required, the reduced ROW
may be further reduced (expected reduction 1-1.5 m).
vi.   As confirmed by the sarpanch, the temple of Bhatiji Maharaj (a
small lxl sq. m. structure, in use but in bad condition) can be
relocated outside the ROW in the adjoining ZP land.
,c.   Since the pathway is common, it is necessary to provide a
pedestrian crossing at an appropriate location or examine the
possibility of 'providing a pedestrian underpass to access both.

d.   A site visit was undertaken to mark the distance from the
centreline of the existing highway so that proposed bus-stop at
the junction of the highway and the road leading to Anandpura
falls at the edge outside the proposed expressway ROW. The
I'        L  -                   Panchmahal R&B  department can  issue  the necessary
clearance accordingly.

L:-;                              guesthouse. in -the premises of Gujarat Engineering Works,
Nurpura village (in Baska Gram Panchayat) explained that the
further construction has been stopped on receiving the notice
L                ~from R&B department considering the land acquisition for the
ROW.
L.  5 -                    fConsidering the location of different portions of the guesthouse (porch,
hall, main building)-fromAthe centreline, the owner expressed his
willingness to pull down the porch and if required, the adjoining hall
requssting that-the remaining structure be kept unharmed if possible.
The options to be considered are:
reduce the land acquisition to 22-26 m instead of 36 m; in which case '
the porch and the - hall need to be demolished, hence provide
necessary compensation for rebuilding them on the other side of the
building; or,
the possibility of relocating it completely in the existing industrial plot
sufficiently far away from the ROW (because of higher noise levels)
needs to be discussed with the owner. Accordingly the compensation
r  (after valuation) needs to be given to enable rebuilding at the new
location and should be the preferred option if acceptable to the owner.
The applicable UD Rules (for existing structures) should be verified by
R&B Department for-the case before granting the final permission.

Number of persons present for the meeting :2
Being the end of the proposed expressway, the socio-economi
aspects due to the proposed land acquisition do not affect village Halol
per-se.
a.    Mr. Jamalbhai Jalabhai Kadiwala, the owner of Hotel Valley
which is approximately 300 m from the proposed toll collectior'
booth, expressed his concem of business loss as the traffit
going from Halol towards Vadodara may not be able to access
his hotel considering that the vehicle entered onto  the-
expressway will have to travel 1-2 km distance betcre taking a.
U-tum on the expressway and getting off the expressway to the
service road to reach his hotel.                        -
i.    His hotel can provide service to about 4 bus loads of
passengers-in 1 hours. Considering that by the year-
2010, about 1370 buses are projected, even if only about
600 were to consider the option of availing the hotel
facilities (accounting for one-way travel direction only), it -
-averages to a number of about 40 buses/hour in 16 hours:
of the day when food is likely to be taken. This itself is 10.
-limes the load he can service. Hence even in the earlier-
years i.e.- after year 2000, it is unlikely that his clienteie,
,, will be reduced.
ii.   Secondly, the owner is also proposing to set up a hotel i
on survey 529, lshwarpura at Asoj which will in fact
- '- increase his business by providing sen/ice to the traffic,-
-travelling towards Vadodara from Halol.
Nevertheless ;the following -may be considered, subject to
technical design feasibility:
The access on the service road before entering the
expressway at Halol should be'provided as a two way
service road to allow the vehicles to reach the hotel from
Halol. By travelling about 300 m, and return to the toll r
'booth to proceed towards Vadodara. Hence service to
traffic in both directions will be possible.
-The owner should be permitted to advertise adequately '
-before the toll booth to draw the attention of the travellers
-and the way to reach the hotel.

Number of persons present for the meeting:14
a.   Villagers expressed their concern of losing existing houses
without adequate compensation as experienced while land was
acquired for the Narmnada canal. It was explained that land will
be acquired only-on the opposite side and hence no existing
houses will be disturbed. The acquisition will involve:
*  relocation of .3 kutcha shops, which can be done on the
same side of the village by identifying suitable land; and 
L                      *   ~~~~~~~~~~Relocation of a'small Bhatiji Maharaj temple to which the
villagers are agreeable.
b.   Concern was also expressed on loss of land as well as loss of
~income from fruit bearing trees due to acquisition of agricultural
Aand. Hence the following -should be done:
provide compensation for loss of agricultural land either
F,                          ~~~~~~~~~~by irrigated land elsewhere on, which fruit trees are
planted and also compensate for income from lost fruit

setting -up ~of _a business from the compensation due for
the acquired land.
c.   Severance~ issue related to the use of pond on the opposite side
of the road including acquisition of about 10% of the'-pond:
Villagers were quite surprised on knowing the results of the t
Li                      ~~~~~~~~survey -Conducted to -identify the present hourly number of
persons and the  uses of the pond data. They also mentioned
that there has :been a decline in pedestrian crossing safely 
under present road conditions and also due to increase in traffic.
The villagers -are also using Vishwamitri river instead of the
pond. To avoid the adverse impact, the following steps
---(discussed, and found acceptable with the villagers) should be
under taken:
U                           ~~~~~~~~~~~the pond should be deepened and widened so that the
water storage capacity is enhanced (this will ensure that
the ground water table Techarge due to the water body
will not be adversely affected);
L                      *   ~~~~~~~~~a subway be provided to access the other side of the
expressway -providing safe access to the pond and the
agricultural fields on the other side.

-1.4       -Modifications in RAP
Any project must be based on the rational choice of the people
especially those who might be adversely affected by it. Only such at
approach ensure both that displacement is minimised and the projec
really serves the public purpose. Peoples' participation in formulatinm
and selection of a project also ensures that those who are going to bE
-PAPs are not made victims but rather partners in the development.
The PIC conducted through participatory approach has led to followinc
major modifications in the RAP.
* Free toll for project land owners: All the PAPs whose land is
acquired should be permitted to free use of highway. This may be
regulated by allowing only one commerciail and one non-
commercial vehicle per affected family. After due verification of the
PAPs, the project can issue a letter to PAP to use highway without
paying toll.
-  Private lands and houses which gets isolated or cut off due to
-  :  - -!                         acquisition of land in the project, may also be acquired if the owner
gives his/her consentto such acquisition. This would apply only to
oustees who can not make economic or any other use of their non-
acquired assets, e.g. Bypass at Baska divides the defunct factory
(Furfural Chemicals Pvt. Ltd.) premises into two disjoint parts of
which the-company can not make economic use. And bypass at
Asoj village generates a triangular section of land owned by Mr.
Ashwin Sheth and his family members between existing road and
. .      . .--the proposed bypass. This triangular section ol land can not be
utilised further for economic purpose by the owner and hence
should be purchased by the project.
*  Changes in the curve Alignment: During PIIC, all altemative
leading to non-displacement were studied. Different altematives on
the basis of technical and social merits and demerits of the project
were examined and made available to public. It has led to many
t .  i:. . t    .   - .--<-   - - ,- -..changes in RAP. Firstly, land at the curve aligniment in the Asoj
bypass belonging to Mr. Ashwin Sheth has been improved in order
to minimise the loss in the utility of his land after land acquisition. At
..many places, minor curve -improvement or reduction in ROW
subject to technical feasibility and social acceptability are made.
*7 6.                               Secondly, in three project villages, need for access to the other side
of the road was strongly demanded by the villagers which led to
provision  -of underpasses in the final design. This has also
enhanced safety levels of the villagers and animals crossing the
road.

4.0        Upper WtndlUpper Air'Climatological Data
The upper. air climatological data at the nearest station to Vadodarn
recording uipper w(inds, is Ahmedabad situated at a idistance of 80 km it
the North of Vadodara. This data is presented be!low for ground anc
elevated inversion layers at 0530 (0000 GMT) and '1730 (1200 GMT) ir
Tables A3.1 - 14 and A3.1 - 15. The early morningi mixing heights are
given inTable A3.1 - 16.
Inversions, and Stable Layers Near Ground:
A stable layer could either form at the ground or at an elevation. In the
latter case, it becomes necessary to completely defirne it by its base, top
- and thickness. The base has been taken as the level at which the lapse
rate leading to stability commences, the top, where it terminates with the
difference between the two -providing the thickness. For the study ol
-frequency distribution of, stable layers, the atmcisphere within the
.boundary layer (1.5 kin) has been divided in to thirte-en layers, first ten
are at an interval of 100 m followed by two layers of 250 m each by the
Indian Meteorological Department.
Data available on stable layers (ground based and ellevated inversions).
*     ~~both for morning (00 -GMT) and afternoon (12 GMTr) data have been
compiled from.the-.data published ~by India Meteorological Department.
'Percentage frequencies of stable layers (Inversioni) both for ground
--based and elevated inversions, in respect of Ahamedabad are tabulated
~in Tables-A3.1 -14 and A3.1- 15.

Vadodara - Halol Road                           Air Quality Simulation Results
APPENDIX 4.1
AIR QUALITY SIMULATION RESULTS
While modelling computations, two typical wind cases viz., paraallel and
cross wind cases have been considered for developing wind case
scenarios. The parallel wind case assumes wind direction to be parallel
(2700) to the general road layout. The cross wind case assumes the wind
direction to be crossing (1800) the general road layout. The predicting
distances are measured from the edge of ROW (Right Of Way) which is
reportedly 24 m and 60 m for 'Do Nothing' and 'With Project' scenarios
respectively. Since the respective receptor locations (distances) changes
with respect to the project scenafios, the concentrations predicted at
these receptor locations are not comparable with each other.
The wind velocity of 1 m/s and mixing height of 90 m were considered
for modelling as a worst case.
Simulation for CO
The peak hourly (1800 hour) CO for 2000 A.D. and 2015 A.D. was
predicted for all stability classes and are presented in Figures-A4.1-1,
A4.1-3, A4.1-5, and A4.1-7 for 'With Project Scenario'. And same has
been depicted in Figures-A4.1-2, A4.1-4, A4.1-6 and A4.1-8 for 'Do
Nothing Scenario'. Two cases for wind directions, parallel wind
(Figures-4.1, 4.2, 4.5 and 4.6) and cross wind (Figures-4.3. 4.4, 4.7
and 4.8), respectively, were considered.
For the case of eight hourly (from 1600 hour to 2300 hour) CO,
predictions were done by assigning hourly stability class for both the
wind cases.
2.         Peak Hourly Simulation for NOx-
In this case also, both parallel and cross wind cases were modelled for E
and F stability classes respectively in the background of maximum
concentration being predicted only for these combination of wind cases
and stability classes than any other such combinations.

Vadodara - Halol Road                                  Landscaping Scheme
The landscaping has been suggested at the following four locations.
Figure-A6-1 depicts the scheme on the cross-section of the road.
Surface road side plantation
This includes mixed plantation of large, shady flowering and non-
flowering trees on outer side of both the service roads along the entire
road at 6 m c/c (centre to centre). With additional trees of 10% over the
estmated trees, this will result in approximately 350 trees for a length of
1 km inclusive of outer side of both service roads with considered. The
unit cost per tree has been estimated by considering the following
aspects:
a)         Excavating the pit of size 1.00 m x 1.00 m x 1.00 m deep
@ Rs.10/-;
b)         Filling of the excavated pit by farm yard manure and
garden soil in 1:2 proportion @ Rs. 120/-;
c)         Sapling as per plan @ Rs. 25/-;
d)         Plantation of sapling including provision of side supports,
watering etc., @ Rs. 25/-; and
e)         Labour charges @ Rs. 10/- .
The approximate total cost involved for 350 trees per km at the total unit
cost of Rs. 200/- per tree and with additional cost of tree guard of barbed
wire fencing @ Rs. 2,00,000/- per km comes out to be Rs. 400,000/-.
Highway side tree plantation
With smaller but moderate trees at lesser c/c distance of 5 m, it is
assumed that road cross-section will have 6 rows (3 on either side of the
carriageway) .This will give about 1600 trees/km. The cost of this
plantation at Rs. 200/- is estimated to be Rs. 32,000/- per km.
* Plantation of shrubs on slopes
This could be in the form of Bouganvellia or flowerbed or grass cover
at the rate of Rs. 60 per sq. m. For an area of 6 sq. m between two trees
of 3 m apart and with such 100 patches on both sides of the road, a
lumpsum provision of Rs. 72000/- has been made for the planatation
along the road slope.
Plantation in central median
Thick median plantation of Casurina trees at Im c/c in 4 rows is
assumed. This will result in 4000 saplings/km. The unit cost of Rs. 25/-
per tree has been estimated by cxonsidering the lesser pit size of 500 m
x 500 m x 500 m including excavation, filling of the pit with garden soil

and farm yard manure, plantation of saplings, ramping all around and
watering etc.. All casunna trees' growth should be restricted upto a
height of 2 to 3 m only.
The beak-up of the the cost estimate for implementing the scheme is
presented in Table-A6. 1-2.

2    Highway side Tree plantation               320,000
3    Plantation of shrubs on slope               72,000
4    Plantation in central median of highway    100,000
Sub-total        562,000
Add 5% contingencies         28,100
Total per km        580,100
Say per km      600,0001km
5    Maintenance (Gardens + Manures +     252,000/km-yr
I1Pesticides etc.) per year
Based on above, the number of trees is estimated to be 5950 per km for
all kinds of species considered. In order to convert this at a Hectare
basis, carriageway of 27 m has been deducted from the main service
road (as per Option 3). Hence, an area of 33 m x 1000 m (for 1 km road
stretch) becomes 3.3 ha (say 3.0 ha). This gives the density of trees as
1 984/Hectare. And cost of plantation is Rs. 200067/Hectare.

Vadodara - Hakal Road                          Social Assesment -An hiNrodueflon
Social assessment study for the project, therefore, aims at identifying
the PAPs, analyzing their socio-economic status, assessing losses
due to project implementation and propose Resettlement and
Rehabilitation plan which ensures that PAPs do not suffer economic
losses. Thus, the Detailed Feasibility Study for the project, besides
examining the technical, economical and financial feasibility of the
proposed project, aims at carrying out an environmental and social
impact assessment of the proposed project to identify the risks
involved and the mitigation measures thereof. The environmental and
social assessment study is expected to prepare a well researched and
documented environmental and social assessment report (ESAR) with
*                         due consideration to public opinion and sensitivities. The ESAR is to
be prepared according to the principles and processes contained in
the Environmental -and Social Statement of IL&FS and the World
Bank's policies (O.D. 4.30 and 4.20).
With regard to Social Assessment, the above emphasizes that the
population displaced and/or adversely affected receive benefits from
the project and that where displacement is unavoidable, the project
should assist with the means to improve the former living standards,
income generating capacities and production levels or at least
E                         maintain the previous standards of living of those displaced and
adversely affected. This requires a thorough understanding of the
social, economic and cultural conditions of the area and its people
and the factors which influence the lives of those affected. It is in this
context that a detailed socio-economic study of the project area and
its people has been undertaken by the Consultants.
7.3         Study Process
The process of social assessment involves primarily the following
steps:
1.    General Assessment: This process involves enlisting
chainagewise all the PAPs, Public structures, Trees (fruit
bearing and non-fruit bearing) belonging to the land owners
etc. and their exact distances from the central line of the
existing ROW. The outcome of this exercise gives the idea
about the chainagewise amount of the losses involved in the
project implementation and serves as the first order
approximation to the final rsk calculating exercise.
2.    Identification and Profiling of PAPs   This process is
followed by general assessment wherein Head of every
Project Affected Family (PAF) is interviewed with respect to his
socio-economic aspects thoroughly and the responses are
recorded in a detailed questionnaire especially designed for
this survey. This exercise generates a very important and
useful database for the further analysis and decision making.
3.    Development of Draft RAP: After analyzing the information
collected in the identification and profiling of PAP exercise,
draft version of Resettlement Action Plan is developed.

Vadodara - Halol Road                          Social Assessment - An Introduction
4.    Public Information and Consultations: Keeping in view the
draft version of RAP, an exercise is initiated (1) to understand
in depth the sentiments and the feelings of the people losing
their assets in the project and (2) to identify the social and
environmental issues/problems at large so that no such issue
remains unaddressed as well as to take care of the problems
as perceived by the people losing their assets due to project
implementations.
5.    Finalization of RAP: The RAP is finalized based on the draft
version of the RAP and findings of ihe PIC exercise.
6.    Identification of Institutional Arrangement : As the final
step  of  SA,  institutional  arrangements  for  efficient
implementation of RAP and monitoring of its outcome are
suggested.
7.4          Progression of the Study
The social assessment study was initiated in August 1996 and the
focus was on the general assessment, identification and profiling of
the structure PAPs. This phase of study revealed that major stretch of
the project road is linear and very few structures fall in the proposed
ROW except for the villages Jarod, Asoj in Vadodara district and
village Baska in Panchamahals district. At this stage it was suggested
by the Consultants that:
- except for the villages Jarod, Asoj and Baska, minimize the ROW,
wherever possible, in order to minimize the losses in structures
and to keep ROW sufficiently away from most of the structures;
and
- at villages Jarod , Asoj and Baska the bypasses be introduced to
ensure minimized losses of structures, to ensure increased safety
and to maintain better speed geometrics.
The suggestions were well accepted and finalized at IL&FS, New
Delhi in October 1996 in consultation with Roads and Buildings
Department (R&B) and Government of Gujarat (GoG). While technical
and environmental consultantsWere working on the design of new
bypasses, social assessment study focused on identification and
-profiling of land PAPs and the task was accomplished during
November 1996. During the same time, technical and environmental
consultants designed the bypasses. The demarcation of the central
line for the proposed three bypasses was initiated by technical
consultants along with Public Works Department (PWD) officials in
January 1997 and the task was completed by February 1997.
Followed by the demarcation exercise, social assessment was started
at these three villages with respect to identification and profiling of
structures and land owner PAPs and also to assess the social risks
involved in acquiring the land for the new alignments.
A set of PIC was conducted in March 1997 to assess the project
awareness among the villagers of the project area, to inform them
about the project design, to understand their general views, opinions,

sentiments pertaining to the project, to identify major issues and
issues in commonality and obtain consent on draft R&R measures. As
an outcome of PIC exercise, the alignment of Asoj bypass was
modified to minimize the impact due to land acquisition to the land
owners. Also a number of road crossings were added to meet the
community needs at appropriate locations.
7.5          Benefits From The Project
Although a small portion of population in the project area is affected
directly due to the property and land acquisition, a larger population in
the project area and in surrounding regions is expected to gain
significantly from the project.
As the main objective of the project is to improve the service level for
traffic, all the road users, as well as the general population and the
PAPs, will be benefited from the proposed improvement on account of
comfort, safety, reduced travel time and better economic
opportunities. The society will be benefited economically from the
saving on vehicle operating costs due to enhanced speed, better
geometrics, smooth surface, etc. The project will upgrade linkages to
national highways and open up the area for increased economic
activities.
Also during the construction phase, a significant economic benefit of
the project is the generation of employment opportunities which will be
available to the people, including the affected community. Besides,
they will also draw benefits from the economic activities as a result of
increased traffic flow and movement of vehicles. Local communities
will have greater access to the public and other transport facilities.
The most significant impact of the project is the reduction in the
number of accidents and fatalities due to enhanced safety conditions.
The subsequent chapters present an overview of the prevailing socio-
economic conditions in the project area, detail the legal frame work
and land and property acquisition, discuss the social assessment
process and PIC process. Final chapter details the RAP emerging
from the above process, including the institutional arrangement for its
implementation.

8.1         Socio-Economic Background Of The State And The Project Area
Districts
The socio-economic parameters are the major determinants of the
growth in the transport demand. These aspects have been reviewed
in the pre-feasibility study carried out for the project and identified
Vadodara - Panchmahal, the project districts, -as the regions with
potential growth in transport demand due to the rapid industrialization
of the region. In this section an overview of the socio-economic profile
of the state and project districts is presented as a background to the
Resettlement Action Plan.
Gujarat with a population of 41.3 million, ranks tenth in population and
ninth in area amongst the states of India as per 1991 census. Of the
total population 34.49% belong to urban areas and the state ranks
fourth in urban population among the states in the country. The
female to male (F/M) ratio in 1991 was 936:1000 for the state
914:1000 for Vadodara and 953:1000 for Panchmahals. The literacy
level of the state and the project districts have been increasing over a
period of time. From a meager 35% literacy rate in 1971 it has
increased to 51% in the state. The projects districts have also shown
remarkable increase in the literacy levels. The female literacy rate has
almost doubled during 1971-1991 in the state and in the project
districts.
Nearly 40.23% of the state's population was engaged in some activity
or the other and hence were called workers. The work participation of
the total population among males at 53.57% was higher than females
at 25.96%. The dependency rate is higher in urban areas (with
30.22% of urban population being workers) than in rural areas (work
participation rate being 45.51%). Of the total workers, 34.12% were
main workers (with an engagement for more than 183 days) and the
rest 6.11%   constituted  marginal workers. The  demographic
characteristics of the state and the project districts are given in Table -
8.1.

Agriculture which is a major economic activity has declined during the
last 30 years and the state has gradually been transformed from an
agriculture based economy to a major industrial force. Decline in the
proportion of workforce dependent on agriculture, stagnation in the
area under cultivation, marg.nal increase in the area under irrigation
have been the characteristic features of Gujarat. Of the total
workforce about 70% was dependent on agriculture in 1971 and this
decreased to 60% in 1991b-Area under cultivation -remained stagnant
at 47 to 48% during 1980-81 and 1990-91. Vadodara, the district, in
which large section of the proposed road passes through, has
becoming a major industrial area. In Vadodara, 57% of the workforce
engaged in primary (agriculture) sector. However, area under
cultivation and irrigation is relatively high indicating relative agriculture
richness of the region. However, district Panchmahals continue to be
agro based with more than 80% of workforce dependent on primary
activity. The district being. largely populated with tribals, low irrigation
levels, the agriculture in the district is at subsistence level. Table - 8.2
presents the agricultural indicators of the project districts.

Gujarat has become the second largest industrial state in the country
in 1990, from the initial eighth position in 1960. Gujarat accounted for
10.64% share of value of production and 10.08% share in value
addition, in the factory sector of the country. The manufacturing sector
contributes 34% of net domestic product of Gujarat in 1991. The
factory sector registered an annual compound growth rate of 4.7% in
the past three decades with employment growing around 2.6%. Table-
8.3 gives number of working factories in Gujarat and in project
districts.

Figures in brackets indicated percentage values to the total number of factories in
the state.
-The consistent efforts over the past three decades made Gujarat the
second largest industrial state. The state has been attracting large
investments. As of now, about 2,200 projects with an estimated
investment of Rs. 899.73 billion generating 420,000 jobs are under
implementation in Gujarat. Among the project districts Vadodara tops
with a share of 17% of projects, whereas Panchmahals share is 3.5%.
The socio-economic parameters of the state and the project districts
indicate that the state has achieved remarkable growth in industrial
sector. The growth in industrial sector will further increase the demand
for transport and communications sectors in future.

8.2          Socio-Economic Aspects Of The Villages In The Project Area
As stated earlier, VHRP covers two districts - Vadodara and
Panchamahal. Large section of Vadodara Halol road passes through
the district of Vadodara. Of the proposed 31.5 Kms road, 25.9 Kms
passes through Vadodara district and the remaining 5.6 Kms comes
in Panchamahal district.
8.2.1        Methodology Adopted For The Study
The methodology adopted for the study is based on the following:
*     Villages on the either side of the existing alignment have been
considered for socio-economic studies. According to 1991
census, there are 14 villages in the study area. All these villages
- -           form a part of the rural area despite being very near to the urban
area.
*     Review of secondary data was done for the above 14 villages
from 1991 and 1981 District Census, Gazetteers, Distnct
Statistical Hand-books, Urban development plans with respect
to population, occupational structure and infrastructure facilities
available in the region.
8.2.2        Review Of Socio-Economic Profile - 1991
The information on socio-economic aspects of the study area has been
compiled from secondary sources. The demographic data has mainly
been compiled from Census Handbook, 1991. The sociological aspects
of this study include human settlements, demographic and other socio-
economic aspects and infrastructural facilities available in the study
area. The economic aspects include agriculture, industry and
occupational structure of workers. The socio-economic details are
briefly described in the following sections.
Demography
a)    Settlement Pattem
As per the village bounda"rmaps depicted in 1991 Census handbooks,
there are 12 villages in Vadodara and 2 in Panchmahal districts,
therefore 14 villages in total falling within the study area. The
geographical distribution of all the settlements are given in Table - 8.4.

Focus area for Social Impact Assesment
8.3          Minimisation Of Adverse Social Impact
As a prelude to the socio-economic survey, consultants carried out a
verification' exercise of the entire corridor of impact of the project
mainly to identify any structures coming within the proposed road
widening. Most of the area within the corridor of impact was' found
under private use for housing, business and other economic activities.
The verification exercise found the following, types of assets coming
within the corridor of impact:
1. Temporary structures -(thatched roof, wooden cabins etc.):
2. Semi-permanent structures (tiled/asbestos roof houses with mud
walls),
3. Permanent structures (tiled/asbestos roof with brick I stone walls,
RCC / RBC structures etc.);
4. Other structures like boundary walls (brick / stones), fencing, etc.;
and
5. Agricultural land.
The initial alternatives were generated solely on the basis of
engineering design requirements to meet the level of service
requirements. These alternatives included strengthening the existing
carriageway going through the villages by reducing the ROW to 36 m
without compromising on the design speed. This also gave the choice
of acquiring the additional land on either left or right side 'of the
existing road.
The verification exercise identified 594 structures in 31.5 Kms road
length. These consisted of 225 structures being used for residential
*                                 purposes, 245 commercial establishments, 59 community / public
infrastructure (including 19 temples) and 65 other structures. This
would have resulted in a major relocation problem in addition to large
amounts of compensation payable to the owners of the structures. At
the same time this would have significantly disturbed the economic
living of the people. In fact, a detailed socio-economic survey was
carried out by consultants-.-mong the people living within the corridor
of impact. Group discussions were also held by its professionals with
local population in the villages mainly to gauge their feelings on the
proposed road improvement.
The consultants sensed that the resistance to the project might build
up creating problems during the construction phases of the project.
Therefore, attempts were made to minimize the problems of the
displacement by modifying the road alignment. Since 395 structures
(66.5 %) of the total structures (594) are coming in only three villages
(Jarod. Asoj and Baska), it was proposed to bypass in these villages
and accordingly the project road was realigned. The proposed lengths
of these three bypasses are 1.458 kms., 1.52 kms. and 1.16 kms.
respectively (total bypasses' length is 4.138 kms. against 4.08 kms.
for alignment passing through three villages).

Focus area for Social Impact Assessment
At another enroute village Khandewadi, the land acquisition for the
proposed ROW of 60 m width entailed demolition of.a settlement of
huts (44) adjacent to the road on the west and redamation of about
10% of the area from a pond on the east of the highway. Avoidance of
the settlement by shifting the additional land acquisition for the
proposed ROW to the east would have increased the reclamation of
the pond area to 22%. Considering the associated risks of flooding
during the monsoon, this was not considered to be desirable. The
resettlement issues at the stretch were minimized by reducing the
proposed ROW of 60 rn to 36 m, the minimum width required to
maintain the road design parameters, and acquiring the land on the
east of the existing carriageway.
The IL&FS officials in the spirit of IL&FS ESA policy and World Bank
O.D. 4.20 reviewed the results and desired to minimize the
resettlement problem. The Consultants, in consultation with IL&FS
officials and GoG officials, adopted the above measures which led to
minimization of the resettlement as under:
1. The resettlement owing to demolition of residential structures has
-*    .                                been reduced from 225 PAFs to 10 PAFs;
2. The requirement of restoration of commercial structures has been
minimized from 245 to mobile 11 units, which can be pushed
back;
3. The requirement of shifting of temples has been reduced from 19
to 7; and
_Z7                                4. The overall dislocation of other public and community structures
also has been minimized.
8.4         Right Of Way And Road Improvement
Right of Way (ROW) refers to the public land and is under the control
of Roads and Buildings Department (R&B). The existing ROW is 24
m. The proposed widenin% and road improvements require 60 m wide
strip of land at the straight sections and upto 70 m wide strip at the
curves. This additional area between the existing ROW and land
-                         required for the widened and improved road is defined as "Corridor of
Impact" and forms the basis for identification of PAPs.
8.5         Land Acquisition For Widening Of ROW
Since the exisfing ROW is 24 m and the proposed road width after
widening is 60 m, a strip of 36 m needs to be acquired all along
sections which run along the existing road. The proposed road will
however, deviate from the -existing alignment at Jarod, Asoj and
Baska villages. The bypasses to these villages will have a combined
length of 4.138 kms. The R&B and Land Acquisition (LA) department
have jointly identified the land to be acquired in both the districts
through Joint Measurement Survey (JMS). The District-wise break-up
of land required for the project is provided in Table - 8.9.

NOTE:   - Excluding Govemment land in District
*- Excluding Govemment land in Vadodara District
- At the stage of declaration under section (6) of the LA Act, the exact land
requirement may marginally change due to minor variations of ROW at the prominent
curves along the road.
Land records in both Vadodara and Panchamahal districts were last
updated in 1952. Meanwhile there have been a number of
transactions both by division of property and sales, most of which
apparently have not been entered in the records. As a result, the
lands are still recorded in the names of the old owners, some of whom
have expired.

The land records will be updated for the project area by the LA
proceedings which have been initiated with the publication of Section
4(1) notification under LA Act, 1894 and amended in 1984. The PAPs
entitled for the compensation against land acquisition will be identified
righffully only when the claims of parties having interest in the notified
lands are invited and settled uls 9 of the LA Act.
8.6          Impact On Vulnerable Sections
According  to  ESR  of IL&FS, vulnerable  sections are  tribals
(indigenous people), women, aged, orphans and disabled. Though
Panchmahals is predominantly characterized by presence of tribals,
the project road is of 5.6 kms in this district. It passes through an
industrial belt.and there are no tribal habitations in the study area.
Since the project may not result in any displacement of population,
impact on vulnerable sections and communities will be confined to
economical impacts. Further, the project being linear in nature and
spread through out the narrow corridor of impact, oniy a narrow strip
of land will be required from an individual land owner on an average.
This will not result in major landlessness in the area and thus
economic earning of those dependent on such lands including
agriculture labour also will not be affected significantly. There is
however still a need to identify vulnerable members for each PAF and
provide for mitigation measures in RAP.

Legal Framework for Land and
Property Acquisition

Vadodara-HaloI Road                   Legal Framework for Land and Property Acquisition
9.1          Land Acquisition
All land acquisition (LA) for any public purpose in the state is
governed by the Land Acquisition Act 1894 amended in 1984. It is a
Central Act and empowers the government to acquire compulsorily
any land not owned by it which is required for a public utility. Land
acquisition applies to those with legal entitlements to land and
structures thereon. In this RAP these are referred to as 'title holders'
of land and other properties there on.
In accordance with this Act:
.     Compensation for land can be awarded by granting 'land for
land'. This is granted by the Collector in particular
circumstances.
Where compensation  of privately  owned  lands, trees,
structures and other assets is paid in money, it is provided at
the  prevailing  'market value'. According  to  the  Land
Acquisition Manual, market value is the price which a willing
*                              vendor might reasonably expect to obtain from  a willing
purchaser. In addition to market value a sum equivalent to
30% of the value of compensation, known as solatium, is paid
in consideration of the compulsory nature of the acquisition.
Interest is paid on the compensation and solatium amount
from the date of notification of the land acquisition or the date
of taking possession of the land, whichever is the earliest.
If there are any disputes relating to the fixation of rates these
will be referred to the court for settlement.
If the land acquisition results in a holding to be operationally
non-viable, the  entire  holding  wilf be  acquired  and
compensated accordingly. This could include land exchanged
for land.
9.2          Procedure For Land Acquisition
For any LA, the Act under section (u/s) - 4(1) stipulates publication of
a notification to that effect in the official Gazette and in two daily
newspapers circulated in the locality of which at least one shall be in
the regional language. Such a notification enables the concerned
authorities to enter upon the land, make preliminary survey, ascertain
its suitability and determine the exact portion of the land to be
acquired. The substance of this notification is given as public notice at
a convenient place in the locality in which the land to be acquired is
located. Such a notification provides an opportunity to the parties
interested in the land to file objections if any, u1s-5A to the proposed
acquisition.
In order to proceed with the acquisition of the notified land or any
portion of it, a declaration u/s-6 of the Act specifies the precise
boundaries of the area of the land to be taken. Every declaration is
published in the official Gazette and in two daily newspapers with

circulation in the local area. With the appearance of the notification
u/s-6 of the Act in the Gazette, Government in Revenue Department.-
issues direction to the Collector u/s - 7 of the Act to take order for the
acquisition of notified land and/or other immovable properties.
Thereafter, Section-8 of the Act requires land to be marked out,
measured and planned, while u/s-9 notices are served -to the
concemed persons stating the intention of the Govemment to take
possession of the land and that any claims for compensation should
be made to the Collector. Finally, the award of compensation is made
by the Collector u/s-11 of the Act after inquiring into objections (if any)
in pursuant to the notice given u/s-9, to the measurements made u s-
8 and into the value of the land on the date of publication of the
notification u/s 4(1). The award u/s - 11 is made within two years from
the date of publication of the declaration and if no award is made
within this period, the entire proceedings of the LA is lapsed and fresh
notification u/s 4(1) needs to be initiated. Once the award is passed,
the Collector takes possession of the land, which there upon vests
absolutely in the Govemment free from all encumbrances. However.
in case of urgency Section-17 of the Act empowers the Collector to
take possession of the land even though no award has been mace.
Such land thereupon vests with the Govemment free from all
encumbrances.
9.3          R&R Policy
R&R policy for the project has been formulated in accordance with the
World Bank Guidelines on Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30) and
Environment and Social Assessment policy of the IL&FS. The VHRP
policy takes into consideration those coming within the 'corridor of
negative impact' of the project. Essentially they are in two broad
categories.
*     those with private ownership of land and other immovable
assets; and
encroachers on govemment land and squatters within the
corridor of impact.
Definition Of A PAP      All persons affected by the VHRP
implementation through acquisition of land and other properties or
removal of squatters and eviction of encroachers from the 'corridor
of impact' or indirectly by the loss of any economic opportunities due
to the project is considered as a Project Affected Person (PAP). And
a PAP displaced as a result of acquisition or removal of structures
from the 'corridor of impact' is considered as a displaced person or
displaced business depending upon the purpose for which the
structure is being used.
Cut Off Date      The cut-off date for the PAPs losing their
privately owned land and structures outside the public land (ROW) for
the project will be date of the notification u/s 4(1) of LA Act. In case of
persons losing access to land and other structures within the ROW,
the cut off date for their eligibility for R&R assistance is the date of the

socio - economic survey in the area and for VHRP this cut off date is
October 1996.
Entitlements          The main objective of deriving the entitlement
through compensation and assistance to be given to the PAPs during
R&R is to ensure that their standards of living is at least restored to
the pre-project level and preferably improved above the levels they
enjoyed before the implementation of the project. In the absence of
any legal regulatory framework to govern such entitlements
associated with resettlement and rehabilitation projects, IL&FS has
adopted its own standards for entitlement framework as furnished
below in Table - 9.1.

Environmental and Social Assessment Report                      Chapter-10
Vadodara-Halol Road                   Socio-economic Protfle of the PAPs and Draft RAP
10.1         Coverage Of Socio-Economic Profile Survey Of PAPs
The objective of conducting a socio-economic survey of the PAPs was
to ascertain their pre-project socio-economic status:
*  to ensure that the entitlement for each PAP is in line with the R&R
policy; and
*  to provide the baseline economical status for post-project
monitoring of the implementation of the R&R measures.
The decision to minimize the R&R issues through project design
modification, as discussed earlier in section 8.3, significantly reduced
the extent of coverage required in the socio-economic survey for
PAPs loosing commercial structures due to acquisition of land for the
project. The generation of such profiles was undertaken by
categorizing the PAPs as under:
(1) Land holders;
(2) Tenants working on agricultural lands; and
(3) PAPs loosing residential/commercial structures but not falling
under categories (1) or (2) above.
Since the maximum impact of LA is on PAPs loosing land to the
project (492 plots), it was felt necessary to focus on their socio-
economic profile in detail through household surveys of the PAFs.
However, due to the difficulties experienced in identifying the land
owners, as the land records were not updated, the survey was
undertaken for those 50 PAFs (owning 66 plots) who could be
correctly identified as the land owners. This needs to be followed up
by survey of each PAF subsequently when the correct status of the
land ownership is established.
In the case of tenants working on agricultural lands, these people
manage the lands on a sea:-onal (or longer) basis. The period of
observation was in non-cropping season and therefore the tenants
were not available at the agricultural fields. As their place of residence
and location of the agricultural-Wands is often different and they were
engaged in other occupation during the non-cropping period, the
tenants could not be contacted. At this stage, by extensive inquiries
with villagers, a partial list of land tenants which could be compiled is
given in Annexure IV.
In case of 10 PAPs loosing residential structures, their socio-economic
profiling has been done as presented in Annexure V-A.
A complete profiling of all the remaining commercial and public
3104                            structure damage/loss related 71 PAPs has been presented in
Annexure V-B. They fall in the following categories:
* movable shops (11 nos.);
*  damage to fencing and compound wall;

presented in the form of a draft RAP at the end this chapter.
10.2        Socio-Economic Survey Findings For Land And Residential

The following section presents an analysis of the household survey
.*                         conducted for the 60 PAFs loosing land and residential structures.
These are presented for:
*  overall socio-economic profile; and
* individual PAF details required for development of the entitlement
package.
10.2.1      Overall Socio-Economic Profile
Democraohv
The total population constituted by 60 adversely affected families of
VHRP is 335 which gives an average family size of 5.5. The
female/male ratio works out to be 925/1000. As can be seen from the
following information, population in the age group of 4-18 years,
representing those going to school for education, constitutes 22.6%
while that in the age-group 18-60 years, which forms the workforce,
accounts for 59%. In India and it is also true for the project area, the
people in the periphery of workforce i.e. those in the age-groups of 5-
18 years and 60+ group particularly among weaker sections also offer
their labour to supplement household income.

Literacy
A little less than two-thirds of the PAPs, are literate which is higher
than the state's average (51%) reported during the 1991 census. One
of the reasons for the present higher literacv rate in the area is the
concerted govemment efforts to promote education among the
illiterate masses under the programmes of National Literacy Mission
which includes non-formal adult literacy, universalization of primary
education, increase in the number of resideitial schools, supply of
free text books etc. However, the disparir; in the literacy rates
between males and females continues with more than 82% males
being literate as compared to 62% among females. Not only the
literacy rate among females is low, even the level of education
attained by them is low. The variations in the educational level among
- the PAPs can be seen from the analyzed data oresented below:

Workinc PoDulation
It has already been observed that around 59- of the population falls
under the age-group 18-60 years which generally is considered as the
working age group. As against this, we find that only 37.3% population
is engaged in some economic activity. Considering the semi-urban
nature of the life in the project area and limited farm based activities,
employment opportunities to the females are reported to be less. As a
result, while 60.3% of males are found pursuing some activity or the
other for economic gains, the same is as low 9.3% among females.
Since agriculture in the area is predominantly rainfed, the returns from
the farm do not ensure the sustenance of the family specially for
those land owners who have holdings below or about minimum
economic land holdings (MEL). As a result, these families also seek
other avenues to supplement their household income. Even the

women, majority of whom generally stay at home to look after the
daily household chores, supplement the household income through
labour.
Occupational Pattem
Agriculture emerges as the most important source of livelihood of the
PAPs as can be seen from the following table:
Table - 10.3
Percentage Distribution of PAFs by Occupation
Occupation .       Distribution in Percentage
Total
Cultivation                      84.1
Farm-workers                      3.6
Service                           9.9
Business                          1.5
Others                            0.9
Total                    100.0
It is noticed that around 84% of the workers are reported pursuing
cultivation followed by about 10%  workers engaged in service.
Proportion of workers engaged in farm wage earning is relatively less
which is understandable from the fact that almost all the PAPs are
land owners and thereby prefer to work on their own farm under
economic compulsions force them to go for wage earning. Female
workers in agriculture mainly provide help to.their male members in
carrying out farm operations.
Agriculture In The Area
The LA for VHRP will affect land holders. Hardly 8% of the land
owned by people in the area is irrigated mainly through wells. As a
result only one crop is taken up. The major crops in the area are
Jowar, Cotton and Paddy in-the monsoon. Pulses are grown where
soils have better moisture retention capacity. Cultivation is practiced in
the area with improved agronomic practices. In fact cotton, a
commercial crop in the area helps in increased farm eamings.
10.2.2      Key Findings For Land Related PAFs
Annexure lil details the status of each PAF before and after LA. The
analysis of the data was done to determine the following:
*  Does LA lead to substantial loss of land?
*  How does the LA affect the PAPs before and after LA and does
any PAP become severely affected due to LA?

* Are there any vulnerable PAPs in the project who need special
attention in the R&R?
*  What is the dependence of the PAPs on agricultural income?
The key findings are discussed below.
Land Holdings
An analysis of the land pre-project and post-LA land holding in a social
assessment is of utmost importance as it helps to assess the degree
of sensitiveness involved with the land acquisition in the road project.
The land holdings can be classified into three categories viz.:
Category 1: Upto the MEL;
-Category 2: Between MEL and twice the MEL; and
Category 3: Above the MEL.
The analysis of the shifts in the land holding pattern from pre-project
option to the post project conditions will determine the degree of
impact on the land owners due to LA for the project.
This analysis, for the irrigated and unirrigated lands is given
separately.
a) Irrigated lands: The MEL for irrigated land in the project district is
0.70 ha. The analysis of land holdings before and after project yields

It is very clear from the above table that, for the irrigated lands, land
acquisition will not result in any change in the PAP's existing land
holding category. Also all of them are above the MEL. The degree of
impact to these PAPs on account of LA only is very marginal and
requires little special attention during R&R.
b) Unirrigated Lands: The MEL for unirrigated land in the project
district is 1.40 ha. The analysis of land holding before and after project
yields the following table.

The table shows that in case of unirrigated land holdings, PAP in the
category 2 is not affected due to the land holdina pattern after LA.
However, from the 35 PAPs in category 3 before the project, while
85% (30 PAPs) retain the same land holding pattern in the post
project scenario, 11% (4 PAPs) shift to a lower category 2 and 4% (1
PAP) move to the category 1. Those who shift from category 3 to 1
are severely affected PAPs due to LA and need special attention in
the R&R process for restoring their pre-project income levels. Land
holders shifting from category 3 to 2 are moderately affected PAPs
due to LA who need to be given compensation for the acquired land
holding and some loans, in addition, to bring them back to their pre-
project income levels. Again there are no PAPs who have a pre-
project holding below MEL.
Sources of Income
During the socio-economic study it was found that land PAPs have
reported their agricultural income on the lower side. Any analysis
based on the agricuitural income will not allow any meaningful
conclusions. The non-agricultural income appeared to have been
reported more correctly, hence was used in the analysis to determine
the extent and dependability of other sources of income. The analysis
of non-agricultural income revealed that  out of 47 PAFs who
responded to the income related queries
* 45% of the PAFs reported to have no other source of income
therefore indicating major dependence on agricultural income;
- 38% of the-PAFs have income which falls above the poverty line
(inspite of questionable response to agricultural income status)
indicating sufficient livelihood avenues; and
* remaining 17% of the families appear to have income below the
line of poverty, but in reality, need to be verified as the agricultural
income may not be correctly reported.
Vulnerable PAPs
According to ESA policy of IL&FS, vulnerable sections are tribals
(indigenous people), women, aged, orphans and disabled. Four
widows were identified, who were also responsible for earning the
livelihood for their respective families. The details of the vulnerable
PAPs are available in the Annexure IlIl (see: SI. No. 9, 12, 13 in

arriving their R&R package.
There are evidently no trbals settlements in the project area and
hence the displacement of tribals will not occur.
10.2.3      Principles For Identifying Land Loss Related Entitlement
The following principles will be followed while arriving at the
entitlements for three categories of PAPs mentioned below:
Cateaory 1: PAPs loosing land which results in their balance land
after LA being above MEL:
Cash compensation will be provided at market value which allows the
PAP to purchase laad elsewhere or invest the compensation in fixed
deposits to earn a relular income.
Categorv 2:  PAPs having land above MEL before LA but below MEL
after LA:
In such cases, additional land adjacent to the current land will be
procured, if available, so as to leave him with a MEL after the project.
The balance land (difference between his original land holding and
MEL provided) will be compensated by cash. In case procurement of
additional adjacent lands to bring the post LA land holding of the
PAP up to MEL is not possible, the PAP will be provided alternate
contiguous land equal to the MEL elsewhere. Under such
circumstances, the entire land holding of the PAP will be acquired by
the project. The PAP will also receive cash compensation for the
balance lands as described above.
Cateqorv 3: PAPs having land below MEL and part of it needs to be
acquired:
All his land will be procured and he will be provided contiguous land,
equal to the MEL, elsewhere, i.e. land for land option will be the first
priority. In addition rehabilitation measures will be identified and
implemented to ensure that the post LA income level for such PAFs
remain above a threshold income level necessary for sustainance.
The minimum income level of Rs. 22,400 equivalent to two times the
poverty line (currently defined Rs. 11200 per year at 1991 prices) is
considered as the threshold level for VHRP.
General Considerations for Raising Post-LA Income to Pre-LA Income
Level:
- In case of all three categories above, if the post-LA income level
(including the accrued interest eamings from investment of the cash
compensation as well as other sources of income) tails below the pre-
LA income level, the options to increase the post-LA income to pre-
LA  levels are considered as obligatory while developing the
entitlement package for the PAF. The additional income generation
schemes will be identified and implemented through financial aid
and/or loan. The financial assistance necessary to raise the post-LA
income level to the threshold level, if applicable, (if it is below the
threshold level) will be offered as a grant and the remaining amount
necessary to further increase the income to the pre-LA levels will be
provided as a loan. The vocational training needs to make optimum

use of grant/loan to start a business will be identified and provided for
the project with the help of a NGO in consultation with the PAP.
Other Guidina Considerations:
Outlined below are the general guidelines which will be followed while
identifying the individual PAP entitlement.
* Land for land option will be the first priority in the case of those
PAPs whose only livelihood means is cultivation and their land
holding after LA is below MEL.
*  The extent of compensatory land to be provided (as detailed in
categories - 1 through 3) will be applicable to the family as a larger
unit. The land title rights will be non-alienable and in the case of
married persons be held jointly by the husband and wife. However,
while deciding the entitlement for assistance towards income
generating schemes, each major son will be considered as a
separate family unit.
- Management of LA Compensation Funds: The compensation
amount will be deposited in long term deposits in the name of the
PAP and they will be paid accrued interest which will add up to the
other sources of income so that it is equivalent to their pre-project
income. In no case will the compensation be paid directly and in
cash.. The management of this fund shall be supervised by the
NGO. Persons who produce a viable plan of building productive
assets, subject to the approval of the NGO, may be released the
money as per requirement.
10.3        Tenants Working on Agricultural Lands
Land tenants are given land by the land owners on lease for a
season/year or even for a longer period to utilise this land for
cultivation. This forms their means of livelihood. With land acquisition
proposed under the project, not only the land owners but also land
tenants are affected.
As discussed in section 10.1, the land tenants are only partially
identified. The changing nature of association of the land tenants with
the land owners needs to be recognized because:
*  natural justice should be given to those land tenants who have
been cultivating the lands for a long period and are left with no
other source of income due to LA;
* there can be a genuine change of a land tenant, due to which a
land tenant identified at one point in time (say a cut-off date
corresponding to the notification under section 4) for R&R and the
land tenant at the time of physical LA (not known/identified earlier)
are different, then a fair criteria needs to be evolved to decide
eligibility for R&R; and

__           Vadodara-HaAol Road                  Soco-economic Profile of the PAPs and Draft RAP
* land owners may also pose a land tenant for additional benefits
which is not in keeping with the spirit of R&R.
Hence the exercise of correctly and completely identifying eligible land
tenants needs to be undertaken through NGO by an in-depth
investigation for deciding the eligibility and entitlement. Certain norms
for deciding eligibility and guidelines for formulating the entitlement
package for land tenants is presented below:
A) Land tenants' information needs to be collected by the NGO by
closely interacting with the villagers, requesting tenants to contact
the NGO through public meetings/notices, paying visits to the
actual land (to be acquired) site and meeting land owners.
Information about the date of the land tenant lease must be
collected and cross-checked.
B) The cut-off date be treated as the date of notification of LA under
section 4(1) i.e. October 1996. Only those land tenants, who
maintain this status since the cut-off date till the date of LA, will be
considered eligible for entitlement. All other cases - such as a
person being a land tenant on the cut-off date but who has found
a substitute occupation, or a new land tenant after the cut-off date
- will not be considered eligible for entitlement.
C) Conduct socio-economic survey of the eligible tenants identffied
and based on their income levels and land available for cultivation
as tenants, they should be categorised in to the following.
a) Marginally affected: Those tenants who are left with more
than MEL to cultivate or have other sources of income so that
they are above the threshold income level can be put in to this
category. As post-LA income is likely to be below pre-LA level,
financial assistance necessary to increase the income to the pre-
LA levels will be provided as a loan. The vocational training needs
to make optimum use of loan to start a business will be identified
and provided for by the project with the help of a NGO in
consultation with the PAP.
b) Moderately affected: Those tenants who have less than MEL
left for cultivation and cannot sustain themselves due to loss in
income from cultivation but have non-agricultural skills and
eamings, can be put in to this category. Financial assistance, as
a grant, to improve the income level above the threshold level and
rest as loan to restore the present income levels will be provided.
The vocational training needs to make optimum use of grant/loan
to start a business will be identified and provided for by the project
with the help of a NGO in consultation with the PAP.
c) Severely affected: Those tenants who are fully dependent on
cultivation and have less than MEL left for cultivation, due to
which they will fall below the threshold level due to LA, can be put
into this category. Preferably MEL equivalent cultivable land area
be provided. Else, financial assistance as a grant to improve
income level above threshold level will be provided.

10.4        PAPs Loosing ResidentialVCommercial Structures
The cases of people/community loosing structures can be categorised
into:
* residential houses (10 PAPs)
*  movable business structures (11 PAPs)
* public structures (7 temples, 3 bus stops and 4 wells)
*  compound walls, fences
* defunct factory
A) The entitlements for the loss of residential houses (10 PAPs) will
be based on following considerations:
*  Firstly, the status of ownership of the land and house will be
established.
. In case of the 1 PAP in Panchdevia, 2 in Khandewadi and 4 in
Baska who own the land and house, altemate land of equal
area will be preferably identified nearby from available
government land for constructing the house. The PAPs will be
given a shifting allowance and rent (during the period of
displacement) for staying  in  a  rented  house  if the
reconstruction of new house is not completed before the
shifting. The construction of the new house (tiled roof) which
is equal to or beKter than the earlier house, will be done
through the project, or if desired by the PAPs, they can
construct the house by contributory labour themselves for
which they will be paid wages. Further, if desired, the PAPs
may contribute additionally for material cost for a larger or
better house. The NGO will closely work to help them
reconstruct their structures.
* There are only 2 tenants in Asoj and 1 squatter in Khandewadi
who will be displaced. Considering that the socio-economic
condition of all is below the threshold level, they may be
provided altemate house (through the project) of minimum
floor area of 32.5 sq.m. (350 sq.ft.) on nearby government
land with a shiftingailowance. The NGO will closely work to
help them reconstruct their structures. The owner of the land
will be compensated for the loss of land and structure.
* For all'the PAPs whose pre-project income is below threshold
income, they will be given assistance for increasing their
income upto the threshold limit by the general guidelines
discussed earlier in section 10.2.3.
B) The entitlements for the relocating movable structures (11 PAPs)
will be based on following considerabons:
* The movable structures comprise tea stalls/pan shops on
wheelcarts or temporary structures standing on wooden stilts

which can be lifted, hence relocating them without the need to
demolish them is possible.
They can be suitably moved to the edge of the proposed road
within the ROW and a shifting allowance will be paid to them.

reconstruction at suitable sites identified in consultation with the
villagers and Gram Panchayat.
D) The PAPs, whose compound walls and fences will be damaged
due to land acquisition, will be paid compensation for
reconstruction of the same.

11.0         Public Information And Consultation
:                     11.1        Introduction
The quantitative aspect of social assessment process is not enough
to ensure a responsive R.A.P. This is mainly because of the fact that
this exercise addresses an individual at a time during the study and
not a group of individuals or a community. Therefore, to arrive at
meaningful conclusions, a qualitative social assessment has to be
exercised wherein group of representative individuals come together
and express their opinions about the project. Keeping this view in
mind, Public Information and Consultations (PIC) exercise was
conducted with following aim:
* to understand in depth the sentiments and feelings of the people
losing their assets in the project;
* to identify the social and environmental issues/problem at large so
that no such issue remains unaddressed; and
*  to resolve satisfactorily problems as perceived by the people
losing their assets due to project implementation.
As a fruifful outcome of this exercise, misconceptions about the
project implementation where removed, number of underpasses,
possible solutions (including constraints) addressing the social
concems were discussed/evaluated consensus was developed about
the alignment especially the by passes so that land structure loss
would not reduce the utility of the balance unacquired land (as in case
of Asoj bypass) and a number of road crossings (underpasses or at
grade crossings) were introduced to limit the severance especially in
the case of cart tracks or pathways.
11.2        PIC Process
Since the proposed project is linear in nature and very few structures
come in the proposed ROW except for the villages Jarod, Asoj and
Baska, it was decided to conduct PIC in
*  two villages which are densely populated viz. Bhaniyara and Halol;
*  three villages Jarod, AsoT& Baska, where bypasses are proposed;
and
* Khandewadi village located adjacent to the existing highway and a
unique feature of loss of pond area was to occur due to the
proposed alignment.
The major issues were anticipated in these six villages for obvious
reasons. In each of these villages a group of farmers, land owners,
businessmen, agricultural labourers, village Tahsildar, Gram
Panchayat officials, women and teachers were selected to cover
socio-economic cross-section of the village. Enough care was taken
also to include some of the PAPs of the project in each group. The
group was also selected well in advance and the time schedule of PIC
was informed to them three days prior to conducting PIC in the
respective village. A pamphlet in Gujarati language (local language)

Finalisation of R&R Action Plan
was carefully prepared detailing major aspects and concems of this -
project from social and environmental view. The pamphlets were
distributed to the group members ten minutes before the PIC.
Each PIC was initiated by detailing of the project needs and its
justification by giving village specific observations made throughout
this study to the group. These observations were mainly pertaining to
traffic projections, reduced safety and environmental aspects in the
absence and presence of the project, environmental resources such
as pond etc. This was followed by the description about the social &
environmental  mitigation  process  planned  in  the  project
implementation. Also the larger economic prospects were highlighted
in these intersections. This established an important linkage between
the group and the consultants through an informal and friendly
atmosphere creation which allowed the group members to freely
discuss their concems.
All the members of the group were invited to express themselves in
various capacities. The opinions of the group members were
extremely useful for the development of a consensus for the
alignment as a whole after classifying and analyzing each and every
group member's opinion. Various alternatives for mitigation measures
on general environmental & social issues were also worked out.
Also on an individual basis wherever possible alignment of road was
given a thought for all possible modifications.
A number of PAP-specific mitigation measures were evolved,
discussed, evaluated and documented on the spot. Major social and
land acquisition related issues were discussed at an individual basis
and perceived need based solutions were suggested.
Thus the PIC process resulted in a general understanding of the
project needs and constraints and gave confidence to the group that
they were important partners in the development process. A win-win
situation wherever feasible was evolved which is intended to serve as
a guideline while developing the RAP.
11.3         Public Information And Consultation - Findings And Follow-Up
Meetings at Bhaniyara, Jarod and Asoj (on 26th March 1997) and
Khandewadi, Baska and Halol (on 27th March 1997) were held during
the PIC. The village-wise issues discussed are summarised below:

The village is fourth largest village enroute the project road and has a
population of about 2000. The main village is located at about 200 m
north of the road. The majority of agricultural lands belonging to the
village, however, lie south of the project road requiring frequent road
crossings by the villagers. The villagers were most concerned about
the land and property acquisition. Second to property issues were the
concerns about the severance of village from the agricultural lands.
During the discussions the villagers emphasised on the following:
a.    Transparency in the land acquisition policy and concern for
adequate compensation for land and property
b.    Need to provide three crossings on the expressway to facilitate
'-'9                                    continued use of the present modes/places of road crossing:
at the beginning (near the bridge), middle (near the curve) and
the end (100 m before the petrol pump).
c.    The possibility of providing employment in addition to the
compensation given for land acquisition was requested.
d.    Clarifications- were requested on the policy of toll collection
from the users residing in the on-route villages or those who
have land in these villages but stay in Vadodara.
e.    A follow-up meeting was requested to discuss the above
issues
During the PIC, the villagers were told that a humane and just
entitlement package, including rehabilitation measures where
necessary, will be worked out for each project affected person (PAP)
through a participatory process with adequate representation of PAPs
and community representatives. Villagers were told that the project as
such did not have much--scope for direct employment. The
rehabilitation measures, however, will be developed through
professional advise and will be compatible with the skills and market
conditions in the project area. One road crossing at the village is
considered essential and the consultants have been asked to propose
a cost effective solution

The village is largest village enroute the project road and has a
population of. The villagers were aware about the project and
proposed bypass. The main concern was the possible loss of
business due to construction of the project road bypassing the village
resulting in diversion of traffic away from the village. At the beginning
of the meeting while expressing their concerns, villagers expressed
preference for maintaining the present alignment and not to bypass
the village. Villagers also expressed strong opposition to the bypass
due to the loss of agricultural property and a housing scheme in the    i
advanced stage of planning
Some village representatives, -however, brought out the fact that
village economy had considerable dependence on transport business
arising due to locally owned transport vehicles which required parking
and repair/maintenance facilities. They expressed a concem that if the
road passed through the village, the transport business will suffer as
there will not be any space left along the road for parking the vehicles
The village community, thus, was clearly divided into two groups -
general business persons and people losing land due to bypass
favoured retention of present alignment; whereas persons related to
transport business favoured the bypass. Alternate alignments for
bypass to minimise loss of land and property were also suggested
During the PIC, the first objective, therefore, was to evolve a
consensus on road alignment. The findings on negative environmental
and social impacts of retaining the existing alignments for the widened
road in terms of increased noise and air pollution, difficulties in road
crossing and loss of a large number of structures were explained. It
was also explained that the traffic volumes on the project road were
likely to increase many folds in future years and the number of
vehicles halting (passenger traffic, local truckers and locally generated
traffic) at the village were not expected to reduce from the present    4
lever. It was also told to the community representatives that adequate
entitlement package addressing losses and needs of individual PAPs
will developed through a participatory. process. The consultations
helped in reducing the concern for loss of business and property and
helped in reaching a consensus in favour of the bypass.
After achieving the consensus on bypass requirement and alignment
(technical requirements for achieving the design speeds were
explained) the issues related to land and property acquisition along
the proposed bypass were discussed. The concems of all present
landowners were individually discussed and mutually acceptable
course of action arrved at. The outcomes with reference to the
location specific plots are presented below

M.P. Hiah School: The bypass commences just near the
school. As a result, a part of school playground needs to be
acquired for extending the ROW along present alignment and
also a part along the bypass. As the significant area from the
school property will be lost for the proposed project,
consultants will examine the possibility of minimizing the land
acquisition by reducing the ROW to 45 m (from 60 m).
ii.    Survey no. 707: Proposed Janata Co-operative Housing
Society (Mr. Adambhai Gafoorbhai Vora) - The entire land
holding has been - given the permission for property
development as Non-Agricultural (NA) land. The housing
scheme has been approved by the Taluka Development
Officer. Although some other permissions required for property
development are still required, the permissions would have
been granted by the relevant authorities if the bypass was not
planned. The bypass, therefore, result in considerable loss of
business to PAP. The options discussed to minimize the
perceived loss were:

The village is the fourth largest village enroute the project road and
has a population of about 1818 as per 1991 census. The prominent
village is located at about 600m south of the proposed bypass. The
main concem of the villagers was transparency in the compensation
policy. The villagers expressed their opinion about land compensation
by suggesting that equivalent amount of land in nearby be provided
ensuring that an alternative source of income was available to all
those who will fully dependent on his/her limited agriculture land.
During the PIC, villagers realised the need for an underpass for the
villagers and tiactors and such other vehicles to enhance their safety.
The details of the discussions are presented below:

. Flnallsetlon of R&R Action Plan
a.    Clarifications   on   the   compensation   policy   for
proposed/approved   development  housing  /commercial
schemes on NA land were asked. A uniform request by all
participants for relaxing the distance limit for development
(under Urban Development Rules, 45 m for residential
development and 75 m for industrial development from the
centreline of the highway) along the existing highway
Considering that after the proposed bypass at Asoj village, the
status of the existing highway may be changed from "State
Highway' to 'other- District Road", the change in the
development rules may be [possible. This matter can be taken
up with the R&B authorities by IL&FS. This matter is also
important considering that otherwise a large area will be
-     between the existing highway and the proposed expressway
and the minimum distance rule will permit very limited
development in the sandwiched area
b.    Land acquisition related specific concerns were discussed with
some of the individual affected persons present. This is given
below with reference to the location specific plots
VI    Survev no. 263/247- Mr. Ghanashyambhai Patel The person
has 1.71 acre land
*     equivalent land is provided elsewhere ; or
*     land compensation is given for the acquired portion and
assistance is provided for development of business to
ensure employment (altemative source of income)
ii    Survey no. 231 (0.375 acres) and 232 (2.5 acres) - Mr.
Bhikhabai Patel: The option discussed to minimize the
agricultural land loss was to provide compensation through
private negotiation at market value
iii    Survey nos. 223 - Mr. Ranchodbhai K. Patel: The land is
partly used by Air Command. Apart.from the present land
which will be acquired partly, the owner has 14 acres land
elsewhere. The options discussed to minimize the land loss
were:
* the remaining land between the two highways also be
procured as it serves little utility in future development
(planned to construct a colony on the land and NA
obtained)
* compensation should be provided for the NA land including
the foundation (for which valuation needs to be done)
* first preference be given for employment on toll booth and
*                                        also life long free toll facility be made available

iv    Survev No. 485.489.480.500.479/1. 233 and 486 - Mr.
Ashwinbhai Sheth (total land to be acquired 1.36 Ha.): The
land belongs to a joint family having substantial land
admeasuring 65 acres and is presently used for agricultural
purposes to provide a source of income. The proposed
alignment divides the land into two unequal parts limiting its
utility, especially the triangular portion between the existing
highway and proposed expressway. The options for
compensating the land discussed were:
* review the geometrics of the proposed alignment and
identify a possible'altematives for straightening the curves
on the alignment and reducing the ROW to 45 m, so that
the affected triangular portion is enlarged. The option most
agreeable to the owner will be chosen in consultation with
the owner [Note: the option of bypassing the land behind
the Kathiavari lodge was examined and prima facae it
cannot be done since there are many industries on the
Halol side subsequently which also need to be bypassed   7
making the proposal very costly];
3  provide a separate underpass (for access between the
divided portions) admeasuring approximately 3.75 m height
x 4m width for passage of loaded tractor;
- the possibility of changing the existing highway status to
"TOther District Road' after the proposed expressway should
be pursued as mentioned earlier so that part of the divided
land adjoining the existing highway can be usefully used in
commercial (which the minimum distance rule presently
forbids)
c     Kathiavari Lodae Owner: The main concem was the possible
loss of business due to construction of the expressway in case
traffic from both directions could not have access to the lodge
premises. However, it was explained to him that his business
will not be affected because of the likely increase in the levels
of traffic, especially after the year 2000
Nevertheless the following may be considered, subject to technical
-design feasibility:   _
*. The access on the service road from both directions be kept as
close to Asoj village as possible with inter-connection between the
service roads (underpass at Asoj). This will allow the vehicles to
reach the lodge, hence service to traffic in both directions will be
possible
* The owner should be permitted to advertise adequately before the
toll booth to draw the attention of the travellers about the
availability of hotel services before enterng the expressway and
the way to reach the hotel

Venue: Hotel Sarvottam
Number of persons present for the meeting: 4
The village is second largest village enroute the project road and has
a population of about 2630 as per 1991 census. The main village is
located at about 200 m north of the proposed road. The initial
impression was that the proposed expressway alignment was along
the existing passing through the village and will result in more than
1000 people being affected by the project. The following was
discussed:
a.    When it was informed that the proposed alignment will bypass
the village, there was immediate acceptance of the alignment.
b.    The sarpanch was informed that 3 houses and hotel structure
(toilets) on the backside, a hut, a small temple and a defunct
factory will be falling in the ROW passing throughWBaska and
needs relocation. The detailed issues that were discussed with
the villagers are as follows:
i.    Mrs. Maniben, a widow residing in the hut with 6 other family
members, eaming livelihood through daily work, was explained
about the need to relocate the hut through project funds. The
sarpanch offered to identify land closeby and the lady was
willing to be relocated. The options discussed were:
compensate for the loss of hut by rebuilding a pucca house in
the land to be identified with the assistance of the sarpanch
providing assistance to the affected adults by way of
vocational training for better employment opportunity.
ii.    The three houses occupied by tenants belonged to Mr.
Chauhan, PSI at Vadodara. We were informed by the
sarpanch that the owner had expressed his willingness to co-
operate in the relocation of the houses. Given adequate
compensation, we also were informed that owner was willing
to have the reconstruction on the adjoining portion of the
unaffected land.
iii.   In case of the hotel (Mr. lsmailbhai, absent), there is sufficient
space at the back  to relocate the toilets after due
compensation is given. Secondly, the loss of land available for
parking also needs only monetary compensation coupled with
by the use of available extra space on the plot for parking or
by compensating the land by acquiring land from the adjoining
plot (if available).
iv.   In case of the defunct factory (furfural chemical products) , the
issue needs to be taken up with the new factory management
(who propose to set up a new plant on the available area).
Discussion has been initiated with new owner, Mr. P.V.
Munshi, General Manager, Gujarat Petro Synthesis Umited,
based at Vadodara. The options to be examined are:

1. Compensate for the existing structures and machinery of
the defunct Furfural plant after due valuation
2. While calculating cash compensation consider the said land
as industrial land instead of agricultural land and acquire the
entire plot as the bifurcated land is of no value for proposed
industrial development or provide an altemate plot for the new
factory (approximately 6.25 acre) in the vicinity,
v.    There are a group of houses adjoining the factory boundary.
Need for relocation of these houses has been avoided by    ;
reducing the ROW at this place. Yet the comer of one house
appears to be in the ROW. An exact survey should be done
while fixing the ROW so that this comer is not falling in the
ROW. If required, the reduced ROW may be further reduced
(expected reduction 1-1.5 m).
vi.   The temple of Bhatiji Maharaj (a small lxl sq. m. structure, in
use but in bad condition) can be relocated outside the ROW in
the adjoining ZP land. This was confirmed by the sarpanch.
c.    The sarpanch informed that a pathway needs to be provided to
access both, the cemetery and Kota Mela village falling on the
other side of the proposed expressway. Since the pathway is
common, it is necessary to provide a pedestrian crossing at an
appropriate location or examine the possibility of providing a
pedestrian underpass.
d.    The sarpanch, who also administers Anandpura village
informed that a grant-in-aid was approved for construction of a
bus-stop at the junction of the highway and the road leading to
Anandpura. This was remaining unutilized at present, pending
fixing of the alignment and land to be acquired. Since the
proposed expressway alignment was decided at this stage, a
site visit was undertaken to mark the distance from the  a
centreline of the existing highway so that it falls at the edge
outside the proposed expressway ROW. The Panchmahal
R&B department can issue the necessary clearance
accordingly.
e.    A partially constructed guesthouse in the premises of Gujarat
Engineering Works. Nurpura village (in Baska Gram
Panchayat) is falling in the proposed ROW. Mr. Ismailbhai
Shabazkar, the owner explained that the further construction
has been stopped on receiving the notice from R&B
department considering the land acquisition for the ROW.
A site inspection was done and the -measurement from the existing
centreline was made. Considering the location of different portions of
the guesthouse (porch, hall, main building) from the centreline, which
needs to be accurately surveyed, the owner expressed his willingness
to pull down the porch and id required, the adjoining hall requesting
that the remaining structure be kept unharmed i possible. The options
to be considered are:

reduce the land acquisition to 22-26 m instead of 36 m (which does
not affect the traffic design considerations of the expressway); in
which case the porch and the hall need to be demolished, hence
provide necessary compensation for rebuilding them on the other side
of the building; or
considering the proximity of the above option, the residents of the
guesthouse will be subjected to higher noise levels and should
preferably be avoided, hence the possibility of relocating it completely
in the existing industrial plot so that it is sufficiently far away from the
ROW needs to be discuissed with the owner. Accordingly the
compensation (after valuation) needs to be given to enable rebuilding
it to the existing level of construction at the new location and should
be the preferred option if acceptable to the owner.
The applicable UD Rules (for existing structures) should be verified by
R&B Department for the case before granting the final permission.
11.3.5      Halol (Location: 33 Kms on SH 87 from Golden Chowkey on NH-8)
Venue: Hotel Valley
Number of persons present for the meeting :2
Being the end of the proposed expressway, the socio-economic
aspects due to the proposed land acquisition do not affect village
Halol per se.
a.    Hotel Valley is approximately 300 m from the proposed toll
collection booth. The owner, Mr. Jamalbhai Jalabhai Kadiwala
expressed his concem that the traffic going from Halol towards
Vadodara may not be able to access his hotel considering that
-the vehide will be just entering the expressway and will have
to travel some distance (1-2 km) before taking a U-tum on the
expressway and getting off the expressway to the service road
to reach his hotel
Should this be the case, his contention is true and it is quite
likely that the vehicles travelling from Halol to Vadodara may
prefer to travel onwards and get off the expressway further
down the road to accgs.an on-route hotel say at Asoj
i.    His hotel can provide service to about 4 bus loads of
passengers in 1 hours. Considering that by the year
2010, about 1370 buses are projected, even if only
about 600 were to consider the option of availing the
hotel facilities (accounting for one-way travel direction
only), it averages to a number of about 40 buses/hour
in 16 hours of the day when food is likely to be taken.
This itself is 10 times the load he can service. Hence
even in the earlier years i.e. after year 2000, it is
unlikely that his clientele will be reduced

ii.    Secondly, the owner is also proposing to set up a hotel
on survey 529, lshwarpura at Asoj which will inlact
increase his business by providing service to the traffic   r
travelling towards Vadodara from Halol
Nevertheless the following may be considered, subject to
technical design feasibility:
*     The access on the service road before entering the
expressway at Halol should be provided as a two way
service road. This will allow the vehicles to reach the
hotel from Halol for food etc. By travelling about 300 m.
and return to the toll booth to proceed towards
Vadodara. Herce service to traffic in both directions will
be possible
*     The owner should be permitted to advertise adequately
before the toll booth to draw the attention of the
travellers about the availability of hotel services before
entering the expressway and the way to reach the hotel

Venue: Mr. Manubhai Manebhai Parmar's House
Number of persons present for the meeting: 14
a.    Concem was expressed that the experience of the villagers
was that land was acquired for the Narmada canal, and now it
is proposed for the highway which will disturb the existing
houses without adequate compensation
It was explained that land will be acquired only on the opposite
side and hence no existing houses will be disturbed. The
acquisition will involve:
*     relocation of 3 kutcha shops, which can be done on the
same side as the village by identifying suitable land:
and
-    ; *  Relocation asmall Bhatiji Maharaj temple to which the
villagers are agreeable
b.    Concem  was also expressed that the agricultural land
acquired is likely to result in loss of land as well as loss of
income from fruit bearing trees. Hence the following should be
done:
*     provide compensation for loss of agricultural land either
by irrigated land elsewhere on which fruit trees are
planted and also compensate for income from lost fruit
trees for a period of 7-8 years till the newly planted
trees bear fruit; or

c.    Severance issue related to the use of pond on the opposite
side of the road including acquisition of about 10-20% of the
pond are the villagers were explained about the survey
conducted to identify the present hourly number of persons
and the uses of the pond. They were quite surprised on
knowing the data. They also mentioned that with increase in
traffic there has been a decline in pedestrian crossing safety
under present conditions and that accidents have taken place.
The villagers are also using Vishwamitri river instead of the
pond. To avoid the adverse impact, the following steps
: -     (discussed with the villagers and found acceptable) should be
taken:
*     the pond should be deepened and widened so that the
water storage capacity is enhanced (this will ensure
that the ground water Table - recharge due to the water
body will not be adversely affected);
* :   a subway be provided to access the other side of the
expressway to allow crossing the expressway safely
providing access to the pond and the agricultural fields
on the other side
11.4        Modifications in RAP
Any project must be based on the rational choice of the people,
especially those who might be adversely affected by it. Only such an
approach ensure both that displacement is minimised and that the
-project really serves the public purpose.
The right to decide whether any process of project has a public
purpose or in the national interest may rest with the people who will be
affected by it both displaced persons and those who might
accommodate them -subsequently. Peoples' participation in the
formulating and selection of a project also ensures that those who are
going to be PAPs are not made victims but rather partners in the
-  _                      development.
The PIC conducted through participatory approach has lead to
following major modifications in the RAP.
Free toll for project land owners: All the PAPs whose land is
acquired should be permitted to free use of highway. This may be
regulated by allowing only one commercial and one non-
commercial vehicle per affected family. After due verification of the
PAPs, the project can issue a letter to PAP to use highway without
paying toll.
-  Private lands and houses which gets isolated or cut off due to
acquisition of land in the project, may also be acquired if the
owner gives his/her consent to such acquisition. This would apply
only to oustees who can not make economic or any other use of

their non-acquired assets. Furfural Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. is one
such case where at Baska bypass the road divides the defunct
factory premises in to two disjoint parts of which the company can
not make economic use and hence option to completely purchase
the factory premises of the said company is worked out. Similarly,
Mr. Ashwin Sheth and his family members own 65 Ha. of land in
Asoj village and bypass at Asoj generates a triangular section of
land between existing road and the proposed bypass. This
triangular section of land can not be utilised further for economic
purpose by the owner and hence should be purchased by the
project. During the execution of the project such options will have
to be worked out by making PAPs participate in the discussion.
Changes in the curve Alignment: During PIC, all alternative
leading to non-displacement were studied. Different alternatives
on the basis of technical and social merits and demerits of the
project were examined and made available to public. It has lead to
many changes in RAP. Firstly, land at the curve alignment in the
Asoj bypass belonging to Mr. Ashwin Sheth has been improved in
order to minimise the loss in the utility of his land after land
acquisition. At many places, minor curve improvement or
reduction in ROW  subject to technical feasibility and social
acceptability are made. Secondly, in three project villages need for
access to the other side of the road was strongly demanded by
the villagers which led to provision of underpasses in the final
design. This has also enhanced safety levels of the villagers and
animals crossing the road.
11.5        Concluding Remarks
The PIC process has resulted in acceptance of the proposed
alignment, identification of community concem at large and possible
acceptable solutions, both at individual level and community level.
These will be generalised approximately while formulating the RAP.
It needs to be mentioned here that discussions with each PAP should
be done as a follow-up by the NGO, exploring the available solutions
suiting the individual considering his/her socio-economic background
so as to ensure adherence to the IL & FS R&R policy.

12.1.        Objectives
The basic objective of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is to ensure
that the PAPs from the 'corridor of impact' of VHRP get adequate
compensation and assistance so as to achieve or improve their pre-
:project economical status in the shortest time and retain their potential
for further economic growth.
12.2.        Key Steps
The key steps in developing the RAP are:
.1  Development of an entitlement package that provides details of
compensation and renabilitation assistance;
2. Integration of RAP implementation with the project execution:
3. Provision of instituticnal set up and budget for implementation of
the RAP; and
4. Provision for arrangement for monitoring the implementation of the
RAP.
The following sections present details on each of the above aspect with
respect to acquisition of the lands for the VHRP.
12.3         Entitlement Package
12.3.1       Loss of Land
Considering the project design and its deviations from the existing
ROW, the VHRP covering 31.5 Km of road improvement will require
acquisition of estimated 79.16 Ha of land in Vadodara district and 28.77
Ha in Panchamahal districts (total 107.93 Ha) from the private land
owners. The details of the extent of land to be acquired and the number
of land holders losing land are given in Table - 8.9 and Annexures IA,
IB and ll.
Land Owner PAFs
For developing the entitlement for the land owner PAFs, the socio-
economic data was analyze&Tor individual families and details on the
following parameters were extracted:
-  family size and number of adult members in the family:
* agricultural, non-agncultural and total income;
* loss of land to project, compensation for land' and balance land
holding after LA;

*  vulnerable families/members in a family such as widows, aged
persons and woman headed family.
With the reported cropping pattem and general yield. while analysing
the data on income, it was observed that some families reported
income which prima facie appeared to be lower than that which could
have been obtained from their land holdings. Therefore the size of the
land holding and absence of non-agricultural income were considered
as the main parameters for categorizing the PAPs into category 1, 2
and 3 corresponding to marginally, moderately and severely affected
groups as defined in section 10.2.3. Out of the 50 families surveyed,
complete information for developing the entitlement package was
analysed for only 50 families. The results of such analysis are
presented in Annexure Ill.
In case there are standing agricultural crops at the time of LA, cash
compensation equivalent to one year income for crops will be paid
through contingency fund. In case of loss of fruit bearing trees, the
income compensation will be for made for a period of 12 years.
Land Tenants
In the absence of information about the profile of land tenants, as
discussed in section 10.3, the entitlement for tenants is based on the
estimated land under tenancy from the plot numbers identified. The
total land under tenancy is estimated as 25.45 ha (16.72 ha. - irrigated
and 7.73 ha.- unirrigated). The pattern of land plot sizes is assumed to
be similar to the land holdings under LA from private owners. Since only
severely affected tenants are to be provided land equal to MEL, it is
assumed that such requirements will be limited to 10 tenants and the
remaining will be assisted through loans / grants.
Industnal Land
Only one case of industrial land loss of a defunct factory exists. The
land value was estimated through inquiries with Gujarat Industrial
Development Board (being industrial land) as Rs. 170,000/Acre i.e.
Rs.419,900/ha. The compensation will be based on this figure.
Loss of Village Land
The public land acquired within the revenue boundary of the village can
belong to either the Gram Panchayat or the Revenue Department,
GoG. In case of the government land, since the GoG is a member
(shareholder) of SPV, and since the project (road) will be transferred
back to the govemment, no compensation is proposed to be paid for
such government lands.' As the gram panchayat / govemment land
holding is yet to be identified through JMS, it is proposed to pay a price
to the Gram Panchayat for such lands at the govemment rate from the
contingency provision.

houses have been rented to tenants and 1 house is owned by a
squatter.
As per IL&FS policies, all house owners are compensated by a house
of area equal to the area of the lost structure. In case the area of the
house is less than the minimum government norm for single family
dwelling, a house of minimum area is provided (Indira Awas Vikas
Yojana). For squatters, irrespective of the size for the present dwelling,
an ownership house of minimum area as per government norm is
provided. The beneficiary under this case however cannot sell the
house till completion of the concession period of the project.
In the case of VHRP all residential structures are below 32.5 sq.m. (350
sq.ft.) in area and therefore all entitlement are restricted to houses with
built-up area of 32.5 sq.m. and surrounding open area of equal
dimension. The cost including the cost of land for such houses at the
rate of Rs. 1075/sq.m. (Rs. 100/sq.ft.) is estimated to be Rs. 40,000.
In the case of tenants, it is expected that they will re-establish
themselves elsewhere and the IL&FS policy entitles them only for a
shifting allowance. However in the present cases, the tenants belong to
economically weaker sections and are living in damaged houses due to
financial constraints. It is difficult to envisage that they will be able to
shift -to altemate accommodation and re-establish themselves. As a
special case, therefore, these tenants will also be provided with a
dwelling unit of minimum area. The house owner will be compensated
for the land and structure based on valuation.
A shiffing allowance of Rs. 1000 will be provided to each of the 10
PAPs.
Commercial Structures
As identified in Annexure V, the only commercial structures requiring
relocation are movable stalls. Hence a shifting allowance at the rate of
Rs. 1000 per structure is proposed for them.
Fencin
Compensation for rebuilding barbed fencing or compound walls will be
given to the PAPs listed in Annexure V.
Industrial Structure
Considering that the factory at Baska is defunct. its valuation will be
'done to determine the cost of compensation for the structures. This will
be paid through contingency funds.
Other Public Structures
Compensation for rebuilding/relocating other public structures such as
temples, bus stop and wells will be provided.

Analysis of each PAF on the basis of the above entitlement norms was
done to determine the individual's RAP requirements. Table - 12.2
represents the outcome of this exercise and is used as a basis for
developing the budget for the RAP for the project.
It is strongly recommended that the NGO who undertakes the socio-
economic survey of the PAPs, analyzes the data in a similar fashion to
assess the individual needs for the PAFs which could not be covered
during the present study.

12.6        Institutional Arrangement For Implementing The RAP
12.6.1       Implementation Responsibility
It is primarily the responsibility of the SPV to ensure successful
implementation of the project. The construction of the project mainly
involves acquisition of private agricultural land to the extent of more
than 85% of the total requirement. The entitlement package developed
for individual PAFs indicate that about 20% families will require a
grantloan/altemate land for restoration of their pre-project status.
Adequate  institutional  arrangements  for  cperationalizing  the
mechanism for assistance is necessary for successful implementation
of RAP. Therefore there is a need to focus on two main issues:
*  Issues related to LA and altemate land allocation for severely
7dlYeC;d PRAfs and..
*  Issues related to Economic Rehabilitation (ER) of PAFs.
Land acquisition is primarily the govemment responsibility and a
mutually acceptable compensation at market rate is to be arrived at
through negotiations. The SPV is committed to pay the difference
between the compensation amount as per govemment rates and the
negotiated settlement price of the land. The procedure therefore will
involve interaction and consensus building with the PAFs on an
agreeable fair rate of compensation.
Economic Rehabilitation of PAFs is necessary so that their pre-project
income levels are enhanced or at least retained. It is essential that the
compensation paid to the PAFs is utilized to build assets for

substituting the loss of income to the PAFs. Since grants and loans
are proposed to be given to the severely affected PAFs as means to
raise the income levels, in addition to compensation for land (cash or
land equal to MEL), it is necessary to identify local business activities
or provide vocational training to utilize these gra^ts/loans to build
assets.
In this context, it is necessary that a NGO exoerienced in LA
procedures and in implementing income generatic: schemes work
closely with  SPV  and  govemment. Thus the implementation
responsibility through an institutional arrangemen- will need to be
developed around the SPV, GoG Representative and NGO
involvement.
12.6.2      Land Acquisition
LA for the project is the responsibility of the Revenue Department
which is done through a Special Deputy Collectc" or District Land
Acquisition Officer (LAO) at the district level. The LA programme will
be implemented in two districts viz., Vadodara ard Panchamahals
simultaneously. Therefore, there will be two LAOs, one for each
district to manage all LA activities for the project. Land plan schedules
indicating the details of the lands required have been prepared by the
Executive Engineer and submitted to the Distnct LAO who has
initiated LA proceedings uls 4(i) in October 1996. Separate
institutional arrangement, other than the existing one is not envisaged
for this purpose.
In addition, there is also is a need to allocate compensatory land to
the severely affected PAPs. There are two options: (1) finding out
govemment land for allotment to PAPs and (2) extending cash
assistance to help the people to purchase land in the open market.
The field observations indicate that govemment lands are of inferior
quality and most of it is already in occupation by the local farmers for
cultivation. The land holders losing land for VHRP have expressed
their reluctance to accept these lands. Therefore. the possibilities of
finding altemate govemment land is extremely limited. The only
alternative therefore is to help the PAPs to find suitable - lands in the
open market.
Thus a district-wise Compensatory Land Procurement Committee
(Annexure VI) for each of the two districts is prcoosed to facilitate
identification, purchase and transfer/allocation of land to the severely
affected PAPs. The committee will help the PAPs identify sellers of
land, assess the extent and the market value of land available. The
committee will thus bring the seller of the land and the PAPs together
and help them  negotiate the price of the land and settle the
transaction. The NGO will ensure that the interests of the PAPs is
addressed - both in land acquisition as well as compensatory land
allocation. The committee will also decide the rate of compensation
from private lands and mechanisms for its disbsrsement for each
PAF.

12.6.3      Economic Rehabilitation
This is one of the critical areas of project implementation. It is
proposed to set up two committees as under:
x Project Level R&R Monitoring Committee (Annexure Vil): The
main function of this committee will be to ensure that the
proposed ER measures are being implemented as planned. make
policy decisions to facilitate implementation of the same and give
necessary administrative decisions/directions as required.
*  District Level R&R Implementing Committee (Annexure Vill).
The main function of this committee is to implement the identified
ER program.
12.7        Role Of NGO
12.7.1      Responsibilities
In the present context, an NGO will work as a link between the project
(more specifically the SPV) and the affected community. It will
educate PAPs on the need to implement the project, on aspects
relating to LA and ER measures and ensure proper utilisation of
various grants and loans being extended to them under the R&R
entitlement package. Specifically, the selected NGOs will be
responsible for:
i) identification and profiling of land PAPs who could not be
contacted in this study in both the districts and develop rapport
with adversely affected PAPs, the project authorities and district
LAOs;
ii) exploring the possibilities of negotiated settlements for the lands
acquired for the project and help PAPs negotiate properly with the
project authorities and the LAO;
iii) identification of vulnerable sections losing their land who could not
be covered in this study;
iv) verification of the land records of the affected PAPs at the time of
-                       :  project implementation to-be carried out to establish the total land
owned by each individual and the extent of loss (follow-up by
NGO);
v) detailing of land owners having land holdings less than MEL
holding and assisting themn during the LA to enhance their holding
to MEL level by providing adjacent lands or to sell their lands to
the project and obtain alternate land;
vi) verification of land tenants and their eligibility for ER based on the
cutoff date (date of notification uls 4(1) in October 1996;
vii) working out entitlement (RAP on individual basis);.
viii).assisting in speedy implementation of ER measures such as
provision of land (if it takes more than six months) by taking up

the issue with Project Level ER Implementation Committee for
appropriate measures;
ix) assisting severely affected (and other eligible PAPs) in obtaining
vocational training from various govemment development and
other suitable training programmes for income generation
schemes;
x) ensuring proper utilisation of various grants as available under ER
package;
xi) help PAPs in the redressal of their grievances relating to LA and
ER; and
xii) any other responsibilities as may be assigned by the project
authorities for the welfare of the affected community.
12.7.2      Selection Of NGO
It is of utmost important to select an NGO which is good, genuine and
committed to the task assigned. NGO having local presence and
experience to deal with land acquisition issues and social problems
like resettlement will be preferred. Since the magnitude of R&R is
relatively small, only one NGO will be selected for the project to help
the District Level ER Implementation Committee in the implementation
of the RAP. Selection of NGO will be done by SPV for a period of
three years.
12.7.3      Contracting NGOs
NGO will be involved in the implementation of the RAP through
mutually agreed upon terms and conditions with specific
responsibilities and adequate in-built accountability. A Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) will be signed with the selected NGO
indicating the tasks to be performed and the amount to be paid for
their services. The payment to the NGO will be linked to the
performance of the task assigned and the time period. The payment
will be arranged on quarterly basis to be released on certification of
completing the previous task. The NGO will periodically submit a
progress report before claiming its next installment of the contracted
amount. Its services will be required for three years. The draft terms
-                     of reference for NGO is detailed in Annexure-IX.
12.8       . Role Of Other Government Agencies
Various govemment departments and public agencies particularly the
Revenue, Rural Development (RD) and Bank/Financial Institutions
have an important to make in implementing the RAP. The Revenue
Department is responsible not only for acquiring the land and other
properties and handing them over to the project authorities but it is
also required to allot available government land for housing and
agricultural purposes. The District Rural Development Agency can
extend the income generation schemes and skills development
programmes for the welfare of the community, especially the severely
affected PAPs to integrate various development schemes for their ER.
It should be noted that the funding for the participation in the

government schemes will be bome by the project and need not be a
constraint in making available such schemes for the PAPs.
12.9        Implementation Schedule
The implementation schedule depends largely on the decision of
contracting the project in two or more stretches. The schedule
proposed below assumes that it will be taken up in two stretches
simultaneously. Land should be taken into possession and handed
over to project authorities (preferably free from all encumbrances) for
carrying out constructional activities.
The first activity of the project, as far as LA is concemed is the issue
of a notification u/s 4(1) of the LA Act, 1894 as amended in 1984 LA
takes minimum of 9 months to complete and it was initiated in October
-- 1996. However, its further follow-up al described in chapter 9 is yet to
commence. Compensation needs to be paid to the PAPs before the
start of actual project construction. In case of any delay in LA
proceedings, R&B will take lands from their owners on 'consent basis'.
The implementation schedule is reflected in the annual phasing of
budget funds wherein it is assumed that 75% land acquisition and
related ER will be done in the first year itself, while the balance will be
done in the second year. Implementation schedule of 2 years has
been worked out on the general LA proceedings. Delays if any in the
LA cannot be specifically addressed. However, to accelerate the
process of acquiring land, negotiated settlement can be given top
priority.
The activities to be taken on an immediate basis as a part of initiating
the implementation of the RAP are as follows:
i3    Issue of notification u/s 4(1) of the LA Act for acquiring private
properties - done in October 1996;
ii)    Selection and appointment of NGOs;
iii)   Conduction of survey of all the land owners and tenants to
identify the PAPs and their entitlement requirements;
iv)    Constituting land operationalising the following:
a)    Project Level -ER Monitoring Committee
District Level ER Implementation Committee
c)    Compensation Land Procurement Committee
iv)   Payment of compensation as per LA Act or as per amount
agreed through negotiated settlement. This is the responsibility
of LAO and SPV.
v)    Allocation of govemment land and release of grants to the
PAPs for purchase of either land or productive assets. DRO
and NGO will work jointly to ensure that grants reach genuine
persons.
Subsequent to the above mentioned, focus will be on the follow-up
actions particularly on promoting economic activities and their

sustainability. A mid-term evaluation will be carried out to suggest any
corrective measures.
12.10       Monitoring And Evaluation
The M&E will be done simultaneous with the implementation of the LA
& RAP. For this purpose, while conventional government monitoring,
as described in subsequent sections will continue which mostly relates
to LA and compensation, number of families displaced and resettled,
extent of government land identified and allotted to the PAPs, other
R&R assistance extended and the related financial aspects etc., An
extemal agency will be engaged to meaningfully and realistically
evaluate R&R programmes on periodic basis. Further arrangements
for M&E are discussed below:
Project Level Monitoring
The SPV will be responsible for setting up and putting in place a
monitoring framework for the R&R implementation of the RAP. Since
M&E will be simultaneous with the initiation of R&R activities, the SPV
will beforehand develop a prescribed proforma for monitoring at
different levels - project and district. Such a monitoring system will
help in developing quality control and planning for remedial measures
to overcome implementation problems and build them into the
programme of activities. Besides various physical and financial
aspects, preparation of quarterly progress reports on the progress of
R&R activities will form the important task of the SPV.
In order to strengthen monitoring of LA & ER programmes, Project
Level Monitoring Committee (Annexure VII) will be constituted. The
committee will meet once in three months to approve plans and
monitor implementation of R&R activities. It will advise the project staff
at the district level through the District Level Committees on various
aspects of the programmes to make implementation more effective.
Monitoring by IL&FS
IL&FS will monitor social aspects of-the project on an on-going basis
through a Social Audit. The Environmental and Social Management
Group (ESMG) which comprises specialists with adequate expertise
and skill to understand the critical issues concerning environmental
and social aspects will undertake it.
District Level Monitoring
Concurrent monitoring at the district level will be the responsibility of
the District Level ER Implementation Committees (Annexure Vil) and
Compensatory Land Acquisition Committee (Annexure VI). They will
provide a feed back on the progress of LA and ER programmes to the
Project Level Monitoring Committee in prescribed monitoring formats.
12.11       Evaluation Of ER Programmes
An independent agency not associated with the project execution will
be engaged to carry out the impact evaluation of the implementation

of R&R programmes. Impact evaluation on sample basis need to be
undertaken twice during the project period. The first evaluation can
take place half way through the project and final evaluation at the
completion of implementing the RAP. The mid term evaluation will
help to plan for corrective measures while the final evaluation will
provide base for changes in the approach and policy to deal with the
problems relating to involuntary resettlement arising out of road
project. Provisions have been made in the budget for engaging the
external agency for impact evaluation.
