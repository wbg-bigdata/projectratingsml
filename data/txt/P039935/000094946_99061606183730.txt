The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification of January, 1994 and its
subsequent amendments of the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India,
does not require Environmental & Social Assessment (ESA) for project category such as
Tirupur Area Development Project (TADP). New Tirupur Area Development Corporation
Limited (NTADCL) however undertook the ESA study in keeping with the requirements
of the IL&FS's Environmental and Social Report (ESR) as well as the World Bank's
Operational Directive 4.01, 4.20 and 4.30.
A Comprehensive Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) Study was carried out by
the NTADCL in the year 1997 through the Centre for Environmental Studies (CES) at
Anna University in association with Tamil Nadu Institute of Urban Studies, Coimbatore as
per IL&FS's and World Bank guidelines.
The objectives of the ESA were:
e  identification and assessment of all the likely environmental and social impacts of the
project components;
-  analysis of alternatives for various project components for minimizing environmental and
social impacts and drawing recommendations thereof;
*  development of an environmental management plan and resettlement action plan for
making the project environmentally sound and socially acceptable and
* recommendation of an appropriate institutional framework and monitoring mechanisms
for the environmental management and resettlement action plans.
In essence, the ESA enables maximization of the benefits of the project and minimization /
mitigation of the environmental and social risks due to the project. The ESA thus aims to
ensure that the TADP is developed as an enviromnentally compatible and socially
responsible venture.
2.0   Existing Water Supply And Sewerage Systems
2.1   Existing Water Supply System
Domestic
Tirupur town is supplied water from 2 existing schemes, which source water from river
Bhavani, a tributary of river Cauvery. Scheme-I was commissioned in 1965 and currently
supplies 8.6 MLD water to TM. Scheme-II was commissioned in 1992 to supply 42 MLD
water to TM and en-route villages. Under the latter scheme, abstraction of water is done
from river Bhavani at Mettupalayam, which is pumped and conveyed to water distribution
stations in TM, 4 town panchayat and 44 wayside villages after treatment. Distribution to
consumer, for domestics and commercial use, is effected from the existing 11 reservoirs
and 7 water supply zones. Presently water is supplied for only two hours on daily basis
the service level being approximately 105 lcpd.



Environmental and Social Assessment Reporn
Tirupur Area Development Project                              Executive Summary
Industrial
Tirupur is India's leading cotton hosiery centre. At present, nearly 2500 knitting and
stitching units, 579 dyeing and / or bleaching units, 300 printing units, 150 embroidery
units and nearly 200 ancillary process units such as raising, compacting, mercerizing etc
are located in TLPA. Other supporting service units for the manufacture of cartons, labels,
polyethene bags, elastic tapes, etc. are also present in TLPA.
Water is an essential commodity in the cotton knitwear production process. The existing
water supply system does not provide any water to the dyeing and industrial units.
Consequently, the industrial units have largely relied on their own resources to water
supply. Private water suppliers abstract ground water and supply it to the industries
through tankers. According to the present estimates, around 30 MLD water is abstracted
by the industries from the ground, and 50 MLD is supplied through the tankers, which in
turn abstract from the ground water in the surrounding areas.
2.2   Existing Wastewater Systems
At present there is no underground sewerage system in TM. Until recently, dry latrines
were used within the municipal area. However, these are being gradually converted to
flush latrines with septic tanks. The effluents of septic tanks are being discharged to soak
pits and partly to surface drains. The economically weaker population is only partly
covered by these facilities. TM has already taken up a "Low cost. sanitation" programme
involving conversion of existing dry latrines into flush type. It is estimated that about 62
% of the total population is covered with low cost sanitation facilities (septic tank / soak
pits).
Some of the main streets have permanent surface drains while the rest of the lanes have
only temporary surface drains. The total length of the drains is about 80 km out of the
total length of 400 km of roads maintained by TM. Domestic sewage, sullage, effluent
from commercial establishment and industries including bleaching and dyeing factories
and storm water are discharged in these open drains. Finally, these wastewaters are
discharged into the Noyyal and Nallar rivers which flow through the town.
As far as industrial wastewater is concemed, about 238 industrial units have already planned
to provide effluent treannent through five Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs),
which are under various stages of completion. The remaining industrial units (about 500) are
in the process of either joining the CETPs or they are constructing on their own Individual
Effluent Treatment Plants (IETPs). The effluent after treatment will comply with effluent
standards prescribed by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), except in the case of
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS).
3.0   Need For The Project
Drawing from the existing situation, it is evident that there is a lack of proper environmental
infiastructure viz., inadequate and low quality water supply, absence of sewerage systems
etc. in the TLPA.

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                            Executive Summary
In the absence of any intervention, the per capita supply, that is already inadequate, will
reduce further due to increase in population and the ground water reserves will further
deplete. Additionally, the ground water contamination will continue to increase, due to high
TDS in the industrial effluents. Population pressure on the sanitation facilities will result in
further deterioration of the existing system leading to serious issues of public health, land and
ground water contamination.
It is in this milieu, that a need for developing the infrastructure for water and wastewater
management in Tirupur was realized and the TADP proposed by TACID.
TADP is an environmental management and social improvement project, which would
significantly improve the environmental and social conditions in the project area. This is
expected to be achieved through provision of potable piped water supply, facilities for
sanitation, domestic wastewater collection, treatment and disposal including sludge treatment
and disposal.
3.1   Project Coverage
The proposed TADP aims to provide water supply to industries and households in TLPA,
which comprises TM and 16 adjacent village panchayats admeasuring 217 sq.km.
In addition, water supply would be provided to villages in the four wayside unions of
Perundarai, Uthukuli, Chenimalai and Tirupur, which lie along the water transmission line
corridor. These Panchayat Unions comprise area admeasuring approximately 780 sq.km.
TADP's scope covers within its arnbit following two phases described below:
Phase I: Water supply; sewerage system (within Tirupur Municipal area), sewage
treatment and low cost sanitation for slums (within Tirupur Municipal area).
Phase II: Common facility for sludge collection treatment and disposal mainly to address
sludges arising from operation of industrial effluent plants.
4.0   Baseline Environmental Conditions
The program for conducting baseline environmental studies was designed after scoping. This
helped to identify the critical environmental components that are likely to be impacted by the
project activities. Hence, the focus of baseline studies was on. monitoring of surface and
ground water bodies. Observations on local ecology were also made during the baseline
survey for environmental quality in the project area.
Surface Water
Surface water quality of river Cauveri was established using both primary and secondary
data. Primary data obtained from the analysis of collected samples as well as the available
secondary data indicated that the chemical and bacteriological quality of the river water
meets the requirements for selecting it as a source of drinking water supply after conventional
treatment.
iii



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                             Execuitve Summary
With respect to the quality of surface waters within the TLPA, the chemical and
bacteriological analysis of samples as well as the secondary data collected indicate a very
poor water quality in both the Noyyal and Nallar rivers and the Sarkar Periyapalayam lake.
This is probably due to the indiscriminate discharge of domestic sewage as well as industrial
effluent into them. Neither of these rivers is perennial and for most of the year there is no
flowing water in them. Further the stagnation of the effluent in these rivers is contributing to
the ground water contamination in the region.
Ground Water
To establish the groundwater quality, samples were collected for analysis from both bore
wells and dug wells. The values for TDS, hardness, chloride, nitrate and sulphate were found
to be exceeding permiissible standards. The bacteriological quality was also found to be poor.
Specifically, high TDS values were observed in dug wells near the rivers which normally
receive effluents from the dyeing units. Chloride levels were in the range of 70 to 4500
mg/I. Dug wells close to the course of Noyyal river in the lower stretches upto
Chennaimalai reservoir had high levels of chloride at 2500-4000 mg/l. Hardness values in
the range of 90 to 1750 mg/I. Nitrate values ranged from 0 to 18.5 mg/I. Fluride values
ranged from 0.2 to 1.6 mg/I. Sulphate levels ranged from 30 to 850 mg/I. Five dug wells
close to rivers Noyyal and Nallar had high colours.
The baseline data thus shows a widespread contamination of the ground water bodies in and
around TLPA.
Further, due to over-exploitation of the ground water, a fall of 8.85 m in the ground water
table has been recorded in Tirupur Block between 1982 and 1993. The ground water
resource is thus under severe stress, arresting further possible utilization. Lack of reliable
water supply, in termis of both quantity and quality, has inhibited the growth of industries
and has slowed down the flow of new investnents into the area.
Ecology
The project area is characterized by undulating rocky zones. The terrestrial ecology of the,
area is suggestive of dry deciduous or semidry deciduous and thorny dry land conditions.
The major aquatic component of the project area represented by the river Cauvery is rich
in floral and faunal diversity. There is a diversity of residential and migratory birds in the
study area. The aquatic and shoreline macro faunal composition in Cauvery river indicates
that the system supports a rich variety of aquatic life. The water intake area at Cauvery
river is rich in vegetation and approximately 36 varieties of plants comprising herbs,
shrubs and trees are present here. A few varieties of terrestrial fauna have also been
recorded at sites for Water Treatment Plants (WTP), Booster Pumping Stations (BPS),
Master Balance Reservoir (MBR) at Pulavapatty and Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) at
Sarkar Periyapalayam and Sultanpet. However, none of the flora and fauna recorded
belong to endangered category.

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                              Executive Summary
5.0   Assessment of Environmental Impacts
The ESA study identifies various environmental and social issues associated with the
project during the construction and operation phases. Most of the impacts have been
assessed as minor, short term and mitigable. To minimize the impacts further, options
have been explored in terms of alternate sites and pipeline routes etc. In this manner, the
ESA study has significantly influenced the engineering design and planning of the project.
The ESA has also identified the positive impacts due to the project. It has been found that
the positive impacts far outweigh the any negative impacts arising during construction and
operation of the project.
The main issues arising in the construction phase are generation of noise, loss of vegetation,
traffic disruption especially during the laying of sewers, dust release and accumulation of
debris near the major construction areas. Some of the issues common to most of the
construction sites are the depletion of resources (construction materials), increased
congestion and impact on air quality and noise levels as well as stress on local utilities.
The assessment of construction phase impacts of the project indicates that all of these
impacts are only short term and possible to be contained near to the sites of construction.
These can be further mitigated by following proper planing and good construction practices.
Many of the operational phase impacts are rather minor and confine to issues such as
reduction in the down stream flow in the river, disposal of sludge from water and sewage
treatrnent plants and noise due to operations of pumps etc. These impacts can be mitigated
by following the recommendations made in the EMP.
The ESA identifies two major issues in the operation of the project such as disposal of the
sludges from treatment of industrial effluents and meeting the TDS standard in the industrial
effluents. The EMP discusses possible solutions to these issues and makes specific
recommendations to this effect. The NTADCL has already taken a note of these
recommendations and have included in the scope of the project, (viz Phase II) development
of a conmmon facility for secured disposal of the effluent sludges. In addition, several
initiatives regarding the management of TDS in the industrial effluents are presently
underway. These include use of low salt dyes, dye bath segregation and management, use of
low liquor ratio dyeing machines, substitution of hypochlorite bleaching by hydrogen
peroxide etc.
The project will have considerable positive social impacts as a result of assured, adequate
and safe water supply and sanitation in the region. These benefits include:-
* Overall improvement in the health of the community especially the children,
* Enhanced opportunities for employment due to additional investments in the region,
* An opportunity to utilize the time and energy, presently spent in fetching water for the
household by the women, for other beneficial purposes.

Tirupur Area Development Project                          Executive Summary
6.0     Environmental Management Plan
A plan for the management of the various environmental issues has been identified and
developed. All the moderate to major issues are fully addressed to ensure that any residual
impacts would be minor and confined to a short period. Specifically, the EMT proposes
guidelines and standard operating procedures to be used by the contractors during the
construction and operation phases to minimize/mitigate the adverse impacts during the
project. Table 0.1 summarises various impacts and EMP in the format of issues, action to
be taken as well as the responsible agency.
6.1   Environmental Monitoring
The environmental monitoring activity in the context of the project would be at three
levels:
* Routine monitoring of the performance of the water supply system up to the point of
bulk off-take by the Operator to ensure that the system is being operated and
maintained in conformity with the applicable water quality standards.
* Compliance monitoring by the NTADCL to ensure that the proposed environmental
management plan is being implemented during both construction as well as operation.
* Monitoring the performance of the project in terms of the services committed by
NTADCL to the beneficiaries as well as the monitoring of the environmental quality in
the project area. This monitoring will be done by NTADCL in consultation with the
Citizens' Committee and would attempt to evaluate the extent of benefits that accrue to
the consumers from the project
The monitoring plan is described in Table 0.2. The estimated cost of the environmental
monitoring is Rs. 2.558 Million per year during the construction phase and Rs. 2.676
Million per year during the operation phase. These costs have been fully integrated in the
overall financial planning of the project.
6.2  Institutional Arrangement
For the recommended compliance and monitoring, NTADCL would hire the services of a
senior expert. The expert will be on a retainer basis and the responsibilities will include:
*  Hiring a monitoring agency to monitor the environmental quality,
* Review the outputs of the monitoring agency,
*  Rationalise the environmental monitoring process,
* Preparation of an annual environmental and social audit report for NTADCL,
* Preparation of an environmental compliance report, to be used by NTADCL for
communicating the progress of the project to the financing institutions providing
assistance. NTADCL would provide a specific format to the consultant for this report
Separate citizens' committees would be formed to monitor implementation of EMP during
construction and operation phases of the project .

Environmental and SocialAssessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                             Executive Sumimnry
7.0   Social Assessment
Socio-economic impacts of the proposed TADP over the habitants in the project area will
be both positive and negative. On the positive side the project will bring in assured and
adequate water supply of clean and potable water to the residents as well as the industrial
users in the TLPA. The project will also provide safe wastewater collection, treatment and
disposal system. The negative socio-economic impacts include dispossession of water
tanker owners and employees property and economical assets on lands to be acquired to
house the project components and their probable displacement and/or impoverishment
According to the feasibility study for TADP, approximately 28 hectare of land area is
required to house the project facilities. In order to minimise the social impacts due to the
acquisition of lands, as far as possible, the facilities are sited on the government lands. The
acquisition of private lands for the project thus is limited to less that 10 hectares.
As a result of land acquisition for the project, the economic losses of Project Affected
Persons (PAPs), besides loss of lands, may include loss of house, business and access to
economic opportunities
The social assessment study has been undertaken with due consideration to public opinion
and sensitivities. The entitlement packages and the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) have
been prepared according to the principles and processes contained in the Environmental
and Social Report (ESR) of IL&FS and the World Bank's policies (OD 4.30 and 4.20)
8.0   Project Affected Persons
The initial estimates indicated displacement of families at three sites. These included 50
families with legal titles at Puluvarpatty (MBR site), 20 families residing on government
land at Thiruvalluvar Nagar (Service Reservoir site) and 57 families residing on
government land at Chinnandipalayam (STP site)
The treated water transmission main would mainly be laid within the Right of Way
(ROW) of NH-47 and the state highways. The social issues due to the laying of the
transmission line, therefore, arise only in those sections where either the ROW is
significantly encroached or is too narrow to allow passage of the pipeline
9.0   Minimisation of Social Impacts
One of important finding of the social survey among the landowner PAPs was that
majority of the landowners were absentee landlords and did not depend on the lands under
investigation for their livelihood. For landowners engaged in agriculture, the lands
required by the project form a small part of their land holdings and thus do not
significantly affect their earnings. The identification of private lands for the project was
thus optimal from the point of view of minimisation of rehabilitation related issues
The minimisation of social impacts focused at the three sites that required major
resettlement efforts for mitigation of impacts and to minimise the social impacts at these
sites, following decisions were taken:
vii



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
7irupur Area Development Project                             Executive Summary
The location for MBR at Puluvarpatty was shifted by 500 m to a new site at Neruparichal,
that did not involve acquisition of any homestead lands. A resettlement site for PAFs at
Thiruvalluvar Nagar was identified within 500m of the Service Reservoir (SR) site to
minimise the impacts on the host community as well as the resettling families. Later, after
discussions with project engineers, it was observed that the site for resettlement, which
was a government land without any encroachments, could be also suitable to house the
SR. The new site has been recommended to house the SR, thus eliminating the
resettlement entirely'.
At Chinnadipalayam, the STP (west) layout has been modified so that the community
residing on the site is not affected
The congested portion along the pipe line route between km 77.6 and km 79 would be
bypassed by following Erode-Perundurai road up to the Perundurai junction, to minimise
social impacts
Some road sections with approximate overall length of 1000m along the feeder mains have
considerable settlements on both sides of the road. Project implementation along these
sections will not have any negative social impacts if the pipe lines are laid below the
paved surface of the road. Otherwise, it will be necessary to acquire a 5m wide strip of
agricultural lands behind the road side structures. Such acquisition due to its very small
area falling under individual field will not have a significant impact on agricultural
income from the fields. The cost of acquisition of these lands is included in project costs
10.0 Final Estimates of PAFs
As a result of project modifications towards minimisation of social impacts, the number of
PAFs has been restricted to 74 from 107. The break-up of PAF's falling under various
categories viz. Land owners, Encroachers and Partially affected families is given in Table
0.3.
11.0 Participation of PAPs
The general principles for determining the entitlement package for the PAPs were
discussed with the affected persons by way of focus group meeting during the course of
social survey and later before finalisation of the RAP recommendations. A formal Public
Information and Consultation (PIC) meeting was also conducted in the project area to
appraise the village representatives and general public about the project and policies
towards social issues
12.0 Resettlement Action Plan
Land Value
The land value within the town fluctuates according to its usage and location. Due to an
increased demand of land for industrial and commercial activities an appreciation in land
value has occurred. The value of land along the Avinashi road is about Rs. 2400 per sq. m
at one of the proposed reservoir sites. The land values in the outskirts of TLPA are in the
'The SA, as a precautionary measure, also provides RAP if the community needs to be resettled.
viii



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                           Executive Summary
range of Rs. 2-2.5 Million per hectare. The land value in Bhavani area, near intake and
water treatmnent plant sites is about Rs. 1.5 Million per hectare
Valuation of other assets
The assets that could be dismantled for clearance of the area for project construction are
structures of different types and varying plinth areas and construction material and trees.
In case of structures, assessment is based on the plinth area and valued at suitable rates,
subtracting depreciation there on. The process to value the trees is based on the age, height
and its girth
Estimation of Compensation
Considering above factors, RAP has worked out detailed compensation for lands and
assets of PAPs and is summarised in Table 0.4.
13.0 Resettlement & Rehabilitation Needs
The findings of SA bring out that it is feasible to minimise the resettlement to only at one
of the sewage pumping station location. There may however be a need to resettle 21 other
families at one of the service reservoir location. The social assessment has however
included the larger requirement for budget estimates. The total cost of the resettlement
needs for the project area estimated at Rs. 3.38 Million. NTADCL will have the over all
responsibility to construct and allot the housing at the resettlement sites.
The project does not have any rehabilitation needs as such. However suggestions are given
for training the youths for possible employment in the textile industries.
14.0 Institutional Arrangements
NTADCL will be responsible to ensure successful implementation of RAP for the project.
However, there will also be close involvement of district authorities in the implementation
process.
The SA recommends formation of Project Level R&R Implementation and Monitoring
Committee for effective implementing the RAP. The primary responsibility of the
committee will be to implement the recommendations of the social assessment with
respect to further minimisation of R&R issues and firm up the actual entitlement packages
for individual PAPs based on the guidelines presented in the ESA.
In this context, it is necessary that a NGO experienced in Land Acquisition (LA)
procedures and in implementing income generation schemes work closely with NTADCL
and government. Thus the implementation responsibility through an institutional
arrangement will need to be developed around the SPV, GoTN representatives and NGO
involvement.
ix



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                           Erecutive Summary
The NGO selected will be a member of the monitoring committee of RAP to be headed by
the District Collector as Chairman. The other members of the committee will be drawn
from NTADCL, different Government departments that are concerned with the RAP and
the senior project staff of the BOOT operator.
The activities to be taken on an immediate basis as a part of initiating the implementation
of the RAP are as follows:
* Issue of notification u/s 4(1) of the LA Act for acquiring private properties
* Selection and appointment of NGO
* Identification of all the landowners through the NGO and detailing of their entitlement
package and
* Constituting and operationalising Project Level Resettlement and Rehabilitation
Monitoring Committee
NTADCL would appoint an independent consultant conversant with R&R planning and
implementation to review the progress of RAP implementation
The overall budget for implementation and monitoring of RAP progress is estimated at Rs.
44.54 Million and includes costs of compensation for land acquisition (Rs. 37.87 Million);
resettlement and rehabilitation (Rs. 4.17 Million) and hiring of NGO and monitoring and
evaluation agency (Rs. 2.50 Million). The cost towards RAP has been included in the
project cost while undertaking the financial analysis of the project.
15.0 Identification & Management of Risks
The various environmental and social risks associated with this project, that may affect its
techno-commercial viability, include public resentment to compensations related to land
acquisition, uncertainty in assured off-takes from the water source, contamination of water
at the intake works and closure of industries due to environmental non-compliance.
The EMP and RAP proposed in ESA bring down most of the risk identified above,
considerably. In addition, the ESA has developed a risk management plan to address any
residual risks so as to keep them within the acceptable limits

CHAPTER 1
CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT
1.1   Background
Tirupur is an industrial town located about 50 km east of Coimbatore, off the National
Highway No. 47 (connecting Trichur and Salem). It is geographically located between
11.7-north latitude and 77.5-east longitude.
Tirupur Municipal town is spread over an area admeasuring approximately 27 sq.km.
Tirupur is known for textile processing and allied industrial activities and for its
contribution to the national economy by way of cotton knitwear exports, accounting for
over 90% of the country's exports in this sector. Exports have risen from marginal levels
in 1980-90 to US$ 1 billion in the year ending March 1998. With its geographic location
(refer Figure 1.1) in the Cauvery and Bhavani river basin and being on the transportation
corridors of western part of the Tamil Nadu State, the town has a good growth potential.
1.2   Situation Analysis
Tamil Nadu Corporation for Industrial Infrastructure Development Limited (TACID), a
Govenmuent of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) undertaking, is responsible for the development of
infrastructure for industrial areas within the State. As per statutory requirements, water
supply, sanitation and sewage management within the urban areas of the State are
implemented by the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board and
managed by the local bodies like municipalities and Town Panchayats and Village
Panchayats.
TACID has taken a lead role in developing infrastructure facilities primarily for the
industries within Tirupur Local Planning Area (TLPA), which comprises Tirupur
Municipality (TM) and adjacent 2 Town Panchayats and 14 Village Panchayats extending
over an area of 217.38 sq.km.
Due to the industrial expansion of Tirupur town, which has contributed to the development of
adjoining areas, this area has been identified as TLPA to facilitate planning. TACID has
developed a comprehensive plan called as the Tirupur Area Development Project (TADP).
The TADP addresses the infrastructure bottlenecks in Tirupur town, local Town Panchayats
and Village Panchayats and for the industries located in the TLPA. The impetus for the
implementation of TADP is largely from a local industry group, the Tirupur Exporters
Association (TEA), formed by Tirupur knitwear exporters.

Environment and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                           Context of the project
1.2.1 Population of Tirupur
The population of Tirupur municipal town was 2,35,661 as per 1991 census. The population
of 2 Town Panchayats and 14 Village Panchayats as per the 1991 census was 35,502 and
83161 respectively.
1.2.2 Industrial Scenario
Tirupur has hardworking entrepreneurs and workers who have made knitting a household
industry. It is aided by the availability of ample quantities of yarn at competitive prices in
the nearby city of Coimbatore, low cost labour and access to special fabrics in the southern
power loom centers of Salem, Erode, Karur and other cities. Today Tirupur houses about
5000 units, which directly or indirectly contribute to the export earning of the town. Of
these 5000 units, about 2500 are into knitwear, 625 are dyeing units, 325 bleaching units
and the balance are in ginning, spinning, steamn calanering, printing, packaging. Since
1985, the exports from Tirupur have witnessed a meteoric rise both in value terms as well
as the number of pieces.
1.2.3 Existing Water System
Tirupur town is supplied water from two existing schemes and river Bhavani as source,
which is a tributary of river Cauvery. Scheme-I was commissioned in the year 1965 to
supply water to TM and 7 wayside villages, which has a design capacity of 7.0 MLD. The
Scheme-II has a design capacity of 32 MLD and was commissioned in the year 1992,
which supplies treated water to TM, four Town Panchayats and 44 wayside villages
The consumers receive an average 31 MLD water from these two schemes after
accounting for the transmission losses. Presently water is supplied for two hours on
alternate days and is grossly inadequate.
TM is vested with statutory powers for the operation and maintenance of the water supply
system within .municipal limits. The water distribution system within TM limits is
therefore operated and maintained by TM. In addition, TM at present maintains the
Scheme-I from source to distribution and is responsible to supply bulk water to 7 wayside
villages covered under this scheme. However, TWAD Board is responsible for operation
and maintenance of the Scheme-II, which is outside TM limits.

Environment and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                           Context of the project
The industries in TLPA area including TM area do not have access to the reliable piped
water supply. Water is an essential commodity in the cotton knitwear production process.
The existing water supply system does not provide water to the dyeing and bleaching
industries. The industries have largely relied on their own resources to access water
supply. Private water suppliers abstract the ground water and supply it to the industries
through tankers, which generally have high concentration of Total Dissolve Solids (TDS).
Lack of reliable water supply has inhibited the growth of industries and has slowed down
the flow of new investments into the area.
1.2.4 Existing Sanitation Facilities
About 62 % of the total population are covered with sanitation facilities comprising of
septic tanks and soak pits. Community facilities in the form of 36 community toilets have
been provided by the TM for about 8,113 households belonging mainly to the
Economically Weaker Sections and Low Income Group. The slurn area within TM
currently does not have access to any sanitation facilities including toilets. The total slum
population of Tirupur town as per the 1991 census was 57,780 (about 25 % of then
Tirupur population) distributed in 88 notified slum areas.
1.2.5 Existing Domestic Wastewater System
Currently, Tirupur town does not have a sewerage system or an organized open drainage
system. Surface drains constructed in rubble masonry cover about 80 km of the road
length of TM, out of which about 50 km road length have well constructed drains (pucca
drains). The sewage, industrial effluent and storm water flows through the open drains to
the river. In case of some houses, the sullage is collected in soak pits.
1.2.6 Existing Industrial Wastewater System
About 288 industrial units had already planned to provide effluent treatment through 8
Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs), which are under various stages of
completion. Around 309 industrial units are in the process of setting up Individual Effluent
Treatment Plants (IETPs). The effluent after treatment would meet the effluent discharge
standards prescribed by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), except the
standards for TDS.
The rapid growth of industry has led to a serious deterioration in the environmental quality
particularly surface and ground water quality. This is due to the fact that the entire production
is through multitudes of small units and there has not been any concerted effort till recently,
on comprehensive planning for industrial effluent treatment and disposal. The ground water
quality over the years has been impaired by TDS in the industrial effluents to such an extent
1-4



Environment and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                             Context of the project
that the industry today finds it impossible to utilize the ground water as a source for process
water.
1.3   Need for the Project
The industrial sector at Tirupur mainly comprises dyeing and bleaching units. Due to the
rapid expansion and development of these industries, the infrastructure facilities at Tirupur
have always been inadequate. At present the water supply is inadequate for domestic
usage and no water is being supplied to the industrial sector. The industrial water demand
is being met through ground water resources and by tankers brought from other places.
The town does not have a sewage collection, treatment and disposal facility. The industrial
effluent treatment is being implemented through IETPs in some industries and through
CETPs in others. The sewage and industrial effluent are disposed off in open drains that
ultimately join Nallar and Noyyal rivers passing through the town. These two water bodies
are basically natural drainage courses, which carry water only during the monsoons. During
the remaining period of the year, these rivers carry only the industrial effluents, which get
stagnated in the natural depressions in the riverbed and percolate into the groundwater. As a
result, the groundwater quality around the cluster of bleaching and dyeing units is found to be
polluted, mainly by TDS, to such a level that it is unfit for domestic, industrial and
agricultural activities.
Low cost sanitation facilities presently provided by TM were found to be inadequate to
cater to the present levels of the population section comprising of slum-dwellers and the
Economically Weaker Sections or the Low Income Group. Also, most of the facilities
provided are not connected to any proper drains or septic tanks. It is necessary to extend
low cost sanitation facilities to the slums in TM.
In the absence of any intervention for remedying the above conditions, the following
consequences are anticipated:
(a)   Increase in health related hazards due to the prevailing unsanitary conditions;
(b)   Widespread environmental degradation due to discharge of untreated effluents;
(c)    Overexploitation of ground water by industries;
(d)   Impairment of ground water quality and
(e)   Deterioration of infrastructure due to increase in population caused mainly by
migration from surrounding areas in search of employment.

Environment and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                         Contex of theproject
It is in this context that the need for developing the infrastructure for water and wastewater
management in Tirupur was realized and the Tirupur Area Development Program (TADP)
was proposed. Details of the proposed infrastructure development program have been
discussed in Chapter 2.
1.4   Project Scope
TADP is an environmental management and social improvement program, which would
significantly improve the environmental and social condition in the project area, through
provision of potable, piped water supply, facilities for sanitation and domestic wastewater
collection, treatment and disposal and sludge treatment and disposal.
The proposed TADP aims to provide water supply to industries and households in TLPA,
which comprises TM and 2 Town Panchayats and 14 Village Panchayats. In addition,
water would be supplied to the four wayside unions (Perundarai, Uthukuli, Chenimalai
and Tirupur) and a Model township at Mudalipalayam, which lie enroute on the water
transmission system corridor. The Project would provide for the collection, treatrnent and
disposal of domestic wastewater generated within TM.
The Project would provide for the collection, treatment and disposal facility for the sludge
generated from industrial effluent treatment plants in Phase-II.
The Project beneficiaries can be categorized as follows:
(a)   Domestic consumers within Tirupur Municipality who would be provided water
supply and sewage collection service
(b)   Industrial consumers within Tirupur Municipality who would be provided a water
supply service and sludge disposal facility in Phase-II
(c)   Industrial consumers outside Tirupur Municipality but within TLPA who would be
provided a water supply service and sludge disposal facility in Phase-II
(d)   Enroute Village Panchayats Unions on the transmission main route who would be
provided a water supply service
(e)   Panchayats adjoining Tirupur Municipality who would be provided a water supply
service
(f)   Residents in notified slums within Tirupur Municipality who would be provided
on-site sanitation facilities linked to the sewerage system

1.5   Approach to Project Implementation
The existing institutional set-up in Tamil Nadu vests the responsibility of development of
water supply and sewerage facilities with the TWAD Board. The onus of providing water
supply and sewerage rests with the Municipalities, Panchayats and other local bodies. The
TWAD Board functions with limited financial allocations from the GoTN and external
funding institutions. As on date, its coverage for water supply for major municipalities (like
Tirupur) is reasonably high, though not complete, while its coverage of sewerage is
negligible. The dependence of Tirupur solely on TWAD Board, for the development of water
supply and sewerage sector would result in considerable time lag, which would be
detrimental to the industrial development of Tirupur area. The Tirupur Exporters'
Association (TEA) along with TACID therefore decided to implement the Project on a
commercial basis. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by TEA and
TACID with Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS) on August 25,
1994 for developing the Project.
To implement the Project on a commercial format, a special purpose vehicle with the
name New Tirupur Area Development Corporation Limited (NTADCL), was incorporated
as a public limited company under the Companies Act, 1956. NTADCL has been
promoted jointly by Government of India, Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN), Tirupur
Exporters' Association (TEA) and IL&FS. NTADCL has entered into a concession
agreement with GoTN for implementation of the Project.
The scope of TADP posed for commercial development under present concession
agreement is limited to implementation of facilities envisages under the Phase I. The
project is conceived on a Build Own Operate Transfer (BOOT) basis. NTADCL would
enter into a Concession Agreement with GoTN and TM as the BOOT Operator and
thereafter be responsible for implementation of the projects.
The Project would be bid out on an International Competitive Bidding (ICB) basis to induct
an experienced and suitably qualified Private Sector Partner (PSP). The PSP would be
responsible for the design, construction and operation and maintenance of the facility for the
period of the concession.
1.6   Objective of the Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA)
The Environmental Impact Assessment Notification of January-1994 and its subsequent
amendments of the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), Government of India, do
not require ESA for project category such as TADP. NTADCL however undertook the
ESA study in keeping with the requirements of the IL&FS's Environmental and Social
Report (ESR) as well as the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.01, 4.20 and 4.30

Environment and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                           Context of the project
A comprehensive ESA study was carried out through the Center for Environmental
Studies (CES) at Anna University, Chennai. Tamil Nadu Institute of Urban Studies
(TNIUS), Coimbtore, supported CES in conducting the social assessment
The main objectives of the ESA study are:
(a)   Identification and assessment of the likely environmental and social impacts and
analysis of alternatives to minimize them;
(b)   Development of an environmental management plan and resettlement action plan
for making the project environmentally sound and socially acceptable and
(c)   Recommendation of an appropriate institutional framework and monitoring
mechanisms for the environmental and resettlement action plans
The ESA study is designed to:
(a)   Ensure mitigation of potential environmental issues and community concerns early
in the implementation of the proposed project by incorporating necessary
safeguards in the design;
(b)   Minimize risk to the project proponent and the consumer;
(c)   Avoid delays and extra costs which may subsequently arise due to unanticipated
environmental and social problems; and
(d)   Ensure that the concems of residents and communities are addressed and plans
made for the rehabilitation and resettlement of those likely to be affected.
1.7   Methodology
1.7.1  Environmental Assessment (EA)
As a first step, secondary data was collected from GoTN and other agencies. Details of
topography, hydrology, surface and ground water quality were obtained. The current
service levels of water supply and sanitary conditions as well as land requirements for
water supply and sanitation projects were studied. Data on soil quality, land use pattern,
climate and meteorology was also obtained. A detailed project description was obtained
from NTADCL for understanding the likely impacts.

Environment and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                           Context of the project
Following this, field investigations were carried out to establish baseline environmental
conditions. Surface water samples were collected from selected locations on the rivers
Bhavani, Cauvery, Noyyal, and Nallar. Samples were also collected from Sarkar
Periyapalam lake. Ground water samples were collected from both dug and bore wells.
The collected samples were analyzed for various biological and chemical parameters.
For studying the ecological status of the region, inventorization and characterization of the
flora and fauna was done.
The above data collection was supplemented by interaction with the local people through
local bodies, Non Government Organizations (NGOs) and peoples' representatives.
The primary and secondary data were used to predict the impact of the project on the
existing environmental conditions. An analysis of alternatives was done for the various
project components. Alternatives most favorable to the environment were then
recommended.
The environmental issues arising from the project were identified and appropriate
mitigation measures suggested in an Enviromnental Management Plan (EMP). The
institutional arrangements required for monitoring the project were identified. This is
necessary to ensure that the mitigation measures suggested in the EMP are implemented.
1.7.2 Social Assessment (SA)
As a first step towards the study, the project documents and maps provided by NTADCL
were carefully studied. To facilitate an understanding of the project, its parameters and the
socio economic setting, field visits to all project facilities were undertaken. After the site
visits, a reconnaissance survey was planned and executed with the objective to gain first
hand information about the probable PAPs and their socio-economic profile, awareness
about the project and concerns. This information was later used to develop detailed survey
plans for their firn identification, to brief the local government about the dinensions and
areas of land acquisition, and to mobilize their support for authentication of ownership
records. The findings of the reconnaissance survey were extensively used for identification
of project alternatives for the project components that gave rise to significant social issues
Following liaison with the local government at the level of the District Collector, the task
of detailed investigation on socio-economic profile of PAPs and adjoining population was
initiated. The questionnaire prepared for the purpose was first field tested with 5%
coverage. Based on the field experience and the feedback, the questionnaire was revised.
Under the supervision of an experienced sociologist, a team of investigators was then
mobilized to carry out the survey.

Environment and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                            Context of theproject
Secondary data on ownership of lands required for the project was obtained. Following the
analysis of these records with reference to layout maps of the proposed project facilities,
physical demarcation of project sites in the presence of revenue officials was carried out to
the extent possible. In order to minimize further encroachment of sites, administrative
steps as well as support from local residents were sought. These steps led to actual
identification of PAPs of the project.
The data on assets and belongings of PAPs, extent of their losses due to the project and
their preference for resettlement and rehabilitation were then collected which formed the
basis for developing the Resettlement plan and the Entitlement package. While developing
the same, IL&FS guidelines, prescribed in the form of ESR, were followed. In order to
ensure timely implementation of the recommendations, a schedule of work integrating the
resettlement and rehabilitation needs with the project execution was developed. The
budgetary requirement for the package, based on the guideline value of land prices and
assets, was then worked out.
1.8   Organization of the Environmental and Social Assessment Report (ESAR)
The ESA report is organized in ten chapters. Introduction and project description are
presented in Chapters 1 and 2 respectively. The introduction provides a background to the
project and identifies the need for the project. The objective of the ESA study together

CHAPTER 2
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1   Preamble
This chapter gives an overview of the Project in terms of technical description of the
various water supply and sewerage system sub-components as for Phase I. The scope of
work would cover the following:
(a)   A bulk water supply system consisting of abstraction of 185 MLD of raw water
from river Cauvery, treatment and distribution to bulk industrial consumers, TM
and wayside villages
(b)   A water distribution system to store and distribute treated water to domestic and
industrial consumers within the jurisdiction of TM
(c)   A sewage collection, treatment and disposal system for the TM, including onsite
sanitation facilities for the slum areas within TM
2.2   Water Supply System
The system is designed to abstract 185 MLD of raw water from river Cauvery, treat it at a
water treatment plant about 1.4 km away and transmit treated water to a master balancing
reservoir, 54 km from the water treatment plant. From the master balancing reservoir,
treated water is pumped to 35 water distribution stations through three trunk distribution
mains, hereinafter termed as feeder mains. Treated water from the 35 water distribution
stations would then be distributed to individual consumers through local distribution
networks. A line diagram representing the water supply system is attached as Figure 2.1.
2.2.1 Water Source
River Cauvery, which is a perennial river, is proposed as a source of raw water abstraction
for the project. The Water Allocation Committee of Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN),
has permitted abstraction of 185 Mld water from river Cauvery at the proposed abstraction
point about 55 km from Tirupur vide Government Order No. 391 dated 27 May 1996.
2.2.2 Intake Works
The intake on river Cauvery would be constructed on the Right Bank of river Cauvery. It
is proposed to create a channel within the riverbed to improve water availability at the

intake well throughout the year. The intake would be RCC structure with manually
cleaned coarse screens.
2.2.3 Raw Water Main
The raw water, abstracted at the intake would be pumped from the intake to the Water
Treatment Plant (WTP), near the Vasavi College compound, through a 1.4 km long
pumping main. The raw water main would be constructed in mild steel of 1400-mm
diameter with a wall thickness of 12 mm
2.2.4 Water Treatment Plant
The water treatment plant would have a capacity to treat 185 MLD of raw water. The
water treatment process would consist of a single stream with pre-chlorination facility, 3
hydraulic flocculators, 3 lamella clarifiers and 10 conventional rapid gravity filters. The
sludge treatment process would include the return of backwash water to main process
clarifiers and the transfer of sludge from the clarifiers to a single polymer sedimentation
thickener and centrifuge. The disinfection process would be based on breakpoint
chlorination.
2.2.5 Treated Water Pumping Station and Transmission Main
Treated water will be pumped from the treated water tank of 4000 m3 capacity, located at
WTP, to a Master Balancing reservoir (MBR) at Neripperichal through a 54 km long
transmission main. One booster pumping station is planned en-route at Erukattuvalasu
(about 14 km from WTP). The transmission main would be 1400mm diameter up to km-
49 and 1200mm diameter beyond km-49
2.2.6 En-route supply
Four tapping points with meters and flow regulation valves would be provided on
transmission main at convenient locations to supply bulk water to enroute villages with
maximum allocated quantity as per details furnished below:
Kanjikoil Union                :    2.7 Mld
Perundurai & Chennimalai       :     8.4 Mld

Environment and Social Assessment Report
Tirmpur Area Development Project                          Project Description
2.2.7 Master Balancing Reservoir (MBR)
The MBR would be constructed in RCC of capacity 23 million liters, which is equivalent
to about three hour's storage. The water supply pumping station would pump the water to
the distribution system from MBR with desired pressure in the supply main.
2.2.8 Feeder Mains
It is proposed to supply water to various areas through 3 Feeder Mains (FM) of Cast Iron
material. The FM-I (about 18.65 km long) will supply water to TM. The FM-II (about
40.42 km long) will supply water to I town panchayats and 9 village panchayats including
industries. The FM-III (about 36.73 km long) will supply water to I town panchayat, 5
village panchayats and SIDCO township at Mudalipalayam. The FM-I, FM-II and FM-III
are proposed to feed 9, 17 and 9 water distribution stations respectively.
2.2.9 Water Distribution Stations (WDS)
The WDS would consist of a ground level storage tank to receive the water from the
feeder main, an elevated service reservoir and a pumping station to lift the water from the
ground level storage tank to elevated service reservoir.
2.2.10 Local Water Distribution Station outside TM
Treated water would be distributed by gravity from the water distribution stations to
individual bulk consumers through a local distribution system. The minimum pipe size in
the local distribution system would be lOOmm. The length of a new water distribution
system in TLPA area would be 120 km. Bulk consumers would be provided with
individual consumer connections with bulk meters. Suitable tap off points and flow
regulating valves would be provided for supplying bulk water to the adjoining Panchayats.
The concerned State agency would implement the water distribution scheme for each
adjoining Panchayats and connect to NTADCL's local distribution system
2.2.11 Water Distribution System within TM
Treated water will be supplied to individual domestic and industrial consumers within TM
from the Water Distribution Station through a local distribution system by gravity. The
pipe material for the distribution system would be Cast Iron, HDPE and PVC. The existing
local distribution system would be integrated with the new local distribution system.
Existing consumer connections on the old system would be transferred to the new
pipelines wherever required. TM would be responsible for providing new consumer

distribution system in TM area is 137 km and the length of additional pipelines would be
227 km.
2.3   Sewerage System
Domestic wastewater from individual properties would be collected through a sewage
collection system and conveyed by gravity to five sewage pumping stations, from where
sewage would be pumped to two sewage treatment plants outside the east and west
boundaries of TM. Treated wastewater would be disposed off in adjacent surface water
channels. Industries within TM would not be connected to the sewage collection system
proposed under this Project. A line diagram of the domestic wastewater system is attached
as Figure 2.2.
2.3.1 Sewers
Gravity RCC sewers would be provided to collect domestic wastewater from Tirupur
Municipal area. The sewers would have diameters varying from minimum 150 mm to
maximum 800 mm with a total length of approximately 288-km. Average depth of
excavation is expected to be3-4 m
2.3.2 Sewage Pumping Stations
To facilitate gravity collection of domestic wastewater, the sewage collection system is
organized into five zones. Sewage from each individual zone would be collected at a
Sewage Pumping Station (SPS). Sewage collected from Zone 1 at SPS-1 (Kangeyam
Road) will be pumped to SPS-4 (at Banakarrawtherthottam) and from SPS-4 it will be
pumped to SPS-5 (at Mannarai). SPS-4 & SPS-5 will also have their own contributory
area from the respective zones. The sewage collected from Zone 3 at SPS-3
(Murugandapuram) will also be pumped to SPS-5. The sewage from Zone 2 will be
collected at SPS-2 near Natraj Cinema. All the sewage pumping stations would be fitted
with submersible pumps
2.3.3 Sewage Treatment Plant (STP)
From SPS-5, sewage will be pumped to ST? (East) at Sarkar Periyapalayam. The sewage
collected at SPS-2 will be pumped to STP (West) at Sultanpet. Primary and secondary
treatment would be effected at both sewage treatment plants. Primary treatment comprises
of screens, flow measurement and grit removal arrangements. The secondary (biological)
treatment comprises of extended aeration process. The sludge would be disposed off after
thickening and dewatering in sludge drying beds. The treated effluent from Sarkar
Periyapalayam ST? will be discharged to the river Nallar and that from Sultanpet STP to
River Noyyal.

CHAPTER 3
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
3.1   Preamble
The program for conducting baseline environmental studies was designed after a detailed
screening and scoping exercise that comprised visits to all proposed sites of the project
components. This helped to identify the critical environmental components, which are
likely to be impacted by the project activities. Hence, the focus of baseline studies was on
monitoring of surface and ground water bodies. In this study, both primary and secondary
data sources were used to understand the baseline environmental conditions.
3.2   Surface Water Quality
3.2.1 Cauvery and Bhavani Rivers
The surface water quality information was collected for the following four locations, using
secondary data.
(a)   The present municipal water supply source on river Bhavani at Mettupalayam
(b)   Bhavani at Savandapur, located 6 km above influence point,
(c)   Cauvery at Urachikottai, this point is approximately 6 km above confluence point
(d)   Cauvery at Kodumudi, 9 km below confluence point
The secondary data on surface water quality in River Bhavani/ Cauvery upstream and
downstream of the proposed headwork site, obtained from Central Water Commission in
Coimbatore, is presented in Annex 3-A to 3-C. The data shows that the values for pH,
conductivity, hardness, nitrate., chloride and sulfate are within the permissible limit for
drinking water (refer Annex 3-D for drinking water quality standards). The temperature of
the river water was in the range 25.3-32.8C. The BOD values were in the range of 0.2-2.2
mg/I. The dissolved oxygen content of the river water varied from 5.1 to 7.7 mg/l. The
values indicate that the river is a good drinking water source.
The present municipal water supply source for Tirupur is river Bhavani at Mettupalayam.
The water quality of this source for the period Jan 1991 to Feb. 1996 was also collected
from Public Health Laboratory, Coimbatore. The data is presented in Annex 3-E.
The above data indicates that the values for pH, TDS, hardness, nitrate, chloride and sulphate
are within limits prescribed for drinking water. However, the water is colored with a high
turbidity value. Bacteriologically, the water appears to fall under Category C waters' and can

achieve the drinking water standards only after being subjected to conventional treatment
followed by disinfection.
Since the Cauvery river water is one of the main sources being considered for use as a source
of drinking water in the present project, the quality of the water at the intake-point needs to
be assessed. To deternine the quality of water in the Cauvery river, samples from six stations
in and around the intake point over a stretch of about 5 km were collected on three different
occasions during May-June, 1996. The samples were collected as per Standard Methods2
with due precautions taken to avoid recontamination. The samples were analyzed for relevant
physico-chemical and biological parameters.
Sampling and Analysis
A reconnaissance water quality survey was conducted on May 19, 1996. During the survey,
water samples from eight stations on Bhavani-Cauvery rivers were collected. The samples
were analyzed for physico-chemical and biological components. Based on the results, two
stations were dropped for further sampling and it was decided to collect three more batches of
samples on different occasions from the remaining six stations. Figure 3.1 indicates these
locations.

(b)   Right bank of river Bhavani above the old bridge at Bhavani on the main stream
(c)   Left bank of river Cauvery below the new bridge
(d)   Right bank of river Cauvery below the new bridge
(e)   Right bank of river Cauvery near the intake well of the TWAD Board
(f)    Right bank of river Cauvery at the intake well of Narmada process
Physico- Chemical Quality of Water
The river water samples were analyzed for turbidity, pH, alkalinity, suspended solids,
BOD, COD, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, hardness and chloride and the results are
presented in Annex 3-F. The turbidity of the water samples was less than five Normal
Turbidity Unit. Hardness values varied from 70 to 113 mg/I. Chloride and Sulphate values
were relatively low at 50 mg/l and 100 mg/l respectively. The nitrate levels were less than
15 mg/I. The BOD values ranged from 5 to 10 mg/I. The COD levels were low at 40 mg/l.
The chemical quality of the river water meets the prescribed requirement of a source for
drinking water supply after conventional treatment. The profile of the chemical quality values
of the river water samples is depicted in Figure 3.2.

To analyze the variation in water quality over the day, further data was collected in site No.2
Bhavani River near old bridge on 18.6.96. Samples were collected at four-hourly intervals
and analyzed for pH, conductivity, TDS, BOD, COD and chloride (Annex 3-G). Concurrent
flow measurements were also made that ranged from 19 to 20 m3/sec. The TDS content was
found to vary slightly between 10.30 am. and 2.30 p.m. at 300 to 220 mg/l. A slight variation
in the COD and pH was also noticed.
Bacteriological Parameters
A detailed bacteriological survey of Cauvery River at four stations covering a stretch of 10
Km around the proposed intake well was conducted during October 1996 to March 1997.
The following stations were selected.
(a)   Station I - 500-600 m downstream Urachikottai Barrage and 5 Km upstream the
confluence or 7 Km upstream the proposed intake well site along the Right Bank of
the river.
(b)   Station n - 200 m upstream the proposed intake well location, 30 m from the Right
Bank of the river.
(c)   Station Im - 200 m upstream the proposed intake well location, 50 m from the Right
Bank of the river.
(d)   Station IV - downstream Rananathapuram Pudur, which is about 5 Km downsteam,
the confluence and 3 Km from the proposed intake well site.
The results of the bacteriological analysis of water at these sites are shown in Table 3.1.

It may therefore be surmised from the results above that the water from the sources
considered is unsuitable for direct consumption, with respect to the bacteriological quality,
unless suitably treated. The TWAD Board supplies water from the same source after proper
treatment for domestic purposes. No outbreaks or epidemics have been reported so far due to
the consumption of this water. It therefore appears that after proper treatment, this water can
be used as potable water.
3.2.2 Surface water Quality - Noyyal and Nallar Rivers and S.Periyapalayam Lake
To monitor the surface water quality in TLPA, samples from eight stations (refer Figure 3.3)
were collected and analyzed for physico-chemical and bacteriological quality. The details of
the sampling sites are given below:
(a)   Nallar River near Nallathupalayam bridge
(b)   Nallar River near Pichampalayam bridge
(c)   Noyyal River near Nataraj Cinema Theatre
(d)   Chinnakarai River near Mangalam Road bridge
(e)   Odai River near Kangeyarn road bridge
(f)    Noyyal River near Kasipalayam bridge
(g)   Noyyal River near Kangeyam - Uthukuli road bridge
(h)   Sarkar Periyapalayam Lake
Physico- Chenucal Quali1y of Water
The results of the analysis of the physico-chemical quality parameters are presented in Annex
3-H. The TDS levels were high ranging from 5000 - 7000 mg/l; chloride values were also
high ranging from 2500 - 3500 mg/l. The COD and BOD values were high ranging from
360-800 mg/I and 35-100 mg/l respectively. The COD, BOD ratio is about 10. These
observations suggest that these two rivers function mainly to convey wastewater.
To assess the water quality profile of the discharge into the Sarkar Periyapalayam Lake, four-
hourly water samples were also collected for deternining pH, TDS, BOD, COD and chloride
at Nallathupalayam. Concurrent flow measurement was also made. The results are furmished
in Annex 3-I. The COD levels ranged from 200-470 mg/l, BOD from 16-30 mg/l, while TDS
and chloride levels were of the order of 6570 mg/l and 3000 mg/l respectively. The flow rate
was about 0.02 m3/sec.
The water quality at Sarkar Periyapalayam Lake was quite similar to those in the river
courses. This is presumably due to the fact that the lake receives its flow from the Nallar
River.

for total Coliforms, fecal Coliforms, E. coli and S fecalis showed levels ranging from 17,000
- 1,30,000/100 ml, 2,000 - 13,000/100 ml, 2,000 - 13,000/100 mnl and 5 - 13/100 ml,
respectively. The sample collected at Sarkar Periyapalayam Lake, where the Nallar River
joins it, was found to be heavily polluted and accounted for fecal contamination.
The water sample of Sarkar Periyapalayam lake also supported rich phytoplankton
population of which Ankistrodesmus falcatus, Chlamydomonas sp., Chlorella pyrenoidosa,
Cosmarium sp., Scenedesmus armatus, S. bijugatus, S. quadricauda Euglena pisciformis,
Fragilaria sp., Navicula cryptocephaIa, Navicula sp., Nitzschia palea, Synedra sp.,
Anabaena sp., Merismopedia sp., Microcystis aeruginosa and Oscillatoria limosa were found
commonly. The presence of some of these phytoplankton and algae is indicative of polluted
waters.
3.3    Ground Water Quality in and around Tirupur
Past data on the chemical quality of ground water in Tirupur was collected from Public
Health Laboratory (PHL), Coimbatore and Public Works Department (PWD) for the period
January 1990 - Febrary 1996 for the following stations.
(a)   Tirupur market and Taluk office area;
(b)   Present municipal supply source at Koilvazhi;
(c)   13 local wells.
The ground water quality of wells in market and Taluk office areas in Tirupur collected for
the period January 1990- August 1994 is presented in Annex 3-K. The values of TDS,
hardness, chloride and nitrate exceed the pernissible limits for samples collected in
market area and the values show an increasing trend. The water quality in taluk office area
also exceeded the limits for drinking purpose with high values of TDS, hardness, nitrate
and sulphate.

Environment and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                            Environmental Settings
The present ground water source for TM supply is Koilvazhi bore well. The quality of this
source for the period May 1991 to Februar 1996 is given in Annex 3-L. Data on ground
water quality of 13 local wells in various parts of Tirupur area are presented in Annex 3-M.
The values for pH chloride, nitrate, fluoride and iron are within acceptable limits3. Though
the TDS and hardness values exceed the acceptable limits of 500 and 200 mg/l it is still
within the tolerable limit4 of 1500 and 600 mg/l respectively.
As seen from Annex 3-M, the turbidity of water samnples ranged between I and 40 NTU with
eight samples exceeding the permissible limit of 2.5 NTU and one samnple having a value of
40 NTU. Three sources had color. The TDS of water samples ranged from 1956 to 6750
mg/I.
Out of 13 sources collected, 7 had TDS levels exceeding the permissible limits of 500 mg/I.
Out of these; four samples had values above 1500 mg/I. The number of samples with
hardness exceeding the acceptable limit of 200 mg/I was 10. Out of these ten samples, three
had values of 600-mg/I. Similarly chloride in seven sources exceeded the permissible limit of
200 mg/I, with three sources having chloride concentration above 1000 mg/I.
To assess the ground water quality in Tirupur master plan area and its suburbs, samples were
collected from 56 locations consisting of 21 bore wells and 35 dug wells, for chemical
analysis. Eleven ground water samples were analyzed for bacteriological parameters. The
sampling location details are provided in Annex 3-N.
Physico- ChemicalAnalysis
The water samples were analyzed for physico-chemical parameters on two different
occasions with a gap of six weeks and the results are presented in Annex 3-0 and 3-P.
The TDS values ranged from 465 to 10,400 mg/l (refer Figure 3.4). Generally, high TDS
values were observed in dug wells near the rivers, which normally receive effluents from
the dyeing units. The TDS values in dug wells close to the course of Noyyal River up to
the Chennimalai Reservoir were relatively high at 6000 mg/I. Chloride levels were in the
range of 70 to 4500 mg/I.
Dug wells close to the course of Noyyal River in the lower stretches up to Chennimalai
reservoir had high levels of chloride at 2500-4000 mg/I. Hardness values were in the
range of 90-1750 mg/I. Generally wells close to the course of Noyyal River in the lower
stretches up to the Chennimalai reservoir had high hardness at 500-1000 mg/I.
Nitrate values ranged from 0 to 185 mg/I; majority of the wells had about 100 mg/l. Fluoride
values ranged from 0.2 to 1.6 mg/I; majority of the wells had about 0.5 mg/I.

Sulphate levels ranged from 30 to 850 mg/l. Wells close to the course of Noyyal river in the
lower stretches up to the Chennimalai reservoir had generally high values at 230 - 600 mg/i.
The five dug wells close to river Noyyal and Nallar wells had high colors. The absorbance
values were of the order of 0.04 - 0.4 absorbance units (Annex 3-Q). The same wells also
showed high TDS (refer Annex 3-P) indicating that they are polluted by wastewater
discharged from the dyeing industry into them.
A review of the past records, and the results of the analysis of primary data described above
indicate that the ground water quality in Tirupur is severely impaired.
Bacteriological Parameters
Eleven ground water samples collected from the area were analyzed for bacteriological
components (Annex 3-R). Among the 11 stations from which samples were collected,
except the sample at station 25, remaining stations were found to have poor bacteriological
quality (Total Coliforms ranging from 41 to 33 x 103 MPN/ 100 ml). Generally, the dug
well water samples were more polluted compared to bore well water samples. Shallow
bore well waters accounted for higher bacterial concentration than the deep bore wells. In
summary, the ground waters from both dug and bore wells in Tirupur and suburbs are
polluted.
3.4   Ecological Assessment
The project area is characterized by undulating rocky zones. The terrestrial ecology of the
area is suggestive of dry-deciduous or semi-dry-deciduous and thomy dry land conditions.
The major aquatic component of the project area represented by the River Cauvery is rich in
floral and faunal diversity.
The secondary data on avian fauna in the project area was collected from the following
sources:
(a)    Salim Ali Center for Omithology and Natural History, Kalampalayam P.O
(b)   Institute of Nature Studies, Erode
There is a diversity of residential and migratory birds in the study area. About 128 species of
birds belonging to 43 families have been recorded in the area.
The rapid floral and faunal survey was carried out at the following sites:

At all the study sites cast-net (mesh size: I cm) was used to catch the aquatic animals. After
each cast the number and species composition of macro aquatic animals caught were
recorded. The animals were put back into the watercourse after recording the observations. At
each sampling site the net was cast at least 5 times. Major shoreline species sighted at
sampling sites were noted and recorded. At each sampling site approximately 20-sqm area
abutting the water line was covered. Strip - count method was followed to study the fauna in
the clear water transmission corridor. At regular intervals of 5 Km a sample stretch of 100
m x 10 m was demarcated and the major faunal species, if any, in the area were enlisted.
3.4.1 Aquatic Flora and Fauna
Aquatic: Cauvery River System
Macro faunal composition in the Cauvery river system at confluence zone of River
Cauvery and River Bhavani, stretch between confluence point and Cauvery Bridge, water
intake area is presented in Annex 3-S.
From the data it is evident that the systern supports a rich variety of aquatic life. The range of
fauna recorded includes the benthic, column and surface feeders. Representatives from all
major invertebrate phyla and chordate classes were recorded during the survey. The dominant
fish fauna included the following. Catla catlt, Tilapia mossambica, Puntius malus, Anabas
scandens and Labeo calbasu. The major crustean recorded during the survey was
Macrobrachium sp. The dominant molluscan fauna included Melania sp. and Carbicula
striatella.

Aquatic: Noyyal and Nallar rivers
Survey for macro aquatic fauna was carried out at 20 stations in Noyyal and 10 stations in
Nallar rivers. No fish / prawn life was evident in both these watercourses. In fact, in several
stretches the water almost remained stagnant. In some places a few molluscan shells and
aquatic insects were observed. In their present condition these two rivers carry effluents from
bleaching and dyeing units located in Tirupur.
3.4.2 Terrestrial Flora and Fauna
The water intake area is rich in vegetation and approximately 36 varieties of plants
comprising herbs, shrubs and trees are present here. The canopy of the region is formed by
trees of the genera Cocos, Areca, Mangifera, Ficus etc. There are nearly 17 varieties of
plants, which are economically valuable in terms of their medicinal and food values. Areca
nut trees form the largest number in the area, approximately 85, followed by 25 Coconut
trees, 20 Neem trees, 15 Jackfruit trees, 8 Guava trees, 8 Palm trees, 5 Mango trees and 2
Fig trees. Penniserum typhoides (americanum) and some grass varieties such as Scirpus
sp. are also found.
Some of the plants of medicinal value include Acalypha indica and P.amarus. Others
which are known for their economic value are Azadirachta indica, Ficus recemosa,
Artocarpus heterophullus Musa sapientum, Saccharum  officinarum, Cucurbita peop,
Oxalis carniculata Areca catechu, Pongamia pinnata, Physalis minina, Scirpus sp. and
Pennisetum typhoides.
The proposed clear water transmission corridor is characterized by the presence of a variety
of economically important trees along the sides. Among these, about 260 are Azadirachta
indica which is known for its medicinal value.
Tamarindus indicus, another economically useful tree is the dominant species in the corridor.
There are about 800 trees on the stretch up to Perumanalor. Each tree is known to produce
about 100 to 150 kg of pods every year fetching Rs.500 to 1000/tree to the Government.
Acacia nylotica is known for its tannin yielding bark. Besides,.there are a few mango,
gulmohr and fig trees all along the stretch.
Sites of booster pumping stations, raw water treatment plant and the sewerage pumping
station at Kuttai are marked by scrub vegetation represented by Prosopis specigera.

CHAPTER 4
ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
4.1   Preamble
Analysis of alternatives is an essential step towards development of environmentally sound
and socially acceptable project design.
In this project, the alternatives were examined at two levels viz.
(a)    Strategic, encompassing the project components
(b)   Project specific, which consider issues related to siting, routing etc.
The strategic level altemative for the project pertains to the selection of the water source for
the project and evaluates the alternatives based on their reliability and water quality. The
project specific alternatives consider the environmental and social impacts of siting the
project components and routing of the water transmission lines and identifies the alternatives
which are environmentally and socially most acceptable.
The technical detailing of the project, in terms of finalization of sites for project components,
have been done concurrent to evaluation of environmental and social impacts. The approach
for selecting the alternatives, therefore, has been to examine the initial proposed scheme and
seek alternatives for those components that give rise to significant environmental or social
risks.
4.2   Identification of Strategic Alternatives for Source of Water Supply
Alternatives for the source of water included the following:
(a)    Surface water options
* River Noyyal
* River Bhavani.
* River Cauvery
(b)   Groundwater options
4-1

Tirupur Area Development Project                              Analss of Alternatives
4.2.1 Analysis of Alternatives for Source of Water
Amongst the surface water options of abstraction from rivers Noyyal, Bhavani and
Cauvery, river Noyyal is not a perennial river and has water for only about three to four
months a year. For the rest of the year, it serves as a drainage channel for sewage and
industrial effluent. Currently since the sewage and industrial effluents are not treated, the
quality of water in the river is very poor and not suitable as a source of water.
River Bhavani has been presently utilized as a source for the first and second water supply
schemes for Tirupur. Besides, river Bhavani also serves four adjoining town panchayats
and several rural panchayats. Discussions with State irrigation department confim that the
Bhavani River System is designed for full utilization. Based on above, river Bhavani may
not serve as a dependable source of water considering the projected water demand at
Tirupur.
Ground water available in the area does not meet the requirements of the project, both in
terms of both quality and quantity. The quality related data presented in Annex 3-K clearly
shows a steady increase in the level of average TDS concentrations. Data on the fluctuations
in the water table in Tirupur taluk are presented in Table 4.1. Table 4.2 summarizes the
ground water potential in Tirupur.

The data presented in Table 4.1 indicates a significant decline of about 9 meters in the water
table, over the last decade.
Also the data shown in Table 4.2 on ground water potential indicates over-ufilization of the
groundwater in the taluk. Groundwater as a source of water for Tirupur is therefore not
feasible.

In view of the above, the water supply requirement of TLPA is best served by the river
Cauvery which is a perennial river. The Mean Annual Run-off (MAR) from the entire
Cauvery basin is 20.7 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) from a study of 38-year record. The
utilizable flow is 19 BCM, i.e., 92% of the Mean Annual Flow (MAF). Further, according
to the decision of the Water Allocation Committee of GoTN, abstraction of 185 MLD of
water from river Cauvery will be permitted for the TADP. Hence, Cauvery River is
considered as the most feasible and reliable source of water amongst other possible water
source options.
4.3 Analysis of Alternatives for Siting the Project Components and Routing
During the project development, there has been a continuous effort to integrate the
findings of ESA with the technical considerations in siting of project components to
minimize the negative environmental and social impacts. Whenever, negative
environmental and social issues for a project component were observed to be significant,
alternate location for its siting were examined.
The findings of ESA indicated that the siting and routing of the project components did
not have any significant negative environmental impacts that entailed selection of
alternatives. The details of these investigations are presented in Chapter 5.
However, some of the project sites gave rise to moderate to significant negative social
impacts. Due to the very nature of a water supply and wastewater management, the
alternatives for siting the project components are limited to alternative locations within a
short distance of the originally selected sites. Notwithstanding this constraint, the ESA
considerations resulted in modifications for those project components that had moderate to
significant associated social risks. The outcome of selection of alternatives for project
components, influenced by the social considerations, is listed in Table 4.3. It is observed
that all major social impacts were effectively addressed by siting and routing

CHAPTER 5
PREDICTION AND ASSESSMENT OF IMPACTS
This chapter focuses on the prediction and assessment of impacts on the various
environmental components due to the project activities. The exercise of prediction and
assessment of impacts is then used to formulate and implement the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) during and after the implementation of the project.
The environmental impacts have been identified for the following stages of the project:
* Pre-construction phase
* Construction phase
* Operation phase
5.1   Pre-construction Phase Impacts
During the pre-construction phase, in addition to land acquisition, land clearance and site
preparation for the proposed facilities are the main activities. Most prominent of these
impacts are social impacts related to acquisition of lands and private properties and are
covered under separate sections (chapters 8-9) of the report. The imnpacts of site clearance and
preparation are in the formn of impacts on vegetation, community severance and generation of
noise and dust The magnitude of these impacts are site specific and depend on the exiting
environmental conditions and the location of sensitive receptors with respect to the project
sites
5.1.1 Impact on vegetation
Most of the project sites of TADP are to be located in banren areas where site clearance does
not have any impact on local vegetation. Only at the water intake site which is proposed to be
located downstream of the confluence of the river Bhavani and Cauveri, raw water main, and
the water transmission line along NH47, will require felling of some trees and shrubs for
locating the project facilities. However, based on the existing information, apparently no tree
felling is required at the site proposed for Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) and Sewage
Pumping Stations (SPS).
With respect to water intake facility, total area required is limited to 0.316 ha. Out of this area
0.256 ha is covered under paddy crop and the tree cover, comprising prominently bettle-nut,
guava, coconut and a few mango trees, is limited to 0.06 ha. The construction of intake well
will require felling of about 20-30 trees. Considering a moderately dense belt of vegetation
all along the banks of river Cauveri in the vicinity of the project area, this tree felling will



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                            Assessment of Impacts
constitute a marginal impact on the enviromnent. It is, however, desirable that the impact is
fully mitigated by compensatory plantation of trees.
At the remaining two sites, the vegetation clearance is considerably less than water intake
site due to low existing vegetation density and the impact on the environment is negligible.
Some clearing of vegetation (felling of a few trees) may also be required along the route of
the clear water transmission line along the NH-47. These impacts, however, are low and
can be further minimized by minor adjustments in pipeline alignment.
5.1.2 Noise and Dust
The project sites can be categorized as sites within TM and outside TM area. The sites, which
are within TM, have been originally earnarked for developing municipal facilities and are
ready for construction. These sites do not require site clearance.
The sites located outside TM require certain degree of leveling etc as pre-construction
activities. These sites are however are located away from habitation and therefore the pre-
construction activities do not have any significant impacts in terms of noise and dust
pollution
5.1.3 Other Impacts
The project sites for water treatment plant, STP and MBR are the only large sites where
severance related issues may be of significance. However, no cart tracks or foot-trails have
been observed at the sites for water treatment plant and the STP.
Amongst the project sites, the site for MBR is the only site that is close to agricultural lands
and habitation. Further, there only a few hutment and houses near to this area. Since the area
of this site is limited to only 4 ha (about 200m x 200m), and that the neighboring areas are
sparsely inhabited, development of this site does not involve any significant severance related
issues.
5.2    Construction phase Impacts
5.2.1 Impact on Air quality
(a)   Impact due to transport of construction material
The construction materials required for the project are presented in Table 5.1. It is observed
that during most of the construction period, on an average the vehicular movement will be
about 20 truck loads per day distributed over a number of roads with a peak of 60 trucks

Tirupur Area Developmen Project                           Assessment of Impacts
(Table 5.2). This will lead to only a marginal increase in dust and air pollutants like NOX,
Pb, SO, SPM and CO due to transportation of construction materials in the project area.
Further, movement of trucks are not expected to cause a significant rise in existing traffic
on any of the haul routes passing through the inhabited areas

(a)   Impact due to construction activities
It is estimated that the fuel consumption for various construction machinery will not
exceed 1000 liters/day during the peak construction period at any of the major
construction site. The air quality impacts due to combustion of diesel at such quantities is
not expected to lead to any significant impacts on the air quality of the neighborhood.
Further, all the major construction sites are located in sparsely inhabited areas.

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                             Assessment of Impacts
(b)   Impact due to traffic diversion
Traffic diversion will need to be done during construction activities mainly during
construction of water distribution system and sewerage system. Traffic diversion will lead to
congestion of main roads. It is expected that due to closer of selected sections, the traffic on
alternate routes will increase by 1.5 to 2 times. The average speed of traffic thus is expected
to reduce from present 30 km/hr to about 15-20 km/hr. The changes in traffic flow will thus
give rise to increased air pollution In addition, at the intersections there could be more of
idling emissions. These impacts will however is short term and limited to the traffic diversion
period.
5.2.2 Noise Impacts
(a)   Noise impacts on residents of TM area
The major sources of noise pollution are vehicles transporting the construction material to the
various sites and noise generating activities at construction sites.
Minor short-term impacts are envisaged at Avinashi road, Bharatiya complex, Rayapuram,
Puchchkadu, Dharampuram road, Peripchipalayar, Thennampalayam and Vinbaji nagar
sites where service reservoirs are proposed. Moderate, short-term impacts are expected at
Erukattavalasu where booster-pumping station is located and Neripperichal where master
balancing reservoir is located. Additionally, during construction of all the sewage pumping
stations, STP and sewer lines there will be moderate increase in the noise levels. Minor
short- term noise impacts are envisaged at the construction sites for low cost sanitation
facilities.
Concreting, mixing and material movement are the primary noise generating activities at the
site and would have impacts in populated areas.
(b)   Noise imRacts on construction workers
Equivalent sound level averaged over 8 hours, (Lcq (8hr)), is used to describe exposure of
noise in work places. The damage risk criteria for hearing, as enforced by OSHA
(Occupational Safety and Health Administration, USA) and other organizations to reduce
hearing loss, stipulates that noise levels up to 90 dBA are acceptable for eight hours
exposure (Lq (sh,)) per day. Whereas ACGIH (American Conference of Govermment
Industrial Hygienists) proposed an (Lcq (ghr)) limit of 85 dBA. Exposure to impulses or
impact noise should not exceed 140 dBA (Peak acoustic pressure). Exposure to 10,000
impulses of 120 dBA is permissible per day.
5-4



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                           Assessment of Impacts
The Director General of Mines Safety in his circular No. DG (Tech)/18 of 1975 has
prescribed the noise level in mining occupations (TLV) for workers, in an 8 hour shift
period with unprotected ear as 90 dBA or less. Although, some construction activities are
likely to exceed the limit, they are not expected to produce sound levels above 90 dBA for
more than 2-5 hours per shift reducing (Leq (8h,)) to be well within the limits.
Heavy machinery drivers and personnel working very near to generator sets are likely to get
exposed to higher levels than the prescribed limits if the exposure is continuous and should
therefore be provided with protective gear. Noise level due to various construction
machinery is presented in Table 5.3.
Table 5.3 Noise level of construction machinery

5.2.3 Other Impacts
(a)   Water Oualitv Impacts
The only construction occurring near the river is the intake well. This is not likely to cause
any adverse impact provided good engineering practices are followed.
(b)   Imnact due to Labor Camps
Impacts due to the labor camps and migrant labor, if used, entail stress on local utilities
and services such as water supply, sanitation etc. Induced impacts due to migrant labor
may be in the form of stress on the local resources such as water supply and sanitation.
Approximate number of construction workers involved in the project will be 112.
Assuming four members per family, the total number of persons will be around 450.
Camps for migrant laborers are proposed to be established in uninhibited area. Therefore,
the impact due to labor camps and migrant laborers will be minor.

5.3   Operation Phase Impacts
There are very few adverse impacts of the project in the operational phase. The infrastructure
improvement due to this project will lead to improved water supply and sanitation as
mentioned earlier.
5.3.1 Noise Pollution
The various sources of noise during the operation of the project are given in Table 5.4.

The sound pressure level generated by a noise source decreases with increasing distance from
the source due to wave divergence. Noise levels at various distances from the point source,
assuming there is no sound attenuation and that noise is hemispherically propagated, can be
calculated using the following-formula.
Lp = Lw -20 log r - Ae -8
where,
Lp    sound pressure level at a distance 'r' from the source,
Lw    sound pressure level at the source,
Ae   attenuation due to atmospheric effects or interaction with the objects in the
transmission path

Further, sound pressure level at various distances can be calculated using the following
formula
Lp, = Lp2 - 20 log (rI/r2) - Ael,2
where,
Lp1   sound pressure level at a distance ri from the source,
Lp2   sound pressure level at a distance r2 from the source,
Ael,2 attenuation due to atmospheric effects or interaction with the objects along the
path ri - r2.

Water Treatment plant
Plant entrance                                       54-55
5m away from the Plant entrance                      32.5

Sm away from the Plant entrance                      30.5
(Permitted noise level is 55 dBA)
These calculations indicate that the noise levels will not have any significant impacts outside
the plant premises, since even at a distance of 5 m from the plant entrance, the levels are well
below the pernitted level of 55 dBA which is prescribed for night time (Table 5.5).
5.3.2 Reduction in the downstream flow of the river
The water will be withdrawn from the river Cauvery at a rate of 2.1 m3/s. Since the flow of
the river ranges from 16.82 m3/s to 18.13 m3/s at Urachikottai and Kodumudi respectively
(refer Annex I 0-A), at 99% confidence levels, the impact of the withdrawn water on the flow
is negligible
5.3.3 Sludge generation from the water treatment plant
About 42 tons of inorganic sludge is expected to be generated every day from the WTP. As
the sludge from WTP do not contain harmful or toxic substances, its disposal does not pose
significant environmental risks. However, indiscriminate disposal of this sludge could lead to
aesthetic impairrment and poor sanitation due to unavoidable co-disposal of municipal solid
waste at these sites.

5.3.4 Sludge generation from sewage treatment plant
The proposed STP are of the conventional type and would adopt biological treatment to
meet the effluent disposal standards prescribed by TNPCB. The Extended Aeration
variation of Activated Sludge Process is proposed to be adopted for Tirupur for treatment
of sewage.
The quantity of sludge expected to be generated from STP(E) and ST? (W) is 11.4 tons
per day and 7.6 tons per day respectively. The volume of sludge to be taken out of the
sludge drying beds will be about 11.2 m3 and 7.6 m3 per day respectively, at STP(E) and
STP (W)
Estimated quantities of screenings from sewage from STP(E) and STP(W) are 0.45 m3/day
and 0.3m3/d respectively. About 3.0 m3 and 2.0 m3 of grit is expected to be collected per
day from STP(E) and STP(W) respectively. The grit will be washed to remove all
putrisible organic matter in the grit removal system before disposing.
Sludge, screenings and grit from STP could result in soil, surface water and ground water
contamination if disposed off indiscriminately.
5.3.5 Sludge disposal
The CETPs / IETPs are expected to generate large quantities of chemical sludge containing
spent dye stuffs and the coagulants used for effluent treatment such as alum / MSS, lime,
polyelectrolytes etc. Based on the expected industrial demand of 100 MLD, the estimate of
sludge generated at the primary sedimentation tanks of CETPs and IETPs is around 300
tons/day on dry basis. Improper management of this sludge may result in contamination of
soil, surface water and ground water.

operational phase are presented in Tables 5.6 and 5.7, respectively.

Tirupuir Area Development Project                        Assessment of Impacts
5.5   Project Benefits
(1)   TADP is the first integrated water supply project of its kind in India which
comprehensively regenerates the environment while bringing positive benefits to
the populace and commercial environment. After its implementation, the
consumers in Tirupur Municipality (TM) would have access to a reliable source of
piped drinking water as well as a sewerage system, which would have been
difficult to provide from government budgetary resources. TADP being a self-
sustaining commercial venture and is a bench marks for future projects in India for
sustainable development combined with industrialization.
(2)   Considering the present inadequacies in water supply and sewerage facilities
within the local planning area of Tirupur, implementation of TADP would,
therefore, bring about significant improvement in the environment and sanitation.
Overall socio-economic improvement would also result due to associated
development and industrialization due to reliable water supply. Several benefits
accruing directly from the project are:
(a)   Provision of reliable and adequate water supply for domestic consumption
is expected to result in improvement in ground water table of the region.
Implementation of the project would result in reduced abstraction from
ground water sources and regulation of ground water utilization for
industrial purposes.
(b)   Tirupur Municipality and en-route Panchayat Unions, which currently have
an unreliable piped water supply once every alternate day for two hours @
a per capita supply of 46 lpcd, would receive an assured water supply @
140 and 70 Ipcd respectively, at a subsidized rate. This would considerably
enhance the quality of life of consumers within Tirupur and en-route
villages.
(c)   Tirupur Municipality xvould receive a comprehensive sewerage system as
part of the project. Currently, domestic wastewater. is discharged untreated
into open channels which has led to contamination of ground and surface
waters.
(d)   Betterment of health and improved community hygiene would be facilitated
through provision of low-cost sanitation facilities for slums. Presently there
are limited facilities for residents in the slum areas in Tirupur which
provide for only 8% coverage of slum population. All slums within the
municipal area have been proposed to be covered under TADP. This would

therefore improve sanitary conditions and considerably enhance aesthetic
quality of the region.
(e)   Industries within TLPA  would have access to common collection,
treatment, and disposal facilities for industrial effluents on completion of
the Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs), which are currently under
construction. Considerable quantities of effluent sludge, which would be
generated by the CETPs in Tirupur, would be treated and disposed at a
central facility to be created under TADP. This would facilitate safe and
organized management and disposal of effluent sludge in a remote area
away from Tirupur, control over localized disposal, reduced human
exposure and control over contamination by toxic substances etc.
Cumulatively, this would also enhance the quality of local environment.
(3)   TADP is expected not only to benefit the existing residents and industries of
Tirupur, but is also expected to create an economically sustainable environment for
future commercial expansion. The very existence of an efficient and assured
supply of water and offtake of fluid wastes would provide a multiplier effect to the
neighboring region, in the form of additional investments in industry and trade.
(4)   Presently, the industries use ground water having a TDS of 2000 to 4000 mg/l. After
the inception of the project, the treated water supply will have TDS concentrations
around 300 mg/l. This is expected to lead to a reduction of effluent TDS
concentration by an average of 2500 mg/I. This will intern improve the ground water
quality since substantial quantity of industrial effluent is presently contaminating the
ground water.
(5)   A large number of the social impacts are beneficial in nature and these include
improved water supply, sanitation, public health, employment opportunities and
ground water quality. This will result in enhancement of economic growth of the
region and thereby improve the quality of life. Detailed discussions on the social
impacts due to land acquisition and their mitigation are provided in chapter 9 of this
report. Table 5.8 gives the summary of positive impacts of the project.

CHAPTER 6
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
6.1 Preamble
The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) addresses the requirements for successfully
mitigating the likely adverse impacts and identifies the post project monitoring
requirements needed for the successful implementation of the suggested mitigation
measures. The institutional arrangements needed for implementing the mitigation
measures and conducting post project monitoring have been identified in the form of a
monitoring plan.
In this Chapter, the EMP for TADP is presented which maps on to the impacts identified
in Chapter 5 for the construction and operation phases of the project. Mitigation measures
are being suggested for those project activities, which have been found to have major or
moderate environmental impacts. The recommended mitigation measures are to be
implemented by the Prospective Operator (PO) and NTADCL in close coordination with
TM, Tamil Nadu PWD, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and public utility
services.
6.2   EMP for the Construction Phase Impacts
The following section recommends the measures needed to minimize and mitigate the
construction phase impacts. Detailed assessment of these impacts has been carried out in
section 5.1 and 5.2. The approach adopted has been to recommend mitigation measures of
two types,  (i) precautionary measures and (ii) compensatory measures, wherever
applicable. In most of the cases however, the recommended mitigation measure is
precautionary in nature.
6.2.1 Managing Impact on Vegetation
Clearing of vegetation, restricted to a few trees, is envisaged primarily at the site proposed
for the water intake well and raw water main at Anainasuvampalayam; water transmission
line and feeder mains.
Precautionary Measures
The precautionary measures suggested to mitigate the impacts likely due to clearing of
6-1



Environmental and Social AssessmentReport
Tirupur Area Development Project                   Environment Management Plan
vegetation during the construction phase include:
* Locating structures at all project sites (e.g., water intake site), so as to minimize felling
of trees, to the extent possible.
* Adjusting the alignment of mains and pipelines to the extent feasible so as to minimize
damage to the root systems.
It is recommended that the compensatory plantation that would require to be done by the
PO, in keeping with the mandates of the Tamil Nadu Tree Felling Act.
Compensatory Measures
It is recommended that commercially and aesthetically important plants such as Cocos
nucifera (coconut), Tamarindas indica (Tamarind), Delonix regia (Gulmohar) and
Bougainvillea be planted along the area.
In some stretches of the transmission line corridor, the sides of the highway are barren.
The aesthetic value and the biological diversity along the water transmission corridor can
be enhanced by planting trees. Trees that provide good shade and large canopy such as
Delonix regia can be planted at a distance of about 3m away from the edge of the road.
Planting of trees such as Azadirachta indica will attract nesting birds.
The barren land area at Erukattuvalasu can be made greener by planting suitable plant
species as suggested, so as to form a canopy at the site for the booster pumping station.
Species such as Bombax malabaricum and Anthocephalus kadamba can be planted.
Some notional cost estimates for landscaping at the various sites in the project area are
presented in Table 6.1.
6.2.2 Management of Noise Impacts
Following Precautionary measures are recommended for the management of noise
impacts.
* To minimize the impact, construction operations in residential and sensitive areas
should be restricted to between 7.30 a.m. and 6.00 p.m. Prior information should be
provided if the blasting is significant.

6.2.3 Managing Impacts due to Movement of Construction.Machinery
Precautionary measures, in order to avoid adverse impacts due to traffic-congestion are as
6-3



Environmental and Social AssessmentReport
Tirupur Area Development Project                     Environment Management Plan
follows.
* The most suitable route for delivery and haul equipment with due consideration for
load limits, traffic pattern, and the character of the area traversed should be selected.
* Traffic controls and diversions, marked with signs. lights and other measures (flags)
should be provided. This is necessary to minimize confusion and ensure public safety.
Police and fire departments should be informed before any route is closed. Also, routes
should not be closed until an alternate road is identified.
* The prospective operator should follow the prescribed safe, legal load limits of all
bridges and surface roads that may be traversed by the heavy equipment used at the
project sites.
6.2.4 Managing Impact on Air Pollution
Construction activities and the consequent transportation activities add to the air pollution
in the region. Impact of the air pollution will be moderate and short term at booster
pumping station, MBR, feeder mains, service reservoirs, sewage pumping stations, STPs
and while laying sewer lines.
Precautionary Measures
* It is recommended that construction equipment, machinery and diesel engines be
maintained in good condition so as to reduce emissions.
* Dust. should be controlled by sweeping and sprinkling with water. Mud should be
washed from all construction equipment and vehicles prior to hauling on roads.
* Trucks carrying dirt and sand to and from the construction site, should be covered or
wetted, in accordance with the construction specifications prescribed by the local
corporation, to minimize release of dust.
6.2.5 Managing Impact due to Labor Camps
Considering the long construction period of the project, the local and migrant laborers will
pose some stress on utility services such as water supply and sanitation.
6-4



Environmental and Social AssessmentReport
Tirupur Area Development Project                     Environment Management Plan
Precautionary Measures
* Planning of labor camps needs to done along the lines of the suggested design in Annex
6-A
* Adequate water supply, sanitary facilities and drainage in temporary colonies of the
construction workers should be provided.
Other Recommendations
In order to minimize the construction phase impacts, a few construction site practices are
being recommended.
*  Deep resurfacing scars on the pavement may cause tripping, falls, and added liability
to the authority. This should not be permitted.
*  When pipelines are laid or subsurface excavations are made in existing streets, cuts in
the paving are unavoidable. Best construction practices should be applied to ensure
that repaved trench areas, blend with the existing pavement to the extent possible.
*  Pedestrian bridges with handrails should be provided at all intersections when trenches
remain open. Steel plates over trenches should be provided at driveways and
intersections.
6.3   EMP for the Operation Phase Impacts
The mitigation measures for the various operation phase impacts identified in section 5.3
are listed below.
6.3.1 Disposal of sludge from Water Treatment Plant
It is estimated that about 42 tons/day of alum sludge (Al(OH)3), will be generated from the
WTP. It has to be ensured that this sludge is disposed off suitably.
Precautionary Measures
* Possible uses of alum sludge are,
* as a plasticizer in ceramic industry;
6-5



Environmental and SocialAssessmentReport
Tirupar Area Development Project                    Environment Management Plan
*  as constituent of high alumina refractory bricks;
* as a part of the mixer with fly-ash for road stabilization;
* as an ingredient for the preparation of building bricks;
* as soil conditioner for heavy clays and
* as fill material for low lying areas and abandoned quarries
These options should be examined and a suitable one selected for management of the
sludge by the NTADCL.
6.3.2 Sludge Generated from Sewage Treatment Plant
The sludge, screenings and grit generated from the sewage treatment plant require
adequate disposal (refer to section 5.3.4). The screening and grit can be washed and then
send to landfill for disposal. The wash-water can be treated in the sewage treatment plant
for removal of organic load. As the STPs are designed as extended aeration systems, the
sewage sludge is expected to be well stabilized and can be used as soil conditioner in areas
earmarked for greenbelt development. This sludge can also be used in the agricultural
field. However, the precautionary measures for management of sewage treatment plant
sludge are presented below.
* Land application, if considered an option, should be attempted only after analyzing the
sludge to ascertain the safety of this option from the point of view of public health.
D High ammonia concentration in the sludge might inhibit seed germination. As the
sludge is high in nitrogen, the nitrate-nitrogen is not readily retained in most soils,
crops that have a relatively high demand for nitrogen should be planted. Usually, soils
that have had prolonged application of sewage sludge will become acidic and require
periodic liming.
6.3.6 Overall environmental management plan
The environmental management plan providing the mitigation actions to be taken for each
issue together with the responsible agency for each action is presented in Table 6.2.

6.4   Environmental Monitoring
The monitoring activity in the context of the project would be at three levels:
routine monitoring of the performance of the water supply system up to the points
of bulk off-take supply to the TM will be by the PO to ensure that the system it is
being operated and maintained in conformity with the applicable water quality
standards.
II    compliance monitoring by the NTADCL to ensure that the proposed environmental
management plan is being implemented. In the event of any violation of standards
observed, it would the responsibility of the NTADCL to ensure immediate
rectification.
III    monitoring the trend in the performance of the project in terms of the services
committed by NTADCL to the beneficiaries as well as the environmental quality of
the project area.  This monitoring which would be done by NTADCL in
6-10



Environmental and Social AssessmentReport
Tiripur Area Development Project                     Environment Management Plan
consultation with the Citizens' Committee and will attempt to evaluate the extent
of benefits that the consumers have accrued from the project. Additionally, if this
monitoring reveals that any modifications are required in the project design to
maximize the benefits, NTADCL would implement them.
Monitoring at this level, would also be a form of disclosure monitoring used to keep the
beneficiaries of the project informed about its progress.
Implementation of mitigation measures may also sometimes give rise to impacts, which
will be recognized early, if rigorous monitoring is ensured. The monitoring plan should
also provide for periodic revision of the measures. The plan is described in Table 6.3 and
fully covers the monitoring requirement at level II and III defined above. It provides the
monitoring requirement for each impact/ issue identified earlier, the responsible agencies
and the estimates of the costs involved.
The estimated cost of the environmental monitoring is Rs. 2.558 Million per year during the
construction phase and Rs. 2.676 Million per year during the operation phase and has been
fully integrated in the overall financial analysis of the project
6.4.1 Infrastructure requirements
In order to implement the monitoring requirements recommended in Table 6.3 above,
certain infrastructure requirements, have been identified.
The operator should provide facilities at the WTP, STP and ETP for monitoring and
regulating performnance of these treatment facilities. In addition, provision should be made
for one centralized laboratory for sampling and analysis of all relevant parameters
including heavy metals in influents, effluents and sludge to confinm compliance with
TNPCB standards.
6.4.2 Institutional Arrangement
For the compliance and trend monitoring recommended above, NTADCL would hire the
services of a senior expert in the form of a consultant. The consultant will be on a retainer
and the responsibilities will include,
* hiring a monitoring agency to monitor the environmental quality,
* review the outputs of the monitoring agency,
* rationalize the environmental monitoring process,
* preparation, of an annual environmental and social performance report for

preparation, of an environmental and social perfornance report, to be used by
NTADCL for communicating the progress of the project to the financing
institutions providing assistance. NTADCL would provide a specific format to
the consultant for this report.
Separate citizens' committees should also be formed for monitoring of construction and
operation phases of the project. During the construction phase, both the NTADCL and the
citizens' committee should monitor the implementation of the mitigation measures
particularly for land acquisition and related compensation and air and noise pollution.
At this point, a schematic of the proposed project implementation structure, showing the
composition of the NTADCL is shown in Figure 6.1 to facilitate greater understanding of
the involvement of the various organizations in the project.
The State Department of Environment and Forests should periodically review and monitor
the project. The groundwater cell of PWD should monitor groundwater quality, levels and
trends in the project area.
Steps have to be initiated to identify and train necessary manpower required for the
operation and maintenance of the proposed, water and wastewater treatment plants. Action
has to be taken at the earliest so as to associate the identified staff right from the initial
stages of construction and commissioning of the plants.
The existing capacity of the TM may be strengthened in terms of increased and trained
manpower as well as improved inforrnation management systems especially related to
billing. This capacity building and strengthening would assist in the mitigation of the
institutional failure risks.

CHAPTER 7
SOCIAL SETTING AND LAND ACQUISITION PROCEDURE
7.1   Introduction
According to the feasibility study for TADP approximately 28 hectares of land area is
required to house the project facilities. In order to minimize the social impacts due to the
acquisition of lands, as far as possible, the facilities are sited on the government lands. The
acquisition of private lands for the project thus is limited to less that 10 hectares.
As a result of land acquisition for the project, the economic losses of Project Affected
Persons (PAPs), besides loss of lands, may include loss of house, business and access to
economic opportunities. Therefore, while implementing the project, it is necessary to
consider all disturbances and losses and their impact on the socio-economic status of the
PAPs while planning for the mitigation measures to minimize the negative/adverse impacts.
Also, the rnitigatory measures should be evolved through a participatory process with the
PAPs and the final plans should have their agreement and approval.
The main objective of the social assessment, therefore, is to assess the social impact of the
project due to acquisition of land and assets and outline a Resettlement and Rehabilitation
(R&R) measures to mitigate the negative impacts and consequent risks to the project. The
remedial measures suggested in the mitigation plan must ensure that all the PAPs have their
income levels after the project implementation improved or at least restored to the pre-
project levels.
Social assessment study for the project, therefore, aims at identifying the PAPs, analyzing
their socio-economic status, assessing losses due to project implementation and propose
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan (RAP) which ensures that PAPs do not suffer
economic losses. The environmental and social assessment study is expected to prepare a
well researched and documented environmental and social assessment report (ESAR) with
due consideration to public opinion and sensitivities. The ESAR is prepared according to the
principles and processes contained in the Environmental and Social Report (ESR) of IL&FS
and the World Bank's policies (O.D. 4.30 and 4.20).

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project         Social Setting and Land Acquisition Procedure
This chapter describes the social setting of the project and also gives the legislative and
procedural requirements on which the recommendations of the social assessment study are
based. The areas covered include:
*  information on past and projected trends of population and economic growth,
*  immigration and its impact on demographic features,
*  land use pattem,
*  land values and social attitude of people towards landholdings in the project area and
*  legislative and procedural aspects of land acquisition.
7.2   Distribution of Project Components
The TADP, primarily being a water supply project, covers all the Town and Village
Panchayats within the TLPA and the villages enroute the water transmnission line. The TLPA
consists of one urban local body - Tirupur Municipality, one Town Panchayat -
Velampalayam and three Panchayat Unions, namely - Tirupur, Avinashi and Uttukuli. The
total geographical area under TLPA is about 218.28 sq.km. The Panchayat Unions consist
of fourteen Village Panchayats each of which houses some of the project components. The
distribution of project components is presented in Table 7.1.
The project also includes laying of 1.4 km of raw water mains, 54 km of treated water
transmission mains, 97 km of feeder mains and 288 km of sewer lines.

Tirupur Area Development Project         Social Setting and Land Acquisition Procedure
7.3   Constitution of TLPA
The Tirupur Local Planning Authority for Tirupur was constituted under section 11 (1) (3) of
the Town and Country Planning Act, vide G.O. MS. NO. 1138 R.D. & L.A. Dt. 07.06.76,
with the Chairman of Tirupur Municipal Council as the Chairman and the Town Planning
Officer as the Member Secretary.
7.4   Decadal Growth of TLPA
The total population of TLPA area is 364504 as per 1991 census. Prior to 1950 Tirupur was
basically an agrarian society with its major crop being cotton with a few handlooms in and
around it. In the course of time the failure of rains and decreasing water level in Noyyal led
to lower agricultural production and people tumed their attention on knit wear
manufacturing. Sustained winds with low ambient moisture, availability of labor and
production of cloth in nearby industrial center of Coimbatore have been conducive for rapid
growth of dyeing and bleaching operations at Tirupur. Table 7.2 gives decadal population
growth of TLPA since 1951.

The occupational pattern in TLPA excluding Tirupur town also shows similar pattern.
Manufacturing sector employs the largest number of persons followed by the agricultural
sector.
7.6   Projected Occupational Pattern of TLPA - 2001
The total number of persons in the workable age group in 2001 are projected to be 3,20,000
comprising 64 per cent of the total population and will be equally divided among male and
female workers. The total workers is estimated at 208000 comprising of 144000 males and
64000 females, constituting 41.6 per cent of the projected total population of 5.00 lakhs and
65 percent of the population in the working age group. The estimated occupational pattern of
TLPA in 2001 is presented in Table 7.5.

7.7   Social Amenities
7.7.1 Water Supply
Tirupur town is served by a system of two protected water supply schemes using Bhavani
river near Mettupalayam as the source. The system also serves the needs of the wayside
villages and the net quantity released at Tirupur reservoir is about 33 MLD with a per capita
consumption of 46 litres.
The water supply is through house connections in well-developed localities and through
public standposts in slums and under-developed areas. In addition there are connections for

wells located in various parts of the town through lorries to unserved and high level areas of
the town.
7.7.2 Drainage and Sewerage
There is no underground drainage system in this town at present and only open drains are
available. The total length of drains is 80 km. out of the total length of roads about 110 km.
The sullage water flows from the drains are discharged into the Noyyal river. *** Most of the
houses have only dry type latrines and some have septic-tanks. The rubbish taken out of
drains is collected in dustbins and removed by carts and trucks to the compost yard situated
on the southern outskirts of the town.

7.8    Land Use Pattern of TLPA
TIhe industrial development has occurred mainly along the railway line, the Noyyal river and
important roads viz., Avanashi road, Palladam road and Perumanallur road. A major part of
the residential development has occurred on the northern side of the railway line and Noyyal
river. The residential development accounts for 72 per cent of the developed area.
The Commercial part of the town is mainly concentrated around the Municipal Office.
However, in the older part of the town i.e. in the southern side of the Noyyal river, some
parts of the residential have been invaded by commercial development. The wholesale and
retail warehousing activities are more around the present Bus-stand which lies on the
meeting point of Dharapuram road, Kangeyam and Palladam Roads. There is a Cotton
Market nearby the Bus-stand. Retail commercial outlets are distributed along the important
roads of the town and Commercial uses occupy 6.00 per cent of the developed area. The
existing land use pattern is presented in Table 7.8.

7.9   Proposed Land Use Pattern
The TLPA master plan describes a proposed land use of TLPA by 2001 AD. About 31 per
cent is set apart for residential activity and 55.52 per cent for agricultural activity. About 8.5 per
cent is intended for industrial activity.The detailed proposed land use pattern is presented in
Table 7.9.

Total                             21828.00
7.9.1 Residential use
The spatial requirements for residential use in the year 2001 for the TLPA have been
assessed on the basis of 75 persons per hectare. The residential area requirement will be
6673.00 ha for the projected population of 5.00 lakh in 2001. It includes the land required
for local roads and streets, local shopping centre, primary schools, open space etc. The
residential area has been divided into primary residential zones and mixed residential zones.
7.9.2 Commercial Use
The commercial use include all commercial and business use, financial institutions, cinema
theatre, and other conmmercial entertainment centres, warehouses and automobile repair
shops etc. The space need at the commercial use in the TLPA for the year 2001 will be about
418 hectares.
7.9.3 Industrial Use
The total estimated working force in the Planning area by the year 2001 is expected to be
208,000. Further division of this working force among service industries, light industries and
heavy industries is expected to be in the ratio of 4:3:2 viz. 92,445 in service industries 69,330
in light industries and 46,225 in heavy industries. The area requirement for different
categories of industries and the planning norms used are presented in Table 7.10.

Total                                              1837 hectares.
Thus the total area under industrial use in the year 2001 is expected to be 1837 hectares.
The occupational pattem of the Tirupur town shows major contribution to the work force of
the knit wear industry which accounts for 80 per cent of Indian cotton knitted garments
(Hosiery). There are about 2500 Hosiery units and 500 processing outs employing over
2,00,000 workers. The export accounted for Rs. 1150 crores in 1991. It has also recorded a
major foreign earning in the country contributing 2.7 per cent of country's exports in 1991
with growth potential of 23 per cent per annum.
The TLPA has regulated the land use dividing it into a number of zones. Exemption needs to
the obtained from the Government and/or Director of Town & Country Planning, as the case
may be, in case any deviation is to be made against this regulation.
7.9.4 Land Values and Ownership
Nearly 90 per cent of the lands in the TLPA are privately owned while the municipal and
government lands account for 2.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. The land value
within the town fluctuates according to its usage and location. Due to an increased demand
of land for industrial and commercial activities an appreciation in land value has occurred.
For example, the value of land along the Avinashi road is around Rs.720/- per Sq.ft. (Town
S.F.No.39/7/K) or Rs.3 crores per acre at one of the proposed Service Reservoir site. The
land values in the outskirts of TLPA are in the range of Rs. 20-25 lakhs per hectare. The
land values in the areas near Bhavani at the site for intake well and water treatment plant are
about Rs. 15 lakhs per hectare.
However, the registered price of land in the area which normally form the basis of
calculating the market value by the revenue department during the land acquisition, are many
times lower the market price. Although, the registered value of land vary for different
transactions, the average value in the project at the time of social assessment (1996) was
7-10



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project            Social Setting and Land Acquisition Procedure
estimated to be R. 2.8 lakhs per hectare. It is thus seen that the market value for the lands is
up to 5 to 10 times of the guideline value of the Registration department.
7.9.5 Social Attitude towards Possession of Land
Due to the vast difference between the guideline value and the actual market price of the
lands, the general tendency among the landowners is to go to court to get a stay order, the
moment the owner of private land or an encroacher/occupier of government poromboke'
lands comes to know about the probable eviction or acquisition. Similarly there is a tendency
of demanding a high rate of compensation based on the market price of the piece of land to
be acquired for any government/public purpose.
In general, the people living in Tirupur and nearby villages where the components are
designed were found to be more attached to whatever little piece of land they owned,
occupied or encroached. In some areas they have been living in poromboke lands for more
than 15-20 years and have electricity, water supply and road facilities but with only 'B'
memos' issued by the Revenue Authorities.
Since they have been living in their respective places for more than 15-20 years they have
established a cultural bond with surrounding areas, besides a trader customer linkage.
7.10 Land and Property Acquisition Procedures
Procedure for Land Acquisition
The Land Acquisition Act (1 894) amended in 1984 as a National Act extends to the whole of
India except for the State of Jammu & Kashmir. This Act empowers any State Government
to acquire compulsorily any land (not owned by it) which is required for a public purpose. In
the present case the land is required for the TADP. The provisions of the Act focus on the
procedures of acquisition and payment of compensation for land and other immovable
properties.
Prior to initiating any land acquisition, an officer (mostly from revenue department) is
I The lands belonging to Government are classified as Poromboke lands. Government can consider allotment
of these lands as per certain norms for Schedule Castes I Tribes.
2 'B' Memo :This is notice served on the encroacher of a government land. This indicates that he would be
evicted at any time without prior notice. A penal tax is also levied on the encroacher which is revisable upwards
yearly.

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project          Social Setting and Land Acquisition Procedure
designated to perforn the finctions of a Collector under this Act who receives requisition
from the concerned project authorities to acquire land for the project. In the case of TADP
the requisitioning authority is New Tirupur Area Development Corporation Limited
(NTADCL). The requisition is submitted to revenue departmnent. The requisitioning officer
submits to the Collector the details of land (called land plan schedules) to be acquired. The
details provided are the land owner's name, survey number and extent of land to be acquired.
For any land acquisition (LA), the amended LA Act of 1984 under section (u/s)- 4(1)
stipulates publication of a notification to that effect in the Official Gazette and in two daily
newspapers circulated in the locality (in which land is to be acquired) of which at least one
shall be in the regional language. In the case of TADP it should be in Tamil. Such a
notification enables the concemed LA authorities to enter upon the land, make preliminary
survey, ascertain its suitability and detemine the exact portion of the land to be acquired.
The substance of this notification is given as public notice at a convenient place in the
locality in which the land to be acquired is located. Such a notification provides an
opportunity to the parties interested in the land to file objections, if any, u/s-5A to the
proposed acquisition.
In order to proceed with the acquisition of the notified land or any portion of it, a declaration
u/s-6 of the LA Act specifies the precise boundaries of the area of the land to be taken. This
declaration is made within one year from the date of publication of the notification u/s 4(1).
Every such declaration is published in the Official Gazette, as well as in two daily
newspapers, one of which should be in the regional language. With the appearance of this
declaration as an office notification, Government issues directions to the Collector u/s-7 of
the LA Act to take order for acquisition of land.
Thereafter, section-8 of the Act requires land to be marked out, measured and planned, while
u/s-9 notices are served to concerned persons (owning land) stating the intention of the
Government to take possession of the land and that any claims for compensation should be
made to the Collector. Such notifications are given as public notices on or near the land to be
taken. Any other claimant to the property as co-proprietor, sub proprietor, mortgagees, tenant
or otherwise, u/s 10 is required to submit a statement to that effect to the Collector. Finally
the award of compensation is made by the Collector u/s- I I of the LA Act after inquiring into
objections (if any), pursuant to the notice given u/s-9 to the measurements made u/s-8 and
into the value of the land fixed as on the date of the publication of the notification for
acquisition of land uls4(1). Section 11-A of the Act stipulates that the award u/s-Il should
be made within a period of two years from the date of publication of the declaration and if no
award is made within that period, the entire proceedings for the acquisition of the land stands
lapsed.

Tirupur Area Development Project         Social Setting and Land Acquisition Procedure
Once the award is made u/s-I1, the Collector u/s-1 6 may take possession of the land which
there upon rests absolutely with the Government, free from all encumbrances. In urgent cases
when land is required on immediate basis for a public purpose, the Collector, as directed by
the Government, may take possession of land where no award has been made, on the expiry
of fifteen days from the publication of notice u/s-9(l). Such lands there upon are vested
absolutely in the Government, free from all encumbrances. However, before taking
possession of such lands, the Collector u/s-17 (3-A) is required to tender payment of 80 per
cent of the compensation for the land to the person(s) entitled.
However, any person, who does not accept the award, or accepts compensation under protest,
is required uls- 18 to apply to the Collector to refer his case to the court for its determination
with regard to the measurement of the land, amount of compensation or apportionment of
compensation among the persons interested. This has to be made within six weeks from the
date
of the Collector's award. Section- 18 to 28 detail out the procedures involved in settling the
cases referred to the court.
Section-3 1(1) of the LA Act, 1984 stipulates payment of compensation to the awarders.
However, if they do not accept the compensation or there is a dispute with regard to the title
to receive the compensation, the Collector u/s-3 1(2) is required to deposit the compensation
amount to the court.
Also, the amended LA Act, 1984 has provision for acquiring land through direct negotiation
between the project affected families and the concerned government authority. In this case,
the government authority will be the Revenue Authority.
7.11  Acquisition of Other Lands
Acquisition of government land does not involve any difficulty as LA is done by the
Government itself. For such lands no compensation is due to any body. However, requisition
is made to the concerned Department for alienation of land.
According to resettlement and rehabilitation policy of IL&FS, if there are encroachments on
such lands, they need to be provided dwelling units near the place of their livelihood.

CHAPTER 8
PROJECT AFFECTED PERSONS - IDENTIFICATION,
MINIMIZATION AND PROFILE
8.1   Introduction
All development projects, unless located in remote and thinly populated areas, involve
considerable displacement of the local population. The degree of displacement may be
much higher if the project has a semi-urban setting, as is the case with TADP. The past
experience of project implementation in India with respect to the rehabilitation of the
displaced people has not been good. Many displaced people have protested against such
projects, causing delays and cost escalation. It has been observed that in a number of
projects, no serious effort was done to assess the degree of displacement during the project
planning stage. The issues related to displacement were thus invariably underplayed till
public pressure and outcry revealed the true dimensions of the problem.
The solution to the problem of displaced persons lies in careful assessment of extent of
displacement during the initial stages of project development itself, minimizing it through
project modifications and providing adequate compensation where the displacement is
inevitable.
As per the environmental and social policy of IL&FS, as the first step towards assessment
of social impacts, a rigorous study for the identification of project affected persons in
TADP together with identification of options for minimization of negative social impacts
was attempted. This chapter describes the methodology and findings of these
considerations. The chapter begins with definitions of project affected persons and
families, describes the secondary and primary data collection effort in their physical
identification, presents their socio-economic profile and highlights the efforts undertaken
towards minimization of PAPs and their influence on the project design.
8.2   Definitions
The field survey of the project sites indicated that majority of the displaced persons are
adversely affected either due to loss of land or loss of structures like housing. In both
cases, according to entitlement framework of IL&FS social assessment policy, the families
of the displaced persons need to be treated as unit for compensation and/or resettlement
and rehabilitation.
A minority of those affected however may be categorized as project affected person where
the loss is confined to the structure for shops. In such case, only the earning member(s) of

the family is affected directly. If through compensation, the income levels are restored, the
family as such is not affected by the project.
8.2.1 Project Affected Persons
Project affected persons (PAPs) are those, who are:
* physically displaced or economically adversely affected as a result of physical
relocation and/or
* economically affected but not physically relocated and/or
* loose access to community amenities and resources due to the project.
8.2.2 Project Affected Families
Project Affected Families are all families (a family is defined as two or more or group of
persons related by birth, or marriage or adoption who reside in the same household and
share the common kitchen) that are
- physically displaced or economically adversely affected as a result of physical
relocation and/or
* economically affected but not physically relocated and/or
* loose access to community amenities and resources due to the project
8.3   Identification of PAPs at Sites for Project Components
The first step towards identification of the PAPs is to compare the Survey Field (SF)
number of plots of lands required by the project with the revenue records, which contain
the latest land ownership information. At the commencement of social assessment, the
information on project profile and project sites layout was scanned to identify the SF
numbers of plots of land required by the various project components. During the initial
stages of the social assessment, the project profile was still being firmed up. So, the
information for some of the project sites was only partially available or was under review.
The initial fieldwork, therefore, was planned as reconnaissance survey for familiarization
with the project sites and the probable social issues.
During this survey, each of the areas belonging to the project components was visited. It
was observed that most of PAPs were residing at three sites proposed for the project
namely Puluvarpatty, Thiruvalluvar Nagar and Chinnandipalayam. Minor social issues in
the form of loss of one or two houses and a few minor structures were perceived with
respect to Kanianpundi, Murugandampalayam, Pappananickenpalayam, Avaraipalayam

Pirivu, Indira Nagar, Anainasuvampalayam, Sakthi Nagar, and Kuppandapalayam,. Rests
of the sites on Municipal land were observed to be free from PAPs and consequently no
adverse social impacts were anticipated for these components. The initial estimates of
degree of impacts related to PAPs for various components of the project during the
preliminary survey are summarized in Table 8. 1.

These findings were discussed with the district authorities of Coimbatore and Periyar
District with the objective of obtaining their support for the physical verification of PAPs.
The District authorities deputed their town level revenue officials with instruction to lay
survey stones in the. project area and scan the sites for the verification of PAPs and the
status of their land ownership.
The reconnaissance survey, indicated that from the point of view of land acquisition for the project,
the site for Master Balancing Reservoir (MBR) at Puluvarpatty was the most sensitive. A socio-
economic survey was carried out among the potential PAPs in the area A census count of the
structures within the area required for the project indicated that 102 houses required demolition for
clearing the site. The results of the survey highlighted that most of the land holdings in the
area (50 per cent of total PAPs) were legal with valid titles or pattas and lived in pucca
houses with well laid road and public facilities. The community expressed deep
apprehension towards land acquisition in this area, which was also reflected, during the

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                     PAPs- Identification and Profile
visit of the survey team.
Thiruvalluvar Nagar, the proposed site for a Service Reservoir was found to be the second
most sensitive area from the point of view of land acquisition. The reservoir site at
Thiruvalluvar Nagar is located within a cluster of 150 families belonging to scheduled
castes. All of these families have occupied Government poromboke land and do not hold a
legal title to the land. These families however, have been residing on these lands for the
last 15 to 20 years and are 'B' memo holders.
The land ownership records indicated that the project site was located at survey field
No.T.S.5. With the help of local revenue official survey stones were laid demarking the
project site. The demarcation enabled exact identification of PAPs and probable loss of
their housing and associated disturbances in their area. It was observed that 20 families
required resettlement at this site.
Chinnandipalayam, the site for Sewage Treatment plant (West) was found to be the third
most critical site during the initial assessment. This site is part of lake poromboke and has
been considerably encroached in roadside. Approximately 60 encroachments were
identified within the land required for treatment plant. The encroachments at this site,
however, were of relatively recent origin of about 5 years or less.
Meanwhile, appropriate steps were taken to authenticate the records by laying survey
stones or making demarcations at all project sites. It was observed that many small huts
have developed in the project sites after the preliminary survey. Hence the District
Revenue authorities were approached for minimization of further encroachments and they
served a suitable order, which helped in controlling the further encroachments at almost all
the sites.
The aforesaid order also facilitated to seek the assistance of town and village revenue
officials not only for demarcating the sites but also settling the local issues that arose after
informal discussion with the community about the objective of the project and its demand
for the site.
8.4   Identification of PAPs along the Water Transmission Main (WTM)
The WTM that carries the treated water from WTP at Suriampalayam to MBR at
Neruparichal will mainly be laid within the right of way (ROW) of NH47 and the state
highways. The social issues due to the laying of the transmission line, therefore, will arise
only in those sections where either the ROW is significantly encroached or is too narrow
to allow passage of the pipe line. During the ESA the entire road stretch was studies

Environmental and Social Assessment RepoH
Tirupur Area Development Project                   PAPs- Identification and Profde
carefully and following road section were identified where social issues required
mitigation
(a)   Road Stretch Passing through Perundurai Town
At km 77.6-79.0, the highway passes through Perundurai, where at a narrow stretch of
about 500 m between km 78.0-79.0, the available ROW width from center of the road
including the BT and berm reduces to about 7.0m which leaves inadequate width for
digging the trench. The highway through Perundurai is a fairly busy stretch and there are
permanent shops/structures on either side at distance of about 1-5m from the BT edge.
Also, there is considerable encroachment of the free available NH land along the road
through Perundurai. At least a few permanent structure located at 1.0 m from the BT and
some temporary businesses are likely to be affected by the proposed water main
alignment. The construction will also cause significant congestion on the NH at this
stretch
(b)   WTM section along the State Hinhwav from Perumanallur iunction to MBR
At km 106 on the NH47, the WTM alignment turns right and runs along the state highway
to Tirupur till the MBR location via the Puluvapatty junction. Along this 7 km long stretch
the total available road width is limited to BT of 7.0m and berm width varying between
0.5m in considerable portion and about 1.0 m at few points. Considerable sections along
this stretch have ribbon development along the road that a number of houses and
commercial structures are located along the road.
8.5   Identification of PAPs along the Feeder Main Routes
Three feeder mains have been proposed to carry water from MBR up to the service
reservoirs within TLPA. The feeder mains are proposed to traverse along the state
highways and ring road sections within TLPA. From the MBR site, two feeder mains (FM
I and III) are proposed to be laid along the ring road on the right of the MBR upto the
Puluvapatty junction while one feeder main is proposed to be laid along the ring road on
left from the MBR. The proposed feeder mains are expected to be of 0.3-0.6 m dia, which
would entail a trench width of about 1.2-1.8 m.
The ring road has an overall width of the 4-5 m with a BT of about 2.5-3.0 m and berm of
about 0.5-1.Om. Most of the feeder mains alignment along the ring road passes through
areas where a lands adjacent to the road are not fully occupied and it is possible to lay the
pipeline without any social impacts. However, there are a few sections (total length about
8-5



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                    PAPs- Identification and Profile
1000 m) where considerable roadside development has taken place and no space is
available beyond the berm. In these sections it will be necessary to take the pipeline
behind the row of structures through the agricultural field. In this context the sections
requiring special attention are the following
*  200 m long distance in stretches close to Puluvapatty junction and on the road to
Neruperichchal village (FM III);
*  in stretches ( about 200 m) along the road to Attupalaiyam (about 10-15 structures
including one road side temple) and through Anuppapalaiyam (about 40-48 houses, 10
business establishments, 4-5 boundary walls requiring partial demolition) along Feeder
Main II route in the region from MBR and prior to crossing Avanashi road.
*  a narrow stretch of about lOOm on the ring road near Solipalaiyam (FM II) where
about 11-13 houses will be partially affected (walls will have to be demolished as
these fall within the berm and are close to the BT);
- on the route to Pudupalaiyam (about 50-lOOm overall stretch) on FM II,
*  moderate to major impacts along the stretch of ring road from Velampalaiyam to
Chamundipuram (about 100 m)
For the entire feeder main length, the social impacts can be fully eliminated by laying the
pipe line below the BT top in the critical stretches described above.
8.6   Identification of PAPs along the Sewer Lines
In city area the sewers are generally laid at the center of the road to facilitate the house
connection by gravity at a short distance from the houses located on either side. The
alignment of the sewer will have to be deviated from the center of the road due to other
underground services like electricity, telephones, water distribution etc. The house
connections are joined to the manholes on the sewer, which are provided at a distance of
about 3045 m depending on the size of the sewer.
For wide roads, like state or national highways the sewers are provided on one side of the
road. To avoid road crossings for connections at short intervals, a rider line is provided on
the other side of the road that is joined to the main sewer at suitable intervals. In Tirupur
area the sewers will be laid underground along the center of the road in almost all parts of
the city. Therefore, no displacement of the people is expected due to laying of the sewer
lines.
At 2 locations, sewers are crossing the railway line through the existing underpasses. In
such case, the sewer alignment will have to be slightly deviated, as the sewer lines can not
be laid through these narrow underpasses. Railway authorities generally carry out the
8-6



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                    PAPs- Identification and Profile
railway crossing works themselves with minimum disturbance to railway movements.
More often construction techniques like pipe jacking are adopted to minimise the
disturbance. The ROW of railways near the underpasses are free from encroachments and
no social issues are expected in construction of the sewers lines.
8.7   Categories of PAPs
After completing the reconnaissance survey and establishing links and support from local
administration, detailed socio-economic surveys were planned at all project sites. These
surveys were conducted by a team of investigators trained locally under the guidance of an
experienced sociologist.
The affected families identified in the surveys belong to the following three categories:
* Land owners
* Squatters
* Partially affected families
8.7.1 Land Owner PAPs
Those families who possess valid titles to the land required by the project fall under this
category. For compensation of the loss, the landowner is considered as a unit or family and
is entitled to choose between a land of equal productive potential or cash compensation.
Due to paucity of land, compensation in the form of alternate land is rarely feasible in
India and hence compensation is mostly in the form of cash compensation. For those
families who have considerable negative impact on their income due to LA, however, it is
desirable to provide advise/training/financial assistance to commence alternate means for
income generation.
8.7.2 Encroacher PAPs
Squatters are defined as the people with no legal holding or ownership of the land under
their occupation.
Generally people encroach the land near the place of their work for dwelling purpose and
also for small temporary shops to earn for their livelihood. They also encroach land for
putting up religious structures. These squatters are considered for compensation, as family,
and are provided with a basic dwelling unit according to certain norms and also cash
compensation, if applicable.

8.7.3 Partially Affected Persons
Those persons who are not directly affected due to loss of major assets and only face
marginal loss or discomfort due to project implementation fall under this category. This
category of PAPs is represented by family head as individuals while being considered for
cash compensation.
Based on the above categories the breakup of PAPs identified with respect to the project
sites is given in the Table 8.2.

8.8.1 Land Holder PAPs
According to the Revenue records and relevant registered documents, that were available
with the village administrative officer, land holdings of PAPs have been ascertained. The
' BPS earlier planned at Sarlai and Kanakkaampalayam were dropped which eliminates PAPs under this
category. The analysis, however, retains the observations during SA.

SR site at New R.K.Puram which they should have transferred to muniicipality in lieu of development
and sale of adjoining lands owned by them.
While compiling this information, it was observed that for a number of land holdings,
ancestral ownership has not been updated. In such cases the social survey has attempted to
find the details of all heirs to the property and has assumed equal distribution of land
among them (for want of more information).
Of the total 32 landowners, 21 are absentee landowners who do not stay at the project site.
It has been gathered that the absentee landholders are staying at different places in Periyar
8-10

and Coimbatore Districts. Out of the 11 landowners who stay in the area, only 9 live near
the project sites with their families and could be contacted during the field visits.
Addresses of remaining two were obtained from the village assistants and their
whereabouts were determined.. However, addresses of the absentee landowners were not
known by any one and they could not be contacted.
8.8.2 Encroacher PAPs
Due to rapid urbanization, there has been a steady increase in the number of poor,
unskilled and vulnerable groups who migrate and settle down in and around Tirupur. New
colonies of these people have emerged as unplanned settlements in many areas around
Tirupur. Majority of these settlements is coming up on lands owned by the Government
i.e. Poromboke lands. Based on their designated use the lands occupied by the squatters
can be classified as:
-  River Poromboke
-  Lake Poromboke
-  Natham Poromboke
-  PWD Poromboke
-  High ways Poromboke
- Cart Track Poromboke
The detailed social survey has revealed that there are 98 encroachments in all the project
sites excluding Water Transmission line. Of these encroachments, there are 87 residential
settlements, 3 shops, one residence cum shop, 1 vacant piece of land, one fence, one semi-
metal road, one thatched structure for Adult Education and 2 bathrooms. The project area
wise details of the encroacher PAPs, their assets and annual incomes are provided in
Annex 8-A.
8.9   Socio-Economic Profile of Squatters PAPs
8.9.1 Social Structure
All PAPs, except for two Christian families, are Hindus. All the Hindu PAPs belong to the
lower strata of community structure. Eighty per cent of these PAPs belong to Schedule
Caste and 20 per cent to Most Backward and Backward communities. The family structure
8-ll



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                    PAPs- Identification and Profile
among PAPs is predominantly nuclear, with less than 10 per cent families being joint.
Probable reasons for such observations may be:
(1)   The male workers migrate with only their spouses to the urban area and leave
behind their parents with their relatives.
(2)   The cost of living in Tirupur is so high that the PAPs are unable to provide for their
parents. Even in the joint families, it has been observed that parents and married
sons with separate kitchens share the dwellings.
8.9.2 Demographic Features
Out of the total number of 344 persons comprising the PAPs there are 174 males and 170
females. The male female ratio among the PAPs thus works out to be more or less
equivalent. The average family size of PAPs is 4. More than 42 per cent of the population
is in the active age group of 18 to 40 years. The overall literacy level among the PAP is 45
per cent but it is considerably lower among the women (30 per cent). Only five per cent of
the population is educated up to Matric. Among the PAPs, no person have done graduation
or attained a formal technical training.
8.9.3 Special Population
During the survey 7 pregnant women and 13 children below one year of age were
identified among the PAPs. The number of children below 5 years, aged persons above 60
years and mentally retarded were found to be 12, 14, and 1, respectively.
8.9.4 Economic Condition
In terms of their occupation, 50 per cent of the adult population are laborers in Banian
(Vest) Companies, 20 per cent are self employed such as barbers, carpenters, vendors,
cycle shop owner, astrologers and Government Pensioners. The agricultural coolies are 7
per cent. Others belong to construction coolies, masons etc. or are not employed in any
economically gainful activity. The dependent ratio is 56 per cent and the working
population constitutes 44 per cent only.
The days of employment for seasonal and non seasonal workers varies from 6-9 months as
12 per cent of them are semi skilled and 88 per cent are unskilled.

Tirupur Area Development Project                    PAPs- Identification and Profile
For most of the families, labor in knitwear companies is the main source of income. The
annual income ranges from below Rs.5,000 to above Rs.30,000 per year. Among the
PAPs, 50 per cent (40 families) of the families are below poverty line ie. earning about
11,850 per annum. Five families in the project site earn more than Rs. 30,000 per year.
Child labor is also seen in the area but respondents were reluctant to provide information
on extent of the practice.
Sixteen per cent of the families have an annual expenditure of less than Rs. 10,000, 57 per
cent spend between Rs. 10,001 and 20,000 per year and twenty two per cent of PAP
farnilies spend Rs. 25.000 per year. The remaining five per cent of the PAPs, spend more
than Rs. 30,000 per year. It was observed that the PAPs do not save much and spend
whatever they earn and take additional loan for emergencies The data on present indebted
numbers of PAPs indicate that there are only 8 families free from loans (Table 8.4).

8.10  Assessment of Structures Owned by PAPs
Housing needs are the prominent cause of encroachment among the PAPs. It is observed
that a majority of houses are kutcha houses (55 per cent huts and 30 per cent with tiled
roof and mud walls) and only 5 per cent of the houses are pucca.
It is further observed that out of 50 project sites, temples exist at 6 sites. However, only at
two sites namely Mannarai and Thiruvalluvar Nagar the temples are pucca built up
structures. Some of the PAPs also own makeshift shops. In a few places, abandoned
community latrines have also been observed. The details on structures owned by PAPs
have already been presented in Annex 8-A.
8.11  Common Infrastructure Facilities and Living Conditions
The infrastructure facilities are easily accessible in those areas where the project
8-13



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                     PAPs- Identification and Profile
components fall within the municipal limit. But these facilities, including essential
amenities are not accessible to the PAPs residing outside the municipal area. At most of
the sites, drinking water, sewage, drainage, street light, toilet, Balwadi, antenatal care,
primary school, housing and facilities for non-formal education are lacking.
If the comparison is made between 'B Memo' paying community and non-paying
community, there is a vast gap in access to basic services. 'B Memo' paying dwellings
possess amenities like electricity, ration card, semi-pucca and pucca housing structures.
These facilities are not found in non-B-Memo areas. Though, most of the sites encroached
by the poor PAPs are rocky and barren in nature, they are located on the main roads,
leading to Avinashi and Tirupur. Thus, these groups enjoy bus facilities, health care
through primary health center, education, Balwadi and ration card, They also have access
to the Post Office which exists within 3 km. Most of the PAPs, however, consider that
school, PHI and the workspace are far away.
In terms of the local community structure, it is seen that there are mostly opinion leaders
and caste leaders who head the community structure. Besides, another informal structure
exists in the form of loosely run welfare societies. If any serious community problem
arises, the PAPs seek the help of local political leaders, who often guide them. There is no
participation of women among the community leadership.
8.12 Housing Condition
All 97 PAPs (l-Arivoli Iyakkam Structure) live in their own shelters. As shown in Annex
8-A, 54 families live under thatched roof with either mud walls or brick walls or thatched
walls. Among the remaining, 40 live under tiled roofs with either mud or concrete walls.
Three live in their bunk shop. 15 per cent of the houses are electrified, none have
individual drinking water. or sewage or toilet. Around 44 per cent of the working
population has to commute more than 5 Km. both ways every day to attend their daily
work. Thirty eight per cent of them have their working place within 5 Km distance and the
remaining within 3 Km distance.
8.13 Housing Size and Surrounding Area
The people who encroached the sites at the initial stage played the role of opinion leaders
and developed political contacts. They possess relatively spacious, semi pucca housing
structures. They have also occupied the surrounding sites for their children. The details of
Housing size and surrounding sites held by the PAPs are given in the Tables 8.5 and 8.6.

8.14  Infrastructure Facilities Available for PAPs
Fifty six per cent of the PAPs live in houses, which have only one room. About 35 per
cent have two room dwellings. Very few houses i.e. 6 per cent possess more then two
rooms. Around 68 per cent have individual kutcha bathroom, three per cent own concrete
bathroom and 29 per cent have no bathroom. Less than 21 per cent of families have a
separate kitchen. Few of them only have cattle and cattle sheds. The PAPs have common
drinking water supply once in 34 days. No one has toilet in their house while 10 per cent
of the PAPs have electrical connections in their houses. Heads of 38 families say that they
have their name in the voters list. Forty-eight families have access to distribution of food
supply under civil supplies through their ration cards.
8.15 Preference of PAPs for Compensation
During social survey the emphasis has been in ascertaining the willingness of encroacher
PAPs to move on to an alternate site. For each group of squatters their opinion on the
preferred options for alternate site and compensation have been ascertained. It was
observed that all PAPs who will loose their dwelling due to the project have requested for
alternate housing. Some partially affected families have made requests for reasonable
compensation for their loss. The social assessment thus attempted to identify desirable
sites for resettlements at each site group of squatters albeit with partial success. The
desirable locations for resettlement of PAPs are presented in Table 8.7.

which should be provided in the near vicinity.
It is observed from the Table 8.7 that only four PAPs are eligible for dwelling units which
should be provided in the near vicinity.
8.16 Minimization of Social Impacts
During the project development, there has been a continuos effort to integrate the findings
of SA with the technical considerations for project design to minimise the negative social
impacts of the project. As a result a number of modifications have been affected.
8.16.1 Minimization of Social Impacts at Sites for Project Components
(a)    Site for MBR
As recorded in section 8.3, 102 houses were required to be demolished to construct the
MBR at the originally selected site at Puluvarpatty. Immediately after the reconnaissance
survey at the site, the information about large number of PAPs and possible significant
impacts of land acquisition at Puluvarpatty was passed to the sponsors for the
reconsideration of sites. Based on these findings and some technical considerations, a new
site at Neruparichal about 500 meters from the original site was identified for Master
Balancing Reservoir. As a result, the number of PAPs from 50 legal titleholders and 52
squatters was reduced to 6 landholders and 1 partially affected PAP (Table 8.2).
(b)    Site for SR at Thiruvalluvar Nagar
The construction of SR at this site requires that 20 squatter families be resettled to a new
location. During the course of SA, inquiries for identifying a possible resettlement in the
vicinity revealed that at about 500 m from the original location, unoccupied government
lands (T.S. No. 14) were available which can be used for housing the SR. The technical
considerations indicate that alternate site adequately meets the site criteria for housing the
SR, eliminating the need to resettle the 20 families.3
3The RAP, however, provides for budget for resettling these families as a precautionary measure

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                   PAPs- Identification and Profile
(c)   Site for STP (W) at Chinnandipalavam
The STP(W) site, predominantly comprises of the S.F.No. 187 (Lake poromboke) along
the main road to Mangalam. The site area adjacent to the road is heavily encroached. As
many as 57 families reside in this area, the details of which are already provided in Annex
8-A. A layout map of the encroached area with respect to overall dimension of
S.F.Nos. 187 and 200A is presented in Figure 8.1. Considering the difficulties of resettling
57 PAFs if the encroached sites are taken for the project, as also the availability of more
than 20 hectare land in S.F.No.187 against the project requirement of 6.6 hectares, the
project layout has been modified to leave the encroached areas and S.F.No.200-A
undisturbed.
This recommendation has saved the project authorities purchase of one alternative site of
at least 0.50 hectare and construction of resettlement colony at an approximate total cost of
Rs. I crore. Also, PAFs have also been spared the physical and psychological hardships of
resettlement and rehabilitation
8.16.2 Minimization of social impacts along WTM routes
During the social assessment studies for the route of WTM from the WTP to MBR ( 54
kim), two critical regions with significant social impacts were identified.
* About 500 m long stretch oh NH-47 near Perundari town
* Stretches along the 7 km long section of SH-6 and Major District Road (MDR) leading
to MBR at Neruparichal
In was found necessary to consider alternate alignment for the WTM near Perundari town
to minimize the social impacts that would have arose due to passage of the mains through
congested sections of NH47.
Two alternative alignments were considered. The first option was to take the water main
along a road connecting to the Perunduari-Erode highway and continuing along either the
left or the right of the road till Perundurai junction. The second alternative was to turn
towards east, north of road km 78 into the weekly market place (government land) before
the congested portion of the NH and continue along the Erode-Perundurai road up to the
junction. The currently laid TACID main also follows the second alternative and cuts

across to the left of the Erode-Perundurai road till the junction beyond which it turns onto
the road to Uttukuli.
The Erode-Perundurai and the parallel road are dual undivided carriageways with a BT
about 7.0-8.0 m wide including the berm and free available land alongside of about 3-5m
width. The stretch after the market plot along the road is relatively free of encroachments;
as the TACID main is being laid across the left of the road, it would be feasible to consider
the road stretch on the right of the Erode-Perundurai road for the proposed TADP main.
The Second alternative, therefore, is the most suitable alignment from the point of view of
social assessment. The residual impacts with the proposed alternative are practically nil.
For minimization of social impacts for WTM route along the SH-6 and MDR, permission
from the state authorities have been obtained to lay the transmission main below the BT
portion of the road. No demolition or acquisition of private property is thus required in this
section.
8.16.3 Minimization of social impacts along the Feeder Mains routes
It has been observed that about 1000 m long stretch of the total length of 95.80 km of the
three feeder mains pass through areas where development along the road does not allow
adequate space for laying the pipeline. The only possible way to lay the pipeline along
these stretches is either to lay it below the BT or through the agricultural field behinf the
structures adjacent the road. With the view to minimize the social impacts, permission for
the relevant authorities is being sought to lay the feeder mains below the BT.
8.17 Impact on Host Communities
For successful integration of resettled population with the host community it is essential to
fulfill the interest of the host community while planning the RAP. As per the original
proposal for TADP, the resettlement of 57 families at Chinnandipalayam and 24 families
at Thiruvalluvar Nagar could have give rise to significant impacts for the host
comnmunities. However, as has been explained in the section 8.16.1, by modifications in
the project design, the resettlement needs at both of these places were fully eliminated.
The project therefore does not need the consideration of impacts on the host communities.

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                         Resettlement Action Plan
CHAPTER 9
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
9.1   Introduction
The process of mitigation of social impacts of any development project is an exercise
requiring a careful and concerned execution of a series of steps. After identification of
PAPs, the first important task under mitigation of impacts is to identify the extent of loss
of physical assets and means of livelihood for each PAP. It is necessary that at this stage
the impact of loss is ascertained keeping in view the capacity of PAPs to earn an adequate
livelihood with the assets remaining after the acquisition.
All PAPs need to be provided adequate compensation for their losses in such a way that
the living standard of each PAP is at least maintained to the pre-project level. It is also
necessary to ensure that PAPs do not suffer from a permanent psychological impairment
and during the post project phase have adequate opportunities to achieve the same level of
economic progress, which would have, been otherwise possible. For adequate mitigation
of social impacts, it is necessary that the resettlement and rehabilitation plan recommended
by the SA, is implemented in a systematic and time bound schedule.
While developing the resettlement and rehabilitation plan for TADP, the SA has attempted
to capture the above elements. This chapter detail the procedures followed to develop
mitigation plans for negative social impacts, presents action plans for resettlement and
rehabilitation and concludes with recommendations for monitoring their implementation.
9.2   Approach for Mitigation of Social Impacts
As a result of land acquisition, the affected population is subjected to a wide range of
social impacts. Most severely affected families are those, which loose all their assets,
including the homestead land, to the project. The fundamental objective of SA, therefore,
is to minimize the number of such families.
The families which loose only partial assets may continue to live at the original place. The
mitigation measures for such families involve a fair assessment of their losses and
provision for timely and adequate compensation. A number of possibilities exist while
deciding the mechanism of compensation. A cash compensation for the loss of land and
assets is desirable only in those cases where the PAPs have the capacity to use the
compensation productively and where the loss does not entirely eliminate their capacity to
earn a livelihood with the remaining available assets.
9-1



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                        Resettlement Action Plan
In other cases, the mitigation measures need to strike a balance between immediate cash
compensation, a cash compensation leading to a fixed regular earning and a compensation
for lost earning capacity by providing alternate means of livelihood through training and
rehabilitation.
One important category of PAPs, however, is of those families, which do not have any
legal rights to the land they occupy for their homestead and commercial activities. The
Government in a way recognizes the rights of those PAPs who continue to occupy the
piece of land for substantial past by levying a penalty for occupying Government land.
For recent encroachments, the PAPs do not have a locus standi and determination of
compensation for their loss requires a humanitarian and sensitive outlook. Mostly, PAPs
under this category are marginalized people, who follow menial occupations to earn their
livelihood, the opportunities for which exist in the near vicinity of their place of living.
These PAPs are normally worst affected due to the project development as they are left to
fend for themselves with depleted possessions and an inadequate capacity to find an
alternate source of livelihood. The fundamental challenge with the mitigation of social
impacts of a development project lies in adequate consideration of the resettlement and
rehabilitation of these PAPs. A successful consideration of resettlement and rehabilitation
needs of such PAPs is possible only if the proposed development shares the benefits of the
project with the affected families.
9.3   Assessment of Compensation
A detailed description of loss of land and other assets of all PAPs have been presented in
the previous chapter. Based on that information, this section evaluates the loss and
provides estimates for compensation to each PAP. The description is sequenced as per the
project components.
9.3.1 Water Intake Well
Water intake well and allied pumping station are to be located in S.F.No.137/9 and 39.
The project requires only 0.06 hectare from S.F.No.137/9 out of the total area of 0.625
hectare. The plot is owned by 5 individuals as described in Table 8.3 under conditional
patta. The extent of land acquisition thus is only 10 per cent of the landholdings of PAPs
and would not impair continuation of horticultural activities by them. At this site, these
five individuals need to be given compensation for the loss of lands and the trees which is
estimated for Rs.1000 per Jack fruit tree and Rs.500 per tree of other types. As per the
ESR the PAPs need to be given 12 years earnings from the trees owned by them as the
compensation for their loss. The total compensation for land required from S.F.No.137/9,
9-2



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                        Resettlement Action Plan
therefore, works out to be approximately Rs. 0.121 Million for the land and 0.18 Million
for the loss of 20 trees.
The S.F.No.39 has a total area of 0.805 hectare and is under agricultural use by 7
individuals. Out of this land the project requirement is of 0.256 hectare, which leaves only
0.549 hectare with the PAPs after acquisition. Since these PAPs have not been living at the
site and even the total land under this SF number is not sufficient to provide sustained
livelihood to the owners, it was assumed that in addition to this land, the PAPs must have
other means of livelihood. In view of the above, cash compensation for the acquired land
is considered appropriate. The total compensation for the land of 0.256 hectares thus
works out to be Rs. 0.512 Million. This compensation should be given to the PAPs in
cash, in proportion to their landholding, only after ascertaining their capacity for
productive utilization of the amount. Otherwise, only a part of the compensation should be
paid directly and the remaining should be kept in fixed deposits to provide a regular
earning to PAPs.
9.3.2 Raw Water Transmission Line and Water Treatment Plant
After originating from intake pumping well in S.F.No.39, the raw water transmission line
passes through SF numbers 40 (Canal poromboke), 50, 46, 30 (NH 47), 29, 28 and 27,
before it reaches the S.F. No.21 and 22 earmarked for water treatment plant.
The land requirement for the pipeline route through S.F.No.39 has already been
considered while arriving at the compensation for intake well. For the S.F.No.50/6 from a
total area of 0.020 hectare, the land requirement for the pipeline is 0.00675 hectare. The
land is owned by two individuals. Based on the estimated land value of Rs. 2.0 Million per
hectare, the compensation for the land is calculated at Rs. 13,500, which can be paid to the
PAPs on the similar lines as compensation for land for intake well. For these calculations
the compensation for crop has not been included. It is assumed that while acquiring the
land, arrangements will be made to enable PAPs reap the standing crop on the land.
Beyond S.F.No.50 the transmission line passes through S.F.No.46 along the cart road and
S.F.No.30 (NH 47). Beyond S.F.No.30 the pipeline needs to cross S.F.No.29, 28 and 27
before reaching S.F.No.21 and 22. Most of the land under these five S.F. numbers are with
the government (Annadhanam Poromboke) except for minor landholdings which do not
come in the way of pipe line and 1.22 hectare of lands in S.F. No. 21 and 22 which are
being acquired from one Mr. Loganathan. The compensation for 1.22 hectare of lands to
Mr. Loganathan is estimated to be Rs. 2.44 Million. The mode of compensation should
follow the guidelines provided for water intake well and raw water transmission line.
'The rate of compensation for lands outside TLPA has been considered @ Rs. 2.0 Million per hectare

Tirupur Area Development Project                        Resettlement Action Plan
9.3.3 Water Transmission Line and Feeder Mains
Water transmission line and feeder mains are proposed within the ROW of NH-47 and
SH-6. Most of the stretches have adequate ROW along the pipeline. However, in some
congested parts laying of the pipeline will cause minor dislocations. The impacts however
can be minimized by bypassing these stretches and taking the pipeline route through less
congested roads as have been already described in sections 8.16.2 and 8.16.3. No social
impacts of laying the water transmission mains from WTP to MBR are expected after the
mimmization measures.
With respect to laying the feeder mains, efforts are being made to obtain permission from
the local authorities to lay the pipeline below the paved portion of the roads through the
congestion sections. However, cost of acquiring a 5-m wide strip over a 1000-m stretch
(total length of congested stretches along the feeder main routes - section 8.5), from the
agricultural field behind the roadside developments has been provided in LA budget. In
case, it becomes necessary to acquire these lands, the owners will be identified with the
assistance of a NGO/social consultant and compensated during the implementation of
RAP for the project.
9.3.4 Master Balancing Reservoir
The total requirement of land for the Master Balancing Reservoir (MBR) at Nerupperichal
village is 4 hectares. This land is to be acquired from S.F.No. 135, 136 and 140. Some of
these areas have been extensively used for stone quarrying and have deep depression,
which are not conducive for construction of the reservoirs. The land under S.F.No.135 is
most suitable for the project, but is entirely owned by private landowners. In case it is sold
by the landowners, 4 hectares can be obtained from this plot which has a total area of 5.49
hectares. However, if only partial land is available from S.F.No.135, lands to the tune of
1.40 hectare from adjacent S.F.No.140 and up to 1.14 hectare from S.F.No.136 can be
obtained.
The compensation amount and its allocation within the PAPs, therefore, will depend upon
actual scheme of land acquisition. The compensation for the lands at the rate of Rs. 3.0
Million per hectare is estimated to be Rs. 12.0 Million, which should be divided among
the landholders in proportion of the area of acquired lands from individual owners. As the
landholders are not dependent on the lands for their livelihood the compensation can be
paid in cash who can also be assisted in using the compensation in acquiring productive
assets.

However, if available lands from S.F.No.140 and S.F.No.136 are taken, only about 2.5
hectares will be required from S.F.No. 135. In this event, no compensation is required for
S.F.No.136, which is poromboke land. The compensation for S.F.No. 140 will be due to
Mr.K.Palanisamy for 0.06 hectare, to the legal heir of late Mr.Alagiri Boyer for 0.12
hectares and to Mr.Natarajan for 1.32 hectares.
On S.F.No.136, which is a poromboke land, certain encroachments are observed towards
southwest boundary. One family headed by Mr.Murugasamy who is the legal landowner
of the adjacent land has constructed memorial for his only departed son, apparently being
unaware that Government land was being encroached upon. The family has also
constructed other structures such as water tank and thatched pump house on the
poromboke land, which they are willing to forgo without any compensation. The family,
however, requested that the memorial should not be disturbed. Considering the sentimental
value attached with the memorial and the fact that it occupies a small area of about 12
sq.m. at the corner of the required land, it is recommended that the memorial he kept intact
and in possession of the PAP.
9.3.5 Service Reservoirs on Feeder Main I
Out of the nine service reservoirs on the Feeder Main I only one reservoir site at New
R.K.Puram is under private ownership. This land has an area of 0.07 hectare and it falls
under TS number 151/If/E.
As per town planning rules, each owner who sells his land for plots for
residential/commercial purpose has to earmark some lands for common amenities such as
play ground, temples, water reservoir, roads etc. Accordingly, this plot of land as
consequence of development of lay out for the area was earmarked for water reservoir site.
The land, however, is still in the name of the original owner and his two sons. Since in
principle, the land should have been handed over to the municipality free of cost, it cannot
be considered, as rightfully belonging to the title holders and as such does not call for
compensation. The municipality, therefore, should take necessary action for transfer of
title.
The land for service reservoir on Feeder Main I at Rayapuram is under municipal
ownership. This land has an area of 0.079 hectares and is situated in TS No.39/54/K. Two
structures, an abandoned toilet measuring, 2.60 x 6.40 m. and a one seated toilet
measuring 2.50 x 1.50 m. under use by municipal staff located in the existing Service
Reservoir site, have been observed to occupy one corner of the plot.
During the construction of the new Service Reservoir, adequate toilet facilities should be
provided for the staff working at the new as well as the old Service Reservoir.

9.3.6 Service Reservoirs on Feeder Main II
Each of the 17 proposed SR sites on Feeder Main II lie on Government land. However,
five sites namely Thiruvalluvar Nagar, Sakthi Nagar, Kuppandapalayam (Church site),
Kanianpundi and Avaraipalayam Pirivu have potential social impacts due to squatters.
Maximum impact of land acquisition was expected to be at Thiruvalluvar Nagar where 21
PAPs have been identified2. Out of these 21 PAPs, 19 families loose their dwellings to the
project and need to be resettled. Remaining two families are partially affected and loose
only superficial parts of their house, for which a compensation of Rs.5,000 to each family
is recommended. The details for resettlement of this site are provided under section 9.12.
Moreover since the adult sons (above 18 years age) are also considered as separate units
for compensation, there will be additional PAPs numbering 5 for whom additional covered
and open space will be provided. These PAPs are:
1. Chandrasekar, S/o.Manickam,
2. Madivanan, S/o.Mahalingam,
3. Gopi, S/o.Ramakrishnan,
4. Manoharan, S/o.Palaniappa Nayanar and
5. Shanmugam, S/o.Lakshmanan.
To account for additional costs of the larger houses for the families to which the above
PAPs, the cost of resettlement is calculated for resettlement of 24 families and is expected
to be Rs.3.24 Million.
The Service Reservoir site near the Kuppandapalayam church is one among the 2 service
reservoir sites proposed in Kuppandapalayamn village. There are three structures in the
form of an abandoned community toilet and two pucca bathrooms have been identified as
encroachments in the site acquisition of which will render 2 families partially affected.
The findings of the social assessment indicated that the PAPs, were not aware of the fact
that the land they occupied were Government land. However, the partially affected PAPs
expressed their willingness to get the compensation for the loss of structures and vacate
the land. It was also observed that these families had sufficient space in their backyard to
rebuild the bathrooms. As part of the mitigation measures, it is recommended that these
two partially affected PAPs namely Mr.N.A.Subramanian and N.A. Eswaran should be
2 It may be noted that as described in 8.16.1 (b), an alternate site for housing the SR on Government lands at
T.S. No. 14 has been made that eliminates the need for resettlement at Thiruvalluvar Nagar. However, as a
precautionary step the budget for RAP includes resettlement at this location

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                        Resettlement Action Plan
considered for a compensation of Rs. 10,000 each for the loss of their bathrooms.
The site for the proposed SR is also observed for being used for open defecation by the
community women covering 100 families. The existing common toilet was found to be in
a dilapidated condition, which forced the women to defecate by in the open. Procurement
would amount to denying a facility, used by the community women, if no alternate
arrangements are provided. The matter was discussed with the women as well as local
village officers during the SA and a suitable site was identified in the cart track
poromboke in close vicinity of the abandoned latrine. The approximate cost of
construction of a 12-seated latrine necessary for this community is estimated to be about
Rs.0.2 Million including water supply and other facilities.
In the site proposed for the location of SR at Kanianpundi village, there is an abandoned
community toilet. It was found that the public were not utilizing the facility but used near
by fields for open defecation. Since this latrine was left unused for years together no
objection was observed during the survey to demolish the toilet. However, as mitigation
measure a common toilet with necessary facilities like water supply and lighting should be
provided to the community. It was observed that adequate open space was available
nearby. Therefore a community toilet with 12 seats costing approximately Rs. 0.2 Million
with necessary amenities is recommended for this site.
At Avaraipalayam Pirivu, the site identified for SR affects a fence of barbed wire
belonging to Mr.M.Ponnusamy who had put up the fence to safeguard his land from
encroachments. During the SA, the PAP requested to be paid compensation for the loss of
the fence and an approach road to his land. The claim of Mr.Ponnusamy for an approach
road is found to be not maintainable as he had adequate space for such a facility in the rear
side of his own land. However, a compensation of Rs. 15,000 is recommended for the loss
of the fence keeping in view of the retrievable nature of the fence. During SA at this site, it
is also come to light that a proposal to provide 0.03-hectare plot of this land for graveyard
is under consideration of the revenue department.
At Sakthi Nagar, one barber shop and one office of the Communist Party of India and
some temple idols are located at the site. A compensation of Rs.25,000 in the form of
providing a shop to Mr.Mani with necessary appliances is recommended. As the party
office is to loose its semi pucca dwelling, measuring 3.5mx3.0 m, a compensation of
Rs.50,000 is recommended as appropriate for this loss.

Tirupur Area Development Project                            Resettlement Action Plan
A few temple idols3 worshipped by the families of Gounder community from the 9
surrounding villages have also been observed at the site. It will be desirable that while
acquiring this land project authorities provide a path to the temple and leave the temple
undisturbed. Alternatively, the temple should be relocated at a suitable site in consultation,
with the community leaders. Excluding the issue related to the temple resettlement for the
2 PAPs at Sakthi Nagar would cost around Rs.75,000.
9.3.7 Service Reservoirs on Feeder Main III
There are nine SRs proposed to be served by Feeder Main III. Out of these sites, 7 sites are
on the Government lands. The remaining two sites are located at Kaliappa Nagar and
Ponkovil Nagar respectively. Both of these sites are reserved for public purposes in the
approved layout. The site for SR at Kaliappa Nagar comes under the village panchayat
jurisdiction and the Ponkoil Nagar SR site falls under a weavers society. The resolution of
the concerned bodies would be necessary to avoid any later, dispute on use of these lands
for SRs.
It is observed that, a dispute between the two religious groups exists about the ownership
of a portion of the site at Kaliappa Nagar and the case is still pending for settlement. It is,
therefore, advised that immediate possession of the remaining land is obtained.
9.3.8 Sewage Treatment Plant -East
An area of 10.25 hectare of land is proposed to be acquired at Sarkarperiyapalayam for
Sewage Treatment Plant (East). The proposed site falls under S.F.Nos. 121, 122, 123 and
124 of Sarkarperiyapalayam village and S.F.Nos. 39 and 432 A of Nerupparichal village.
The S.F.No. 121, 123, 124 and 432 A are on various poromboke lands and their
acquisition does not entail any compensation for land acquisition. These lands are also free
of encroachments. However, S.F.No. 122 with a land area of 2.05 hectare belong to 2
individual landowners. Similarly 124/1 with land area of 1.16 hectare is also owned by
two landowners. For S.F.No.39, out of a total area of 1.095 hectares, an extent of 0.775
hectare belongs to two individual owners and the remaining land falls under cart
poromboke. According to the estimated land value of Rs. 3.0 Million per hectare the cost
of the private land at the sites works out to be Rs. 19.96 Million. The total compensation
for each PAP would be therefore adequate to provide sustained livelihood if invested
appropriately. The RAP monitoring committee to be formed under this project should
provide the necessary guidance to PAPs.
3 Of the 6 temples observed at the project sites, after minimization of social impacts, temples only at two
sites- Sakti Nagar and Mannarai, will be affected. A provision of Rs. 0.1 Million for shifted the temples at
each site has been made. Although the first preference should be to leave the temples undisturbed by
modification in layout of the facility to allow its continued use by the community.

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                       Resettlement Action Plan
In addition to land, the PAP headed by Mr.Chennimalai Gounder also owns a tiled shed
and cattle shed towards which Rs. 0.15 Million should be paid as compensation.
Another PAP, Ms.Mayangathal alias Rangathal owns a well, which is used for irrigation
purposes of this land and adjoining lands. The compensation value for this may be fixed at
Rs. 0.1 Million.
9.3.9 Sewage Treatment Plant - West
An area of 6.60 hectare is required for STP (West) at Chinnandipalayam village. This land
falls under S.F.Nos.187 and 200-A. S.F.No.187 is a lake poromboke with a total area of
28.855 hectares. The S.F.No. 200-A, has 4 sub plots, out of which two sub plots 200/1,
200/2 owned by Mr.K.Nachimuthu Gounder and Mr.K.Subbiah Gounder are to be
acquired for the project with total contribution of 0.235 hectares of land. However, there
are certain family commitments from both of these owners which make them reluctant to
sell their land to the project.
Also, part of this site in the S.F.No.187 (Lake poromboke) along the main road to
Mangalam is occupied by 57 squatter families. However, as described in section 8.16.1
(a), by modifying the layout of the STP, the need to remove the squatter families from the
site has been obviated.
9.3.10 Sewage Pumping Stations
Out of 5 SPS, at sites near Vanakkara Rawthrr Thottam and Kangayam Road which fall
under S.F.Nos. Ward J, Block 53, TS No:ll. and Ward HT, Block-6 TS No:31/3, no land
acquisition issues are perceived. The findings of the SA indicate the entire lands required
for these are Government land and are also free from encroachments. Out of the remaining
3 sites maximum impact is expected and at Mannarai, where 5 encroacher PAPs stay on
the land required by the project. After the first survey one more encroachment has been
observed which should not be considered for compensation. In addition to PAPs the site
also has a temple regularly visited by Muthuraja community which also celebrates temple
festival once in every 2 years at the site.
As part of mitigation of social impacts out of the 5 PAPs, 4 need to be provided an
alternate dwelling, as per prescribed norms having a total land area of 60 sq.m. and built
up area of 40 sq.m. Since the number of PAPs is small, the families should be resettled
near the site itself so that they can continue to pursue the means of their livelihood.

Environmental and SocialAssessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                          Resettlement Action Plan
Considering very high land values in Tirupur it is strongly recommended that all PAPs
compensated by allotment of dwellings against their loss of house on encroached lands
should not be allowed to sell or sublet the dwellings. If the title of dwelling is on
poromboke the title of the dwelling should remain with the government. In case the land
or dwelling is obtained by the NTADCL it should hold the title to that value. This step is
very important as a safeguard against resale of the plot and profiting from measures for
social justice.
The fifth PAF headed by Mr.Ramasamy who has constructed a pucca house has expressed
willingness to vacate the site on receiving compensation for the loss of the structure. A
compensation of Rs.75,000 is recommended as appropriate for his loss. It is also necessary
to resolve the social impact associated with the use of temple at the site. It will be
necessary for the project authorities to have a dialogue with Muthuraja community in this
issue.
As the first option, if project lay out does not disturb the temple and allows a provision of
approach road to the temple, the community may be permitted to continue using the
temple. Alternatively, it may be necessary to shift the temple or construct a new temple in
an alternative location.
At the SPS site Kongu Main Road, a small portion of a nursery school situated at one
comer of the site is affected. Although the school itself is an encroachment it will be
necessary to pay compensation for partial damage to the structure. Since at this site
sufficient land exists for the SPs with the S.F.No.12, ward D block 4, it is advised that the
site layout may be slightly modified to leave the school structure intact.
The SPS site at Kuttai near Nataraj theatre is observed to have one PAP and one partially
affected PAP. Mr.Kumaran, the partially affected PAP encroached about 1200 Sq.ft. area
adjacent to the proposed SPS site. One of the structures constructed by the PAP, a
bathroom, lies within the SPS site and needs to be demolished.
Mr. Vallapuran is the son of the partially affected PAP who has also encroached land for
one thatched roof structure, which falls under the proposed site. A compensation of
Rs.5000 is recommended to each of the PAPs for their loss.
9.3.11 Booster Pumping Stations
The booster pumping stations at Erukkatuvalasu falls under S.F. No.260, a poromboke
land that is also free from encroachments or squatters.

Tirupur Area Development Project                          Resettlement Action Plan
The overall findings of the SA on assessment of compensation for the project (excluding
the clear water transmission line) are summarized in Table 9.1. The assessment of
compensation for loss of land to the PAPs is based on information obtained about the
actual market value of lands in the project area. The rate of compensation of Rs. 2.0
Million per hectare for areas out side the TLPA and Rs. 3.0 Million per hectare for within
the TLPA includes 30 per cent solatium.
9.4 Resettlement Action Plan
The findings of SA bring out the need to undertake resettlement measures for 24 PAPs at
Tiruvalluvar Nagar. Considerable interaction took place with PAPs and village officials to
understand their resettlement and rehabilitation needs. A vacant government land at
Thiruvalluvar Nagar has already been identified as a probable site for resettling 24 PAPs.
The action plan for resettlement at Thiruvalluvar Nagar which provides the site for
relocation, facilities to be constructed, the budget and time schedules for resettlement is
presented in Action sheet 9.1. The agencies to construct the resettlement sites and to allot
the houses to the PAPs have also been indicated. However, in view of the reluctance of
PAPs to move out of their present dwellings, recommendation is made to consider the
proposed resettlement site for housing the service reservoir as the preferred option.
No such sites, however, could be identified at Mannarai where it may be necessary to
purchase private land for resettling 4 PAFs. The action plans for resettlement at these
areas that provide the site for relocation, facilities to be constructed, the budget and time
schedules for resettlement are presented in Action sheets 9.2.

9.5 Rehabilitation
The social survey among the initially identified PAPs indicated that in addition to
resettlement in certain cluster the PAPs would also need rehabilitation assistance. Later,
the project layout has been modified to minimize the resettlement requirements and the
over all need were reduced to about 4 PAFs. During detailed engineering, further effort
will be made to fully eliminate the resettlement on the project.
The project authorities, however, can consider some rehabilitation assistance in the areas
which house major project facilities and thus generate good will among the people towards
the project. With this view certain suggestion and estimates are being made for training
assistance for income generation schemes.
The youth from the affected communities can be trained in tailoring which has good
potential for employment in the garment business at Tirupur. A local NGO could be
identified for the proposed training. It is necessary that the NGO should have previous
experience of organize similar training.
For the training program and their placement, the TEA can play a vital role. They can
build up a rapport with the people through this involvement, which would be useful in the
long run and during the implementation of the project.
9.5.1 Budget for Training
The estimates of budget for the training 100 persons is furnished in Table 9.2.

9.5.2 Placement
After undergoing the training, the youth should be absorbed in the garment manufacturing
units in Tirupur. As trained candidates they may get higher wages which will be an
additional income to the families.
9.6 Community Development
The findings of the Social Assessment on the social profile of the PAPs and their
community indicate that in the Thiruvalluvar Nagar area, facilities like Balwadi, Non-
Formal education unit etc are absent. If the resettlement in this area is undertaken, it is
desirable that as part of community development in a resettlement area some attention to
this aspect is also given.
9.6.1 Balwadi
Due to lack of awareness coupled with irregular income, child health and care are given
very low priority. Opening a Balwadi in the area would mitigate the existing conditions
considerably.
9.6.2 National Literacy Mission Unit
The survey indicates that the literacy rate is low, particularly among women. It is,
therefore, desirable that a unit of National Literacy Mission be opened in the locality
which can function in the community center to be constructed under the Resettlement
Action Plan.
9.6.3 De-addiction Center
Addiction to alcohol is quite prevalent in the area. In this context, counseling cum de-
addiction center will prove very useful to the area.
9.6.4 Convergence Efforts
The needs identified above could be implemented through convergence efforts with
District Collector, Social Welfare Department, Education Department and NGOs. The
involvement of TEA in such activities will result in establishing a link between the
affected community and the project administration.

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                         Reseftlement Action Plan
9.6.5 Public Information and Consultation (PIC)
In addition to considerable interaction with the PAPs during the social survey and focus
group discussions to discuss the resettlement and rehabilitation issues, a formal PIC
meeting was held on September 25, 1996 at the TEA's office at Tirupur. The meeting was
attended by about 30 persons comprising residences of Tirupur and representatives of the
way side villages and the villages housing the project components. During the PIC,
project details including the draft EMP and approach to RAP and development of
entitlement package was presented to the participants. The suggestions received were
incorporated in finalization of the EMP and RAP. The details of PIC are presented in
Annex 9-A.
9.6   Institutional Arrangement for Implementing the RAP
9.6.1 Implementation Responsibility
It is primarily the responsibility of NTADCL, the SPV for the TADP, to ensure successful
implementation of the RAP for the project. The construction of the project mainly
involves acquisition of private lands to the extent of about 10-hectare. Due to low
dependence of the landowners for their livelihood on the lands being acquired and
considerable land prices in the area, it has been possible to work out the entitlements based
on the compensation that will ensure that the PAPs will not be economically adversely
affected. Also recommendations have been made on feasible project alternatives to almost
eliminate resettlement on the project.
However, a socio-economic status of landowner PAPs has not been conducted. There is,
therefore, a need to undertake a socio-economic survey of all PAPs that are entitled for
compensation on account of loss of productive assets. This information will be used as the
baseline soci-economic status of the PAPs for ascertaining the success of implementation
of the RAP. Also, there is a need of NGO intervention to assure that the PAPs are paid the
due compensation in time and are assisted in selection of alternate means of livelihood.
NGO intervention is also necessary to arrive at appropriate price for the lands, specially in
view of significant differential between the guideline values of the land (at which they are
expected to be compensated for their lands by the government) and the price at which
equivalent lands may be available in the market.
The NTADCL, therefore, should appoint an NGO/consultant to assist in implementation
of RAP.
In addition to appointment of an NGO/Consultant, NTADCL should also constitute a
project level R&R implementation and monitoring committee and appoint an independent
agency for monitoring and evaluation to assess the success of RAP implementation. The

following sections describe the functions of various entities. It may be noted that the
objective of formation/appointment of these entities is to provide necessary assistance in
implementation of the RAP to the NTADCL . The responsibility to ensure that RAP is
successfully implemented fully rests with NTADCL
9.6.2 Project Level R&R Implementation and Monitoring Committee
The primary responsibility of the committee will be to assist in NTADCL in the
implementation of ESA recommendations for the RAP and take necessary steps for further
reduction of resettlement and rehabilitation requirements while finalizing the alignment of
the feeder mains.
The primary tasks of the committee will be the following
* Oversight the conduct of the survey of all the land owners and tenants to identify the
PAPs and their rehabilitation entitlement requirements (proposed to be done through
the social assessment survey);
* Oversight payment of rehabilitation assistance as per amount agreed through
negotiated settlement. This is the responsibility of SPV
* Oversight procurement and allocation of land and release of grants to the PAPs for
purchase of either land or productive assets
 Monitor and review the implementation of the RAP periodically and ensure that the
PAPs are receiving the rehabilitation assistance as articulated in the RAP. Also provide
a platform for grievance redressal
*  Dovetail various training and income generation schemes of the government with the
implementation process of RAP
* Approve Terms of References and selection of agencies for the conduct of monitoring
and evaluation of the RAP
9.6.3 Structure of RAP Implementation and Monitoring Committee
The structure of RAP committee to implement and monitor the RAP is presented in Table
9.3.
The committee should initially meet once in a month to speed up the process. Later the
meetings can be held once in two months to solve any problems and monitor the RAP
work. The exact identification of PAPs, resolution of any disputes, final determination of

CHAPTER 10
RISK MANAGEMENT
10.1  Introduction
The various environmental and social risks associated with this project that may affect its
tecno-commercial viability relate to:
* Public resentment to compensation related to LA
* Uncertainty is assured off-takes from the water source
* Contamination of water at the intake works and
* Closure of industries due to environmental non-compliance
The probability of each of these risks can be brought down through a management process,
with any detriment to the project only if a combination of risks were to prevail
simultaneously.
10.2 Public Resentment to Compensation Related to LA
Risk Assessment
Land is to be acquired for the construction of the intake well, laying of the transmission line
to WTP, construction of WTP, MBR, SRs, SWPs, STPs and laying of feeder main pipelines.
T'his would result in displacement of landowners in some cases and squatters in other
instances as described in detail in the chapter 8 of this report. Associated with this activity is
the risk of public resentment due to perceived inadequacy of the compensation for the assets
and lands acquired by the project.
Such resentment could lead to delays in land acquisition which in turn could result in delays
in the commencement of the project. The cost escalation due to the delay could affect the
overall commercial viability of the project.
Risk Management
Public resentment risk would primarily be those related to the compensation package.
Entitlement packages have been made in keeping with the mandates of IL&FS's ESR and
the details are given in the section on SA (refer chapter 9.0). The entitlement package is
proposed to be implemented through a public consultation process and the services of NGOs
10-]



Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                             Risk Management
are proposed to be used to negotiate the entitlement package.
During the course of the ESA study, considerable interaction with the PAPs has happened. A
public information and consultation (PIC) meeting has also been held by the NTADCL to
discuss the issues with the PAPs. The interactions indicate that the project is being well
received by the people and as per the suggestion of participants to the PIC, similar
consultations will be done in all the affected villages. It is considered that through an open
and principled process for development of entitlement package for the PAPs, the risk of
public resentment to the project due to LA related issues would be adequately mitigated.
Monitoring
The land acquisition process is to be monitored by NTADCL. NGO involvement will be
sought for negotiation and implementation of the compensation packages. After one year of
implementation of the RAP, an independent M&E agency will evaluate the outcome of RAP.
Any deficiency highlighted by the social survey, at this stage, will be immediately addressed
by the NTADCL, securing full satisfaction of PAPs with the RAP implementation.
103  Uncertainty in Assured Off-takes from the Water Source
Risk Assessment
Reliability of the water source is one of the most vital project requirement. The financial
viability of the entire project rests on the reliability, both quantity and quality of the water to
be supplied.
River Cauvery, a perennial river, is the proposed source of water for the TADP. Previous
schemes to supply water to Tirupur were from river Bhavani, a tributary of river Cauvery.
According to the decision of the Water Allocation Committee of GoTN, abstraction of 185
MLD of water from river Cauvery will be permitted for the TADP.
Data on flow regime in Cauvery - Bhavani Basin are collected at various locations in
Karnataka and Tamil Nadu by Central Water Commnission (CWC) and published every year.
A grid plan of the Cauvery system indicating the locations of the gauge stations of the CWC
is presented in Fig. 5.1 To analyze the flow pattern at the proposed offtake point, the
following three gauge stations are of significance:
i) Savandapur in Bhavani River, 7 km upstream of proposed intake point
ii) Urachikottai in Cauvery River. 7 km upstream of proposed intake point
iii) Kodumudi in Cauvery River, 9 km downstream of proposed intake point

Monthly average flows in the three stations for the period 1984-85 to 1993-94 are furnished
in Annex I 0-A.
These were analyzed by Pearsonian distribution for arriving at reliability of source for three-
confidence levels-namely 99%, 95% and 90%. The results of the analysis are presented in
Table 10.1.
Table 10.1 Reliability of Flow (m31sec) at Various Confidence Levels
Confidence levels
99%           95%               90%
Savandapur (Bhavani)             1.40            4.57                 8.36
Urachikottai (Cauvery)          16.72           26.50                31.00
Kodumudi (Cauvery)              18.13           27.40                32.54
T'he desired supply to Tirupur is 185 MLD or 2.1 m3/s. A realistic assessment of the source
reliability from the exclusive point of view of proposed TADP would require a three step
analysis:
(i)   assess the total irrigation demand in Cauvery below the offtake point- that is, up to
the confluence of the river with the sea,
(ii)   work out the net availability by deducting the irrigation demand
(iii) compare the same with the requirement of 2.1 m3/s.
Such an analysis would not lead to positive results since it is a well established fact that
agricultural demand in Tamil Nadu exceeds the potential. Discussions with State Irrigation
Department confirms that the Bhavani River System is designed for full utilization and
hence, no surplus is expected at confluence of Bhavani with Cauvery. The river flow analysis
serves the limited purpose that the 90% surface flow in Kodumudi (below the offtake) is far
above the minimum requirements for Tirupur and hence the interests of the project would be
safeguarded if priority for industrial use over agriculture for Tirupur is recognized by the
Government Of Tamil Nadu.
Thus, it can be concluded that the risks of water supply from the source at Cauvery are low.
No risk management plans are as such necessary.

10.4 Contamination of Water at the Intake Works
Risk Assessment
The bacteriological quality of the downstream reaches of most of rivers in India has been
observed to have poor bacteriological quality. To assess, suitability of river Cauvery as a
source for drinking water supply, a detailed bacteriological survey undertaken at four stations
covering a stretch of 10 kmn around the proposed intake well was conducted during October
1996 to March 1997. The results of the analysis indicate that the water samples at proposed
intake well occasionally show elevated bacteriological contamination.
Also, the towns of Kumarapalayam and Bhavani are located about 2 km upstream of the
intake point. The quality of water at the proposed intake point for the present project may
get impaired in the future due to the wastewater discharges from these towns, specially the
town of Bhavani.
Risk Management
The selection of surface water as the main source for the project was used to mitigate the risk
associated with quantitative reliability of the source. The risk with respect to the
bacteriological contamination, presently, is considered low as about 250 m upstream of the
proposed intake site, there are three intake wells serving Perunthurai-Karumandi-
Chellapalayam water supply scheme, Chitod dairy water supply schedule and Perundurai
water supply scheme, respectively. Another intake well is presently in operation by TWAD
at about 200 m upstream of the proposed intake site. No incidents of epidemiological
outbreaks have been reported in regions using water from these intake points.
To mitigate the public health risk associated with future impairnent of water quality, the
EMP (chapter 6.0) recommends the need for suitable treatment measures (two staged
chlorination and provision for increased dose alum and coagulants) to be adopted to raise the
quality to that recommended by the CPHEEO.
Monitoring
The project operator will monitor the water source for its quality. Additionally, the
NTADCL will also monitor surface water quality and the quality of water supplied to ensure
that the recommended EMP is being implemented and the risk is averted.

10.5 Closure of Industries due to Environmental Non-compliance
Risk Assessment
As a result of implementation of TADP, the water supply to industries over the time will
increase to about 100 Mld. This in turn will proportionally increase the generation of
industrial effluents.
Until 1995, no effluent treatment was practiced in Tirupur, which led to severe
contamination of surface and ground water in and around Tirupur. In 1996, the TNPCB
directed all effluent generating industries at Tirupur to treat their effluents to discharge
standards either individually or collectively. Since then a serious initiative is underway by
the industries to provide the requisite effluent treatment through a scheme of CETPs and
IETPs. The present design of the treatment systems complies with the effluent standards
prescribed by TNPCB, except for the TDS.
The costs of meeting the TDS standard of 2100 mg/l have been, so far, found to be rather
high and unaffordable. There is, therefore, a risk that some of the industries may not be
able to meet the TDS standard and face closure. This will adversely affect the water
demand and thus the commercial viability of the project.
Manazement
Many industries, which have been directed by TNPCB to take measures to meet the required
effluent standards, have opted for construction of IETPs. The remaining industries have
joined one of the 8 CETP schemes. The present status of the IETPs and the CETPs with
respect to their number and stage of progress is presented in Table 10.2.

Environmental and Social Assessment Repor
Tirupur Area Development Project                             Risk Management
In is evident from Table 10.2 that significant progress has been made at Tirupur towards
achieving effluent treatment capacity for industrial effluents. The risk of closure of a
significant number of industrial units for non-compliance of effluent standards (except for
TDS) is very low.
However, compliance of TDS standard of 2100 mg/l could still be a considered an
important concern. The IETPs, which have been recently constructed on these lines and
are operational, however have a promise to satisfy the TDS standard of 2100 mg/l due to
the strategy of segregation and evaporation of high TDS laden effluents stream. This is
expected to have a multiplier effect and more industries are expected to go in for IETPs.
The designs of CETPs, however, have been done to meet all the parameters specified by
the TNPCB except the TDS and this leaves a considerable gap in the compliance of TDS
standard.
However, a number of initiatives are being attempted by the industries towards reduction
of TDS, which will lead to long term solution of TDS problem in the industrial effluents.
The prominent efforts in this context are on the following lines:
* promote techniques for the minimization of TDS at source by dye substitution. TEA is
expected take a lead in this exercise by holding demonstrations/discussions with the
commercial vendors and impress upon the textile units to practice use of low salt dyes
to the extent possible. Some industries in Tirupur have already started looking at this
option. The TDS levels in the effluent may come down by 25% in the next 4 to 5
years;
* a demonstration facilitv employing reverse osmosis may be set up towards TDS
management at CETPs. Financial support may be sought in direction from State,
National as well as international organizations such as Technology Development
Board, The World Bank, Asian Development Bank, IDBI, ICICI, UJNIDO etc. This
may lead to reduction in the TDS at CETP as well as explore possibility of water reuse
or renovation;
* presently, the industries use ground water having a TDS of 2000 to 4000 mg/l. After the
inception of the project, the treated water supply will have TDS concentrations around
300 mg/l. This is expected to lead to a reduction of effluent TDS concentration by an
average of 2500 mg/l.
Considering the TDS management plan, promises of IETPs and the low TDS levels in the
supply of water, it can be concluded that the TDS concentrations in the industrial effluents
will significantly reduce after implementation of TADP and it may also be possible to meet
the required standard.

Environmental and Social Assessment Report
Tirupur Area Development Project                             Risk Management
Monitoring
The elevated levels of TDS in the industrial effluents get reflected in contamination of
ground and surface waters. The initiatives for the management of TDS, therefore, will have a
direct co-relation with the TDS levels in the environment. Extensive environmental
monitoring has been recommended to provide timely feedback on TDS trends in ground and
surface waters in TLPA under the TADP. A discemable improvement in TDS (as is
anticipated due to supply of low TDS water through TADP and other initiatives), is expected
to help the industries acquire an environmentally responsible status and will further reduce
the risk of closure of industries due to environmental problems.
10.6  Conclusion
Based on the above observations, it may be concluded that all the identified environmental
and social risks due to the construction and operation of the project have been adequately
assessed and mitigated through the recommended EMP and RAP. Also, adequate
precautions have been built through elaborate environmnental monitoring recommendations
to provide a true picture of the performance of the project on environmental and social
aspects.
