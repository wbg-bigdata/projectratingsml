MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO INFRASTRUCTURE LEASING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED
AND A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR A PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE (IL&FS) PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan of US$200 million to Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited
(IL&FS) with the guarantee of India, and a credit of SDR3.4 million to India, the equivalent of
US$5 million, to help finance a Private Infrastructure Finance (IL&FS) Project. The loan would
be at the Bank's standard LIBOR-based interest rate for US$ single currency loans, with a
maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The Government of India (GOI) would charge a
guarantee fee of not less than 1.2% per annum on the outstanding amount of the Bank loan, a
level considered appropriate considering the pioneering role IL&FS is expected to play in
establishing a track record for India in the area of private investment in infrastructure. The
proceeds of the loan would be onlent to subborrowers for a maximum period of 20 years,
including a maximum grace period of 5 years, at a market-determined rate. The crediet will be
on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years. The proceeds will be onlent on the standard
terms and conditions for central assistance to the states applicable at the time.
Private investment in infrastructure
2.    The expansion and efficient use of infrastructure is fast becoming one of India's key
development issues. Of grave concern today is the risk that poor infrastructure will undermine
severely India's ability to achieve its medium- and long-term objectives of higher and sustainable
economic growth. At the root of the problem is a severe absorptive capacity and implementation
constraint which, combined with a financial constraint, has led to chronic underinvestment in the
sector and a less than optimal use of the funds actually made available. Addressing the situation
requires, above all, a redefinition of the role of the public sector in the provision of infrastructure
and the establishment of an appropriate legal, regulatory and administrative framework for
private investment so that the latter can assume a dynamic role in a domain up to now dominated
by the public sector. The impetus for change will have to come primarily from the central and
state governments. A number of steps and policy announcements have already been made in that
direction. The removal of formal barriers to private investment must now be followed by the
establishment of policy and institutional frameworks fully supportive of such investment.
3.    The lack of finance on terms commensurate with the typical long gestation and revenue-
earning capacity of infrastructure projects is also slowing down the pace of private investment in
the sector. The development of a domestic long-term debt market will require a number of
significant policy reforms in the financial sector, particularly as regards regulations applicable to
contractual savings institutions. While such reform program is being formulated and until its key



- 2 -
elements are implemented so that a well-functioning domestic long-term debt market can
emerge, domestic financial institutions will have to play a major role in supporting private
investment in infrastructure. Among these, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services
Limited (IL&FS) stands out as it has been, since its inception in 1988, at the forefront of the
promotion of private investment in infrastructure. One of India's top five non-banking financial
companies, IL&FS is a 51% privately-owned finance company with strong ties to the public
sector, a highly competent and innovative staff, and a high-quality Board. Now that it has built
up its balance sheet to a comfortable size, it is embarking on a major move into infrastructure.
Although its record to date in this area is limited to the successful implementation of a small toll
road in Madhya Pradesh, the company is emerging as the leader in developing the concept for
commercializing infrastructure projects, the associated legal framework as well as financing
alternatives. In the process, IL&FS has displayed an exceptional understanding of the synergy
required between public and private interests for successful infrastructure development As a
result of its initial success and the general liberalization trend of the Indian economy, it is faced
now with the need to raise long-term finance to support its pipeline of projects.
Objectives
4.    The Project aims to develop prototype contractual arrangements for private investment in
IL&FS's areas of involvement (urban bypasses and bridges, water supply and sewerage, effluent
treatment, and other municipal infrastructure), thereby facilitating entry of the private sector on a
much larger scale in areas heretofore dominated by the public sector. In the process, it would
build up India's capacity to attract private investment in infrastructure, pilot-test institutional and
contractual arrangements in a variety of subprojects under various administrative and political
conditions, and help establish a track record as a prerequisite for large scale private investment in
the sector. The Project would also meet the pressing needs of commercial infrastructure project
entities for long-term rupee financing, pending the implementation of financial sector reforms for
the development of a domestic long-term debt market, currently under preparation. Equally
important, it would foster efficiency in the delivery and use of selected infrastructure services,
encourage the establishment of more efficient practices in the construction and operation of
infrastructure projects, and assist in alleviating the severe financial and institutional constraints to
the expansion of infrastructure in India.
Description
5.    The Project will assist IL&FS in financing infrastructure subprojects to be implemented
on a build-operate-and-transfer (BOT) basis (or a variation thereof) and expected to be started
within the next three years. It consists of three interrelated components:
* an investment component in the form of a line of credit to IL&FS, the proceeds of which will
be used to provide long-term finance to special purpose entities established for the
construction and operation of commercial infrastructure projects in IL&FS's pipeline;



- 3 -
* a subproject preparation component to cover specialized consultancy services to advise
public authorities granting the subproject concessions or to assist project developers in
preparing their subprojects; and
* a training and technical assistance component to cover (i) IL&FS's staff development for its
Projects staff, (ii) specific studies that IL&FS is undertaking to facilitate the evaluation and
implementation of commercial infrastructure projects (e.g., legal and regulatory framework
applicable to BOT projects in sectors of IL&FS's interest, innovative financing for
environmental infrastructure in medium-sized cities and townships, traffic forecasting,
willingness to pay and fixation of user charges for water supply and road projects).
Implementation
6.    The Project will be implemented by IL&FS, acting as equity investor and lender to the
special purpose entities. IL&FS has designed a comprehensive system of steps and procedures to
be followed by its staff for appraising subprojects and evaluating subloan applications. The
resulting project cycle is an elaborate and well-thought out project evaluation system. Because
of the size, relative complexity and novelty of the subprojects which the loan will finance, all
subproject appraisal activities will be carried out in close consultation with the Bank. For the
first two subprojects in each sector category, there would be close interaction with the Bank as
appraisal of infrastructure projects is still an area where the company has least experience and
where the Bank can contribute most. In particular, the full documentation on the contractual
framework for the subprojects (e.g., concession agreement, construction contract, O&M contract,
lenders' agreement, shareholders' agreement) will be reviewed in detail by the Bank for their risk
mitigation aspects. This is critical as IL&FS is breaking new grounds in India and is thereby
setting precedents that may potentially become government policies. For all subprojects, IL&FS
will prepare a detailed subproject evaluation report.
7.    The aggregate cost of the subprojects in the pipeline is estimated at about US$1.6 billion,
with a foreign exchange component of about US$686 million. These figures are indicative and
provide an order of magnitude of the investments envisaged. The subprojects would be
developed with a mix of financing comprising: equity from project sponsors and other partners
such as institutional investors (through specialty equity funds), debt financing from contractors
or suppliers, term financing from other domestic financial institutions and the domestic markets
(e.g., through the offering of "toll bonds"), and long-term financing from multilateral agencies
such as the Bank loan. In the aggregate, it is estimated that the Bank loan will finance about
30% of the foreign exchange cost. The IDA credit will finance consultancy services and
associated computer hardware and software to be procured by public authorities for the
negotiation of concession agreements. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in India are presented in Schedules C and D. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 15364-
IN, dated March 8, 1996, is being distributed separately.

8.    Bringing the subprojects to financial closure will require a mix of project development
expertise and relatively novel and complex financial engineering. IL&FS is expected to play a
key catalytic role in the process. Comfort can be taken from its established position as the only
specialized infrastructure finance institution in India, its proven record of success in investment
banking and financial services, and the strategic alliances it has established with foreign
institutional investors. For all subprojects in its pipeline, IL&FS is also laying great emphasis on
aligning the interests of the major stakeholders and the local governments in the success of the
projects.
9.    The proposed loan would be an open line of credit for infrastructure projects. It would
not preclude investments in any particular subsector to take account of the composite nature of
some of the subprojects (e.g., integrated area development). However, the eligibility criteria
applicable to the subprojects emphasize priority to certain sectors and replicability. Proceeds of
the proposed loan would be onlent to the project entities, mainly in the form of rupee term loans
with maturities matching that of the original loan to IL&FS as closely as possible. In most cases
therefore, IL&FS will bear the foreign exchange risk. It will hedge the currency risk by
swapping the proceeds of the Bank loan into back-to-back rupee-denominated loans with the
same repayment structures as the Bank loan. To enable IL&FS to arrange these swap
transactions in a cost-effective manner, a Special Account, with an authorized allocation of
US$25 million, will be established by IL&FS in a commercial bank. The amounts deposited in
the Special Account will be used exclusively for executing swap transactions, and the rupees
obtained will be deposited in a Swap Account from which withdrawals will be made to finance
eligible expenditures under subloans.
Sustainability
10.   The Project will support the implementation of commercial infrastructure projects which
IL&FS is carefully screening for their financial, economic, technical, environmental and social
merits. IL&FS has set as its own eligibility criterion a minimum real financial rate of return of
14% which it considers to be the minimum for attracting private finance. The projects are
structured to generate sufficient revenues to recover capital as well as operating and maintenance
costs through the duration of the concessions. Particular attention is given by IL&FS to
establishing an appropriate institutional framework for the implementation of the projects,
through a pro-active dialogue with GOI on regulatory and legal issues and by establishing
public/private partnerships with state governments and their agencies. IL&FS has developed an
Operating Framework which inter alia sets out a risk management framework and related policies
as well as the company's guidelines and framework of operations. To ensure that IL&FS's
expanded involvement in infrastructure is sustainable in the long run, the Operating Framework
will be strengthened to include a clear set of prudential guidelines for IL&FS, with particular
emphasis on the management of the risks associated with its infrastructure business, and specific
terms and conditions for onlending to infrastructure projects. To ensure that the subprojects
supported under the Project are the result of a fair and responsible contracting and negotiating
process, a small technical assistance component, financed under the IDA credit, has been
included and will be specifically geared to support public contracting parties

Lessons from previous Bank involvement
11.   The Bank has successfully funded numerous operations through financial institutions for
India's industrial, agricultural and housing sectors. More recently, the Bank has agreed to
finance the implementation of fundamental reforms and the modernization of the banking sector.
In the context of the preparation of the 1996 Country Economic Memorandum and of the
proposed Infrastructure Financing Project (FY98), further discussions are taking place to foster
the development of a long-term debt market in India. This will be the first Bank operation with
IL&FS. IFC has made an equity investment and two lines of credit to IL&FS, representing a
total investment of US$45 million and the largest total exposure to a single company in the Asia
Capital Markets's portfolio. IFC recently prepared a draft Investment Assessment Report in
which it stresses the need for both IFC and IBRD to carefully monitor the development of
IL&FS's infrastructure business and the extent to which it modifies the risk profile of what is
currently a very prudently managed enterprise.
Rationale for Bank involvement
12.  IL&FS has made an impressive start in positioning itself as the leading player in the field
of infrastructure financing and has broken new grounds in demonstrating the commercial
viability of infrastructure projects in India. Its growth in the infrastructure business is now
limited by the availability of long-term finance. In the absence of a well-fumctioning long-term
debt market in India, IL&FS has no other option but tap foreign sources for long-term funds.
IFC is not in a position to provide additional funds with the maturities and on the substantially-
increased scale that is now being sought by the company. IL&FS is therefore looking to the
Bank not only as a major provider of much needed long-term funds, but also as a source of
technical expertise. As an innovative and sophisticated finance company already active in the
private infrastructure market, IL&FS is the ideal conduit for channeling the Bank's efforts to
build up India's capacity to attract private investment in infrastructure, thus making the Project
fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Executive Directors on
June 20, 1995.
Agreements reached
13.   Agreement has been reached with IL&FS that:
(i)  it will provide to the Bank, on a timely basis, all important documents and information
submitted to the Board for its consideration;
(ii)  it will implement a comprehensive cost accounting system by product line to be fully
operational by March 31, 1997;
(iii)  it will submit its annual audited accounts to the Bank by June 30 of each year;



(iv)  any material modification to the existing regulatory framework applicable to IL&FS,
that adversely affects the operations of the company, will be an event of default under
the loan;
(v)  it will continue to conduct its operations in accordance with the principles and
procedures enunciated in its Operating Framework, as suitably revised, and that any
material modification to the Operating Framework, without prior approval of the Bank,
will be an event of default under the loan;
(vi)  it will maintain at all times a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.25;
(vii) it will maintain at all times a debt to equity ratio of not more than 6: 1;
(viii) it will apply eligibility criteria, acceptable to the Bank, to all subprojects to be financed
under the loan;
(ix)  it will onlend the proceeds of the loan on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank;
(x)  it will use the amounts deposited in the Special Account exclusively for executing swap
transactions, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, and it will deposit the
rupees obtained thereby in a Swap Account, payments out of which will be used
exclusively for eligible expenditures under the Project; and
(xi)  it will follow a methodology acceptable to the Bank for the economic analysis of
subprojects.
14.   Agreement has been reached with GOI that it will guarantee the proposed loan to IL&FS
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, including the levy of a guarantee fee of not
less than 1.2% on amounts outstanding and disbursed.
15.   Agreement has been reached with GOI and IL&FS that annual management reviews of
the Project will be carried out by April 30 of each year and that a mid-term review of the Project
will be carried out no later than April 30, 1998.
16.   Conditions of effectiveness of the loan to IL&FS will be that:
(i)  IL&FS's Operating Framework has been revised to (a) set definite investment exposure
limits instead of guidelines, (b) limit to one third of its total credit exposure, IL&FS's
credit exposure to infrastructure projects, as suitably defined, (c) limit to 30% of the
company's net worth its aggregate investments in affiliates, as suitably defined, and (d)
treat as equity all expenditures incurred by IL&FS on infrastructure projects prior to
their financial closure;



- 7 -
(ii) GOI and IL&FS have entered into an indemnity agreement on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank; and
(iii)  the security arrangements for the loan have been completed by IL&FS, including the
placement of the loan under the mortgage shared equally with other lenders and the
execution of the intercreditor agreement.
17.   A condition of effectiveness of the development credit will be that the loan to IL&FS has
been made effective.
18.   Conditions of disbursement for the investment component of the loan to IL&FS will be,
with respect to all subprojects, that the Bank will have reviewed and approved each subproject
and that all contracts associated with the implementation of the subproject will have been
executed.
Environmental and social aspects
19.   IL&FS, with assistance from an NGO, has prepared an Environmental and Social Report
(ESR). The ESR: (a) states the company's environmental and social goals; (b) provides the
contextual setting for the environmental and social assessment process; (c) identifies the major
issues in the priority sectors; (d) details the environmental assessment and social assessment
(EA/SA) process that IL&FS will follow when appraising suprojects; (e) outlines methods to
moderate risks and liabilities due to environmental and social factors; (f) specifies the
organizational arrangements in IL&FS to manage the environmental and social assessment
process; and (g) spells out the staff development plan. Relevant regulations, guidelines
(including the Bank's relevant operational directives), checklists and protocols are provided as an
attachment to the report. The Bank "field-tested" the ESR approach in the context of one
subproject and met with various government officials and NGOs to assess their concurrence with
the approach proposed in the ESR.
20.   In the process of preparing the document, IL&FS's management has demonstrated a
strong commitment to implement the ESR and taken a proactive stand for tackling environmental
and social issues. IL&FS clearly sees the EA/SA process as an integral part of its risk
management framework: specific environmental and social risks are identified upfront and
mitigation measures fully integrated into the project design, thereby reducing the risks of delays
during construction and operation that could threaten the project's financial viability. It also
enables IL&FS to screen projects and avoid financing investments for which, for example, land
acquisition may result in costly resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R). IL&FS has brought a few
innovative features into the environmental and social assessment process, such as the
establishment of neighborhood committees or the preparation of annual environmental and social
audits for the company. It has set an example of best practice.
Economic analysis
21.   The economic analysis of the Project will be carried out at the subproject level, on an



- 8 -
investment-by-investment basis. Each subproject will be subject to both a detailed financial
analysis and a conventional economic evaluation by IL&FS, assisted, as necessary, by
specialized consultants. The eligibility criteria which each subproject will need to comply with
include a minimum economic internal rate of return of 12%. The Bank agreed with IL&FS a
methodology to be followed for investments in each sector, including: (i) a clear articulation of
the underlying rationale for the choice of each subproject, (ii) the consistency of the subproject
within future sectoral development plans, including poverty alleviation and growth strategies,
(iii) the identification of the expected beneficiary groups, (iv) the valuation of economic benefits
and costs using appropriate shadow prices, (vi) the identification of the risks of the subproject
and the associated mitigation measures, (vii) the calculation of the economic internal rate of
return (ERR), (viii) the test of first-year benefits (FYB) to check appropriate timing of the
investment, and (ix) the use of incremental analysis in the context of a phased project. These
aspects will be fully documented in the subproject evaluation report which IL&FS will submit to
the Bank for the review and approval of each subloan.
Benefits
22.   At the subproject level, the Project will achieve the benefits normally attributed to
specific infrastructure projects; these will be clearly identified and measured on a case-by-case
basis in the economic evaluation of individual subprojects. At the macroeconomic level, the
Project should be seen as a precursor for greater involvement of domestic financial institutions
and the capital markets in the infrastructure sector. It will enable IL&FS to promote
commercially-viable infrastructure projects on a much wider scale than heretofore. By giving
such investments a clear commercial orientation, the concept adopted by IL&FS for their
implementation is expected to induce better cost recovery, faster construction, the application of
improved maintenance policies, the introduction of technological improvements, better
utilization of the infrastructure capacity, and better interaction between users and providers of
services. The project will also provide the company with the appropriate institution-building and
technical assistance support required to develop it into a successful infrastructure company.
IL&FS will thus have become a rare institution in the developing world, achieving what it does
as a purely indigenous enterprise.
Risks
23.   The pioneering of commercial infrastructure projects in India in itself constitutes a major
risk, particularly in the absence of a well-established administrative, legal and regulatory regime.
To mitigate this risk, IL&FS is using great care in selecting ("cherry-picking") only those
projects which it considers commercially viable, in establishing close partnerships with local
authorities and other stakeholders, and spending significant resources in developing appropriate
contractual frameworks (e.g., concession agreements) for these projects. BOT-type infrastructure
projects are still very new to IL&FS and raise credit risk issues quite different from the more
traditional corporate finance and investment banking business in which IL&FS has so far
excelled. IL&FS is building up a core team of professional staff and has agreed to build into its
appraisal process a greater degree of reliance on outside consultants to complement its own
resources. Systems are being put in place to ensure careful and comprehensive appraisal of



-9-
projects which will be reinforced by a close interaction with the Bank. Another risk stems from
IL&FS's involvement in a number of large and relatively complex projects, leading to a rapid
and considerable expansion of its infrastructure operations. While it has followed until now
prudent management practices, it is crucial that it maintains a proper balance between growth and
sound investments. The financial covenants proposed for this project, including the prudential
guidelines being developed in consultation with IFC, should provide adequate safeguards. The
risk of too rapid a growth is however counterbalanced by the possibility that IL&FS may have
set excessively optimistic targets for implementation of the subprojects in its pipeline. Thus,
embedded in the project is also a risk of delays in disbursing the proposed loan. Finally,
appropriate safeguards have been built into the terms and conditions of the Special Account and
the associated Swap Account so that the funds disbursed from the loan account are used
exclusively for the Project.
Recommendation
24.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve them.
