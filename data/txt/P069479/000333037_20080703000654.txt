F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The main objectives of the proposed project are to:




                                              ii

  (a) improve the operation and management of fishing ports through rehabilitation and
the introduction of community-based fishermen's associations as their managers(to be
called Fisheries Management Organizations, or FMOs);

  (b) introduce an effective institutional framework for community-driven co-
management of marine fisheries resources by involving FMOs and strengthening the
public sector's capacity; and

  (c) restore the country's previous capacity in aquaculture, and explore the potential for
further development of aquaculture, particularly for high value species.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Bank Strategy
The 1998 CAS identified poverty alleviation and human development as strategic priorities for
Albania. A 2001 CAS Progress Report confirmed that these themes would continue to be
priorities. Government had prepared a Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), which
was to provide the basis for a new CAS to be completed in late 2002. The CAS defined three
assistance priorities for IDA: (a) Governance and Institution Building, (b) promotion of
sustainable private sector growth, and (c) promotion of human development and poverty
alleviation.   The CAS further identified the agriculture and fisheries sectors as critical for
sustaining the country's overall growth, and emphasized the importance of community
participation in project implementation.

Government Strategy
In 1999, Government developed a fisheries sector strategy as part of an overall agriculture
strategy (the Green Strategy) that included as pillars: (a) sustainable development of marine and
inland fisheries, (b) restructuring and modernizing of production activities, marketing networks,
fishery industries, and fishing ports, and (c) increasing production in marine and inland
aquaculture while protecting the environment. Unfortunately, the sector strategy did not provide
concrete means and actions for achieving its objectives. Furthermore, it did not elaborate on an
effective institutional framework or on capacity building, and lacked quantifiable indicators for
its stated objectives.

Sector Context
At the time of appraisal, Albania's fisheries sector had been in decline since the demise of the
socialist regime and it accounted for a relatively small portion of the country's economy, with
only about 2,000 families directly involved and dependent on fishing the country's coastal waters
and inland lakes. However, Albania had considerable potential to re-establish and develop its
marine and lake commercial fishing and aquaculture industries. Development of the sector could
provide expanded employment opportunities, increased export earnings, and other contributions
to the national economy, while also establishing sustainable use and capture of benefits from the
nation's potentially very valuable coastal, marine and aquatic resources.

Fishery management and impacts           - At the end of the socialist regime, the institutional
framework for managing fisheries resources and ports had collapsed, and various illegal and
destructive fishing activities were flourishing. Illegal trawling, the lack of enforcement of
regulations, and unlicensed fishing were persistent problems in marine fisheries. Almost all
Albanian vessels, including many that were not licensed for fishing at all, trawled close to the
coast in shallow waters, thereby destroying nursery areas for demersal (bottom dwelling) species.
Foreign trawlers too were operating illegally close to the Albanian coast. These activities alone
had resulted in a significant decline in production. A study carried out by FAO (report published
in 1997) indicated serious over-harvesting of demersal fish stocks in Adriatic and Ionian waters.

The lack of enforcement of fishing regulations was impacting negatively on resources and yields.
While fisheries and aquaculture legislation, including an agreement with FYR Macedonia on
Lake Ohrid, defined regulations on fishing gear, the size and quantity of the permissible fish
catch, as well as closure periods, regulations were not being enforced due to the weak capacity of



                                              1

the Directorate of Fisheries Policies. On Lake Ohrid, about 300 fishing boats were reported to be
operating, whereas only 80 licenses had been issued. The harvest of the endemic Ohrid trout
(Koran) had recently surged as a result of the activities of these illegal fishing boats. Harvest
levels were estimated to be unsustainable, and production was predicted to plunge within a few
years following depletion of breeding stock. In the Adriatic and inland lakes, fishing with the use
of explosives was commonplace.

Institutional arrangements - The Directorate of Fisheries Policies (DoFP), then within the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MOAF), had overall responsibility for the fishery sector. This
included strategic planning for the sector, developing and enforcing regulations, negotiating
agreements with neighboring countries, monitoring, and research.            The Fishery Research
Institute (FRI), also within the Ministry of Agriculture, was designated to carry out assessment of
marine resources and was also involved in freshwater restocking programs for lakes.

At the time of appraisal, DoFP and FRI were severely under-resourced, and unable to fulfill their
mandates.      For example, information on licenses and registration of vessels was largely
maintained in paper files, and was not used as a tool to monitor and control fishing activities.
Some progress was being made to improve data collection and analysis through an FAO-
ADRIAMED Project, which funded development of a Fisheries Management Information System
(FMIS). However, the impact of this technical support would be limited if further assistance
could not be provided to enable DoFP to operationalize the system. Frequent replacements of
experienced staff due to political appointments, and low salaries also contributed to the poor
performance of these key institutions.

The need for fishing community organizations - In order to achieve sustainable development of
the fisheries sector, close collaboration between the Government and the fishing communities
would be essential. Hence the Governments interest in developing a sector strategy that would
include engaging local fishing communities to develop and enforce local fisheries co-
management plans in cooperation with the Government. The fishing communities would also
facilitate the collection of information on marine resources to help improve monitoring by the
Government, which - in turn - would coordinate with regional organizations and neighboring
countries. However, at the time of appraisal, awareness of the concept and potential benefits of
co-management had not yet taken hold, fishing communities had not yet organized, and the
capacity of Government to catalyze and support the necessary change in mindset and behaviors
was very weak.

The absence of fishing community associations undermined efforts to enforce fishing regulations.
Licensed fishermen, most of whom had made a living from fishing since the socialist regime,
were generally aware of the need to enforce fishing regulations, and were very concerned about
the excessive and destructive fishing activities that they frequently observed, particularly in
lagoons and inland lakes where the general public had easy access. The Directorate of Fisheries
Policies was ineffective at enforcing regulations, and individual fishermen acting alone were
unable to assist. Because their traditional fishing rights had not been formalized, Artisanal
fishermen in coastal lagoons were being displaced by larger boats and fishing concerns.
Additionally, some municipalities were prone to intervene in licensing for political advantage.

Fishing ports ­ structure and organization - Fishing ports had formerly been managed and
owned by the fishing cooperatives formed during the socialist regime. At the time of appraisal,
responsibility for administration of fishing ports had been transferred to the respective port
authorities. However, the primary focus of the port authorities was on commercial and passenger
terminals. Hence provision of basic services for the fishing fleet suffered. Landing charges and


                                             2

levies were not being collected, and fishing ports were not being properly maintained and were in
a state of serious deterioration. No fishing ports would have met minimum sanitation and
hygiene standards - access to potable water was severely limited, large piles of solid waste on the
port side, as well as half submerged wrecks in the harbor areas, hindered normal operations.

The status and poor management of fishing port facilities was also an impediment to the
development of coastal and marine tourism, which was seen as a potential alternative source of
income for fishing communities and incentive to protect marine resources. The potential of the
rocky southern coast for sport fishing and diving had not yet been assessed. However, the area
that was not suitable for trawling hosted a variety of sunken wrecks from the Second World War
era, as well as other undersea archeological sites, and seemed likely to host abundant demersal
fish such as grouper. In addition, because of their proximity to Western Europe, there could be
potential for Albanian fishing communities to provide supplies and services for boats cruising the
Adriatic Coast. Since fishing ports would be key entry and departure points for tourists, it would
be essential to keep them clean and well maintained.

The perceived potential for aquaculture - Aquaculture appeared to be a fisheries subsector where
Albania had good potential, given its temperate and proximity to Western European markets. The
development of aquaculture had been one of the priorities of the socialist regime. Approximately
800 hectares of fresh water fish ponds and aquaculture facilities, mostly for carp and trout, were
developed with Chinese and Australian assistance and had been run by cooperatives. Large
reservoirs for hydropower stations in Kukes and Shkodra were also used for extensive carp
aquaculture. Aquaculture of mussels had been conducted on a large-scale on a cooperative farm
in Butrinti Lagoon.

Since the demise of the socialist regime, however, the aquaculture cooperatives had collapsed,
facilities had been abandoned and fallen into disrepair, and no new activities had developed.
With little effort to help former cooperative members organize, it seemed that it would be
possible to restart fresh water aquaculture for domestic markets. Additionally, many irrigation
reservoirs had recently been transferred to water user associations (WUAs), and it was thought
that aquaculture could be introduced to provide additional revenue for operation and maintenance
of WUA irrigation facilities. Albania also appeared to have good potential for marine aquaculture
of high-value species such as shrimp, sea bass and sea bream, which could be sold on
international markets. Aquaculture of these species, it was thought, could provide a lucrative
adjunct or alternative to capture fisheries, thereby easing the pressure on marine resources.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The main objectives of the project were to:

         (a)     Improve the operation and management of fishing ports through rehabilitation
         and the introduction of community-based fishermen's associations as their managers (to
         be called Fisheries Management Organizations, or FMOs);

         (b)     Introduce an effective institutional framework for community-driven co-
         management of marine fisheries resources by involving FMOs and strengthening the
         public sector's capacity; and

         (c)     Restore the country's previous capacity in aquaculture, and explore the potential
         for further development of aquaculture, particularly for high value species.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

There was no formal revision of the PDO or key indicators

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The project would benefit some 1,200 marine and coastal lagoon fishermen and their families,
and some 300 fishermen and their families in the two major lake fisheries (Ohrid and Shkodra).
Through generating greater economic returns within the sector, the project would also indirectly
benefit about 400 marine and fishing industry suppliers and traders, including fish traders and
exporters, fish processors, ship's chandlers, etc.; and a further 400 hundred vessel owners. In
addition, the project would support a large number of farmers and part-time inland fishermen who
would participate in freshwater aquaculture programs to be implemented under the project. A
conservative estimate suggests that the freshwater aquaculture program would benefit about 150
full-time fishermen and their families living near large reservoirs, and about 4,000 families that
are members of WUAs.

The project would not target a particular income group, as its aim was to support development of
the fishery and aquaculture sector per se. Fishing communities include mixed income groups,
including traders, owners of medium-size fishing vessels and small boats, boat crews, and small-
scale (artisanal) fishermen. However, specific project activities were designed to include: (a)
small-scale fishermen, such as the inland fishermen on Lakes Ohrid and Shkodra, (b) lagoon
fishermen, who are now subject to increased competition for fish resources from larger scale
commercial interests, and (c) inland reservoir fishermen, who live in areas where income-earning
opportunities are severely limited. In addition, efforts were made in the process of developing the
coastal FMOs to include crew members as well as boat owners.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

COMPONENT 1: SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY BASED CO-MANAGEMENT OF
FISHERIES (US$3.35 Million)
The aim of this component was to support the fishery sector through the establishment of
community-based Fishery Management Associations (FMOs) and the rehabilitation of fishing
ports. The component supported the preparation of fisheries management plans for the FMOs,
which would include rules and regulations for fishing activities.

Sub-component 1: Rehabilitation of Fishing Port Facilities: This sub-component focused on
small-scale rehabilitation work and/or improvements to facilities at a number of fishing ports and
fish landing sites in order to meet basic international standards of navigation safety and hygiene,
and to support the FMOs' management of these facilities. Project activities included the clean up
of wreckage, repair of damage to essential port facilities (e.g., quays and jetties), and provide
essential infrastructure such as water supply, toilets, an office for the FMOs, and small storage
facilities. Fences were to be constructed to limit access to the fishing ports, help improve security
and maintain hygiene standards. Small landing facilities were to be established on the two lakes
to help fishermen land their catches.

Sub-component 2: Support to Coastal Area Management: This sub-component supported the
institutional strengthening of Fishery Management Organizations to improve their management of
fishing port facilities, and to promote self-regulation as the key to sustainable marine resource



                                               4

management. This sub-component involved the provision of National Coordinators and Regional
Promoters1, international Technical Assistance to the FMOs, preparation of Fishery Management
Plans, marine eco-tourism development, fisheries MCS planning, training and pilot demonstration
program and the demonstration of alternative fishing technologies and artificial reefs (this last
activity was subsequently removed from the project).

COMPONENT 2: AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT (US$2.13 Million)
The Aquaculture Department of the Fishery Research Institute was originally planned to manage
this component which aimed to undertake the following:

Sub-component 1: Support for Restocking Carp: This program envisaged to re-stock carp in
reservoirs to restore extensive carp aquaculture, providing fishermen in large reservoirs with
incentives to organize themselves, solicit contributions from each other, control their fishing
activities and increase their incomes. The main constraint was the absence of community-based
organizations to control fishing activities and maintain the fish stock. State-owned carp hatcheries
had been privatized but these private businesses had not developed as the demand for the carp
fingering had not increased.

Sub-component 2: Support for Restocking Koran in Lake Ohrid: This sub-component aimed to
support the government's program to restock Koran in Lake Ohrid through rehabilitation of the
state-owned hatchery in Lin and through various technical assistance programs. In combination
with the technical assistance provided to the Pogradec FMO this sub-component aimed to
establish controls on fishing on the Albanian side of Lake Ohrid (shared with FYR Macedonia),
and enhance the sustainability of the Ohrid trout fishery. Lake Ohrid trout (Salmo letnica or
Koran in Albanian), is of particular scientific interest as it is endemic to Lake Ohrid. Activities
include the rehabilitation of the Lin Hatchery, improving the management of the restocking
facilities and a program for restocking impact assessment (it has been estimated that these
releases may account for as much as 90% of recruitment to the stock, there are no studies that
prove the cost effectiveness of re-stocking Lake Ohrid with Koran). Using part of the
rehabilitated hatchery, technical assistance was also proposed to conduct experimental research
on the potential of Koran for intensive cultivation to market size.

Sub-component 3: Pilot Aquaculture Development): This sub-component would support the
government's efforts to explore Albania's potential in the aquaculture of new marine and
freshwater species. In particular, the project would provide support to the Fishery Research
Institute (FRI) to carry out the following pilot programs:

         Tilapia - The project intended to support the small-scale demonstration of aquaculture of
         this species to test its technical and financial feasibility and to monitor ecological impact.
         This species cannot over-winter in Albania, and thus it would be very unlikely to cause
         ecological problems. A small hatchery was intended to be developed at the FRI in Tapesa
         (near Durres) to raise tilapia fingerlings. Grow-out would then be tested in cages installed
         at irrigation reservoirs managed by water user associations (WUA).

         Eel - The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a high value species known to be widely
         distributed in the lagoons and rivers along the Albanian Adriatic Sea. Eel have
         traditionally been caught and consumed in Albania and are currently being fished


1Later termed Local Promoters




                                                 5

         commercially but there is no information on the availability of elvers. A small-scale stock
         assessment survey would be carried out in two stages ­ the first stage to organize a
         resource survey and train fishermen and the second stage to sample catch elvers when
         they arrive in late winter/early spring.

         Exploration of High Value Marine Aquaculture ­ Shrimp - Support was proposed for the
         development of an aquaculture centre at the abandoned ex-state carp farms in Kavaja in
         order to demonstrate the technical and financial viability of shrimp aquaculture (other
         high value species such as sea bass and sea bream were also originally included in the
         project concept and pre-appraisal, but later removed because of the high investment costs
         and existing private sector involvement). Considering the high risks, implementation was
         planned in two phases: Phase 1 (2002-3) involved the grow-out of shrimps using semi-
         intensive culture involving the construction of 6 grow-out ponds and Phase 2 (2004),
         dependent upon the results of Phase 1 a shrimp hatchery was to be constructed.

         Mussel Marketing - The technology for mussel aquaculture has existed in Albania for
         many years but there was at project design an EU ban on exporting live mussels since the
         outbreak of cholera in 1994. Technical assistance and equipment was to be provided to
         assist in resuming exports to the EU.

COMPONENT 3: SUPPORT FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR (US$ 0.25 Million)
A key priority for this component was the preparation and implementation of a training plan for
the staff of both the DoFP and the FRI, including the regionally based Fisheries Inspectors.

Sub-component 1: Technical Assistance for the Directorate of Fisheries Policies: Legal training
and assistance to negotiate bilateral agreements with neighboring countries is important given the
multi-species nature of the demersal fish stocks in the Adriatic and the shared fish stocks in the
inland lakes that straddle the borders of Montenegro and Macedonia. Legal assistance will
support the DoFP in reviewing, developing or amending various laws, particularly in relation to
establishing FMOs and improving integrated coastal zone management and MCS. Support to the
Development of a Fisheries Management Information System (FMIS) for the sector will also be
provided.

Sub-component 2: Technical Assistance for the FRI: The Fisheries Research Institute was
institutionally very weak and at project design lacked a formal relationship with the Fisheries
Directorate. Increasingly it needs to be able to obtain its own funding, contribute to regional
research projects and contribute to the co-management of fisheries resources. Activities include
the preparation of a business/management plan and the funding of minor renovation works and
equipment.

COMPONENT 4: PROJECT MANAGEMENT (US$0.78 Million)
This component provided support for project administration and implementation including
incremental operation costs for a project management unit (PMU), and technical assistance for
project implementation e.g., financial management, procurement, auditing and co-ordination of
the FMA and public sector training program.

1.6 Revised Components

While no formal revision of components was undertaken, the scope and scale of some activities
were adjusted during implementation, as outlined in section 1.7.



                                               6

1.7 Other significant changes

Project components were not revised. However, adjustments in the scope or scale of activities
undertaken during implementation included the following:

Under Component 1: Support for community- based co-management of fisheries, "rehabilitation
of fishing port facilities" the PAD envisaged an allocation of about US$160,000 to purchase
goods needed upgrade the existing port of Durres with mobile facilities that could be moved in 4-
6 years when Government was planning to move the Durres fishing fleet to a new fishing port
site. This would be necessary to accommodate an anticipated increasing need for ferry boat
traffic. However, events moved faster than anticipated and the fishing fleet was required to move
out of the existing port with less than a years notice. Consequently, the ministry requested and
the Bank concurred that the goods allocation initially envisaged for Durres under the project be
shifted to TA, and additional project funds allocated to TA, up to a total of about US$400,000 in
order to undertake feasibility work for construction of a new purpose-built fisheries port. The
feasibility studies (i.e., an environmental impact assessment, an economic feasibility study, and a
port management plan) were subsequently used to successfully help leverage a credit for the
necessary investments of about $9 million from the Islamic Development Bank

Under Component 2: Aquaculture development

Several activities were adjusted in scale or dropped when it became apparent that the rationale for
IDA support was questionable.        For example, while additional resources were allocated to
complete the successful hatchery koran trout at Lin on Lake Ohrid, tilapia hatchery trials were
dropped when it became apparent that the costs of over-wintering brood stock of this tropical
species undermined the economic viability of using the species. The high initial cost of facilities,
together with the questionable availability and reliability of supply of wild elvers led to the
decision to discontinue eel cultivation early in project implementation.

Under Component 3: Support for the Public Sector

Project resources allocated for provision of international technical support for the Directorate of
Fisheries Policies to assist with developing fisheries sector strategy and annual program planning
were increased following cancellation (in 2004) of an earlier anticipated EU project
"EUROPEAID/112668/D/SV/AL Technical Assistance to the Fishery Directorate", which had
been identified in 1999 but was then never implemented.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project was originally envisaged in 1998 as a component of an Agricultural Services Project
financed by IDA and, at the initial conceptual stage, was largely focused on developing Albania's
capacity for aquaculture.       However, given the differences in beneficiary communities,
geographical coverage and technologies, the decision was made in 1999 to develop a stand alone
fisheries project. During preparation the focus of the project shifted to emphasize rehabilitation of
fishing ports and establishment of lake fish landing sites; building fishing community
organizations, and introducing the concept of co-management of fisheries resources by fishing
communities in partnership with Government.

Detailed preparation, mostly undertaken between late 2000 and late 2001, involved an appropriate
range of technical expertise including a ports engineer, a fisheries management and planning
specialist, an aquaculture specialist, ecologist, legal expert, and a socio-economist. Project design
drew on worldwide experience of development initiatives based on decentralization of
management responsibilities from the central government to local government and community
organizations (e.g., water user associations, communal forestry and pasture associations).

In Albania, IDA was already experiencing some success in pioneering initiatives based on local
and community based organizations (e.g., Water User Associations in the Irrigation Project,
village credit committees in the Rural Development Project, communal forestry and pasture
associations in the Forestry Project, and community associations in the Urban Land Management
Project). Based on the lessons learned in these operations, fishing communities were involved in
project preparation from the earliest stages, and their inputs and opinions contributed
substantively to project design.

Government commitment was demonstrated by their participation in preparation, and by
establishing legislation that would provide the legal basis for development of the sector and
implementation of project activities. During preparation, a draft amendment to the Law on
Fisheries and Aquaculture, which provided the legal basis for establishing FMOs, was submitted
to Parliament; and transfer of responsibility for management of fishing ports to FMOs was
authorized. Government participated in preparation primarily by establishing a Project
Preparation Unit (PPU) of four full time staff, as well as two consultants - former senior
government fisheries staff - who represented the fishing communities and facilitated organization
of the first FMOs, which were formally established following adoption of the amended law.

At the time of appraisal, the EU/EUROPE AIDE project envisaged providing long term technical
support to build the capacity of DoFP and help develop sector policy and strategy, as well as
investing in construction of several wholesale fish markets and slipways for repairing fishing
vessels.    Consequently, the PFDP was designed to compliment these interventions.               The
EUROPEAID project (/112668/D/SV/AL "Technical Assistance to the Fishery Directorate"), was
identified in 1999 at the same time as the PFDP was identified, but it was never implemented and
was eventually dropped from the EU portfolio in 2004 (i.e., more than two years after launch of
the PFDP).

QAG assessed the project for Quality at Entry in 2002, and assigned an overall rating of
Satisfactory, and Highly Satisfactory for strategic relevance and approach, and noted that the



                                               8

project was an "innovative and high risk operation" that the panel found to be the right choice to
implement an "important and viable operation in a sector, which was in complete disarray after
the break up of the central government controls under the socialist era of the past".

Assessment of Risks

The project was assessed as highly risky at appraisal, mainly because of the almost complete
breakdown of institutional arrangements for administration and management of the fisheries
sector, with rampant use of illegal, destructive and unsustainable fishing techniques, the fishing
fleet and ports in a state of advanced disrepair, and an overall perception that the sector was in
irredeemable decline. Although the introduction of community driven approaches had yielded
initially promising results in other sectors, transfer of administrative responsibility for port and
landing facilities to fishing communities was untested in the Balkans, and the fishing fraternity
appeared so anarchic that the feasibility of establishing functional FMOs seemed questionable.
Nevertheless, providing hard investments in the initial upgrade of ports, combined with a
systematic effort to organize and empower fishing communities appeared to be the most
appropriate strategy to bring order to bear in the sector.

The following risk factors and mitigating measures were identified at appraisal ­ with an overall
risk rating of H (High):

2.2 Implementation

Positive factors

Capable, empowered and continuous project leadership ­ Implementation benefited greatly from
the quality and continuity of the project management team, as well as the level of authority it had
been assigned to make decisions, and its ability to remain independent from shifting local and
national political pressures. Project achievements in changing attitudes toward the sector and
developing the commitment of fishing communities towards sustainable fishery management
should not be under-estimated. These achievements can be attributed, to a significant extent, to
the sustained efforts of a project director (who was known and respected at the level of the
fisheries sector, and among the fishing communities) supported by a committed PMU team that
were able to provide continuity in the delivery of this geographically wide-spread, and technically
challenging project.

Flexibility and coordination with other projects during implementation ­ The project was able to
enhance some impacts by coordinating with parallel development initiatives, and collaborating
opportunistically to take advantage of synergies. Reallocation of about $400,000 of planned
expenditures from goods to services needed to undertake a feasibility study and environmental
impact assessment helped leverage an additional $9 million credit for construction of a new
fisheries port at Durres. Collaboration with the Italian NGO COOPI, which was formalized in the
context of a Memorandum of Understanding, ensured that parallel funding made available by the
Italian Government, was used for complimentary investments and training needed to establish the
FMO and a fisheries center at Lake Shkodra. Also, recommendations for development of tourism
based on coastal resources are being followed up under the Coastal Zone Management and Clean
Up IDA project.

Fuel subsidy - Fuel is of particular importance for the marine fleet, which is comprised of largely
old and fuel inefficient vessels. The availability of subsidized fuel to fishing vessels via FMOs
provided additional economic incentive for vessel owners to join FMOs. Additionally, a levy
charged by FMOs for delivery of the fuel constituted a significant contribution to running costs,
which further assisted the initial establishment and operation of these new community based
organizations. Subsidized fuel was made available to vessel owners in all four coastal ports from
mid-February 2004, and additional reductions in the price of fuel were made by government from
1st July 2006.

Supervision effort - The Bank team, including instrumental technical guidance on fishing port
rehabilitation and operation under the FAO CP program, provided substantive support through
frequent informal and formal supervision in all phases of the project from identification through
to closure. Members of the Bank/FAO supervision team visited Albania and all project sites


                                              10

approximately six times annually, with the most frequent interactions taking place during the first
three years of implementation. The Bank team was responsive in providing or suggesting
solutions to obstacles to implementation, and followed-up systematically until corrective action
was taken.


Negative factors

Limited capacity and budgetary support - DoFP has remained largely under-funded and under
staffed throughout the implementation period, and this has compromised its ability to fully
assume its role as the key partner to FMOs in implementing co-management of the fishery sector.
The situation was exacerbated following government reorganization at the end of 2005 when
DoFP was transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to the Ministry of
Environment, Forestry and Water Administration (MEFWA), whereby government budget for
year 2006 included provision for only recurrent costs. The continuity of management provided by
an adequately resourced PMU helped mitigate impacts on project outcomes. However, current
staffing and budgetary limitations may continue to delay further development and effective
operation of co-management of fishery resources.

Government inflexibility regarding reallocation of funds across disbursement categories ­ Cost
savings, together with windfall gains derived from currency fluctuations, led to the availability of
a surplus of unallocated funds of about US$1.2 million in the final year of project implementation.
While the initial IDA allocation of $5.6 million has been disbursed and project achievements
have been substantially achieved, more could have been achieved and the sustainability of project
outcomes could have been further enhanced if some of the funding surplus could have been used
on technical assistance priorities that were identified in October 2006 ­ when the scale of the
surplus became apparent. Priorities identified at that time included: (i) training of DoFP and
FMO staff to implement fishery management plans and operationalize co-management; (ii) stock
assessment of the Ohrid fishery to help guide optimal restocking and harvesting regimes, (iii) a
dredging feasibility study that could have been used to leverage donor support for works needed
to maintain access of the fishing fleet to all main fishing ports, and (iv) a social assessment
needed to better define project impacts and target future investments in the sector. However,
Government policy limits the proportion of IDA project funding that can be used on TA, and
allocation of surplus funding on additional TA was not permitted, despite a appeals made by
MEFWA and the Bank. As a consequence, some surplus funding that it has not been possible to
spend before project closure on goods or works (about $0.5 million) will be lost to the country,
and an opportunity to enhance project impacts has been missed.

Procurement skills ­ While the technical and managerial capacity of PMU staff was high, initial
lack of familiarity with World Bank procedures led to errors in following procedures and some
delays in procurement.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Assessment of Risks

The Logical Project Framework provided in the 1st Annual Workplan remained largely un-
changed throughout implementation. Monitoring indicators specified in the framework (related to
project inputs, outputs and impact) were referred to fairly consistently, although it was not
possible to regularly update all data sets. During project implementation monitoring of
achievement against some of the indicators was satisfactory, particularly for output indicators
(e.g., number of FMOs established, number of ports managed, number of fishermen engaged in




                                             11

aquaculture, etc). Assessment of achievement against some of the more qualitative indicators
associated with changes in attitude and capacity building have been more problematic.

M&E could, perhaps, have been more useful had it been possible to gather baseline data in a
standardized and repeatable manner during the socio-economic assessment that was undertaken
during project design.      Instead, the comprehensive household survey that was undertaken
proposed key performance indicators including those that would require the collection of
additional baseline data, as well as process indicators, output indicators and project impact
indicators (see below). Those marked with  were later incorporated in M&E system:

· Numberofassociations(FMOs)established();
· Numberof people,by typeof member,joiningassociationsand actively participatingin
    association activities ();
· Numberoffishingzonescoveredby activeassociations();
· Numberof peopletrainedinassociation management,fisheriesmanagement,fish
    reproduction, fishing techniques, and other educational programs relevant to the fisheries
    industry ();
· Numberoffishreproducedineachfishingzone;

    members in each fishing zone (partial );
· Absolutesize offish populationsandtheirgrowthratesineachfishing zone;
· Numberof peopleactively fishingineachfishingzone;and
· Amountofincomeby householdsderivedfromfishing-related activities.

A management information database has been used throughout implementation to monitor the
execution and progress of civil works, the training program and other institutional development
inputs; and M&E data was updated and included in each quarterly and annual report.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
The safeguard policies applicable to this project, as specified in the PAD were:

     Policy                                                                 Applicability
    Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01)                    Yes
    Natural Habitats (OP 4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04)                            Yes
    Forestry (OP 4.36, GP 4.36)                                             No
    Pest Management (OP 4.09)                                               No

    Projects in International Waters (OP 7.50, BP 7.50, GP 7.50)            Yes
    Projects in Disputed Areas (OP 7.60, BP 7.60, GP 7.60)*                 No

Environmental impacts ­ an overall, longer term, goals of the project was to achieve significant
and sustained beneficial environmental impacts through halting unsustainable fishing practices
that are destructive of marine and coastal ecosystems and also threaten endemic populations of
aquatic fish. Environmental impacts that could have resulted from project investments were



                                              12

modest, and associated mainly with possible contamination of ports following disturbance of
sediments by construction works, and the possibility that fishing pressure would actually increase
following improvement in marine port facilities and lake landing sites. These potential risks were
balanced against the beneficial impacts of cleaning up of port facilities, introducing waste
collection and management of port and landing facilities, and the longer term establishment of
sustainable fish harvesting through co-management of resources. The restocking programs of
Koran trout in Ohrid lake, and carp fingerlings delivered to ponds and reservoirs for inland FMOs
would also help reduce the pressure on fish stocks and marine resources. Environmental issues
were addressed in detail in the Project Implementation Plan (prepared in November 2001) and its
environmental monitoring plan.

Financial management was handled satisfactorily. The financial monitoring reports were
prepared and submitted on time. Project financial statements were audited on an annual basis by
independent auditors and all audit reports had unqualified (clean) opinions. During the review of
the audited financial statements from 2003 to 2006 no issues related to the internal control
systems, accounting and administrative matters were raised by the auditor in their management
letter. The financial management supervision were carried out in two main ways: (i) review of the
project's quarterly financial monitoring reports as well as the project's annual audited financial
statements and auditor's management letters; and (ii) during the Bank's supervision missions,
review the project's financial management and disbursement arrangements to ensure compliance
with the Bank's minimum requirements.

Procurement under the project has been generally acceptable to the Bank. Post reviews were
conducted annually and only minor procedural errors were raised by the Bank team. Record-
keeping of procurement documents was adequate. At the time of project launch, while the
technical and managerial capacity of PMU staff was high, procurement expertise was less
adequate. Lack of familiarity with World Bank procurement procedures led to some delays in
carrying out the procurement activities. However, with the support of procurement training
courses, difficulties faced during first two years were corrected over the course of implementation
and, by project completion, procurement capacity had increased substantially.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Value of the fisheries sector to Albania - Assessments undertaken during project implementation
suggest that the current value of marine and lake fish landed, processed, marketed locally and
exported is approximately US$32 million, with the potential to grow to US$50 million with
improvements in harvesting, processing and marketing. The sector has important local upstream
and downstream multiplier benefits and employs upwards of 4,000 people in fishing, processing
and fisheries related industries. It also has the potential to contribute significantly, through the
supply of fresh fish and opportunities for employment and recreation, to the rapidly developing
tourism sector (in particular along the coast). Furthermore, the EU has a Community Action Plan
for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources in the Mediterranean under
the Common Fisheries Policy, supported by Regulation 1967/2006. Albania would need to be
compliant with this action plan in order to conform with EU membership requirements.

In order to capture these significant economic, social, environmental and political benefits, the
Albanian Government would need to build on the achievements gained with the support of the
PFDP to ensure the sustainability of the FMOs and further develop an effective fisheries co-
management system. In the absence of continued targeted efforts on the part of Government to
establish sustainable co-management of the fisheries sector, fishing port facilities financed under
the PFDP may fall into disrepair, the emerging fish resource co-management system will not


                                               13

develop, fishing effort is likely to become unsustainable with catches declining, and the loss of
livelihoods and opportunities for alternative employment with tourism based on marine resources.
Such a scenario may also undermine Albania's progress toward assuming the obligations of EU
membership.

Fisheries Co-Management is the sharing of responsibility between the State and user-groups to
ensure sustainable management of resources. It is one solution to the growing problems of
resource over-exploitation, and is finding increasing favor in the re-organization of fisheries
management systems in many countries around the world, including the EU, USA and Australia.
Current approaches to fisheries management recognize that, even where the State has access to
adequate resources to cover the full costs of fisheries enforcement, `bottom up approaches' to
developing and implementing fisheries management systems are much more likely to be
successful and affordable. Under co-management systems, formalized user groups (FMOs) jointly
develop and enforce fishing regulations, including those that govern the types of fishing gear that
may be used, closed seasons and restricted areas for spawning, and catch quotas. If fishers and
fishing communities are adequately involved in developing regulations, co-management can build
ownership and can lead to effective and affordable implementation of the governance structure.

The need to adopt and implement the fisheries sector strategy ­

Implementation of provisions included in the sector strategy and action plan that is currently
being finalized for approval by the Cabinet of Ministers could enable Albania to capitalize on
project investments and establish effective, sustainable co-management of the fishery sector. In
particular, in accordance with the sector strategy, in the medium term DFP should:

    ·   Ensure that adequate public investments in port maintenance and dredging are effected in
        a timely manner.

    ·   Play an active role in supporting and guiding FMOs to ensure their effective management
        of fishing ports and landing sites. This may initially requires regular inspection of ports
        and landing sites to review FMO management procedures and their application on site.

    · Arrange for formal adoption and implementation of fishery co-management plans by
        Government and FMOs. This will entail following up with further promotional and
        communications initiatives to ensure that the vessel owners and crew are fully aware of
        the benefits of collaborating with the FMOs, DFP and the Fishery Inspectorate to
        implement the co-management system.

     · Finalize and fully implement the Fishery Management Information, and the Monitoring
         Control and Surveillance systems, and use information derived from these tools to
         inform stakeholders, guide management of the sector, and refine supporting policy and
         regulations.

     · Reactivate the bilateral fishery commission for Lake Ohrid, and explore options to build
         awareness and ownership of sustainable co-management through FMO contribution
         toward continued operation of the Lin Hatchery.

    ·   Facilitate organization of annual carp fingerling restocking program as necessary.

The need for continued support to FMOs to ensure their survival and sustainable operation as
key partners in the governance and management of the sector ­


                                               14

Exemption of Excise Tax on Fuel - Fishing vessel owners have been exempted from the need to
pay excise tax on fuel at all four coastal ports since February 2004. The cheaper fuel was
distributed by the FMOs through refueling facilities that were financed with PFDP resources at
the request of the government. A Commission was appointed to monitor the supply of duty-free
fuel to the fishing fleet and a government decision specified the maximum volumes to be sold at
each port ­ an initial total for the four marine ports of about 32.6 million liters annually, revised
later down to 21 million liters of which effectively only an estimated 10.8 million are consumed.
The excise tax exemption on the fuel consumed equates with a subsidy to the marine fishing fleet
and FMOs of about US$4.0 million annually. Such duty exemption on fuel is common practice
in the EU, for example, where registered fishing vessel owners frequently are exempt from
paying excise tax on fuel.

How FMO Operating Costs are Financed ­ For FMOs to function efficiently as independent
stakeholder organizations ­ operating as potential resource co-managers and as port operators -
they need to cover costs, rather than be reliant on State support. This need has been partially
addressed with support form the PFDP through provision of training and the preparation of
operational business plans for each of the six main FMOs. Each plan was tailored to the specific
needs and wishes of the local FMO membership, which decided on the balance of options for
raising revenue, through a combination of membership fees and user charges (e.g., service fees
from the sale of fuel, water, use of workshop facilities, berthing/mooring fees etc). In total the
four marine and two lake FMOs are capable, based on the existing size of the fleet, of generating
estimated revenue (within the formal economy) of about US$180,000 annually. This income is
directly invested in employing people and maintaining the ports. Since February 2004, a
significant proportion of this collective income is derived from the sale of fuel, where FMOs
charge a levy of about Lek 1.6-2/lt to deliver the tax free fixed price fuel to registered FMO
members.

Challenges to the Economic sustainability of FMOs - In June 2007, the Ministry of Finance has
lifted the fuel assistance to FMOs due to concerns of abuse and because the policy did not have
the expected effect towards fostering formalization of the sector. In its place, MoF is proposing
price supports for landed catch, which would be conflicting with the EU's Common Fisheries
Policies. As a consequence of the current situation, at the time of ICR preparation, many marine
fishing vessels had ceased operations, and some vessel owners were indicating that they had little
incentive to pay service charges to the FMOs. Significantly, marine FMO income has dropped
more than 50% by some estimates and, hence, their ability to manage the ports ­ let alone act as
partners in developing sustainable co-management of the resource - had been seriously impacted.
Additionally, of the fishing vessels that are continuing to operate, many are reported to be turning
to fuel vendors in neighboring countries, a practice that incurs losses (in terms of additional fuel
used as well time that could be spent fishing) associated with the need to travel greater distances
to buy the fuel. This erodes the economic viability of even the larger fishing vessels, and leads to
a loss of returns to local fuel suppliers and the economy. Based on assessment of marine FMO
financing needs undertaken during the ICR mission, it appears that the marine FMOs may have
difficulty surviving in the medium term in the continued absence of access to subsidized fuel for
onward sale to fishing vessels, and many fishing vessels may cease to operate. While some
reduction in the size of the, largely outdated fishing fleet is to be expected and even desirable,
failure of the marine FMOs would equate with loss of the institutional mechanism put in place
under the PFDP to provide for operation and maintenance of fishing port facilities, and co-
management of the fishery resource.




                                               15

Considering the case for phasing out fuel subsidy to the marine fishing fleet - Given
seriousness of the threat to FMO sustainability that appears to have resulted from the shock of
immediately eliminating the concession on subsidized fuel, there may be an argument to support
return of the subsidy, but with a view to phase out over a prescribed period. The Ministry of
Finance may consider undertaking a cost-benefit assessment of the trade off between providing
some form of concession on the sale of duty free fuel versus the actual and potential losses to the
economy that could be associated with failure of the FMOs, a downsizing of the sector, and the
developing practice of boat owners to purchase fuel in neighboring countries. In a worst case
scenario the trade off could be between the virtual collapse of governance in the fisheries sector
with the loss of a significant proportion of the value of annual landings (currently US$32 million
with the potential to increase to $50 million) and around 4,000 associated jobs, degradation of
fishing port facilities financed under the PFDP, and possible delays in conforming to EU
standards; versus a continuation of the supply of duty-free fuel, initially at the current rate of duty
exemption at a cost to the economy of about US$4.0 million annually, but phased out over a
period of about five years, while the FMOs consolidate their financial basis and role as partners
with government to ensure sustainable co-management of Albania's marine resources.

At the same time, the FMOS should explore all options for reducing dependency on income from
the sale of subsidized fuel, and should update their business plans and projections accordingly;
and any subsequent donor support for the fisheries sector should, as a priority, continue to help
build the capacity of the FMO institutional co-management framework that has been established
under the PFDP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Project objectives and approaches continue to have relevance for Albania's current development
priorities and the Bank's program. Priorities of the 2001 CAS Progress Report included: (i)
governance and institution building, (ii) promotion of sustainable private sector growth, and (iii)
human development and poverty alleviation. It further identified the agriculture and fisheries
sectors as critical for sustaining the country's overall growth, and emphasized the importance of
community participation in project implementation.          The January 2006 CAS emphasizes
continuing to support Albania's efforts to improve governance, but with greater selectivity,
including a focus on continued economic growth through support to private sector development,
and recognition of the role of community driven approaches to ensure effectiveness of poverty
reduction efforts.    Establishing and now operationalizing the FMOs has already achieved
significant progress in decentralizing responsibility for management of port facilities and fishery
resources, thereby laying the basis for greatly improved governance and equitable economic
development. However, further collaborative efforts on the part of Government and the FMOs
will be necessary to fully achieve these goals.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The three main objectives of the project were to:

         (a) Improve the operation and management of fishing ports through their rehabilitation
         and the introduction of community based organizations (i.e., the FMOs) that would take
         over management of the ports,

         (b) Introduce an effective institutional framework for community-driven co-management
         of marine resources by involving FMOs and strengthening the public sector's capacity,
         and

         (c) Restore the country's previous capacity in aquaculture, and explore the potential for
         further development of aquaculture, particularly for high value species.

Given the baseline conditions prevailing at the time of appraisal, these objectives were
particularly ambitious ­ as reflected by the overall risk assessment of the project on entry.
Nevertheless, the project substantially achieved objectives (a) and (b) through investing in marine
fishing ports and lake fish landing site infrastructure, supporting the establishment and capacity
building of 13 FMOs (covering all marine and lake fisheries areas in the country) and the transfer
of responsibility for managing fishing ports to FMOs, developing fisheries co-management plans,
and contributing toward development of sector policy, strategy and planning. The project also
contributed toward achieving objective (c), significantly by re-establishing capacity for
aquaculture production of koran fingerlings for restocking lake Ohrid, resuming the carp
restocking program to inland lakes and reservoirs, and exploring the economic viability of
innovative options for developing commercial aquaculture of other species by the private sector.

A summary of ratings and achievements by sub component follows.




                                               17

COMPONENT 1: SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY-BASED CO-MANAGEMENT OF
FISHERIES. (US$ 3.85 million) Overall rating: Satisfactory.

Rehabilitation of Fishing Port Facilities: Highly Satisfactory.
By project closure all small-scale rehabilitation work and/or improvements to facilities at four
fishing ports and three lake fish landing sites has been completed. Thirteen FMOs, covering all
marine and lake fisheries in the country, have been established, and port transfer agreements are
either in place (in Vlora, Durres, Saranda, Zogaj and Shiroka) or in the process of being
established (in Shengjin and Udenisht). All FMOs have business management plans, and
executive staff has been appointed in all fishing ports. All four marine FMO operating costs,
including staff salaries, are covered from membership and vessel service fees (for fuel, electricity
and potable water supply). The Lake Ohrid and Shkodra lake FMOs are not yet self-financing, as
opportunities for income generation are more limited by the scale of the fishery and type of
vessels used, but there is potential to achieve this objective in the medium term. Significantly,
project resources were used opportunistically to undertake feasibility studies that, subsequently,
leveraged provision a $9 million credit from the Islamic Development Bank for development of a
new fishing port at Durres.

Support to Coastal Area Management: Satisfactory.
Under this sub-component, the project made significant progress toward establishing the
institutional framework for community driven sustainable fishery resource management.
Following their establishment, DoFP is now piloting issuance of licenses for fishing vessels to
FMOs rather than individual vessel owners, thereby greatly reducing administrative burden, and
transferring authority for supervising fishing effort to the fishing communities. Fishery co-
management plans were prepared for the marine fishery and each of the lake fisheries in early
2005. The project further contributed toward building capacity for fishery resource management
through implementing a pilot Monitoring Control and Surveillance (MCS) demonstration project,
preparing an MCS operational manual, and providing training for FMO members in Shengjin and
Lake Shkodra. The institutional framework for fishing communities to work with Government to
implement fishery co-management plans is largely in place. Implementing the plans would
further improve control of access to prohibited fishing grounds and seasonal restrictions, better
enforce trawl fishing gear and net size regulations, and operationalize procedures for collection
and delivery of statistical data to DoFP needed to monitor and manage the resource sustainably.

Also under this sub-component, an eco-tourism diving survey was completed in late 2006. Its
findings and recommendations have been followed up under the IDA financed Integrated Coastal
Zone Management & Clean-Up Project, and will by the end of 2007 see the introduction of
national legislation on recreational diving that will help to guide strategic planning of marine and
coastal tourism in southern Albania.

COMPONENT 2: AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT (US$1.03 million).
Overall rating satisfactory

Support for Restocking Carp: Satisfactory.
An analysis of landing data suggests that lake productivity has increased four-fold since
restocking was initiated. This has resulted in an increase in the income of FMO members and the
likelihood that FMOs will finance continued restocking of reservoirs with carp fingerlings
following closure of the project. The targets set for this project activity in terms of wide
distribution of socio-economic benefits among five different FMOs and a larger number of
WUAs have been achieved. Production of carp species in reservoirs through the regeneration and
redevelopment of traditional extensive aquaculture appears to have been a success.


                                              18

Support for Restocking Koran in Lake Ohrid: Satisfactory.
The project supported the government program to restock Koran in Lake Ohrid through
rehabilitation of the state-owned hatchery in Lin. The hatchery is now functioning well and
effectively implementing an annual cycle of collecting and fertilizing eggs from wild spawning
fish, rearing larvae, and then tagging and releasing fingerlings at about 9 months of age, thereby
increasing survival rates for this portion of the life cycle from about 3% (as in the wild) to more
than 90% (in the hatchery). Project support has increased the annual capacity of the hatchery
from only about 200,000 larvae to about one million fingerlings. Released fingerlings are being
tagged so that data made available as they are recaptured over the next several years will enable
assessment of the proportion of Lin hatchery inputs to overall recruitment to the fishery.
Government is committed to maintaining this level of activity to compliment parallel initiatives in
Macedonia and, with the establishment of the Ohrid FMO, the opportunity now exists to explore
options for FMO contribution toward running costs of the hatchery in the context fisheries co-
management.

Pilot Aquaculture Development: Satisfactory.
Pilot demonstration of aquaculture of high-value species, including tilapia, shrimp and eel, were
completed or discontinued for appropriate reasons. Trials of shrimp aquaculture in Kavaja,
undertaken over a three year period, confirmed that extensive aquaculture and an annual
production cycle could produce 0.2 tons per hectare in Albanian conditions. Based on these
findings, technical and financial guidelines for potential investors were prepared.           Tilapia
hatchery trials were dropped when it became apparent that fingerlings and brood stock could not
survive in ambient winter temperatures. The high initial cost of facilities, together with the
questionable availability and reliability of supply of wild elvers led to the decision to discontinue
eel cultivation early in project implementation.

COMPONENT 3: INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR. (US$ 0.17
million) Overall rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Technical Assistance for the Directorate of Fisheries Policies: Moderately Satisfactory.
At appraisal, provision of a relatively modest level of technical support for DoFP was envisaged
under this component. This was to include provision of legal assistance and training, and also
technical assistance to develop a Fisheries Management Information System (FMIS) for the
sector. Legal assistance and training was to support preparation of technical documents to
negotiate bilateral agreements with neighboring countries, as well as review and develop
legislation with emphasis on the establishment of FMOs (as semi-private organizations that also
serve public interest). However, since the legal framework for FMOs was largely established
before effectiveness, and the needs for provision of additional legal training was subsequently
provided by FAO, the emphasis of this component shifted during implementation to: (a)
providing overall technical backup for project implementation, and (b) supporting development of
sector policy, strategy and planning, following the withdrawal of earlier EU commitments to
provide more substantive support in these two critical areas. Technical backup has been of
instrumental value in supporting the quality of DoFP supervision of all project activities and
reporting; and a draft sector strategy and action plan has been prepared and is currently pending
finalization and adoption by the Council of Ministers.

Some progress was also made, in collaboration with the FAO AdriaMed Project, toward
developing the FMIS. A register of all marine fishing vessels has been developed, and
collaborative arrangements have been established between DoFP and the coastguard to enable
vessel tracking. Data gathered during operation of the MCS developed under component 1 was to


                                               19

feed into the FMIS, thereby providing the information tools needed for sustainable management
of the sector.

However, procedures for collecting and documenting fish landings (logbooks) have not yet been
implemented, and the FMIS is not yet fully operational, drawing attention to the need for the
continued support of DoFP and other partners to ensure benefits are realized. The improvement of
legislation for data collecting is under the process as adoption of Council Regulation (EEC) No
2847/93 date 12 octobre 1993.

Technical Assistance for the Fishery Research Institute: Moderately Satisfactory.
As envisaged at appraisal, in addition to provision of some small works and equipment, the
project assisted with development of a business plan for the FRI, which entailed review and
analysis of FRI's activities, including operation of hatcheries, and developing a business strategy,
including cash-flow and activity projections for a 3 year period. Outputs of this work were
incorporated as appropriate in the sector strategy and plan that is being finalized for approval by
the Cabinet of Ministers. Following the 2006 government restructuring, FRI was transferred
from the Ministry of Environment Forestry and Water Administration to the Ministry of
Education. Close collaboration between the two ministries will be necessary to ensure that FRI
programs contribute most effectively toward development and sustainable management of the
fisheries sector.

3.3 Efficiency

The PAD indicates that a conventional economic analysis would have been difficult since many
project benefits are not possible to quantify directly. No ERR or FRR had been calculated for the
full project. However, some estimates to evaluate the efficiency of the various components were
made.

In light of the relatively small investment made under project and the significant income
generated by FMOs that goes directly towards managing the port and fish landing site
infrastructure that is supporting the sector, and the significant potential for growth in the fishery
sector over the next decade, cost effectiveness of component one is considered high.

Under the aquaculture component, the rates of return from increased catches of Koran trout and
carp as a result of the release of fingerlings is estimated around 30%. In addition, the project will
have played a significant role in pre-empting the possibility of extinction of the endemic Koran
trout.

No estimates were made for the benefits derived from the third component, and the sector
strategy and policy. However, if effectively implemented, the sector strategy could ensure
sustainable management and development of a fishery where the current value of marine and lake
fish landed, processed, marketed locally and exported is approximately US$25 million, with the
potential to grow to US$50 million with improvements in harvesting, processing and marketing.

In view of the relatively small scale of the investment at less than US$ 6.0million in IDA funds,
and the pilot nature of the project, the economic benefits accrued relative to cost are likely to be
high.

                                               20

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
The project substantially achieved the first two of the three main objectives described in the PAD,
i.e., it improved the physical condition, operation and management of fishing ports through their
rehabilitation the establishment of community based fisheries organizations (i.e., the FMOs), and
transfer of responsibility for managing the fishing ports to the FMOs. It also introduced a
potentially effective institutional framework for community-driven co-management of marine
resources by involving FMOs and strengthening the public sector's capacity through training and
support for the development of sector policy and strategy.

The first element of the third objective, i.e., to "Restore the country's previous capacity in
aquaculture", proved to have been over ambitious and probably inappropriate, in that the
country's former capacity in aquaculture had been, reliant on state support as well as: (a) larger
areas of fresh water being available for aquaculture at that time, and (b) higher production levels
in some water bodies because of fertilization that had formerly derived from livestock
management regimes that are no longer appropriate under current land use systems. However,
the component did significantly increase aquaculture production levels, and also successfully and
usefully "explored the potential for further development of aquaculture, particularly for high
value species".

Given the baseline conditions prevailing at the time of appraisal, the relatively small amount of
IDA funding made available under the project to address the challenge, and the "high risk" rating
assigned to the project (and endorsed by QUAG during its quality at entry review), achievements
under the first two objectives were considerable. The overall outcome rating is assessed as only
moderately satisfactory, however, largely because of concerns regarding sustainability of
outcomes, as outlined under section 4.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

With an overall objective of re-establishing control and development of the fisheries sector, the
project did not target a specific beneficiary group. However, data on catches from lakes and
reservoirs, suggest that inland fishing communities ­ represented by 5 of the 13 FMOs in the
country - may have benefited most directly from the project, since these rural populations are
among the poorest, and carp restocking programs in-land reservoirs led to a relatively immediate
increase in the availability of protein and income.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Community based institutions - Under the project, new community based institutions (FMOs),
representing all marine, lake and inland fishing communities in the country, were established and
empowered by law to manage marine fishing port and lakeside fish landing facilities. DoFP is
now piloting the transfer of authority for licensing fishing boats at one project site (Ohrid), and a
sector strategy that is pending adoption by Government would enable further empowerment of
the FMOs to share responsibility for sustainable management of all of Albania's fishery resources
with Government.

Government institutions - At the time of appraisal, capacity building and training for government
institutions responsible for monitoring and managing the Albanian fisheries sector was to be
provided by an EU financed project. When the EU project was dropped, the PFDP endeavored to
make up for the deficiency by expanding the scope of support for DoFP to include development


                                               21

of the national sector strategy and action plan, and provision of technical support for
implementation of all project activities.

By establishing the FMOs the project has established the institutional framework for long term
sustainable management of fishery resources. However, long term sustainability of these new
institutions will be reliant on Government implementing the sector strategy, and further
developing and implementing collaborative arrangements for fishery management with the FMOs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

A positive outcome of the project that was not intended at the time of appraisal is the development
of a new fishing port at Durres, financed with a $9 million credit made available by the Islamic
Development Bank. Early in implementation the Government moved to close existing fishing
port facilities at Durres to make way for a ferry boat terminal. In response, the project supported
the development of a feasibility study, an environmental impact assessment, and a port
management plan that were used to successfully leverage funding for construction of a new
fishing port for the Durres fishing fleet.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
No formal Stakeholder survey was undertaken on completion of the project. However, a national
conference to present and discuss a fishery sector strategy developed with the support of the
project was held in July 2007. The conference, which was attended by the prime minister and the
ministers of Agriculture and Environment, FMOs and other sector stakeholders, agreed that the
strategy defined an acceptable development path for the sector and that it should be finalized and
submitted for approval of the Council of Ministers.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

Investments, works, capacity, and awareness developed under the project have established the
basis for sustainable management of fishery resources.          Prior to the project, fishing port
infrastructure was so severely degraded as to be almost unusable, exploitation of fishery resources
was anarchic and unsustainable, with no fishing community institutions and a state of acrimony
prevailing between fishermen and government officials. Key outcomes of the project, together
with an assessment of risk to the sustainability of these outcomes, are as follows:

Rehabilitation and construction of fishing port and landing site infrastructure ­ Four marine
ports and five fish landing sites on lakes and reservoirs have been rehabilitated or constructed in a
manner that allows for more efficient operation of fishing vessels, and establishment of basic
standards of hygiene and safety. Additionally, a Koran trout hatchery has been rehabilitated at
Lin on Lake Ohrid. Responsibility for management of marine ports has been assigned to the
recently established FMOs, and government has committed to continue support for operation of
the hatchery at Lin. The risk that development outcomes associated with use of this new or
rehabilitated infrastructure is Negligible to low.

Establishment and operation of fishery management organizations ­ Thirteen FMOs, covering
all marine, lake and inland fishery resources in the country, have been successfully established.
All FMOs have business plans, fee paying membership, and provide other fee based services to
finance their operations. In particular, responsibility for managing and operating fish landing sites
and fishing port facilities has been transferred to local FMOs. Significantly, the initial financial
viability of these fledgling community based organizations has been bolstered by their role as
distributors of Government subsidized fuel to fishing vessels, and their levy of a small fee for
delivery of this fuel. At the time of ICR preparation, subsidy on fuel made available to FMOs had
been revoked, and the shock of this in anticipated loss of income has significantly challenged the
financial viability of the marine FMOs. Whether or not the subsidy is replaced and then phased
out over a more manageable period of time, FMOs will need to become reliant on their continued
and enhanced delivery of other services to their fee paying members, as well as the transparency
of their operations. While core services currently provided by FMOs are largely limited to
operation and maintenance of port facilities, the adoption of co-management of fishery resources
would further enhance the influence of FMOs and the likelihood of their sustainability. Given
current concerns regarding the likelihood that fishery co-management plans will be implemented
(see next paragraph) the risk that this significant development outcome will be sustained is
moderate.

Co-management of fishery resources ­ The project objective envisaged introducing an effective
institutional framework for community driven co-management of marine fisheries resources by
involving FMOs and strengthening the public sector's capacity. This has largely been achieved.
Indeed, given the baseline conditions prevailing at inception, as well as the timeframe and scale
of the project, progress in achieving this objective has been as satisfactory as could have been
expected: FMOs have been established and are financially independent. The concept of co-
management of fishery resources by Government working together with FMOs has been
introduced, understood, and adopted as a desirable vision for the future. Fishery co-management
plans, clearly defining regulations and the responsibilities of all parties to ensure sustainable use
of fishery resources, as well as maintenance public infrastructure and facilities, have been
prepared. At one site (Ohrid) responsibility for licensing fishing vessels has already been assigned
to the local FMO, while in Shkodra the same arrangement is planned to begin in 2008. However,
more time and additional efforts, in terms of training and sharing initial experiences among


                                               23

FMOs and fisheries field inspectors, will be required in order to ensure that fishery co-
management plans are effectively implemented. Given the prevailing limited capacity of DoFP to
play a leading role in operationalizing co-management in the absence of continued technical
support, the risk to development outcome is significant.

Sector policy and strategy and institutional capacity ­ Following withdrawal of the EU initiative
that was to provide support for developing sector policy and capacity building within DoFP, the
project supported some activities in an endeavor to make up for the shortfall. With regard to
sector policy and strategy, this included consulting stakeholders and specialists, and then
developing draft sector strategy and policy for the consideration of Government. The drafts
provided a vision for the development of the sector, defined institutional responsibilities, and
included a priority action plan and estimates of financing needs to sustain and develop the sector.
The document was reviewed and discussed at a national conference where it was broadly
approved by stakeholders and government officials and, at the time of preparing this ICR, it is
scheduled to be submitted for adoption by the Cabinet of Ministers in the coming weeks. With
regard to capacity of DoFP, in accordance with the practice and needs of the day, project
management was largely assigned to a PMU, whose capacity developed as a result of
involvement in all project activities. While some PMU staff will return to DoFP on closure of the
project, most will pursue other career opportunities - notably, many will now form a PMU that
will supervise construction of the new fishing port at Durres. Adoption of the national sector
strategy would constitute a significant contribution toward formalizing adoption of the concept of
co-management, and addressing concerns associated with institutional sustainability. However, in
view of the level of political support indicated by the delays in finalizing the strategy and
submitting it for Cabinet approval, as well as the current levels of staffing and budgetary support
for DoFP, the risk to sustainability of project outcomes associated with capacity building and the
adoption and implementation of sector policy is rated moderate.

Aquaculture activities ­ Assessment and pilot testing of tilapia, shrimp and eel, aquaculture
provided valuable guidance, which suggested that economic viability was questionable in most
cases. Consequently, project activities directed toward restoring the country's previous capacity
in aquaculture focused on restocking inland lakes, and reservoirs with carp, and rearing Koran
trout fingerlings for restocking Lake Ohrid. Restocking produced significant increases in carp
production where water bodies are managed by FMOs, and the inland fishery FMOs seem likely
to take on the cost of continuing carp restocking to support higher levels of production. However,
the restocking program will probably require continued coordination on the part of DoFP in the
first instance. Furthermore, carp restocking is unlikely to be continued in other inland water
bodies managed by Water Users Associations, where there is less interest and ability to profit
from fishing. Hence the risk to sustainability of the level of carp restocking and production
initiated under the project is rated as moderate. Upgrading the Koran trout hatchery at Lin on
Lake Ohrid has significantly increased the capacity of the facility to rear and reintroduce
fingerlings, thereby greatly reducing mortality in this stage of the lifecycle and improving
recruitment to this high value fishery. Given governments commitment to continue supporting
operation of the hatchery, while also exploring options for cost sharing with the local FMO, risk
to sustainability of this activity is negligible - low.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The project was initially identified and prepared as a component of the Agriculture Service
Project (ASP), with the objective of supporting development of the agriculture sector following
collapse of the pyramid scheme in 1997. However, in the course of the preparing the ASP, due to
differences in geographical coverage, stakeholders and technologies, Government and the Bank
agreed that it would be appropriate to prepare a separate project to support development of the
fishery sector. In mid 2000, therefore, Government officially requested a separate fishery sector
project and, subsequently, project scope shifted to emphasize rehabilitation of fishing port
infrastructure, and support for developing community based fishermen's organizations. The
majority of detailed preparation work was undertaken in late 2000 and early 2001, and the project
was submitted to the Board of the World Bank in late 2001. QUAG assessed the project for
Quality at Entry in 2002, and assigned an overall rating of Satisfactory, and Highly Satisfactory
for strategic relevance and approach. QUAG noted that the project was an "innovative and high
risk operation", and that the panel found its design to be the right choice to implement an
"important and viable operation in a sector, which was in complete disarray after the break up of
the central government controls under the socialist era of the past".

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank team, which included technical expertise on fishing port rehabilitation and operation
made available under the FAO CP program, provided substantive support through frequent
informal and formal supervision in all phases of the project from identification through to closure.
Members of the Bank/FAO supervision team visited Albania and all project sites on a bimonthly
basis, with the most frequent interactions between Bank and project teams taking place during the
first three years of implementation. Positive factors influencing achievement of development
outcome during implementation include the flexibility of the Bank and the project teams to
adapting to changing circumstances and opportunities, as outline in section 2.2. The Bank team
was responsive in proposing solutions to obstacles to implementation, and followed-up
systematically until corrective action was taken.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank team was continuously engaged throughout preparation and implementation in
intensive monitoring of developments and providing timely advice and support to Government
counterparts and beneficiaries. The close collaboration between the Bank and borrower teams,
particularly, the PMU and DoFP, and the unusual frequency of interaction between the extended
Bank team and counterparts was of critical value in ensuring that project objectives were
achieved.




                                              25

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Government support, through establishing the legal framework for FMOs and transferring
authority for management of port facilities to FMOs has been instrumental in enabling the project
to make significant progress toward achieving key development objectives.              However, the
sustainability of these significant achievements is questionable, as evidenced by delays in
finalizing, adopting and implementing a fisheries sector strategy and action plan that would
assure adequate levels of budgetary support for DoFP to enable fisheries co-management to be
operationalized, and FMOs to consolidate and assume their critical role in sustainable
management of Albania's fishery resources. Government inflexibility regarding reallocation of
funds across disbursement categories is outlined in section 2.2 as a negative factor that may have
hindered achievement of development outcomes.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

In accordance with the practice and needs of the day, most project management functions were
delegated to PMU. The quality of staffing and the level of empowerment of the PMU, together
with its excellent collaboration with DoFP and sector stakeholders, are positive factors that
enabled the project to achieve its target objectives within the originally agreed timeframe.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Notwithstanding the excellent performance and achievements of the implementing agency, and
the instrumental support of Government at the outset, the questionable sustainability of project
outcomes that prevails at the time of preparing this ICR (in terms of establishing sustainable
operation of the FMOs and ports, and management of fishery resources) is largely attributable to
the Borrower. In particular to delays in finalizing, adopting and implementing the sector strategy,
as well as inflexibility with regard to allocation of project and other resources to priority needs of
the fisheries sector. Borrower performance in implementing the Project has been satisfactory, but
efforts toward ensuring sustainability of outcomes and achievement of the overall development
objective could have been more effective. Accordingly, overall borrower performance is rated
moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

(a)    Overall approach

       (i)     Risky projects can pay off ­ Although assessed as a high risk operation at the
       time of appraisal, due to the conditions prevailing at that time it was also viewed as the
       appropriate approach to re-establishing control of the fisheries sector and taking first
       steps toward its sustainable development. Project objectives have been largely achieved,
       and the risky strategy has proven to be appropriate. Frequent, and substantive guidance
       and support made available by the supervision team was instrumental in capturing the
       benefits of this approach.

       (ii)    Opportunism and flexibility in project implementation can pay off ­ The
       experience of implementation provides three different kinds of example:

               Reallocation of resources to activities not envisaged at the time of appraisal (i.e.,
               TA for a feasibility study, EIA and port management plan) leveraged a $9 million
               credit for construction of a fishing port at Durres. It also helped make up for
               deficiency when another donor reneged on earlier commitments to provide
               critical support for development of sector policy.

               Collaboration with other donors ­ led to provision of parallel financing for
               facilities and training to support establishment of the FMO at Lake Shkodra.

               Coordination with other IDA initiatives ­ may lead to recommendations for
               development of coastal tourism being implemented under a separate operation.

(b)    Technical assistance for institutional reform

       The need to build awareness and consensus ­ while the development of draft sector
       policy and strategy was informed by global experience as well as consultation with a
       broad range of stakeholders, finalization and adoption of the strategy has been delayed.
       This may have been due to changes in political leadership and resulting lack of
       appreciation across high level stakeholders of the benefits that could be realized from
       improved management of the sector, versus the costs and foregone gains to the country
       associated with the status quo.        The level of analysis, participatory process and
       communications that could possibly have pre-empted this delay proved to be beyond the
       scope of the project following withdrawal by another donor from its earlier commitment
       to provide such support.

(c)    Fisheries Co-management

       (i)     Bottom up approaches for fisheries management appear promising in Albania
               ­ the project's spectacular achievements in establishing FMOs covering all
               marine, lake and inland fisheries; and introducing the concept of co-management
               of fishery resources by FMOs in partnership with Government ­ as well as the
               success of other community based resource management initiatives in Albania ­
               suggest that the project's bottom up approach to fisheries management is
               appropriate.



                                             27

    (ii)    Economic incentives helped catalyze the formation and financial independence
            of the FMOs ­ The availability and distribution of Government subsidized fuel
            to fishing vessel owners via the FMOs provided an economic incentive for vessel
            owners to become members, and also helped FMOs establish financial self
            sufficiency.

    (iii)   The need for continued Government leadership ­ While Government and sector
            stakeholders have achieved significant progress in establishing the institutional
            framework for co-management, sustainability of FMOs, their effective operation
            of port facilities, and implementation of fishery co-management will require
            continued leadership and strategically targeted support from Government beyond
            the five year life of the project. This should include provision of joint training
            for FMO and fisheries inspectorate staff, and collaborative development of
            operational procedures.

(d) Aquaculture

    Sustainability is reliant on both social and economic relevance ­ Aquaculture
    production levels for carp were significantly greater under the former regime because
    they were supported and required by Government. Following the collapse of that system,
    the project was successful in increasing production levels of carp by supporting a
    restocking program. These levels of production are only likely to be maintained in water
    bodies that are managed by FMOs and where there is a local market for this species.
    Water users associations are not likely to effectively or economically harvest fish
    resulting from the restocking program in water bodies that they manage, nor are they
    likely to continue restocking.

Annex 2 Outputs by Components

Component 1 ­ Support to Community-Based Co-Management of Fisheries (US$ 3.85 million)

Under this component a total of 3 marine ports where completely rehabilitated. Works included
building of several hundred meters of new key wall, building of a landing ramp for boat repairs in
Saranda, refurbishing of a machine shop for boat repairs and a warehouse, and police building in
Vlore, refurbishing of a net repair space and a wooden jetty in Shengjin. Solid waste containers
and service contracts, including toxic waste (batteries, paint rests, and other toxics,) installation of
bilge water oil separators and used motor oil collection facilities were installed and agreed for
each site. Finally, basic utilities including electricity, street lights, drinking water, bathroom and
sanitary facilities, were brought to each of these three sites. Lastly, offices for FMOs were built
on each site. Only very few works were undertaken in the fishing port of Durres, as the fishing
port is being moved to a new location. The project supported this endeavor with support to the
feasibility study by providing the EIA. A US$ 9 million credit from the Islamic Development
Bank is financing detailed design and works that are to begin at year's end.

Landing sites were built in Zogay, Shiroka (Skodra Lake) and Udenish (Ohrid Lake). Works on
these sites included the construction of buildings and offices, the building of fish cleaning halls,
and cooling facilities, and offices on each location, including running water, electricity, and
sanitary facilities.

Finally, 13 FMOs were registered with 1482 members, including training on basic facilities
management and port operations, and financial management, including regular recording of
landed catches.


Component 2 - Aquaculture Development (US$1.03 million)

Under this component the Lin hatchery in Pogradec has been completely rehabilitated including
installation of water treatment system, installation of new basins and brooding stations, a new
laboratory for continuous testing of water intake and release and other facilities have been
installed. In its current state, since repairs have been completed 3 years ago, the hatchery has
produced and released some 3 million 10 months old fingerlings into Ohrid lake.

The carp restocking program has been reactivated with regular release of up to 1 million carp
fingerlings in a number of lakes and reservoirs of participating FMOs and WUAs.

Shrimp production demonstration was activated and practiced for two years on the site of Kavaja,
including refurbishing of basins, purchase of brood, feed stock, etc. A business plan detailing
investments required and details of mode of operations was developed.


The other activities under this component have not been completed for the reasons summarized as
follows:

    · the Tilapia demonstrations were cancelled in initial stage of the project when hatching
         proved to be too challenging as overall water temperatures and variations thereof were
         considered too great for sustainable production of this species.

    · the eel study was cancelled as volumes of elvers caught proved to be unsustainable to
         start a viable industry given existing regional competition,



                                               31

    · while no investments have directly taken place to support the bi-valve mollusk industry,
        mainly as a result of the temporary EU ban on seafood imports from Albania, the project
        provided assistance with mobilizing and registering an FMO in Butrint lagoons to support
        the local EU investment.


Component 3 ­ Support for the Public Sector (US$0.18 million)

The project supported the development of a sector strategy and policy. This involved an extensive
exercise of stakeholder consultation, a realistic assessment of sector needs, estimates of resources,
and an action plan. The process was facilitated and managed with the help of two international
fishing sector specialists financed by the project.

Fishery Co-management plans were developed for the marine fisheries along the coast, as well as
for Ohrid lake as well as Shkodra lake. These plans, clearly delineate the responsibilities in
managing the resources in the sector between FMOs as users and primary beneficiaries, as well as
the DFP as the main regulator and owner of much of the fishery related infrastructure, i.e. ports
and landing sites.

In addition, a diving survey was undertaken along the southern coast of Albania, the results of
which are integrated in the Bank's Coastal Zone Management Project that will use these findings
to develop alternative income sources derived from tourism for fishing communities, and reduce
the pressure on the fish resources.

Finally, some initial steps towards establishing of a Monitoring Control and Surveillance (MCS)
system have been taken. A model has been put in place in Shkodra with training provided to the
FMO, inspectors and rangers. On the side of the marine ports, each port has been equipped with
radio communication, and the project has supported the establishment of a boat registry with
mandatory equipment of GPS positioning for larger boats. The boats can now be continuously
monitored by the cost guard.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The PAD identified economic benefits to be derived from (a) the rehabilitation of fishing ports,
(b) improvements in fishery resource management, (c) economies of scale for fishing vessel
operators (in terms of efficiencies resulting from availability of port services such as, mechanical
shops, net repair services, refueling, various waste removal, and other fishery related inputs), and
(d) development of aquaculture, including some small grant demonstration programs. The PAD
also indicated that a conventional economic analysis would be difficult since many project
benefits are not possible to directly quantify. No ERR or FRR had been calculated for the full
project.

Component 1 - The PAD contains a pro-forma income statement for port FMOs based on
revenues to be generated from mooring fees, membership fees and other income. The estimates
for FMO revenues on marine ports have largely proven to be accurate. Much of port maintenance
and operation of facilities is assured from FMO income.

In economic terms, benefits accruing from the port rehabilitation work can be accounted for in the
light of the: (i) reduced risk of accidents and improved efficiency of vessel operations, (ii)
potential access to higher value markets for fish resulting from the availability of facilities with
minimal acceptable sanitary conditions, and (iii) reduced state budgetary allocations needed to
maintain the ports, since users have largely assumed the operational running cost related to port
operations and management. The actual incremental value as a result of the rehabilitated port
facilities can be summarized as follows:

         · The value of reduced number of accidents would provide a good indication of the
             economic contribution of refurbished ports. However, since fishing boats are of
             many different shapes and sizes and for the most part very old and largely uninsured
             and records of causes of accidents not accurately kept, this figure could not be
             calculated based on available data.
         · Albania lands a conservatively estimated US$32 million worth in fish. For the most
             part it is still consumed locally because competitive supply chains to foreign markets
             have not developed yet. As these develop, as a result of acceptable landing facilities
             it is likely that the value of the catch at landing will significantly increase, increasing
             revenues in the sector and further improving the livelihood of fishermen.
         · The size of the marine fish catch has grown systematically since 2004 at an average
             of 1.2 million US$ and has the capacity to grow to an estimated US$ 50 million. The
             net present value of maintaining this incremental growth over the next 20 years
             amounts to US$2.95 million and an investment rate of return of some 28%.
         · The FMOs no manage their own facilities and generate annual revenue that is directly
             reinvested in port and landing facilities towards maintenance and operational costs.
             This represents direct yearly budget savings.

Component 2 - For aquaculture activities related to carp fingerling restocking the immediate
economic benefits are more readily quantifiable. Recent estimates of catches indicate a three to
fourfold increase in lake productivity, and a current incremental increase in catches of
approximately 30 tons within three years of initiating the program. This suggests that the
program has a rate of return of 36% assuming this program and the incremental catch is sustained.



                                                     37

The volume of Koran trout fingerlings released from the Lin hatchery has increased fivefold, and
the releases are composed of larger fingerlings rather than young larvae (10 months as opposed to
one month old fry), thereby increasing survival rates at 1 year by about 90%. A tagging program
is presently being implemented to assess survival rates of released fingerlings to adulthood, and
hence the potential economic value of the program. Data will become available over the next
several years. In the meantime, projected estimates for the likely increase in catch resulting from
the stocking program from 2009 onwards suggest a rate of return of 38% assuming a 30%
survival rate at beginning of catch at 4th year of life of release. This rate of return drops to 28% if
the survival rate drops to 20%. This activity will likely play a significant role in ensuring the
survival of the Koran as an endemic species in Lake Ohrid.

The combined rate of return of the activities undertaken under this component amount to 36% in
case of 30% survival rate of Koran trout, or 29% should the survival rate drop to 20%

Component 3 ­ No attempt was made at calculating the benefits of this component

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


I carefully read the document and I think that it is a good one.

The essential policies of MEFWM in the fishery sector aim at the gradual increase of the
fishery production to reach the optimal limits of a rational exploitation, support for the
management process, reconstruction and upgrading of fisheries activity, port
infrastructure, marketing net and processing industry, in order to increase the value of
fishery production and employment level.

To achieve the above-mentioned objective, one of the primary efforts was to support the
sector with favorable policies and in this context the PFDP played an important role.
This project was started in an important moment for the fisheries sector and gives us a
strong support for the fisheries management and co-management as well as in
rehabilitation of fisheries infrastructures, aquaculture, technical assistance, etc..

I think that the project has fully met its expectations in all its components.

When we started, the project was assessed as highly risky at appraisal, mainly because of
a lot of problems in the fisheries sector and related with the difficulties of the sector in
itself. Investments, works, capacity, and awareness developed under the project have
established the basis for sustainable management of fishery resources.
