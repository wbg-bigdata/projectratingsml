A. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
1.      Project Development Objective (see Annex 1) and Key Performance Indicators (see Annex 13):
The project objectives are to: (a) transform a traditional Soviet style ministerial structure into the transport
sector's policy formulation and deregulation entity needed in a market economy; and (b) define and contribute to
achievement of operational autonomy and accountability of the Transport Agencies (State Departments). The main
actions to be undertaken under the project are: (i) finalize definition of the specific transport-related functions of
government; (ii) specify how these functions can best be fulfilled in Georgian circumstances; (iii) identify and
implement appropriate organizational set-up; and (iv) build the requisite staff capacity, by appropriate staff selection
and training, in MOT and the other relevant organizations of the transport sector. The project will thus result in the
separation from the Government structure of all operational functions via commercialization, privatization and
divestiture of assets. The functions expected to be retained being those related to policy formulation and regulation.
The project has a significant learning potential: (a) help assess GOG's commitment to transport sector
reform as it redefines the relationship between the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and transport agencies; and (b) test
a functional review methodology. The emphasis on new ministerial functions, with a corresponding diminution in
policy making functions of supra ministerial entities and modal agencies, should be applicable elsewhere in the
public service. This implies that the project is a pilot, i.e., lessons learned from making transport agencies
operationally independent, selecting staff in a clear and transparent way, training ministerial staff and retaining them
within the Government, should prove useful in a wider scale Public Sector Reform.

A  Government-Barcn"   joint diagnostic exercise has already identified five broad areas of.concern in public sector

Recognizing its significance, not only:to transport but also as the forerunner for broader public setorrefnn,te
Government has already decided to set up a high-level Steering Group for the project, including the; Advistr to the
President on Economic Reforms, the Ministers of Finance and Transport, a leading official of the State.Chancery,d th
Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on the Economic Sectors.

Progress toward the objectives described would be monitored as follows: (a) comparing actual progress
with "Proposed Program of Structural Reform and Privatization of the Transport Sector (Annex 10); (b) conducting
transport user surveys; and (c) monitoring the progress of Transport Agencies towards becoming independent,
accountable, and sustainable, having their own income and capacity to borrow.
The project acts on four fronts simultaneously. First, functional and structural reorganization of the
Ministry of Transport will enable it to fulfil its role as the policy formulation and regulatory entity in the transport
sector: through functional reviews, adjustments to the legal framework, reduction in size and scope. Second,
improving business processes within the reformed Ministry and information flows in the sector (including provision
of necessary equipment) will enhance efficiency and transparency: by adjustment to the legal framework,
operational reviews, and redrafting of statutes. Third, pay and employment reform will yield a work force of the
size and with the skills necessary for the Ministry to effectively discharge its new and enlarged functions:
institutionalizing merit-based processes in recruitment, evaluation and promotion, and creation of an incentive
structure that will allow the Ministry to attract and retain qualified and competent staff would fall within this sphere.
Fourth, a major program of on-site training, supplemented by a few study-tours, will steadily expand the capacity of
the staff to play the new roles demanded of them.
The project has been structured in the context laid out in the Transport Sector Memorandum (Report #
13978), which recommended a sector strategy based on, and in certain cases being the forerunner of the macro-
economic reforms, in particular, privatization and reduction of the Government's role in the, sector. The agreement
of the Government of Georgia led to the preparation of the Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP), which addressed
the short-term priorities under the sector reforrn strategy, and is close to full disbursement. The Transport Sector
Reform Project (TSRP), under preparation addresses the medium term priorities with major emphasis on policy and
institutional change. A restructured Ministry of Transport would be a necessary contribution to the redistribution of
functions involved in the implementation of sector reforms, under the TSRP.
D-. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
1.     Sector-Related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Goal Supported by the Project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 1700D -GE Date of latest CAS discussion: October 21, 1997.
This project is consistent with the Bank Country Assistance Strategy (Report # 17000-GE para. 57) which
specifies that the Transport Sector would be considered for an early use of adaptable lending instruments such as
Learning and Innovation Loans. More specifically, the project would contribute to the following CAS mentioned
goals: (a) downsizing the public sector; (b) reorienting public outlays to focus on basic expenditure needs and
withdrawal from commercial activities; and (c) increasig productivity and removing infrastructure bottlenecks by
achieving full cost recovery for public investment, and by promoting competition, private sector participation and
privatization.
(a)    Downsizing the public sector.
The project would adjust the number of saff in the Ministry of Transport to the number required to
perform satisfactorily the new functions of a Ministry in a market economy. The draft functional analysis' indicates
that staff required would be less than 100 people, while approximately 430 staff are currently employed in the
Ministry. In addition, the newly independent transport agencies would reduce their staff numbers to sustainable
levels as the agencies develop their outsourcing of services and civil works.
(b)    Reorienting public outlays to focus on basic expenditure needs and withdrawal from commercial
activities.
The project concept is specifically to introduce new market oriented regulatory framework and designed to
give means to the Ministry of Transport, to efficiently and actively, address the policy changes necessary to
implement a strategy of privatization of commercial operations, and outsourcing of the non-core civil service
activities.

(c)    Increasing productivity and removing infrastructure bottlenecks by achieving full cost recovery for
public investment, and by promoting competition, private sector participation and privatization.
These improvements will be introduced as the private sector takes part in transport operations and the
provision of infrastructure. (See Annex 10). This will result from the use of standard competitive bidding
procedures, commercialization of infrastructure management, and increased cost recovery through user charges.
2.      Main Sector Issues and Government Strategy:
(a)     Deterioration of Basic Transport Infrastructure.
The severe deterioration of basic transport infrastructure represents a critical barrier to private investment
and growth. In Georgia, this results from a combination of several factors: (a) lack of investment and maintenance
for a number of years; (b) inefficient organizational and institutional structure dominated and regulated by large
monopolies, state-owned enterprises/departments; and (c) very precarious financial situation due to inadequate
pricing policies and low collection payments. The Government is aware that, due to limited public resources,
alleviation of these transport infrastructure bottlenecks will require financial participation of infrastructure users and
private investors. It is, however, clear that in the short run, the volume and scope of private investments will be
limited due to social, political and economic considerations. A number of steps have already been taken in this
direction: (i) tariff increases and introduction of user charges; (ii) improvement in collections; (iii) partial
privatization of construction companies and road transport; and (iv) some restructuring of the sector in anticipation
of further privatization.
(b)     Lack of Proper Trade Supporting Services.
The country also suffers from lack of proper trade supporting services such as proper warehousing and
distribution facilities close to the ports of Poti and Batumi, freight forwarders connected with international freight
forwarders to provide door to door services, or privately owned transport operators ("TRACECA: Improvement of
Road Transport Services"). Since the Government of Georgia has neither the financial nor the managerial
capability to offer these services efficiently, the development of these services within the private sector has become
a Government priority, via commercialization and progressive privatization of the sector. Development of these
services by the private sector is hindered by absence of a clear, stable and conducive legal and regulatory
framework. A significant effort is required to enable the active participation of the private sector and the
Government has already taken some specific measures in the port sub-sector. In the case of transport services,
transfer of ownership to the private sector is expected to occur in the next two to three years.
(c)     Limitation of the Current Organizational Structure.
The MOT would need to change its current structure to improve its effectiveness in dealing with the above
issues. The MOT was created recently (1996) on the initiative of the GOG to address the need for coordination
between the various transport subsectors, but it followed the Soviet model, being based on legislation passed prior to
Georgian independence in 1991. The creation of the Ministry proved to be useful, although its existing organization
and structure as reviewed was found unnecessarily complex.   Significant inconsistencies can be noted, e.g., the
relationship between the Minister and subsector directors differs from one subsector to another. In addition,
overlapping or unclear responsibilities in the existing structure result in a stronger focus on short-term issues instead
of strategic ones like transport sector reform.
Unclear organizational structure favors a piecemeal approach to sector restructuring.  Instead, the
organization needs to enable development of a group of specialists that could become the driving force in
implementing the vision of a reformed transport sector shared by the President's Office, the Government Council
and the MOT. The strategy of the Minister of Transport, supported both by the Government Council and the
President of Georgia, is to proceed first with an in-depth restructuring of the Ministry of Transport in the near future
based on the findings of the draft structural analysis prepared under the Transport Rehabilitation Project (see
organizational chart, Annex 11). This analysis reviewed the MOT structure as established by the GOG and made
recommendations as to the organization structure, personnel management and ministerial functions.

(d)    The Need to Test and Experiment.
Public Sector Reform in FSU countries poses a difficult challenge, since it needs to address a fundamental
lack of institutional capacity. The opportunity to restructure a traditional Soviet Ministerial Structure into one
attuned to a market economy, as the LIL would attempt, is made difficult by the lack of best practice on the subject
generally, and in Georgia in particular. There is a need to try out solutions suitable to the Georgian situation on
subjects such as: changing the role of Government; downsizing; pay scale reform in close relationship with the
public sector reform; recruiting policies; training and development of key staff; and instrumentation of the policy
reform function itself All these deserve careful design and testing. The experience to be developed has potential
value for the wide ranging Public Sector Reform process under consideration, since it will test acceptability without
foreclosing any options, and would imply a separation of all policy from operational activities. (Policy functions
and regulatory functions would rest in the MOT.)
3.      Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices:
The restructuring of the Ministry of Transport is a common denominator underlining the three sector issues
mentioned above. This restructuring will allow the elaboration of the legal and regulatory framework required to
finance infrastructure and support development and transport services by the private sector. Restructuring and
strengthening of the Ministry of Transport would enable it to become a powerful and effective organization for the
large restructuring task that still lies ahead in the transport sector. The future structure of the Ministry would be
balanced, i.e., proportional power and functions amongst departments, a clear distribution of responsibilities, staff
specialized to perform their assigned tasks. Once the Ministry is reorganized to fit to the requirements of a market
economy, the new Ministry staff and selected decision-makers would be exposed to international experience in
sector reform and restructuring of transport agencies and companies. The development of an information system in
the Ministry of Transport is expected to increase efficiency of the new structure.

L.     Project Components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The operation as conceived attempts the transformation of a traditional Soviet ministerial structure into one
suitable to support the sector in a market economy. To this end, the following actions are envisioned: re-
organization and streamlining of functions and responsibilities within the Ministry including: (a) recruiting and
hiring of staff according to profiles defined in the functional analysis of the new Ministry; (b) training in support of
a staff development plan; (c) technical services to help define these actions; and (d) technical assistance in the form
of advisors on call during the implementation period.
The project would consist of four major components.
(a)    Restructuring of the MOT and Independence of Transport State Agencies (US$820,000).
The component would cover technical services to: (i) reorganize the MOT and its staff around the new
functions needed in a market economy; (ii) review and redraft, as required, the statutes of the MOT in light of the
functional review, and draft new statutes for transport State Agencies guaranteeing their independent and
commercial operations and i-reasing their accountability; (iii) determine proper information flows within the
transport sector; and (iv) institutionalize merit-based recruitment and promotion procedures in the MOT in
consultation with the Bureau of Public Service established under the Law on Civil Service. These services require
inputs from experts (with transport experience) on Organizational Behavior, IT, Human Resources, Recruitment,
Severance package design, Opinion survey. To ensure a consistent high quality throughout the assignment, these
specialists will be recruitd inifividualy.

(b)    Information Technology for the Ministry of Transport (US$570,000).
This component would provide office technology (hardware, software, and relevant training) to support the
new MOT organization for a period of five years.
(c)    Refurbishment of the MOT Building (US$350,000).
This component would cover part of the MOT building restructuring. (See Annex 2, project component 3.)
(d)    Training of MOT staff and Georgian decision-makers (US$760,000).
This component would consist of (i) training newly recruited staff to be defined and confirmed in details
during the LIL; (ii) establishing an information center on worldwide transport publications; (iii) offering study tours
for higher level ministry officials. The training would focus on the needs outlined in the "Development Strategy of
Training Unit of TRRC (March 1997)" prepared by Transport Reform and Rehabilitation Center (TRRC) and would
take place at the Training Unit of the TRRC. This unit is successfully providing training for 240 persons under the
Transport Rehabilitation Project. A list of proposed training courses and seminars is available in Annex 12.
(e)    Provision of specialized advisors on demand to assist policy formulation and implementation.
These advisors will assist as a minimum in the following capacities: formulation of the Ministry's
functional analysis; definition of staff profiles; recruitment; policy development; change management; drafting of
statutes; and deregulation process of the sector.

2.     Key Policy and Institutional Reforms Supported by the Project:
Key policy reforms supported by the project were described in the Transport Sector Memorandum (Report
# 13978) and are summarized in Annex 10. These transport sector reforms include: (a) divestiture of assets by state
enterprises; (b) commercialization and privatization of state enterprises; (c) liberalization of tariffs and routes;
(d) contribution of transport to the reform of customs and excise duties; (e) introduction of economic appraisal
procedures for all new public investments and of cut-off economic rate of return analysis for the financial year; (f)
use of acceptable competitive bidding procedures for most public expenditures in the transport sector; and (g)
progressive commercialization of infrastructure.
3.     Benefits and Target Population:
The main benefit of the project would be to facilitate the transport sector reforn program. The overall
impact of accelerating transport sector reform would be substantial for a wide majority of Georgians, whether they
live in rural or urban areas. The quality of transport infrastructure, could potentially improve significantly. These
improvements would in turn translate into cheaper goods, better access to markets, social services, and potentially

additional foreign investments in local industries. By improving its efficiency and implementing successfully a
transport sector reform, the Government of Georgia would gain additional international and local support.  In
addition, and perhaps even more important, the lessons of implementation under this project would feed into wider
plans for public service reforms, thus reducing the risks that untested changes could pose to the functioning of
government.
4.     Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
(a)    Implementation Period.
The project would be implemented over a two-year period (1998-2000).
(b)    Executing Agency.
The TRRC would be the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of this project.  It has successfully
implemented the Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP). The project team would be integrated by the PIU,
working groups within each agency or entity involved, and Georgian and foreign experts. The PIU would
coordinate the activities of the working groups, prepare terms of reference, hire consultants, contract services and
purchase goods as necessary for the implementation of the project. Consultant services would be procured in
accordance with the World Bank "Guidelines on the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers" dated January 1997, revised September 1997.  The government contribution would cover the
incremental cost of the PIU for the implementation of this project, estimated at US$15,000. The Bank supervision
team would provide guidance and quality control.
(c)    Procurement and Disbursement.
Goods and services financed by IDA would be procured in accordance with the Bank/IDA procurement
guidelines. The project PIU has had an extensive and successful experience in procuring small civil works and
individual consulting contract under the TRP and the PPF of the TSRP. The project components not financed by
IDA would be procured in accordance with the national regulations or the co-financing institution's procurement
regulations. The project elements, their estimated cost and procurement methods are summarized in Table A of
Annex 5. A procurement plan detailing the packaging and estimated schedule of the major procurement actions is
presented in Table C of Annex 5. All other procurement information, including capability of the implementing
agency, estimated dates for publication of GPN and the IDA's review process is presented in Table B of Annex 5.
Advisors under para l(e) would be procured as individual consultants, indefinite delivery contracts, in accordance
with para 4.5 of the Guidelines on Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers.
(d)    Accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements.
The PIU would establish and maintain project accounts, and have them audited every fiscal year by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA, in accordance with Bank guidelines. The PIU would also maintain all
documentation related to project expenditures, and keep financial records in accordance with sound accounting
practices. The project will benefit from the same financial management and administrative arrangements of the
TRP, these arrangements were key to its successful implementation.
(e)    Monitoring and evaluation arrangements.
A project-specific monitoring system under the responsibility of the PIU was discussed during appraisal to
serve as the key project impact and performance monitoring tool. It includes a small but significant set of indicators
drawing from the extensive list in Annex I as discussed during technical discussions of the legal documents as the
main group of monitoring indicators for this operation. Besides output indicators such as staff profiles, training
opportunities and technical services reports, the main performance indicators reflect the ability of the Ministry to
lead the reform process and may be grouped as follows: preparation and implementation of further transport de-
regulation, passage of legislation necessary to keep the reform agenda, and improved sustainability of the sector.
Other indicators include detailed progress benchmarks covering physical works, goods and services, procurement
and disbursement, and financial management. The PIU would provide quarterly reports for review, summarizing
implementation progress, results from the monitoring system and utilization of project funds.

D. PROJECT RATIONALE
1.     Project Alternatives Considered and Reasonsfor Rejection:
(a)     Assistance via a Supplemental Credit to the Transport Rehabilitation Project.
This option was first explored and described in the Aide Memoire of the September 1997 mission, since
part of the training proposed under this new project was initially included in the TRP. It remained unfunded due to
(i) a shortfall in cofinancing, and (ii) an adverse change in the value of the SDR versus the US dollar. Both the
country team and the project team rejected this possibility due to the nature of the proposed component:
restructuring of the Ministry of Transport, which was not included in the TRP. The project is consistent with the
CAS discussed on October 21, 1997 by the Board of Directors.
(b)    Assistance Through a Proposed Bank Investment Project.
Since a new Transport Project is under preparation, this option was carefully reviewed, but finally excluded
due to timing reasons. The Transport Sector Refonn project (TSRP) is not expected be implemented before the end
of fiscal year 1999. Combining the LIL and TSRP would not be acceptable since (i) our client considers the
restructuring of the Ministry to be a priority, and (ii) progress in the implementation of the reforms under this
project will significantly facilitate a successful Transport Sector Reform project.
(c)    Assistance Through the Civil Service Reform Project.
This option was also rejected for timing reasons. In addition, the LIL would provide an opportunity to the
Georgian Goverment to experiment on small-scale reform, prior to a broader application of this experience. The
lessons learned during this process may be applicable to a wider scale Civil Service Sector Reform.

3.     Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Proposed Project Design:
During the first phase of assistance to the Transport Sector, the impact of the Bank on the course and types
of reforms has been substantial. It has helped to establish a fruitful policy dialogue and build a good partnership
with the Govermment. The Transport Rehabilitation Project is close to completion less than two years after
becoming effective. Three critical elements ensured the success of the previous project: (i) development of local
ownership in the project; (ii) articulation of a vision and set of goals for the reform of the transport sector shared by
some in the transport agencies, the Ministry of Transport, the Cabinet of Ministers and the President's Office; and
(iii) replicability and sustainability of reforms and procedures introduced in Georgia.
These lessons have been taken into account in the project design. The project already benefits from a very
strong local ownership. It was requested by the Minister of Transport and supported by the Minister of Finance, and
the Investment Council of the President. Both the transport sector reforms proposed and the project design strongly
emphasize sustainability of sector reforms and of the Ministry reorganization, e.g. addressing the likely cost of
retaining newly recruited staff.
4.      Indications of Borrower Commitment and Ownership:
The Minister of Transport's initial request and support of the Council of the Government and the
Investment Council of the President, stand as clear statements of borrower commitment and ownership. In addition,
in its February 5th request for IDA financing, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its views on the project
composition. These preferences are fully reflected in the LIL. The Appraisal mission reviewed and confirmed the
extent of project ownership by the Georgian authorities.
5.     Value Added of Bank Support in this Project:
The Bank has established itself as a strong partner in reforming the transport sector and the civil service.
The Bank continued cooperation, shared understanding of the need for reform and of the existing political structure
in Georgia would contribute significantly to the productivity of our efforts. Besides, the new product used for this
project, LIL, offers the flexibility to pilot a specific approach to ministry restructuring and the possibility to respond
to our client with a tailored solution in record time (one and a half months between formal Government request and
technical discussions).
E. SUMMARY PROJECT ANALYSIS
1.      Economic:
In relation to the project objectives, the project is expected to generate the following benefits: (a) concrete
experience of Ministry restructuring in Georgia with lessons applicable to the wider scale Public Sector Reform
effort; and (b) accelerated implementation of transport reform due to a more efficient Ministry of Transport. Their
combined effect would result in: substantial economic savings due to improved transport infrastructure and
competition in the sector, and in economic growth from broad availability of high quality transport services.
Commercialization of infrastructure would result in lower vehicle operating cost and consequently generate
substantial savings. The sale of public shares in transport service companies would: (a) create a one-time revenue to
the Government; and (b) generate increased annual tax revenues instead of subsidies. In addition, it would attract
local and foreign investment to productive sectors.
2      Financial:
Because of the strong emphasis on technical services and the very nature of the LIL, including its size and
emphasis on testing and innovation, the monetary and non-monetary benefits have not been analyzed in the
comprehensive way of World Bank investment projects. The project-specific fiscal impact would be limited to
US$0.2 million or about 8 percent of the total cost, and would not exceed US$0.1 million in any given year. The
administrative cost of running the Ministry of Transport would not be increased as a result of the project.
Assurances with respect to financial contributions by the Ministry of Transport were agreed during appraisal and



Project Appraisal Document                                                              Page 10
will be confirmed with the Ministry of Finance during negotiations. While the project-specific financial impact
would be limited to US$2.3 million of additional lending, the project would have much wider positive consequences
in the medium run on the fiscal and financial situation of the transport sector.
3.     Technical:
A significant part of the project would consist of technical services ranging from the functional analysis of
the MOT to the design of its information flow system. Recommendations from these technical services would be
reviewed by the Bank, including cost estimates, overall design and allowance for physical and price contingencies.
Support to project team from other units of the Bank, notably those concerned with broader public sector and civil
service reform, would continue to be provided as needed to ensure quality and consistency with other future
projects.
4.     Institutional:
The executing agency for the project will be the TRRC, which was in charge of implementing the
Transport Rehabilitation Project. Details of the executing agency and project management were described earlier in
the Project Description Summary, Institutional and Implementation arrangements, (section C, para 4).
5.     Social:
The consultant in charge of preparing the severance payment plan will specifically review the
contractual obligations of the Government toward its employees, applicable laws including labor laws,
prevailing labor market conditions, the attitudes prevalent in the work force, the affordability of the
package and its replicability elsewhere within the Government. The Bank would support such a process
and through supervision ensure that the Ministry of Transport keeps a firm grip on the overall budgetary
constraints and obtains value for money, and minimizes slippage in project implementation.
6h      EnvironmentalAssessment:   Environmental Category [C]
The project is not expected to have any direct impact on the environment since it consists mainly of
technical services.
7.     Participatory Approach:
(a)    Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups.
The primary beneficiaries of the project will be the Ministry of Transport, the Cabinet of Ministers and the
President's Office, which will be given the means to effectively implement their vision of the transport sector
reform. Reflecting participatory preparation of the LIL, these beneficiaries have already demonstrated their project
commitment and ownership. The primary beneficiaries will continue to be involved in a participatory approach,
i.e., the Ministry of Transport by its intense involvement at all stages of the project implementation, the Cabinet of
Ministers and the President's Office by consultation throughout the process.
(b)    Other key stakeholders
The transport community and transport users would also benefit from the project's acceleration of the
reform process, and would be consulted annually through a transport survey to be designed under the project.
Coordination with the EU-TRACECA program will be assured by consultations with its coordinator.
F. SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
1.     Sustainability:
Both the restructuring of the Ministry of Transport and the transport sector reform process have a strong
built-in sustainability. One of the major risks concerns how to retain the newly recruited and trained staff within the
Ministry. The Ministry, supported by consultants provided under the project's technical services, will make some
specific proposals to address this risk. The transport sector reform described in Annex 10 has been designed to



Project Appraisal Document                                                                        Page 11
achieve sustainability by strengthening the private sector and competition in the provision of transport services, and
by commercializing the management of infrastructure. The main risk to its sustainability would be a significant
political shift slowing down the reform plan in Georgia. Despite its expected improved performance, the operating
cost of the Ministry is expected to be maintained at the same level as today, and not to impose an additional burden
on the Government's tight budget.

objectives and active consultants support.
Risk Rating - H (High Risk), S (Substantial Risk), M (Modest Risk), N (Negligible or Low Risk)
3.      Possible Controversial Aspects:
The sustainability of the project depends on the design of proper retention mechanism for the newly
recruited and trained staff. The introduction of such a mechanism could create an unstable situation in the case of a
delay in the Civil Service Reform project under preparation by the Bank, due to disparities between ministries.
However, a successful restructuring of the Ministry of Transport would accelerate the demand for and acceptance of
broader civil service reform. The formulation and availability of incentives to retirement is one of the key aspects
for which the project provides expertise, and is expected to significantly reduce controversial responses to it.
G. MAIN CREDIT CONDITIONS
1.      Effectiveness Conditions:
Counterpart funding for the first six month of the project (US$50,000) should be deposited in a bank
account by the target date of effectiveness-November 15, 1998. Thereafter, semi annual deposits will be made to
reconstitute a balance of no less than the equivalent of US$50,000.00
2.      Condition of Board Notification:
The Government should present a staffing strategy for the Ministry of Transport acceptable to the Bank
addressing the staff reduction and hiring process during the implementation of the LIL. In addition to observing the
principle of budget neutrality, the staffing strategy would meet broad targets agreed during negotiations and
included as a side letter to the legal documents. This condition has been fulfilled as an outcome of Credit
Negotiations.

Annex 2
Georgia: Restructuring of the Ministry of Transport
Detailed Project Description
(Note that reference numbers refer to the Annex 1)
Project Component 1 - US$820,000 (total cost of component) Restructuring of the MOT and independence of
Transport State Agencies. The component would cover the following technical services:
1.1.    Implement the recommendation of the functional analysis. The consultant would coordinate the tasks 1.2,
1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and the beginning of 1.6 to reorganize the MOT and its staff around the new functions needed in a
market economy, using the recommendations prepared under the World Bank Transport Rehabilitation Project and
described in two reports entitled "Organizational Structure, Personnel and Ministerial Action" and "Action Plan
1997". The consultant would then outline with the MOT the individual outputs and corresponding time schedule
necessary to meet the reform program objectives.
1.2.    Define responsibilities and decision process in the new MOT/Sector structure and provide draft statutes
establishing independent and commercial operation of transport agencies. The consultant would define in detail the
role, functions and responsibilities of each position in the new MOT in cooperation with the MOT and the
relationship between the transport agencies, the MOT, the Cabinet of Ministers and the President's Office. The
consultant will draft new statutes for Transport State Agencies guaranteeing their independent and commercial
operations while increasing their accountability and submitting them to external financial and technical audit to be
published annually.
1.3.    Define internal and external information flows in the new transport sector structure and determine the
needed technology to implement it. Based on activity 1.2, the consultant will define information flows required
within the MOT and between the MOT and other ministries, agencies, development institution. The consultant will
recommend the information technology required to handle this information flow in the next five years. The
recommendation will consist of preparing the appropriate technical specifications to be used for the procurement of
these goods and the corresponding cost estimates.
1.6.    Assist the new MOT in the implementation of the new structure and discharge of its new responsibilities
over a one-year period. The consultant will provide the needed support to the MOT after its restructuring, to
effectively implement the transport sector reform during a one-year period. This assignment will overlap with the
assignment 1.1 in defining the individual outputs and corresponding time schedule necessary to meet the reform
program objectives.
1.7.    Project Administration.
1.8.    Evaluate project inputs and lessons. The consultant will assess the impact of the project and deter-mine the
relevant lessons for the broader civil service reform.
2.1.    Determine the skills and qualifications of staff required to fulfill 1.1 and 1.2, their corresponding market
salaries and the likely cost of retaining them. The consultant will focus on finding some elements of comparison in
Georgia between the skills and qualifications needed and the market salaries. If the quality of data found in Georgia
is insufficient, the consultant will make a comparative study with other countries. The most critical element of this
assignment will consist of working out with the Ministry of Transport some specific proposal to retain the newly
recruited staff and a simple monitoring system to assess the staff turnover.
2.2.    Design a fair and transparent selection process for candidates to staff positions in the restructured MOT and
in Transport Agencies. The consultant will design the selection process based on the skills and qualification
required (ref. 2.1) and would assist the MOT in recruiting the proper staff.

2.3.    Design compensation package and other severance payments (consultant financed by the Bank for US$
20,000). The consultant will specifically review the contractual obligations of the Government toward its
employees, the applicable laws including labor laws, the prevailing labor market conditions, the attitudes and power
of public service trade unions, and address the affordability and replicability of the package for the Georgian Civil
Service as a whole.
2.4.    Assist in designing and implementing an Annual Transport User Survey. The consultant will assist the
MOT in designing and implementing a survey to assess/monitor the impact of the reform on the various transport
users (industry, individuals,) and the community. To that end, the document "Performance indicators for the road
sector", prepared by the OECD, could be used.
Project Component 2 - (US$570,000) Information Technology for the Ministry of Transport. This component
would include the provision of office technology to support the new MOT organization for a period of five years,
based on the technical analysis prepared during the MOT restructuring (item 1.3).
Project Component 3 - (US$350,000) Refurbishment the MOT Building. This component would cover part of
the MOT building to be used by the new Ministry. It includes wiring for OT, sanitation and water supply, power,
and furnishings required by the significantly reduced work force of the Ministry.
Project Component 4 - (US$760,000) Training of MOT staff and Georgian decision-makers. This component
would cover:
3.1.   Implement a training program with intemational lecturers. The training program, outlined in Annex 12, is
based on the "Development Strategy for the Transport Sector (March 1997)" and would be performed in the
Training Unit of the Transport Reform and Rehabilitation Center (TRRC), which successfully administered training
for 120 persons so far under the Transport Rehabilitation Project.
3.2.    Provide TRRC with essential documents on international restructuring. This will consist of creating an
information center in TRRC gathering relevant publications on worldwide experiences in restructuring.
3.3.    Offer a study tour for higher-level ministry officials to countries where restructuring has been successful.

Consultant or Indefinite Delivery Contract procurement methods is the best way of ensuring a consistent high quality for each
advisory assignment on the MOT restructuring. The PIU has proved to be effective and successful under the first TRP and the
TSRP preparation in arranging and managing contracts for a large number of individual consultants. Contract for item 1.6 and

Annex 5D
Georgia: Restructuring of the Ministry of Transport
Allocation of Loan Proceeds
1.     Disbursement. Direct payment procedures from IDA to suppliers would be used. Disbursements against
the categories described in the following table would be made upon receipt by IDA of fully documented
applications, except for contracts valued at less than US $200,000 for goods and works, US $100,000 for consulting
firms and US $50,000 for individual consultants, which would be made against certified statements of expenditures
(SOE). Supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained by the Borrower and made available to IDA during
supervision. The minimum size of application for direct withdrawals and issuance of commitments from the IDA
Credit account would be 20% of the amount of the Authorized Allocation to the Special Account.
2.     Special Account. To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account in
one of the major foreign commercial banks on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the Bank's
share of expenditures. The Authorized Allocation would be US$450,000, representing about four months of
average expenditures made through the Special Account. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation
to the Special Account would be limited to US$230,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the
Credit have reached the level of SDR 600,000, the initial allocation may be increased up to the Authorized
Allocation of US$450,000 by submitting the relevant Application for withdrawal. Applications for replenishment
of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn,
whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedure
as described in Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the Special Account which have
been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests.
3.     Accounting and auditing. The PIU for this project acted as PIU for a previous Bank's Credit soon to be
entirely disbursed. The PIU will reuse the financial management system from the previous project, since it proved
to be adequate. Audits for the previous project were acceptable to the Bank and submitted in time. An independent
auditor acceptable to IDA would conduct an annual audit of the project's account. Certified copies of these audits
would be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the Government's fiscal year. The cost of these audits
during the three years would be borne by the Ministry of Transport. The scope and content of the audits would be
agreed in advance with the IDA. Certified copies of the auditors' report would be retained by PIU for subsequent
review by IDA missions.

Expenditure Category    Amount in SDR                    Financing Percentage
1. Civil Works                 200,000    75 % of total expenditures
2. Goods                       350,000     100% of foreign expenditures;
100% of local expenditures (ex-factory);
80% of local expenditures for items procured locally
3. Consulting Services       1,010,000     100% of total expenditures
