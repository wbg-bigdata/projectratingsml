REPUBLIC OF CHILE
PRIMARY EDUCATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan and Proiect Summarv
Borrower:                Republic of Chile
Beneficiarv:             Ministry of Education (MINEDUC)
Amount:                  US$170 million, equiv4.ent
Terms:                   Annuity with 17 years maturity and a 4-year grace
period, with interest at the Bank's standard variable
rate.
Prolect Obiectives:      The central project objective is to assist the Govern-
ment in enhancing the efficiency, quality, and equity of primary
education in selected schools in urban and rural areas. The project
would also:
(a) expand the coverage and enhance the quality of preschool
education to increase primary school preparedness and reduce late
entry, repetition, and dropout in primary schools, especially for
5-year-olds living in poverty conditions;
(b) strengthen the institutional capacity of the MINEDUC central,
regional, and provincial offices, as well aa that of the education
departments of the munic'palities to direct and manage a
decentralized education system, and improve the managerial sk'llc of
the municipal and private-subsidized preschool and primary school
administrators? and
(c) assess alternative cost-effective approaches to meet the
secondary education needs of primary education graduates.
Protect Descri,tion:    The project would support the above objectives by
financing four components:
Primary Education (74 percent of total project cost): (i) imple-
menting 5,000 locally based quality improvement projects of a
pedagogical decentralization program (PRODEPE) through the
participation of teachers and principals of 5,000 selected municipal
and private-subsidized primary schools; (ii) strengthening the
educational testing system to assess and monitor student academic
achievement for about 240,000 students from either fourth or eighth
grades every year; (iii) providing inservice training for about
78,000 teachers, 8,000 school principals, and 625 supervisors;
(iv) distributing, on a targeted cost-recovery scheme, about 24.5
million primary textbooks for all municipal and private-subsidized
primary students, about 870,000 sets of complementary reading and
teaching materials, and teaching equipment for primary schools;
(v) hiring 500 new teachers to provide eight grades in 500 incom-
plete rural primary schools; (vi) constructing 500 classrooms in
rural areas; (vii) upgrading and refurbishing classrooms in about
2,500, mostly rural, primary schools; (viii) establishing an



- viii -
experimental education communication computer network in 66, mostly
rural, primary schools; (ix) providing henlth screening and
referrals to 250,000 first graders every year; and (x) establishing
monetary incentives for inservice teacher training and lecturing in
deprived, mostly rural primary schools.
Preschool Education (16 percent of total proiect cost)s (i) expand-
ing the coverage of preschool education for about 16,000 urban and
30,000 rural, mostly 5-year-old children of low-income urban and
rural families by hiring 23 supervisors, 140 teachers, and 1,255
paraprofessionals; providing about 3,000 workshops to train 23,400
rural parents in the early stimulation of their children; construct-
ing 100 classrooms and refurbishing 75 rural facilities donated by
the communities; providing 18,000 daily food rations and 40,300 sets
of didactic materials; and (ii) enhancing the quality of existing
preschool services by hiring 50 supervisors, 163 teachers, and 164
paraprofessionals; providing inservice teacher training courses for
about 200 supervisors, 3,300 preschool principals and teachers, and
2,700 paraprofessionals; designing, producing, and distributing
about 102,000 sets of teaching materials; strengthening parent
participation through training workshops and a massive media
campaign; and establishing evaluation studies to ascertain the cost-
effecti.rnass of each preschool alternative implemented and the
medium-term impact of preschool on the child's education, behavior,
and skills.
Institutional Development (7 nercent of total proiect cost):
(i) reinforcing managerial skills at the central MINEDUC, regional,
and provincial levels by training about 500 staff to improve their
planning, programming, budgeting, and monitoring capacities;
(ii) providing management training to about 670 municipal education-
al employees (from 280 municipal departments of education, and 54
municipal Corporaciones); (iii) providing management skill training
for about 1,200 preschool and primary school administrators; and
(iv) developing practical manuals for planning, programming,
administration, budgeting, and monitoring decentralized education
activities; and (v) establishing an educational information system;
and
Secoadarv Education (1 oercent of total 2roiect cost): financing
about 12 studies on curriculum development, teacher training and
evaluation, as well as external and internal efficiency of secondary
education to assess cost-effective secondary education strategies te
meet the future needs of greater numbers of primary education
graduates.
Expected Benefits:       The principal benefits include:
(a) enhancing the efficiency and quality of preschool and primary
education through improved educational inputs;
(b) improving the equity of the education system, mainly through
targeted preschool expansion, relevant teaching materials and
infrastructure for the rural areas, and inistitution of PRODEPE,
which will promote poverty alleviation on poor, urban and rural
subsidized primary schools;



- ix -
(c) facilitating the decentralization process, through the
participation of teachers and school principals in the design of
quality improvement projects, of supervisors, the municipal and
provincial authorities, and the provincial education Councils :In
project selection; and
'd) increasing the institutional managerial capabilities by
supporting: (i) the MINEDUC in translating educational policies and
strategies into concrete programmatic actions, targeting resources
to deprived schools, and periodically monitoring sector achievements
and problems through improved jector programming, budgeting,
information and analysis skills at its central, regional, and
provincial levels of decision making; (ii) the municipalities in
executing mnore effectively educational programs derived from the
education sector policies, and administering more efficiently the
resources of their assigned municipal schools; (iii) school
principals and proprietors in implementing technical-pedagogical
supervision and school management; and (iv) the timely detection
through the education information network of possible wastage in
resource allocation and resultant better deployment of teachers and
other educational resources.
Risks and Safeguards:   The major risks to project implementation are:
(a) possible distortions in targeting project interventions; and
(b) recentralization of education services. These risks will be
reduced by: (a) implementing precise targeting criteria to benefit
deprived urban and rural schools; (b) adopting suitable operational
and procedural manuals and training for provincial and municipal
education authorities, school principals, and supervisors; (c) care-
fully selecting and training key personnel participating in the
Project Implementation Unit, and in PRODEPE's disbursement and
monitoring; (d) promoting the participation of the municipalities
and communities in project implementation; and (e) close supervision
by the Bank.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The current Chilean Administration has adopted economic policies
consistent with the functioning of a private sector led market economy, while
promoting the improved delivery of targeted social services to enhance equity.
Productive activities in the economy are diversifying rapidly, as Chile
reduces its earlier dependence on natural resource extraction, increases the
international competitiveness of its value-added exports, and develops its
service sector, mainly through technological innovation. In order to facili-
tate and accelerate this process, the Government wishes to upgrade flows of
human capital, starting with an effort to improve the efficiency, quality, and
equity of the primary education system. Moreover, over the past two decades,
Chile, has implemented a significant reform of the social sectors. The reform
redefined the role of the Government, decentralized major social development
responsibilities to the municipalities, promoted privatization, targeted
public social expenditures to low-income groups, and channelled resources to
municipal and private-subsidized schools.
1.02      Chile's quantitative educational indicators compare favorably to
higher income economies: average years of schooling now attained by Chileans
is among the highest in Latin America, and adult illiteracy is among the
lowest in the region. Access problems in primary education are now largely
resolved. However, despite these accomplishments, the Achievement Assessment
System (SINCE) and educational statistics demonstrate that the sector has not
fully translated educational policy reforms into higher levels of quality,
efficiency, and equity, especially among low-income urban and rural groups.
Student achievement demonstrates low level mastery of objectives maintained
for the prescribed curriculum and is therefore not likely to contribute to the
quality of human resources necessary for a dynamically developing country.
Educational effectiveness has been hindered by the ambiguously defined joint
responsibilities brought by the reforms of the last decade between the
Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) and the municipalities. Furthermore, the
subsidy system implemented with the education reforms did not fully respond to
wide differentials between municipalities in the unit costs of delivering
educational services; neitner did it stimulate private investments in rural
and adult education. It thus exacerbated inequities in access to quality
education, especially between rural and urban children. At the same time,
adoption of high-cost preschool models has slowed considerably the expansion
of coverage of such programs.
1.03      Within the framework reviewed above, the Chilean Government has
already mobilized substantially more resources for social services through the
tax reform law and national budget redistributicn. It has: (a) established
the Provincial Education Councils (PEC) as advisory and participatory bodies;
(b) sent to Congress legislation to establish a professional Teachers Statute
(TS) to provide monetary incentives for inservice teacher training and for
teaching in deprived primary schools, and to amend the formula for educational
subsidies to ensure improved distribution of resources to small rural schools;
and (c) implemented specific actions targeted to low-income subsidized primary
schools to improve education quality and foster education innovations in
150 targeted primary subsidized schools. Finally, the Chilean educational
authorities have adopted, as a national policy, the enhancement of the effi-
ciency, quality and equity of primary education, especially for lower income
rural and urban students. To complement this policy MINEDUC has decided to:
(a) expand coverage of preschool education; (b) strengthen the institutional
capacity of the MINEDUC and other authorities involved in education; and
(c) assess alternative cost-effective approaches to secondary education nceds.

II. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
A. Overview
Organization of the Educational Sector
2.01      The decentralized and well developed Chilean education system begins
with preschool for children under six years old. Preschool education is a
noncompulsory service offered by an array of public and private institutions
to promote children's social, psychomotor, and emotional development. Primary
education consists of an eight-year compulsory cycle for children 6 to 13
years old. Secondary education is furnished to students 14 to 17 years old
who have completed primary education. It involves a four-year cycle divided
into two tracks: (a) a scientific-humanistic curriculum that prepares
students for further studies through college; and (b) a technical-vocational
curriculum to prepare for work immediately after graduation. Special or
differentiated education is given to children 6 to 14 years old with learning
disabilities. Adult education programs are directed to adults 16 years and
older who want to learn to read and write or who need to complete primary or
secondary education.
2.02       MINEDUC carries its legally mandated functions of policy setting,
supervision, evaluation, and financial monitoring through its central,
regional, and provincial departments, largely independent of the municipa-
lities, which are in charge of the daily operation of the public schools.
Educational services are provided by the municipalities and private
proprietors, with the MINEDUC monitoring the quality of the services
delivered. The 334 municipalities provide educational services through their
Education Departments (280) or Corporaciones (54). Close to 15,500 schools
provide preschool, primary, secondary, and differentiated education in Chile.
The description and organization charts of the MINEDUC, regional, and the
provincial education departments appear in Annex 2.
Educational Reform of 1980
2.03      In 1980, Chile had a well-developed educational system that was one
of the oldest and most sophisticated in Latin America. MINEDUC provided
nearly all preschool, primary and secondary education and heavily subsidized
the two public and six private universities.  MINEDUC's 13 Regional Secre-
tariats (SEREMIS) were responsible for the administration and operation of all
public schools in the country.
2.04      At that time, the Government decided that such a highly centralized
system was not appropriate to respond to the problems of low efficiency and
low quality education. To address these concerns, the Government implemented
an administrative reform of the educational system. While the pre-reform
system awarded funds to schools and universities based on historical fiscal
allocations for teacher salaries and operating costs, the new system2
channelled resources to each municipality based on average monthly student
attendance. More specifically, this administrative reform consisted of:
(a) transferring the preschool, primary, and secondary schools to the
country's 325 municipalities (currently 334); (b) transferring a proportion of
the vocational secondary schools to private nonprofit organizations
("corporaciones") created by associations of employers; and (c) encouraging



-3-
through a subsidy payment per student ("subvenci6n") private individuals and
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to create tuition-free schools. Under
this new concept, the municipalities became completely autonomous in the
administration of material, financial, and human resources, as well as the
maintenance of schools.
2.05      The transfer of schools to the municipalities considerably reduced
the size of MINEDUC from 20,000 employees in 1980 to about 3,000 employees in
1990,L distributed by category as follows: managers, 14 percent; profes-
sional and technician, 49 percent; and clerical and services personnel,
37 percent. While the reform process brought a clear division of responsi-
bility between municipalities and the MINEDUC in some areas, ambiguously
stated responsibilities led to uncertainties in other areas. School personnel
administration, including hiring and firing of teachers and other school
personnel, is a municipal responsibility. Annual performance assessments of
teachers and other school personnel are carried out by municipalities, but
appear to be pro forma in many cases. Municipalities are currently in charge
of providing all support services, including diagnostic testing and libraries,
and making decisions about services provided to special categories of students
(e.g., those with learning disabilities). Joint responsibilities of municipa-
lities and central government agencies (including MINEDUC, the Ministries of
the Interior, Finance, and National Planning) include budgeting, accounting
controls, the management of resources to cover operational deficits (resulting
from frequent cases when municipal educational expenditures exceed income from
per student subsidies), and decisions about new construction and major
improvements in buildings and equipment. The Central Government also inter-
venes if municipal deficits are incurred, since municipalities are not
permitted to accumulate debt. Added to its oversight of municipal current
expenditures, the Government exercises tight control over municipal expendi-
tures for construction and school improvements via the regional offices of the
Ministry of Planning (MIDEPLAN).
Enrollment
2.06      Total pre-university enrollment for the school year 1989 amounted to
almost 3 million students attending over 15,000 schools (Annex 3, Table 1):
7.2 percent were registered in preschool, 66.8 percent in primary, 24.9 per-
cent in secondary (18.1 percent of which are in the scientific-humanistic
track and 6.8 percent in the technical-vocational track), and 1.1 percent in
differentiated education (Table 2, Annex 3). The Metropolitan Area (RM) of
Santiago encompassed 38.2 percent of the total enrollment; the regions of
Valparaiso (V), Concepcion (VIII), and Puerto Montt (X) comprised another
30.7 percent of the student population, with the remaining 31.1 percent
scattered throughout the other nine regions (Table 2, Annex 3). The municipal
schools serviced 58.7 percent of the total student population; the private
subsidized schools 32.1 percent; and the private nonsubsidized schools
9.2 percent (Table 3, Annex 3). The urban student population (in communities
with 301 or more inhabitants) represented 87.3 percent of the total. Female
1/   Out of the 3,000 employees, 21 percent are located at the MINEDUC in
Santiago; the rest are in the SEREMIS and the Provincial education
departments.

enrollment took nearly a 50 percent share of the total. Unlike many other
developing countries, gender discrimination in the Chilean educational system
is no longer an issue (Table 4, Annex 3). The regions of La Serena (IV),
Rancagua (VI), Talca (VII), Temuco (IX) and Puerto Mont (X), contain large
segments of rural and ethnic student populations (Table 4, Annex 3). A
breakdown of attendance by family income quintile shows a concentration of
low-income students in the municipal schools and of higher income students in
nonsubsidized private institutions (Table 5, Annex 3).
2.07      In the 1980s, total enrollment grew annually only 0.6 percent, i.e.,
from 2.84 million students in 1981 to 2.97 million in 1989. This limited
expansion was caused by a decrease of 7.1 percent in primary education
enrollment, even though there was an increase in the preschool, secondary, and
differentiated education enrollments (Table 6, Annex 3). The primary enroll-
ment decrease was mainly due to a decline in birthrate from 1.9 percent in
1970 to 1.67 percent in 1987, and a reduction in dropout rates (paras. 2.09
and 2.20). Net primary enrollment of the cohort of 6 to 13 years old has
remained very high for the past 20 years, increasing from 93 percent in 1970
to a peak of 98 percent in 1985, and slightly decreasing to its current level
of 95 percent.
2.08      Preschool Education.  Enrollment in preschool education has grown
rapidlv over the past decade totalling over 330,000 by 1989 (Tables 6 and 7,
Annex 3). Of these, 33.9 percent were registered in the municipal schools,
23.5 percenit in the private subsidized schools, 15.3 percent in National
Kindergarden Board (JUNJI; JUNTA Nacional de Jardines Infantiles), schools,
12.4 percent in INTEGRA schools, 1.8 percent in Jardines Familiares,
3.1 percent in NGO schools, and 9.9 percent in the paid-private schools.
These enrollments represent 28.4 percent of the cohort of 2- to 5-year-olds;
69.3 percent of total enrollment corresponded to children age 5; 20.7 percent
to 4 year olds, and the remaining 24.5 percent were 2 to 3 year olds (Table 8,
Annex 3). The number of teachers and paraprofessionals employed in preschool
education in 1989 is shown in Table 9, Annex 3.
2.09      Primary Education  In 1989, enrollment totaled 1,987,758 students,
representing 94.6 percert of the age group 6-13 years (Table 10, Annex 3).
Only a very sm.l1 number of children, most of them in need of special or
differentiated education, do not enroll in the primary schools. Enrollment
has decreased 7.1 percent since 1981, due to the decline in birthrates and a
reduction in dropout rates from 8 percent in 1981 to 2.7 percent in 1989.
After the 1980 reform, enrollment in the private-subsidized schools doubled as
their primary education student population rose from 14 percent of total
enrollment to 31 percent during this period. The increase came at the expense
of enrollment in the municipal schools, whose share decreased from 80.0
percent in 1980 to 62 percent in 1989. The enrollment share in paid-private
schools increased only slightly from 6 to 7 percent (Table 11, Annex 3).
2.10      Secondary Education.  Total enrollment in secondary education in
1989 reached 742,010 students (about 81.6 percent of the 14 to 17 year olds
cohort), or 37 percent more than in 1980. Enrollment in private-subsidized
schools increased almost three times in the last decade (Table 12, Annex 3).
Over 70 percent of secondary students chose the scientific-humanistic track
during the last decade. Two factors have contributed to this: (a) the



educational laws enacted in 1980 and 1981 that opened new alternatives for
admission to higher education; and (b) a high school student's expectations of
getting a better job by earning a university degree.
2.11      Higher Education.  During 1989 there were almost 230,000 students
enrolled in higher education institutions, an increase of 102.0 percent with
respect to the 1981 enrollment. The 34 universities absorbed 57 percent of
the enrollment; the 133 technological centers, 30 percent; and the 53
professional institutes, 13 percent. Twenty-two higher education institu-
tions out of the universe of 220 institutions received Government subsidies
during 1989. About 58.0 percent of the students were enrolled in the
subsidized, higher education institutions.
Adult Illiteracy and Years of Schooling
2.12      Chile reduced the illiteracy rate of its adult population from
16.4 percent in 1960 to 5.6 in 1989. According to the 1970 and 1982
population censuses, the average number of years of schooling of the Chilean
population increased from 4.3 to 7.7 in that period, with current estimates at
8.5 years of schooling. According to the most recent National Socioeconomic
Survey (Encuesta de Caracterizaci6n Socioecon6mica Nacional--CASEN) data, the
national schooling average for children under 15 years old is about 10 years,
and for household-heads in the fifth quintile is almost 12 years. This gives
Chile the second lowest illiteracy rate in Latin America and one of the
highest years of schooling rate. However, considerable variations exist in
average level of educational attainment by Region and by income quintile, with
the lowest rates not surprisingly in the poorest areas and social groups of
the country.
Women in Development
2.13      Chile has an outstanding record concerning the issue of Women in
Development (WID). No gender bias exists in school enrollment in all the
educational levels (para. 2.06 and Annex 3, Table 4). In its long tradition
of textbooks distribution for all primary school students, the Chilean
Government, through MINEDUC, has explicitly stated no gender biases as a
precondition to procure the publication, production, and distribution of new
editions from the private sector.
Educational Expenditures and Finance
2.14      Public spending for education in Chile has declined during the last
decade. Education budget's share of GNP fell to 2.5 percent in 1990,
declining from almost 13 percent of total public spending in 1981 to 8.1 in
1990 (Table 1 and Chart 1, Annex 4), The decentralization of education funds
to private-subsidized schools ar.d municipalities and the financing of private
and municipal subsidized schools through subvention payments, now approximate
60.0 percent of the education budget (Table 2, Annex 4). As noted in Table 3
and Chart 2 in Annex 4, there has been a dramatic decline in higher
education's share of total public spending in the sector.



2.15      Even though government has given priority to primary education,
public spending per student has declined in real terms during the 1980's
(Table 4, Annex 4). Capital spending has represented a small share of sector
spending (Table 5, Annex 4). Due to a number of factors, including loss of
students to newly-formed private schools, municipalities experienced deficits
in their education departments when the amounts provided through government
subsidies failed to cover educational costs. Municipalities have responded by
transferring funds from their own resources to bridge the gap. The total
contribution of municipalities to educational funding amounted to 3.2 percent
of total education spending in 1990 (Table 6, Annex 4) and is less than
7.5 percent of the amount transferred to the municipalities through subsidies.
To address the issues of adequate and equitable funding, a reform of the
Subvention Law (SL) is now before the legislature. Its intention, among other
objectives, is to bring subsidy payments more closely in line with actual
costs and to adjust more adequately for differences between communities in
terms of population dispersion and the cost of providing educational services.
The intended result is a "regularization" of educational finance in subsidized
public and private schools, whereby Central Government payments for education
would flow through the education budget rather than through special alloca-
tions to municipalities to cover deficits. This adjustment will certainly
decrease MINEDUC's cost to administer the subsidy scheme, and personnel time
will be freed to focus on improved quality issues.
2.16       Personnel costs dominate sector spending.  A Teachers' Statute (TS)
already enacted (Law 19070, dated July 1, 1991) will improve teachers' pay and
working conditions, provide monetary incentives for inservice training and
teaching in deprived and isolated schools, and make other changes in the legal
structure affecting the profession. The TS is part of the government's
commitment to improve conditions in the sector and contributes to better
educational quality (see Annex 5, paras. 3 and 4, for a brief discussion).
The TS will call for increases in recurrent expenditure beginning in 1991, for
which budget allocation has already been provided, rising to an estimated
total of 38.7 billion pesos in 1995 (Table 2, Annex 5). This increase, while
substantial, is sustainable. Annex 5, Table 1 demonstrates that projected
growth of educational recurrent spending, including the impact of the project
and the TS, will represent 11.6 percent of public spending in 1995 declining
slightly thereafter.
2.17      The decline in public spending for education has been counter-
balanced by increaaed private sector payments. The share of private
contribution to educational costs has increased from roughly 21 percent of
total sector finance (including central education, municipalities, and private
education) to 31.6 percent between 1985 and 1990. Most of the private share
of sector spending and most of the increase in private payments is at the
university level (Table 7 and Chart 3, Annex 4). Estimated private higher
education payments grew from 14.7 percent of total educational spending to
over 24 percent (or roughly three-fourths of total private funding) between
1985 and 1990. Combined municipal and private payments have grown during the
period of educational decentralization, and accounted for almost one-third of
total sector finance in 1990. These payments did not, however, fully
compensate for the decline in public finance of education. Total sector
finance, including public and private, declined from 8.64 percent of GNP to
3.7 percent from 1985 to 1990 (Table 6, Annex 4).

B. Sectoral Issues
2.18      The main education sector issues are:  (a) unacceptably low primary
education efficiency; (b) unsatisfactory education quality in both academic
achievement (output) and learning environment (educational inputs);
(c) inequities in the delivery and quality of services; (d) weak managerial,
financial, and administrative capacity; and (e) shortcomings of post-primary
education.
Unacceptably Low Primary Education Efficiency
2.19      Although Chile has by and large already solved the traditional
problems of literacy and access to primary education, unsatisfactory efficien-
cy at this educational level continues to be an issue. Late primary school
entrance, high repetition and dropout in primary schools, and the existence of
quite a large number of "incomplete" primary rural schools not offering the
full eight primary grades, have the greatest impact on low promotion and
completion rates.
2.20      Late Primary School Entrance.  Figures for 1989 suggest that some
44.0 percent of the 6 year olds enroll in the first grade each year; another
50.0 percent join at age seven, and the rest (about 6 percent), at age 8 or
above. Available data show that late entrance, however small, increases
repetition rates, and decreases the completion rates of primary education to
the point where about 17.7 percent of students enrolled lag behind the
standard age for each grade in primary education by one or more yearss which
increases to 23.4 percent at the secondary level (Table 1, Annex 6).
2.21      Repetition and Dropout Rates in Primary Education.  The average
repetition rate for primary education at the national level in 1988, as
calculated by UNESC0-OREALC,L was 12.2 percent (Table 2, Annex 6). It was
higher between the fourth and eighth grades (average 14 percent) and in the
regions with heavy concentrations of rural and ethnic students, such as Talca
and Temuco (Table 3, Annex 6). Private paid schools have shown the lowest
repetition rate, and thus the highest promotion rates. Municipal schools
repetition rate is slightly better than private subsidized schools (Table 2,
Annex 6). Dropout rates vary from 2 percent in first grade to 8.0 percent by
the eighth grade. The dropout rate is higher in municipal and private
subsidized schools than in paid private ones. The dropout rate in rural and
ethnic regions (such as Region X) is more than double the national average
(Tables 2 and 3, Annex 6).
2.22      Incomplete Primary Rural Schools.  About 7 percent of the total
primary schools in Chile (568) offer five grades or less, and 48 percent
(3,814) do not offer the last two grades of the full primary cycle (Table 4,
Annex 6). The existence of these so-called incomplete primary schools, mostly
located in rural and ethnic communities, keep many students from completing
their primary cycle.

by MINEDUC Planning Division, and correcting for reenrollment which tends
to understate repetition.



2.23      Promotion and Completion Rates in Primary Education.  According to
UNESCO/OREALC estimates, the average number of students/years required in
Chile for promotion to the next primary grade is 1.2 to 1.3 years; one-fifth
of the total enrollment will complete the primary level after repeating two or
more times, resulting in a total of almost 12.4 years expended for the 8-year
cycle in municipal schools (8.8 years in the paid-private primary schools)
(Table 5, Annex 6). Here again it appears that significant scope for improve-
ment exists. While Chile's national completion rates are among the highest in
the Latin America and the Caribbean Region, the cumulative effects of late
entrance, repetition, and dropout rates, and the incomplete primary schools,
mean that only 57.5 percent of the initial student cohort finish the eighth
basic education cycle. Some of the specific causes of poor performance are:
lack of personalized instruction, no periodic student evaluation during the
school year, inadequate time spent by teachers on learning activities, and
poor supervision, especially by school principals. There is also evidence of
an increasing gap in quality caused by the differential access to educational
materials, textbooks, and computers in primary schools. In addition,
differencas occur by socioeconomic group in terms of child care and stimula-
tion after school hours. There are indications of age heterogeneity in the
classroom, originated mostly by late entrance to first grade and continuous
repetition, which makes it more difficult for the teacher to organize meaning-
ful learning experiences.  Finally, the limited bilingual primary education
programs, are insufficient to serve ethnic groups, which represent perhaps
5.0 percent of the primary student population.
2.24      Repetition Rates in Secondary Education.  About 85 percent of
primary education graduates continue to the secondary level. Repetition rates
for the secondary education vary from 5.4 percent for paid-private schools to
15.3 percent for the municipal schools, whereas dropout rates climb respec-
tively from 3 to almost 11 percent. There has been a decline in secondary
repetition and dropout rates since 1980. The secondary completion rate is
approximately 71 percent,2L which is equivalent to an internal efficiency of
41 percent of the initial primary school cohort./ It takes an average of
5.6 years for a municipal secondary student to graduate, and 4.4 years for a
paid-private secondary student (Table 5, Annex 6).
Unsatisfactory Educational Quality
2.25      The unsatisfactory education quality in both academic achievement
(education output)--shown by a decrease in Spanish (Table 6, Annex 6) and
mathematics (Table 7, Annex 6) in the 1982 to 1988 period--and in the learning
environment (education inputs) has been mainly caused by: (a) insufficient
supervision and monitoring by school principals and supervisors; (b) deficien-
cies in the primary education texts and in the curriculum on which they are

based; (c) lack of other supplementary educational materials; (d) lack of
skillful, well-trained, and highly motivated teaching force; and (e) insuffi-
cient use of existing academic achievement test reAults to guide the decision-
making process at all institutional levels, and to target compensatory
pedagogical measures to high-risk students.
2.26      Educational Supervision and Monitoring.  Educational supervision and
monitoring is a key instrument to imprcie the quality of the services provided
if performed primarily by the school principal in conjunction with and
supported by the pedagogical supervisor. Educational supervision in the
Chilean preschool and primary education system is deficient basically for two
reasons: school principals are not trained adequately to supervise pedagogi-
cally their teaching force nor do they have the skills and resources needed to
implement successfully such a function in their schools. On the other hand,
the super-visory labor force is limited. There are only 40 preschool and 375
primary education supervisors to monitor almost 4,200 preschools and over
8,500 primary education schools in the country, comprising a combined teaching
force of 77,000. Supervisors usually lack transportation, facilities, and
resources. They are also overloaded with other administrative tasks not
directly related to technical-pedagogical activities. As a consequence, most
schools, especially the rural ones, do not receive the adequate pedagogical
supervision they require during the school year.
2.27      Textbooks and Curriculum.  There are several deficiencies in the
primary education texts and in the curriculum on which they are based. These
deficiencies can be particularly significant when teachers themselves lack
mastery of the material, and when students lack supplemental learning opportu-
nities in the home or at school. Some of the written learning objectives are
not presented in the detail needed to test whether each objective has been
accomplished by the students. Another deficiency is that texts do not
necessarily go beyond straightforward application of the materials presented.
Current textbooks also lack complementary teaching material relevant to the
rural areas. In this environment, an improved curriculum and textbooks may be
the most cost-effective means to improve learning of the type needed to
prepare students for the increasingly modern and technologically changing
economy. The primary education curricula, textbooks, and teaching materials
do not contain gender biases. Furthermore, the MINEDUC has explicit'ly stated
no gender biases as a precondition to procure the publication, production, and
distribution of new textbooks and teaching materials. No cost-recovery
policies on textbooks and/or other teaching materials has so far been
implemented by the Chilean authorities, yet the current administration has
agreed to implement a targeted cost-recovery policy (paras. 3.17 and 3.39).
2.28      Supplementarv Educational Materials.  Municipal primary education
schools tend to lack supplementary educational materials such as globes, maps,
charts, educational toys, supplemental texts, and workbooks. Likewise, more
costly but effective resources such as libraries, classroom reading resources,
science kits, and computers are rarely in evidence. The above situation also
prevails at the preschool and secondary schools. Private subsidized and
nonsubsidized schools have a somewhat larger, but still inadequate quantity of
didactic materials.



- 10 -
2.29      Teaching Labor Force.  An important factor to improve quality of
education is to incorporate into the educational system a skillful, well-
trained, and highly-motivated teaching force. According to the Chilean
education authorities, there is ample room to improve the above situation with
the current 9,000 preschool and 67,000 primary school teachers. Prevailing
teacher salaries range from a low of 8 times the present individual student
subsidy (most frequently observed in recently established private-subsidized
schools not affiliated with churches or nonprofit organizations) to a high of
some 20 times the student subsidy (most frequently observed in municipal and
NGO schools). Average primary school teacher salaries decreased 48 percent in
real terms in the municipal schools and 61 percent in the private-
subsidized schools in the 1981 to 1990 period.5 Given the low level of
teacher salaries, the quality of those now applying for teaching positions is
probably also decreasing. As a result, effective teacher time on tasks has
diminished, as indicated by the Chilean education authorities.
2.30      Beginning in 1987, teachers w7ere required to have college degrees;
however, many teachers without degrees were permitted to obtain them through
relatively short correspondence courses. There is evidence of insufficientI
preservice and inservice training and upgrading programs and incentives for
preschool and primary education teachers and paraprofessionals. This
situation is more apparent in the case of the paraprofessionals employed in
some of the preschool modalities.
2.31      Academic Achievement Assessment.  Between 1982 and 1984, the MINEDUC
administered two sets of tests nationwide--known as Programa de Evaluacion del
Rendimiento Escolar (PER)--to 390,000 fourth and eighth graders in 3,200
schools. These tests were designed to measure cognitive achievement in the
areas of reading, mathematics, social sciences, and natural sciences. A new
achievement test, an updated and corrected version of PER known as SIMCE, was
applied in 1988 to 233,000 fourth graders in 5,600 primary schools; in 1989
the test was again applied, this time to 193,000 eighth graders in 4,600
schools. About 3,700 primary rural schools with enrollments of six students
or less in fourth or eighth grades were not included in the 1988 and 1989
applications of SIMCE, because the current assessment instrument is not
appropriate for small groups. SIMCE has been transferred from the Catholic
51   The average gross monthly salary for a grade 20 primary school teacher
(typically achieved after a couple years of experience) decreased in
constant prices of 1990 from 128,861 pesos in 1981 to 67,350 pesos in
1990 for the municipal school, and to 49,770 pesos in a private-
subsidized schools. Coleaio de Profesores de Chile, 1990. Jara,

declined to reach an average of 3,800 teachers (4.7 percent) per year as
of 1984. CPEIP's training program for 1991 aims at 16,000 principals and
teachers.

University (UC) to MINEDUC, including key intellectual leadership familiar
with its design, operation, and processing.
2.32      Test results by school type show that the paid-private schools
scored highest, followed by the private-subsidized, and then the municipal
schools (Table 8, Annex 6). These results, although suggestive, should be
interpreted with caution, since the information was not adequately disaggre-
gated for further analysis. PER (1982) and SIMCE (1988) results for Spanish
and mathematics show no improvement in the quality of education during the
1980s (Tables 6 and 7, Annox 6). Furthermore, the gap between the highest
scores in the Spanish test, shown in the paid-private school, and the lowest
scores in the high-risk municipal schools, widened in the 1982 to 1988 period.
Current academic achievement in the Chilean primary education systems is below
the standards called for in the sector policy (paras. 2.50-2.52, and Annex 7).
2.33      In spite of SIMCE's sophisticated tests, procedures, and organiza-
tion, they are not currently used as an educational evaluation system. This
is because SIMCE does not provide the information required to the key inter-
ested groups. MINEDUC and the municipal education authorities need the data
for correcting educational policies and strategies targeted to ameliorate
inequities in the quality of the educational services provided, especially
among lower-income groups. School teachers, principals, and supervisors could
utilize the information for upgrading teaching and learning practices, and
developing more suitable teaching and learning materials. Finally, parents
would find the data useful for information on progress of their children, and
possible school choice. The same is true for other evaluation studies
undertaken, such as those implemented by the UC under the sponsorship of
UNICEF to evaluate JUNJI's preschool models of jardines infantiles and
jardines infantilas fariliares.Y
Inequities in the Delivery and Quality of Services
2.34      Inequities in the delivery and quality of services are manifested by
regional disparities in: (a) preschool participation; (b) children nutrition-
al status; (c) primary school promotion rates; (d) achievement raten-
(e) deployment of specialized and compensatory education resources; and
(f) average years of schooling and literacy rates of the adult population.
2.35      Ineguities in Preschool Participation.  A recent study undertaken by
UNICEF in Chile found that close to 73 percent of children under 6 years old
living in poor urban and rural areas are not served by any modality of
preschool education (Table 9, Annex 6). Of those not served, 23 percent live
in conditions of extreme poverty. Children with psychomotor and social skills
deficits are at higher risk of repetition and dropout during primary school.
7/   The evaluation shows the positive contribution of these preschool
alternatives to improve the child's nutritional status, as well as its
social and psychomotor development. Yet, these studies have had little
effect on educational policy, the exception being the formulation of the
preschool component of this project. Evaluaci6n v provecci6n del

2.36      Disparities in Children's Nutritional Status.  Although Chile has
made rem,kable achievements in reducing malnutrition among young children,
there still are distinct subgroups potentially at risk from suffering from
moderate to severe malnutrition, according to weight-for-age standards.
Infants and preschoolers, particularly from low-income families, and school
children not participating in any preventive health control, feeding program,
and/or dayeare programs mainly conform the groups at risk. National preva-
lence rates mask often sign!'4cant disparities in child nutritional statua by
geographic area of residence, age group, and family socioeconomic characteris-
tics. The prevalence of malnutrition among children in select, predominantly
rural, southern regions of Chile is more than double that of generally large
urbanized northern regions.
2.37      Rezional Disparities in Primary School Promotion Rates.  Unsatis-
factory national primary education promotion rates, averaging 42.5 percent for
the initial cohort of students, hit hardest among deprived children from low-
income households, thus indicating an area for priority attention. About one-
third of first-grade students living in poor rural and urban areas may be
repeating that grade. Although at the national level some 10.7 percent of all
first-grade students repeat it, and some 10 to 16 percent repeat at least once
between the second and eighth grades, repetition of lower-income students
(half the population) is nearer 20 to 25 percent.
2.38      Regional Disparities in Primary School Achievement.  The 1988
nationwide SIMCE test of fourth graders also revealed some regional inequities
(Table 10, Annex 6). For example, school performance in the urban poor and
rural regions of Temuco (IX) and Puerto Montt (X) was half that of more
affluent zones. Furthermore, the different applications of primary achieve-
ment tests (PER and SIMCE) in 1982, 1984, 1988, and 1989, show that the
average cognitive performance in Spanish and mathematics of primary students,
especially poor students, is not improving (Tables 6 and 7, Annex 6). Statis-
tical studies based on the information provided by the evaluation tests found
that socioeconomic factors are the main determinants of school achievement in
Chile, ad is the case in many other countries. The implication is a need for
stronger compensatory measures, such as early childhood stimulation, motiva-
tion, and personality building, which are capable of modifying variables at
school level and eventually improving student achievement, especially among
poor students. School pedagogical supervision, primarily undertaken by school
principals with the -echnical support of qualified and experienced school
supervisors, should also be redesigned to target schools most in need. Urban
poor and rural schools should be provided with more textbooks, teaching aids
and reading materials.
2.39      Inequities in the De2lovment of Specialized and ComDensatorv
Education Resources. Municipalities, especially those with relatively low
enrollment levels, often lack the specialized resources and expertise needed
for the design, operation, and supervision of special education programs
(geared fundamentally to those students with various types of learning
disabilities) that can very quickly become repeaters and eventual dropouts
from the primary system. The per student subsidies provided by the Government
for this type of program are clearly inadequate to cover costs. Municipali-
ties can provide these services only by cross-subsidizing them with funds
intended for regular instruction or by providing supplementary funds.

2.40      Regional Disparities in Averaze Years of Schooling and Literacy
Rates of the Adult Population. There are marked signs of existing social
inequities in the Chilean society as measured by the average years of school-
ing and literacy rates of the adult population. According to the most recent
CASEN survey, there is a 3.8 years difference in average years of schooling
between Chileans in the lowest income quintile and those in the highest.
Relatively larger differences exist between Chileans 15 years and older in
first and fifth quintile urban families (5.9 years) than among those from
first and fifth quintile rural families (3.1 years). The above are marked
signs of existing social inequities in the Chilean society.
Weak ManaRerial. Financial, and Administrative Capacity
2.41      The educational sector has insufficient institutional ce?ability to
strengthen and consolidate ongoing education reforms to assure educational
efficiency, quality, and equity improvements, especially among low-income
urban and rural groups, and thus fortify the decentralization process. This
situation stems primarily from the limited ability of: (a) MINEDUC to
translate effectively educational policies and strategies into concrete
programmatic actions, target resources to deprived schools through the
municipalities, and periodically monitor sector achievements; (b) the munici-
palities to execute educational programs derived from sector policies, and
administer efficiently the resources of their assigned municipal schools; and
(c) schEol administrators to implement adequately technical-pedagogical
superv.aion and school management. Moreover, the lack of a timely, trust-
worthy, and relevant Educational Information System (EIS) has not allowed the
Chilean educational authorities to ascertLin the impact of a decreasing
primary enrollment on resource utilization, resulting in possible overstaffing
in some subsidized schools. The lack of a ?rofessional teachers statute
regulating the teachers' out-of-class pedtgogical activities, the inservice
teacher training inducement and promotion, as well as appropriate reviews in
the current subvention law (SL) to avoid inequities in resource allocation to
small, mostly rural primary schools, has firther weakened the educational
institutional capacity.
2.42      Translation of Educational Policies and StrateRies Into Concrete
Programmatic Actions. In order to properly u ilize funds being allocated to
the sector it is critical to improve the avai.bility of timely and reliable
management information that could guide policy-making and targeting of
resources. Due to lack of appropriate hardware, software, and technical
personnel, the central, regional, provincial, municipal, and local (school)
education authorities have not been able to make timely and relevant decisions
based on the current educational statistical data base and sector financing
information system. In addition, the weak and understaffed system of school
supervision and inspection in MINEDUC's 40 Provincial Departments, and the
lack of planning and managerial skills in the municipalities has cast primary
and secondary schools almost adrift in a condition of quasi-autonomy. As a
consequence, the NINEDUC has been unable to ensure properly that curriculum
standards and guidelines are suitably applied and/or that investment resources
(targeted for school construction and maintenance) and other educational
inputs are correctly deployed by the municipalities i-. the schools. The
ineffective monitoring and supervisory system currently in place hinders the
timely implementation of corrective measures that would assure the provision
of better educational service3, especially for the poor.

2.43      Insufficlent Municipal Management Capability.  Municipal education
authorities, both at the DEM's and the Corporations, lack adequate procedures
and operational manuals on: (a) microplanning techniques for efficient
deployment and targeting of available resources; (b) personnel management;
(c) formulation of school construction, o luipping, and refurbishing projects;
and (d) financing, accounting, and auditing. Furthermore, some municipal
governments undersupply several important services that could enhance educa-
tional quality and improve the completion rates of primary education. There
seems to be limited information regarding proven and cost-effective education-
al techniques used in other countries. Tests for the assessment and diagnosis
of students with learning disabilities are very limited. There is a similar
lack of support for the education of indigenous groups for whom Spanish is a
second language. Primary facilities and equipment are generally adequate in
the better-off municipalities, but not in the deprived, mostly rural schools.
Certain facilities that could improve the auality of education are generally
lacking. These include science kits, libraries and classroom reading
resources, space to accommodate students with learning disabilities, and
computer-aided education laboratories. The quality of physical facilities in
the private-paid schools, although variable, is generally higher than in the
municipal and private-subsidized school system, where municipalities and
private proprietors have not been able, in general, to provide a systematic
and periodic maintenance. Finally, municipal and private-subsidized school
principals do not receive adequate training and advice on school management
and technical-pedagogical supervision.
2.44      Resources intended for school construction, equipment, and mainte-
nance are allocated by the Central Government to the Ministry of Education and
to the municipalities through the Ministry of Interior, plus a small addition-
al amount through the President's Social Fund and other sources. The total
amount of capital spending has been very low during the 1980's, ranging
between one to 2.0 percent of the total sector spending (Table 5, Annex 4).
Much of this came from an InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) loan to support
the Ministry of Interior Development Fund. However, the fungibility of these
funds, the lack of sufficient funds to cover operating expenses, especially in
poor municipalities, and the total autonomy of the municipalities, leads in
some cases to such resources being used to cover school operating deficits or
investments in other activities.
2.45      Professional Teachers Statute.  The lack of a professional teacher
statute has restrained: (a) increasing teacher time on task and productivity;
(b) good teachers from working in disadvantaged schools; (c) teachers from
engaging in teaching skill-upgrading activities; (d) offsetting teachers real
wages decline due to cost of living increases (para. 2.28); and (e) offering
cost-effective opportunities for senior teachers to retire.U The Government
is effectively addressing these issues with a new TS which has high potential
benefits (para. 3.27).
8/   Teachers with 26 or more years of service represent 12.5 percent of the
teaching labor force.

2.46      Education Subsidies.  The present design of school subsidies, based
largely on the type of education provided and monthly average student atten-
dance, discriminates against small, typically rural schools with relatively
low student/teacher ratios. The inherently high fixed costs of education,
reflected in its teacher-intensive nature, make it difficult for small rural
schools to reach break-even points. For these cases, the current subsidy does
not provide for teaching materials, administration, and maintenance, and in
some cases, sufficient teacher salaries. Also, the subsidy does not stimulate
private investment in rural and adult education. Nor does it take into
account cost differentials by region, educational modality, or specialty
within a given educational level. The subsidy unjustifiably penalizes schools
for student absenteeism not directly imputable to the student, such as the
ones prompted by rain and flooding in the rural areas. The Executive Branch
initiative to modify the existing SL addresses the deficit issue of mostly
poor rural municipalities (para. 3.29).
ShortcominRs of Post-Primary Education
2.47      Shortcomings in post-primary education mainly refer to:  (a) the
secondary curriculum modes; and (b) equity in the delivery of secondary
education to low-income primary graduates.
2.48      Secondary Dual Curriculum Modes.  Secondary education enrollment has
expanded from 30 percent of the relevant age group in the early 1970s to about
82 percent at present. This enrollment increase has brought some problems
related to the difficulties of serving students with different levels of
preparation, a greater age range than in the past, and diverse career and
educational aspirations. The two track secondary education system has not:
(a) adapted itself to the changing needs and requirements; (b) planned and
implemented adequately its curriculum, resulting in an overloaded curriculum;
and (c) been evaluated. The gap between subsidized and non-subsidized schools
has consistently widened. The economic crisis has led to deterioration of
physical facilities, especially for scientific and technical subjects and up-
to-date educational materials. The various parties concerned with educational
policy and strategy have not been able to engage in fruitful dialogue on the
issues. There is a pervasive sense that secondary school education has
stagnated and fallen far behind Chile's needs in a modern and rapidly-changing
world, and that the time is propitious for a careful consideration of the
objectives and alternative strategies for this subsector.
2.49      Eguity in the Delivery of Secondary Education to Low-Income Primary
Graduates. Many of the problems of the subsector have to do with inequitable
delivery of educational services to these very groups. The recent CASEN data
showed that coverage and access continue to be lower for the low-income
stratum of society. Moreover, repetition and dropout rates are higher than
average in the schools that serve these groups. Critics argue that the study
plans designed for a smaller and more homogenous and elite student body are
inappropriate for a substantial portion of the present enrollees. Indicators
of achievement for secondary school students are largely confined to "academic
aptitude tests" that many universities require of applicants. It is these
tests that underscore the widening quality gap between public and private paid
secondary schools. There are indications that public secondary schools
serving students from lower-income families have more serious qualitative
problems than the average of public schools, although more information is
needed on this and other aspects of the secondary system.

C. Government Sectoral Obiectives and Stratep.y
2.50      The Chilean Government has assigned top priority to upgrading flows
of new human capital within an overall strategy of increasing Chile's competi-
tiveness in the international economy. Enhancing the efficiency, quality, and
equity of primary education, especially among lower-income students, is the
logical starting point for addressing this priority.
2.'51     The following strategies, basically targeted to deprived urban and
rural primary schools, have been approved by the Chilean authorities to
achieve stated educational policies: (a) expanding coverage and enhancing the
quality of preschool education to increase primary school preparedness and
reduce late entry, repetition, and dropout rates, especially for 5 year olds
living in poverty conditions; (b) establishing a pedagogical decentralization
program to induce the participation of teachers and school principals in
implementing school quality improvement plans in municipal and private-sub-
sidized primary schools; (c) strengthening the educational testing system to
evaluate and monitor student performance on a continuous basis; (d) enhancing
the quality of diverse educational inputs; (e) offering the full primary
eighth grade cycle in incomplete primary schools; (f) strengthening the
institutional capacity of the MINEDUC, regional and provincial departments,
the municipalities, to support the ongoing decentralization process; and
(g) assess alternative cost-effective approaches to meet the secondary
education needs of primary graduate students, especially from low-income urban
and rural areas. The policy and strategy matrix appears in Annex 7.
2.52      Implementation of the above strategy has already started.  The
MINEDUC implemented a "900 Deprived Primary Schools Program," under a grant
provided by the Nordic countries. This program aims to improve student
achievement among 160,000 first to fourth graders of low-income municipal and
private-subsidized schools that scored low on the SIMCE and have high repeti-
tion and dropout rates. This program comprises: (a) allocating teaching
materials; (b) refurbishing primary school buildings; (c) providing inservice
teacher and supervisor training; and (d) sustaining remedial workshops for
potential dropout and repeaters. The technical, managerial, and logistical
experience gained in this program since 1990, as well as the teaching and
learning materials developed will be transferred to the proposed project. In
addition, the Teacher Training and Educational Research Center (Centro de
Perfeccionamento, Experimentacion, e Investigaciones, y Tecnol6gica--CPEIP)
has launched a national program to induce the participation of supervisors,
teachers and principals of about 150 municipal and private subsidized schools
to develop quality improvement projects. The experience learned during its
implementation will be transferred to the proposed project, especially
concerning the pedagogical decentralization process (paras. 3.04 to 3.08).
Finally, to induce community involvement in the Chilean educational process,
PECs were established by Presidential Decree in each of the 40 Provinces of
Chile during the second quarter of 1990. These Councils have an education
advisory capacity and are participatory bodies comprising MINEDUC and
municipal authorities, teachers, and parents. Bylaws governing these Councils
have been enacted.



- 17 -
2.53      The financial capacity to carry out these programs and policies is
favorable. The Government has implemented a major tax reform that has
produced additional resources for the public sector as a whole. Education and
health have received a substantial proportion of the social sector allocation.
The tax reform went into operation in the last quarter of 1990 producing
additional revenues that were distributed as budget supplements during that
year. The education budget for 1991 of almost 255.5 billion pesos (Table 2,
Annex 4) shows an increase of 54.6 billion pesos (US$158.3 million) over the
budget for 1990.1  After adjustment for inflation, the increase in the
education budget between 1990 and 1991 in real terms was 11.4 percent. IWhile
this substantial increase in the education budget is a one-time step upward in
sector resources, and increases in the future will be in line with overall
increases in public revenues. The tax reform assures that adequate resources
will be available for counterpart funding to sustain the projects recurrent
costs and the TS after the project is completed. Recurrent expenditures for
education will increase from 8.9 to a maximum of 11.6 percent of estimated
total public spending during the period 1991-97 (Table 1, Annex 5). This in-
crease, to which the government is committed, does not result in unrealistic
requirements for financial resources.
2.54      The Government has issued a policy statement for the education
sector specifying: (a) the medium-term goals regarding equity, efficiency,
and quality of primary education; (b) the overall sector financing plan for
primary, secondary and tertiary levels of the education system; (c) the
responsibilities at various levels of Government and the private sector; and
(d) that the Government will allocate requisite financial resources to sustain
future education expenditures. The policy statement also includes: (a) a
quantification in line with the projections of the SAR, of the rate of the
annual increase in education expenditures required to achieve and sustain its
quality improvement program in a decentralized system; and (b) a statement of
intent to increase education expenditures accordingly, as long as there is no
marked deterioration in the macroeconomic or public finance situation. The
policy statement, which is available in the project files, will provide the
basis for the annual budget review (para. 4.09).
D. Bank Role and Strategv
2.55 Bank involvement in education in Chile began in 1965 with projects
supporting vocational training and primary education. The first two education
projects (Ln. 431-CH for US$2.7 million, and Ln. 666-CH for US$1.5 million in
1965 and 1970, respectively) were aimed at expanding the training capacity of
the National Institute for Vocational Training. The projects were success-
fully implemented and assisted in making this Institute an outstanding
training institution. The third project (Ln. 668-CH for US$7.0 million in
1970) supported the MINEDUC to expand and improve primary teacher training
colleges and agriculture secondary schools. This project was prematurely
implemented given that the country's policy basis was in its very formative
stages at that time. Furthermore, project implementation coincided with a
9/   Comparison between approved budgets in current pesos.

period of political turmoil in Chile with the result that many project
objectives were never achieved. Besides these three education projects, the
Bank has assisted the Chilean Government during the last two decades in the
following sectors: power (four projects), transportation (seven projects),
water and sewage (three projects), agriculture (four projects), industry and
mining (four projects), housing (two projects), and sectoral adjustment and
technical assistance (five projects). All of these projects assisted the
Chilean Government to attain macroeconomic stability, adopt a market economy,
liberalize trade, and promote private sector participation as the main engine
of economic growth. Some of these involved important components directed at
the social sector. Structural Adjustment Loan III aimed, for example, among
other objectives, at: (a) increasing the efficiency of the collection of
social security contributions; (b) strengthening the preventive health care
programs; (c) improving cost containment, management, and accounting of the
public health system; (d) rehabilitating public hospitals; and (e) developing
manuals on organization of maintenance systems and a computerized inventory
model for the health sector.
2.56      Chile's education sector is at a crucial development juncture.
Having now expanded the primary education system to attain virtual universal
coverage, the challenge ahead is to ensure equity in access to high quality
primary education while concurrently enhancing the internal efficiency of the
system. This will necessitate major changes in existing educational policies
and approaches, financing mechanisms, and administration and management.
Expansion of preschool opportunities for disadvantaged children is an
essential corollary to improve primary education performance. In addition,
the design of secondary education programs must be carefully reassessed and
modified, as necessary, to ensure that the vast majority of graduates for whom
this is the last stage of formal education can respond to rapidly evolving
labor market demands within a dynamic, modernizing economy. Bank involvement
in the education sector at this juncture can play an invaluable role, beyond
provision of investment financing ver se, in assisting the Government to
formulate appropriate policies, institute equitable financing schemes, and
design cost-effective educational programs which can contribute importantly to
attainment of Chile's overall development objectives. The proposed project,
the first in the Chilean educational sector since 1970Od to be financed by
the Bank, comprises an integral part of the Bank's overall country assist=nce
strategy to maintain and consolidate economic reforms, secure sustainable
economic growth and social development, and accelerate poverty alleviation.
The major focus of this will be on instituting cost-effective measures to
increase educational opportunities for low-income urban and rural children, a
problem which has been identified as a central concern in the Bank's recent
social sector work. Bank involvement assures continuation and consolidation
of economic and social reforms undertaken by the Chilean Government in the
past, and preservation of the decentralization of social services. This
project would complement sectoral financial resources already obtained through
the enactment of tax reforms. The Bank would provide valuable technical
iO/  IDB is preparing a project aimed at providing vocational training for
unemployed youth. The proposed IDB loan amounts to US$57.4 million.
Additionally, in the pipeline for FY92, IDB has another loan in the
amount of US$92.4 million to assist the Chilean Government in improving
higher education in science and technology.



- 19 -
assistance to transfer successful educational experiences from other
countries. It would also open dialogue about future Bank involvement in
secondary education, where complex curricular and financing issues await
policy attention.
2.57      The above policy is to be accomplished by instituting cost-effective
measures necessary to increase the efficiency of the public sector and
appropriate targeting and delivery of social programs to the poor. In the
education sector, the strategy is to help improve the educational opportuni-
ties available to children from low-income areas so they can participate more
actively and successfully in a rapidly evolving economy. Consistent with this
country and sector strategy, the Bank involvement in education investment aims
to support targeting public resources to the most vulnerable population groups
by: (a) extending the coverage and enhancing the quality of preschool educa-
tion; (b) enhancing the efficiency, quality, and equity of primary education;
(c) assessing the adequacy and responsiveness of secondaz-y education; and
(d) improving the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, the
regional and provincial educational departments, the municipalities, as well
as the managerial and pedagogical supervisory skills of municipal and private-
subsidized preschool and primary school principals. Sustaining the ongoing
decentralization process is an essential corollary to increase the efficiency,
quality, and equity of primary education.
2.58      Finally, the Bank involvement will help ensure greater sustainabi-
lity of programs, which are likely to become expensive as they expand if
economies of scale are not attained. The Bank will also help ensure the
program's cost-effectiveness and act as counterweight to excessive political
pressures for expansion beyond what can be justified.
2.59      Lessons Learned.  The most important lessons learned"' from
previous Bank experience in the primary education subsector are as follows:
(a) Interruptions or delays in provision of counterpart funds causes
implementation problems. If counterpart funds are not provided, or
are reduced, this has serious implications for the scope of the
project. Furthermore, project sustainability has been hampered by
inadequate allocation of resources and poor maintenance practices.
(b) The details of the project objectives and components need to be
clearly defined at the time of Board Approval to ensure that the
Borrower and the Bank are in agreement about the project definition
and scope, which should preclude implementation delays due to mis-
understanding or disagreement about project specifications.

Asia and Africa; (ii) the recommendations of "Lending in Primary
Education" EDT #20, "Textbooks in the Developing World": EDI Seminar
Series and "Lending for Learning: Twenty Years of World Bank support for

Operations and Evaluation Department Annual Reviews from 1984 to 1988;
and (iv) "A World Bank Policy Paper: Primary Education."

(c) Before innovative reforms can be widely adopted, adequate pilot
testing is required to ensure that: (i) the new experience is in
harmony with the environment in which it is taking place; and
(ii) the best possible use is made of available resources. Also,
the overall success of education refoxrus depends on how well they
are implemented at the school level, thus the need to strengthen the
capacity of teaching and administrativ'e staff in both rural and
urban areas to carry out innovations.
(d) Primary education projects are inherently complex, since they
typically have several components, such as simultaneous construction
at several remote sites, introduction of innovations, and procure-
ment and delivery of educational materials in dispersed areas. This
requires an effective project management, monitoring, and supervi-
sion network. In addition, projects must be designed with flexibi-
lity so that they can easily adapt to changes in the country
situation.
(e) Direct purchasing is the best option for the procurement of
textbooks. Nevertheless, problems abound, including poor coordina-
tion of activities, poor quality of textbooks, distribution
failures, and inadequate teacher training in the use of improved
texts. Strategies to avoid these pitfalls focus on proper project
design, field testing of purchased books, close monitoring of the
distribution system, and a linkage between the teacher-training
program and textbook production %nd dissemmination.
(f)  Effective community participation has been instrumental in winning
popular support for educational (and other) reforms and in reducing
maintenance costs to the Government. However, community participa-
tion has been more effective in countries where such a tradition
already exists.
(g) Teacher training continues to be an important element of primary
education projects, but upgrading and continuity have been
neglected. Programs must include multigrade teacher training
programs and continuous training and upgrading.
2.60      These lessons have been incorporated into the design of the proposed
project.  Specifically, to ensure counternart funds, the Chilean Government
has already mobilized substantial additional resources for the education
sector through tax reform and national budget redistribution (para. 2.53). In
addition, provisions have been made to provide sufficient funds to meet
maintenance costs of school facilities. Furthermore, an agreement has been
reached with the Government for the Bank to comment the education budget
annually with the objective of ensuring that adequate resources are provided
to sustain the quality improvement program and for effective decentralization
(para 4.09). As for 2roiect scope, the Government's full involvement in
project design and preparation is a noteworthy aspect of the project.
Detailed operational manuals, procedures, and guidelines have been prepared
for the main project components and sub-components. With respect to the malor
innovation in this project, PRODEPE's pedagogical, technical, operational, and
managerial procedures are based on the already established "900 Deprived
Primary Schools Program" and the "Programa Nacional de Fomento al Desarrollo
de Innovaciones Educativas" (para. 2.52). To address the complexity issue,
classroom expaneion designs have been kept very simple, and the PIU will be
staffed by a small number of highly qualified and experienced personnel. The
PIU manager will report directly to



- 21 -
the Minister or Undersecretary level, and will be assisted in policy and
monitoring activities by a project executive council composed of senior
officials of the key MINEDUC departments involved in the implementation of the
project. Also, special arrangements for project supervision have been made
with the UNESCO regional office and local consultants. With respect to the
textbook component, textbooks will be produced and distributed by private
publishing houses in accordance with precise curricular and pedagogical
specifications in terms of reference prepared by MINEDUC. Enhancing current
comunity and garent particivation is another key element of this project. It
will be strengthened through offering specially designed workshops coupled
with a mass media campaign. PRODEPE will provide resources for quality
improvement projecto in selected municipal and private-subsidized schools. To
ensure proper implementation of this program, sDecial training courses for
both teachers and supervisors will be conducted to provide them with the
required skills.
III. THE PROJECT
3.01      The proposed Primary Education Improvement Project (Proyecto de
Mejoramiento de la Calidad y Equidad de la Educacion-MECE) responds to
educational sector development needs as identified in the Bank's recent social
sector work. The work concluded that: (a) improving educational
opportunities of children from low-income families is a high priority; (b)
extension of coverage and enhancement of the quality of preschool education is
crucial to any effort to improve the efficiency and outcome of primary
education; (c) improvements of the quality and equity of primary education
will contribute to reduce repetition and dropout rates and promote equitable
access, retention, and promotion rates, thus increasing internal primary
school efficiency by targeting appropriate interventions to low-income urban
and rural schools; and (d) revision of education subsidies could reduce
discrimination against small typically rural schools and subside pervasive
financial education deficits in municipal budgets.
A. Prolect Oblectives
3.02      The project's key objective is to assist the Government in enhancing
the efficiency, quality, and equity of primary education in selected schools
in rural and urban areas. To this end it will additionally: (a) expand
coverage and enhance the quality of preschool education to increase primary
school preparedness and reduce late entry, repetition, and dropout rates,
especially targeted to 5-year-old children living in poverty conditions; (b)
strengthen the institutional capacity of the MINEDUC, central, regional and
provincial offices, as well as that of the education departments of the
municipalities, and the managerial skills of municipal and private-subsidized
preschool and primary school administrators; and (c) assess alternative cost-
effective approaches to meet the secondary education needs of primary gradu-
ates.
B. Proiect Description
Enhancing the Efficiency. Ouality, and Eouitv of Primary Education
(US$180.7 million)
3.03      Efficiency, quality, and equity of primary education will be
enhanced by: (a) implementing 5,000 locally based quality improvement
projects of a pedagogical decentralization program (Programa de
Descentralizaci6n Pedag6gica--PRODEPE) through the participation of teachers



- 22 -
and principals of 5,000 selected municipal and private-subsidized primary
schools; (b) strengthening the educational testing system to assess and
monitor annually student performance for about 240,000 students from either
fourth or eighth grades every year; (c) providing inservice training for about
78,000 teachers, 8,000 subsidized primary school principals, and 625 supervi-
sors; (d) distributing, on a targeted cost-recovery scheme, about 24.5 million
primary textbooks for all the municipal and private subsidized primary
students, about 870,000 sets of complementary reading and teaching materials
for all primary subsidized schools, and teaching equipment for primary
schools; (e) hiring 500 new teachers to provide eight grades in 500 incomplete
rural primary schools; (f) constructing 500 classrooms in the rural areas; (g)
upgrading, and refurbishing classrooms in about 2,500, mostly rural primary
schools; (h) establishing an experimental education communication computer
network in 66 (mostly rural) primary schools; (i) providing health screening
and referral to the primary care system, as needed, to 250,000 first graders
every year; and (j) establishing monetary incentives for inservice teacher
training and teaching in deprived, mostly rural primary schools in the
framework of the new TS.
3.04      Pedagozical Decentralization Program (PRODEPE).  Like many
developing countries, before 1980 the tradition in Chile was a very central-
ized, top-down primary education style. The MINEDUC developed policies and
standards, oversaw all aspects of school aeministration, and provided all
financing from the center. In such an environment, local decision making was
limited, and local initiative was clearly not facilitated. The 1980 reform
presented a sharp break on this tradition. By moving operational control to
the municipalities and encouraging participation of the private sector, the
Government hoped to encourage greater local participation in primary education
development. With PRODEPE, the Government proposes a bold further step to
foster local initiative focused to solve key problems in quality improvement.
This program will be built from ground up, providing grant funding to locally
designed programs addressing the specific problems related to quality weak-
nesses at the school level. PRODEPE will: (a) enhance local curriculum in
reading, writing, mathematics, and science education through the participation
of teachers and school principals; and (b) establish and implement school
specific quality improvement projects in 5,000 municipal and private subsi-
dized primary schools.12 The PRODEPE will finance the implementation and
sustoinability of multi-year school quality improvement projects through the
participation of the PECs, and the municipal and provincial education authori-
12/ School quality improvement projects could consist, for example of:
(a) developing teaching and learning materials for primary school
students; (b) reinforcing teaching and learning of Spanish, mathematics,
natural and social sciences; (c) establishing new pedagogical models; (d)
creating school orchards and gardens; (e) implementing pedagogical and
supervisory teachers' workshops; (f) carrying out study programs
comprising visits to public and private institutions, attendance to
concerts and conferences, and other activities acceptable to the Bank for
primary school students and teachers; (g) organizing handicraft
activities among students; (h) implementing activities organized by
groups of parents and teachers and other associations; (i) organizing
periodic school exhibitions and fairs; (j) restructuring school
curricula; and (k) promoting school cultural activities.

ties. Resources for such projects will be made available on a competitive
basis assessed on the relative quantitative and qualitative merits of specific
proposals developed at the local level. Resources will go to selected and
targeted municipal and private subsidized schools that meet stated criteria
and present their innovative educational improvement projects in a timely
fashion. Details of PRODEPE implementation arrangements are in Annex 8.
3.05      Identifying those schools eligible for funding has been a focus of
project development. Six weighted criteria, explained in Annex 8, are used to
classify the municipal and private-subsidized primary schools into high,
medium,and low risk. During the project, PRODEPE will be targeted to 5,000
subsidized schools, comprising 62 percent of all municipal and private-
subsidized primary schools. Out of this universe, 2,300 schools will be high-
risk (100 percent of the total high-risk schools), 2,300 medium-risk (57 per-
cent of the total medium-risk schools), and 400 low risk (25 percent of the
total low-risk schools). This distribution clearly demonstrates an equity
focus of the project. The desirability to enrich PRODEPE with quality
improvement projects arising from good primary subsidized schools suggests the
inclusion of a small but relevant number of low-risk schools. The targeting
criteria to select participating schools will: (a) ensure poverty alleviation
impact by favoring high-risk, mostly poor, urban and rural subsidized primary
schools; and (b) insulate PRODEPE from political interference. The applica-
tion of suitable manuals approved during the appraisal, and procedures to rank
school quality improvement projects on their merit, will ensure enhancement of
the quality of education. Official approval by MINEDUC of PRODEPE's Opera-
tional Manual containing the implementation procedures, selection criteria and
the required proportion of school ranking was submitted to the Bank prior to
negotiations. It will be fo .ally adopted by MINEDUC as a condition of loan
effectiveness, and will be followed during project implementation. During
negotiations, agreements were reached that changes to the PRODEPE Manual that
materially and adversely affect the project would be considered an event of
default. Finally, the participation of teachers and school principals in the
design of quality improvement projects, of supervisors in their ranking, and
the municipal and provincial authorities, as well as the provincial education
Councils in their selection, will strengthen the decentralization process.
3.06      It is estimated that during the first year of the project (1992),
PRODEPE will finance up to 400 quality improvement projects (8 percent of the
targeted group of schools). For the following two years, PRODEPE will
increment the number of projects to be financed by 350. For the last three
years of the project, PRODEPE will finance an average of 1,000 projects per
year, reaching a total of 5,000 targeted subsidized schools during the project
life (see Annex 8). The gradual implementation of PRODEPE will allow for a
close and constant monitoring and supervision, and thus an orderly expansion
program. Criteria to set upper and lower bounds of the funds made available
to competing quality improvement projects, as well as the disbursement
characteristics including the school's counterpart resources, are explained in
Annex 8. Selected schools will be entitled to receive the improvement grant
only once during the project's lifespan.
3.07      After their preparation, school quality improvement projects
competing for financing must be endorsed by the school's principal. After
approval at the school level, projects will be presented to the provincial
education authorities (with PEC and municipal participation) for selection and
approval through the respective supervisory subsystem. Manuals to rank the



- 24 -
competing projects based on their quantitative and qualitative merits to
improve efficiency and quality of education will be tested and implemented
under the National Program to Foster Educational Innovations--currently being
implemented as a pilot program in about targeted 150 schools by the CPEIP
(paras. 2.52 and 3.08). The content of the agreement to be signed by MINEDUC
with the municipalities and private-subsidized school proprietors concerning
PRODEPE was discussed during the appraisal; the model contract to be signed
with each Municipality or private-subsidized school proprietors with terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank would be made a condition for loan
effectiveness. Agreements were reached during negotiations that an agreement
will be signed between MINEDUC and each municipality and private-subsidized
school proprietors where a project will be carried out, before approving the
respective project, substantially in the form of the model contract
satisfactory to the Bank. Under such agreements, the responsibilities and
obligation of the municipalities and schools are detailed in Annex 11, para.
8. All the key technical personnel involved in ranking, selecting, and
approving the quality improvement projects will be suitably trained. During
the entire life of the project: (a) 625 primary school supervisors will be
trained to rank quality improvement projects and assist teachers to partici-
pate in the pedagogical decentralization process; (b) 40 provincial two-person
technical teams will be annually retrained to upgrade their quality improve-
ment project selection, approval, and monitoring skills; (c) 8,000 primary
subsidized school principals and 8,000 teachers will be trained to upgrade
their quality improvement designing skills; and (d) 334 municipal and 490
private primary subsidized school proprietors will regularly be informed on
the progress of this program. MINEDUC will establish an information system to
register all competing quality improvement projects and to monitor the
implementation of the selected projects, and will implement an evaluation
study on PRODEPE's process and impact.
3.08      While an important innovation to Government policy, PRODEPE bases
its pedagogical, technical, financial, operational, and managerial procedures
on established Chilean experiences, such as the "900 Deprived Primary Schools
Program," implemented in 1990, and CPEIP's recently enacted "Programa Nacional
de Fomento al Desarrollo de Innovaciones Educativas", a pilot program targeted
to about 150 primary schools.
3.09      Pedagogical Supervision.  The project will finance the strengthening
of supervisory capacity at the primary schools and at MINEDUC's provincial
level respectively by: (a) providing technical-pedagogical training skills to
about 8,000 municipal and private subsidized primary school principals; and
(b) increaeing the number of primary education supervisors from the current
375 to 625, and providing them with training, supervisory Operational Manuals,
materials, and resources. During the project's life, CPEIP will coordinate
the design and implementation of 400 technical-pedagogical training skill
courses for school principals and 70 courses for primary education supervi-
sors, that will be provided by CPEIP and 34 higher learning institutions and
universities. During 1992 and 1993, approximately 55 training courses will be
offered annually, increasing to about 100 at the peak of the project in 1997.
3.10      In the future, supervisors will focus on technical-pedagogical
issues, leaving the administrative functions to the educational inspectors
assigned to the provincial offices of the MINEDUC. There will be one supervi-
sor for every 15 urban schools and one for every 13 rural schools. High-risk
schools will receive one pedagogical supervision visit per month. Prior to



- 25 -
negotiations, the Bank received the final version of the supervisory manual
which will be adopted by MINEDUC as a condition for loan effectiveness and
followed during project execution. During negotiations, agreements were
reached that changes to the Supervision Manual that materially and adversely
affect the project would be considered an event of default.
3.11      Academic Achievement Assessment.  SIMCE, the Achievement Assessment
System, will be strengthened to ensure that: (a) all tests used to measure
student learning achievement meet stringent psychometric standards of
reliability and validity; (b) information gathering activities are carried out
in a timely and efficient manner; (c) results reporting will be easily
interpretable and will facilitate improving instructional practice at the
school level and policy decisions concerning the efficient use of school
resources; and (d) results analysis will be dove by competent research
specialist to provide feedback to school authorities on educational and social
significance of the assessment findings.
3.12      During the project's life, SIMCE will be expanded to also measure
the academic achievement in small, mostly rural, incomplete and/or multigrade
primary school.s with six or less fourth and eighth graders, comprising a
universe of 34,000 students. A secondary school achievement evaluation system
(SIMCE-Media) targeted for 130,00C secondary sophomores (para. 3.54) will be
gradually implemented. The project will finance the required hardware,
peripheral equipment, personnel, training, technical assistance, license,
inservice training and studies required in the assessment system.
3.13      The Chilean educational authorities have transferred SIMCE's
technological capacity, including the intellectual leadership, from the UC to
the MINEDUC. This decision has been taken on the ground of MINEDUC's desire
to build its own assessment capacity, to reduce costs by using the same
equipment of the EIS in primary and secondary schools' achievement evaluation,
and timely availability of the scores information. The SIMCE group will be
directly accountable to the Minister and the Undersecretary on staff
organizational and institutional capacity. SIMCE will continue being imple-
mented on a fourth and eig:^th grader census basis, mainly because it is an
effective feedback information device to induce school teachers and principals
to participate in the quality improvement program. Continuous training will
be provided to SIMCE's technical and support staff. SIMCE results are
expected to be periodically disseminated among MINEDUC and municipal
educational authorities, school principals and teachers, interested NGOs,
research centers, and parents.
3.14      Inservice Teacher Training and Upgradinz.  The inservice teacher
training will be coordinated by PIU and CPEIP, and implemented through CPEIP'S
central and regional offices, as well as with the participation of 34 other
higher learning institutions and universities throughout the country. The
project will finance the following activities:  (a) reinforcing CPEIP to
design and produce inservice teaching materials; (b) producing video, audio,
and printed teaching materials for distance inservice activities; (c) estab-
lishing 330 communal inservice teaching training workshop networks to
strengthen the distance inservice teaching training program; (d) providing
distance inservice training to 63,000 primary teachers; and (e) training for
14,600 regular teachers, out of whom 8,400 teachers will be trained in early
detection of learning disabilities to facilitate timely referral of students



- 26 -
in need uf differentiated education, and 6,200 (mostly) teachers from
multigrade and/or incomplete rural schools will be trained in quality
improvement project formulation to induce their participation in PRODEPE.
3.15      The distance inservice teaching training aims to help teachers to
design quality improvement projects, for use in their daily professional
practice. The program is intended for approximately 6,300 teachers per year
duri-lg the first two years of the project's life, increasing the number of
participants to almost 19,000 by the last two years. Periodic monitoring and
supervision of this program will be provided by 16,000, previously trained
school. principals and teachers in 8,000 short-term workshops held during the
entire life of the project, comprising 8 to 10 teachers per workshop.13'  The
training of teachers for detection of learning disabilities and timely
referral of these students will be provided in 210, one week, in-class courses
during the entire life of the project.
3.16      Textbooks and Other Education Inputs.  Educational 'nputs such as
textbooks, reading materials, teaching guides, and educatioral technology will
be targeted mainly to deprived urban and rural schools. The MINEDUC will
gradually update the textbooks of mathematics, Spanish, history, geography and
natural sciences, procuring them from private publishers. The books corres-
ponding to the first, second, fifth and sixth grades of primary education will
be updated during 1992, while the ones corresponding to the other grades will
be reformulated during 1993. Textbooks intended for rural areas will be
supplemented with additional relevant teaching materials. A total of about
24.5 million books (approximately 2 million for the rural areas) will be
produced and distributed by the contracted publishing houses during the
lifespan of the project. Textbook updating will be executed according to the
MINEDUC's precise curricular and pedagogical terms of reference. A teaching
guide for each subject will be published and distributed to every primary
school teacher. First to fourth grade textbooks, used simultaneously for
teaching and student written exercises, will have a one-year lifespan during
the entire project, whereas fifth to eighth grade textbooks will have a two-
year lifespan. The new textbooks will provide the national curriculum
required by law; regional and local teaching materials would be incorporated
into the curricula by interested schools through PRODEPE. Experience gained
in the pilot bilingual and rural program of the University of La Frontera,
Temuco, will be transferred to design and produce rural complementary teaching
materials for ethnic students. Private publishers bidding for textbooks will,
in coordination with CPEIP. provide the necessary teacher training in the use
of these materials.
3.17       A targeted cost-recovery policy directed to subsidized primary
schools located in above medium-income areas will be implemented. About
20,000 primary students from high income subsidized schools, and 380,000 from
medium- to high-income subsidized primary schools will be required to purchase
the textbooks at subsidized prices. This cost-recovery policy will generate
about US$250,000 per year. During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances
that the Government will enact this policy, which will be a condition to

1996, each province will provide an average of four short-term workshops
per month.



- 27 -
commence disbursements of the primary textbook subcomponent. The average
textbook unit cost is US$0.92; without the small editions of especially
designed rural textbooks, the average unit cost decreases to about US$0.80. A
research study will be completed to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of the
one- and two-year use of textbooks.
3.18      The in class reading resource center program (Rincones de Lectura)
is designed to induce reading habits among first and second graders, their
teachers and parents. This program will supply 80 books (sets of 35 books for
every first-grade classroom, and 45 for every second grade classroom) of each
subsidized primary school, during the lifespan of the project. The process to
select the appropriate subject matter incorporated in the reading resource
centers to be procured from private publishers will be derived from the
ongoing experience of the "900 Deprived Primary Schools Program." Starting in
1993, the third and fourth grade classrooms of all subsidized primary schools
will receive sets of 60 books each. This project will finance in aggregate
24,500 sets of books.
3.19      The project will also finance the annual production of 23,000
textbooks to develop basic (written, oral, arithmetic, senso-
perceptive, and psychcmotor) functions of primary students with learning
disabilities, and 800,000 sets of specially designed Spanish and mathematics
learning materials for first to fourth graders in all subsidized primary
schools.
3.20      Supplementing PRODEPE, the project will finance the procurement of
about 5,OCO televisions and videocassettes, 30,000 videotapes, 10,000 tape
recorders, 100,000 audio cassettes, and 5,000 basic copying machines, which
will be made available to quality improvement projects requiring some of the
above education inputs. Concurrently, a teacher training program on how to
use this equipment will be provided by CPEIP. The production of video and
audio educational materials will be contracted with different public and
private academic and research centers, including CPEIP. The education
technological equipment will be procured in packages accordingly to the
demands registered in the revision of competing quality improvement projects.
3.21      The project will finance the enhancement of the teaching and
learning process in 3,700 high-risk, mostly rural (multigrade and/or
incomplete) primary schools by: (a) providing one encyclopedia per school;
and (b) furnishing one teaching manual and three teaching guides (one for
math, Spanish and science) for each of the 6,200 teachers assigned to these
schools. Furthermore, pedagogical innovations, based on the ongoing pilot
bilingual and rural program of the University of La Frontera, Temuco, intended
for incomplete and/or multigrade schools, will be tested beforehand in five to
ten selected rural schools throughout the country (to be labeled "Testing
Ground Schools") prior to general implementation.
3.22      Hiring Teachers and Constructing Classrooms for Subsidized
Incomplete Primary Schools. To allow poor, mostly rural sixth graders to
complete their primary eighth-grade cycle, the project will finance, on a
declining basis, the hiring of 500 new teachers to an equal number of
subsidized primary high-risk schools. The 500 primary high-risk incomplete
schools with less than sixth graders, out of a universe of 3,814 incomplete
schools, will be selected. Newly appointed teachers will share the teaching



- 28 -
load among all school enrollers, so as to seek a more uniform teaching
distribution and reduce the per pupil teacher ratio. Finally, 500 classrooms
will be constructed among the selected schools.
3.23      Remodelling of Primary Schools.  The project will finance the
remodelli.ng of about 2,500, mostly deprived urban and rural primary schools,
with the participation of the school community and the municipalities. School
remodeling projects will be selected on the basis of their cost-effectiveness,
degree of local participation, and municipal commitment for sustaining
maintenance. The technical, financial disbursement, managerial, and
logistical learning experience achieved in school remodelling in the "900
Deprived Primary Schools Program" will be transferred to this project. The
content of the agreement to be reached by MINEDUC with the Municipalities for
remodelling primary schools was provided during the appraisal; the model
contract to be signed with each municipality with terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank will be made condition for loan effectiveness.
Agreements were reached during negotiations that an agreement will be signed
between MINEDUC and each municipality where a school's remodelling be carried
out before disbursing any funds to such municipality, substantially in the
form of the model contract satisfactory to the Bank. Under such agreement,
the responsibilities and obligations of the municipalities are in Annex 11,
para. 9.
3.24      Computer Network.  An experimental educational computer network to
promote the participation of teachers and students in designing relevant
regional teaching materials in the four primary education subject areas
(Spanish, mathematics, science, and social studies) will be launched in 66
(mostly rural) primary schools in 22 communities in three adjacent regions of
the country.  This program is based on the followjing six criteria:
(a) computers will be used as means and never as pedagogical ends; (b) the
computer network will be geared to reinforce the extracurricular activities of
participating schools; (c) the network activities' design will be linked to
the local and regional realities of the users; (d) an interdisciplinary
approach, linking different subject areas, will be sought; (e) individual
capability and creativity will be fostered; and (f) computer-aided prepackaged
educational software will not be allowed in the network.14 The project will
finance local consultants, hardware, software development, and training.
3.25      As a complement to the above experimental project, an evaluation
study on the impact of computers in the Chilean primary education system has
been included in the project. Terms of reference for such study to be
implemented by the CPEIP have been set. The results of both this diagnosis
and the experimental computer network will guide future sectoral policies on
this complex issue. The project will finance local consultants trained in the
use of computers in education and evaluation.
3.26      Health Care Assistance.  A yearly screening, referral, and limited
assistance health care program for 250,000 first-grade primary students of all
municipal and private-subsidized schools will be implemented with the partici-
pation of the local health authorities. This program aims to perform yearly
14/ Commercial communication software will be procured from private
suppliers.



- 29 -
diagnosis of first-grade primary school students concerning: nutritional
status; auditory and visual acuity; genital, spinal, foot and dermatological
problems; and parasitosis.s' Students in need of medical assistance will be
referred to the proper health authorities. A finished school health manual
has been implemented. The project will finance: (a) the printing manuals for
12,000 primary school teachers in charge of health programs; (b) 40 yearly
inservice training courses for teachers serving as facilitators of this
program; (c) 44 staffyears to supervise this program; and (d) the screening
services provided for a fee by the municipal health authorities and private
clinics.
3.27      Professional TS.  A TS has been approved by the Chilean Congress
(Law 19070, dated July 1, 1991) including the requisite financial resources
required for its implementation. This TS seeks to improve teachers
productivity by: (a) raising the minimum professional salary of a primary
school teacher to 57,000 pesos (US$165 equivalent) per month for 44 weekly
chronological hours (33 weekly lecturing hours and 11 cocurricular hours); (b)
regulating the out-of-class pedagogical activities that teachers are paid for
and expected to perform; (c) inducing inservice teacher training from which
teachers will be promoted on a selective, quality-control merit basis; and (d)
motivating skilled and experienced teachers to serve in deprived urban and
rural schools. On the cost side, the TS is expected to have the additional
costs detailed in para. 2.53 and in Table 1, Annex 5. The project will
finance on a declining basis the following aspects of the TS: (a) the
inservice teacher training costs for about 78,000 municipal and private subsi-
dized preschool and primary school teachers and principals participating in
the project; and (b) incentives for teaching in about 3,700 deprived urban and
rural primary schools. During negotiations, an agreement was reached that
changes to the TS Law (Law 19070 dated July 1, 1991) that materially and
adversely affect the project would be considered an event of default.
3.28      The TS implementation runs the risk of granting automatic salary
increases for inservice teacher training based on attendance instead of
selective and quality assessment criteria upon completion of course. This
situation is compounded by the salary increases granted by the TS based on
seniority. To minimize these risks, luring negotiations, Government provided
assurances that will put in place no later than June 30, 1992 a system whereby
the entire teaching force will be encouraged to participate in periodic
upgrading inservice teaching training during the life of the project. For
loan effectiveness, the Bank would require copies of Government Bylaws
regulating inservice teacher training certification based on selectivit- and
quality control merits be enacted.
3.29      Concurrently with the TS, the Executive Branch of the Chilean
Government has submitted to Congress an initiative to amend the SL. This
initiative aims to: (a) introduce equity into the system by increasing the
subsidy for adult education, differentiated education, and by raising the
resources made available to small, mostly, rural schools with a total
enrollment of less than 100 students; and (b) modify the monthly average
15/ The Chilean municipal health authorities and private clinics will
provide, for a fee per student, the screening for parasitosis, nutrition-
al status, dermatological problems, and visual acuity.

attendance subsidy formula to a longer period, to reduce present significant
monthly changes in revenues to school, contributing to large education
deficits in many municipal budgets. During negotiations, the Bank obtained
assurances that annual budgets allocate each year of project implementation
the specific minimum amounts required to finance the SL as follows: $2.0
million equivalent for 1992; $2.7 million equivalent for 1993; $3.2 million
equivalent for 1994; $3.4 million equivalent for 1995; and thereafter. The
first yearly (1992) allocation is to be provided as a condition of
effectiveness.
3.30      Complementary to the TS and the modifications to the SL, the Chilean
education authorities have increased the schoolyear from 36 to 37 weeks,
effective last March, when the 1991 schoolyear began. This increase will
undoubtedly contribute to achieving the project's objectives as more time on
task is spent by teachers with their students.
Expanding the Coverage and Enhancing the Quality of Preschool Education
Targeted to Poor Children (US$39.3 million)
3.31      The principal objectives of the preschool education component would
be to assist the Government in increasing the achievement levels of deprived
children to first grade expanding access to preschool education of poor
children. The project also would increase the quality of targeted existing
preschool services, thus contributing to: (a) raising the readiness levels
required for performing in first grade at expected "standard" levels;
(b) reducing late entry and facilitate the timely graduation from primary
education of deprived students; (c) reducing functional illiteracy by raising
performance in primary education; and (d) helping working women by taking care
of their young children.
3.32      The project will finance preschool expansion for about 16,000 urban
and 30,000 rural, mostly 5-year-old poor children, by: (a) hiring teachers,
paraprofessionals, and supervisors; (b) creating new facilities and school
additions; and (c) expanding existing services. The project. would also
finance the enhancement of targeted ongoing preschool serv'oes. Finally, the
project will finance an evaluation process to study the cost-effec_iveness of
each urban and rural preschool alternative and its impact on the future
academic achievement, behavior, and skills of the children.
3.33      The urban and rural preschool models to be implemented would be
cost-effective, replicable, and sustainable. Preschool poverty alleviation
impact will be attained by: (a) targeting the urban expansion in poor areas
whose primary students have scored low in SIMCE, show late primary entrance,
high repetition and dropout rates, as well as, below average primary comple-
tion rates; and (b) primarily increasing the preschool supply in rural areas.
3.34      Preschool Expansion.  The project will finance the expansion of
preschool education for about 16,000 urban 5-year-old children by: (a) hiring
140 preschool municipal teachers; (b) constructing 100 municipal classrooms
providing about 4,500 spaces; (c) hiring and training 490 paraprofessionals
for the INTEGRA and JUNJI options and using 7,000 spaces of unused capacity in
centers currently operated by INTEGRA as well as 4,000 unused spaces of the
ongoing JUNJI program; (d) developing and distributing 11,300 sets of teaching
materials; and (e) implementing a school feeding program to provide 16,000
daily rations to deprived preschoolers. The school feeding program is



- 31 -
administered by the National School Assistance and Scholarship Board (Junta
Nationale de Auxilio Escolar y Becas--JUNAEB), which procures the distribu-
tion, storage, and preparation, with eligible competing bidders from the
private sector.
3.35      Preschool education in rural areas for about 30,000 new children
under 6 years old would be provided through two models. Both alternatives
will provide: (a) about 29,000 sets of teaching materials; and (b) continuous
inservice teaching training for supervisors, school principals, teachers, and
paraprofessionals. In addition, the first program involves the active parti-
cipation of parents in program implementation, training of about 23,400
parents in 3,000 local workshops, which would be organized and implemented by
about 43 existing and 8 newly hired preschool supervisors and 615 trained
paraprofessionals. This alternative will not provide food supplements to the
participants. The second program, to be implemented by INTEGRA, comprises:
(a) hiring 15 supervisors and 150 paraprofessionals; (b) refurbishing 75 small
rural centers donated by the respective communities, each one holding about 25
children under 6 years old each, and being operated by two paraprofessionals;
and (c) providing 2,000 daily food rations.
3.36      Construction of about 100 new municipal preschool classrooms would
be targeted to low-income urban or urban-rural communities with: (a) more
than 30,000 inhabitants and a population of 5-year-olds of 300 or more lacking
preschool education; and (b) primary schools that have scored low on SIMCE and
have late entrance, repetition, and dropout rates above the national average.
Classroom construction will be awarded to private local contractors on a
shopping or direct contracting basis, as detailed in para. 5.06. Munici-
palities will be held accountable for awarding the contracts and supervising
the execution of the construction projects, as well as for the systematic and
periodic maintenance of the school premises. The classroom will operate, when
possible, in double shifts serving approximately 32 children per shift.
INTEGRA will be accountable for procuring the services to adapt 75 local
facilities donated by the respective rural communities to implement the small
rural centers program. The plans and estimated costs of both the municipal
and INTEGRA models are incorporated in the project working papers. The draft
agreement to be reached by MINEDUC with the Municipalities for construction
preschools construction was provided during the appraisal. The model
contract, with terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, will be made
condition for loan effectiveness. Agreement was reached during negotiations
that an agreement will be signed between MINEDUC and each municipality where
didactic material be provided; additional teachers be financed; school feeding
program be expanded; and a classroom construction be carried out before
disbursing any funds to such municipality, substantially in the form of the
model contract satisfactory to the Bank. Under such agreement, the responsi-
bilities and obligations of the municipalities are in Annex 11, para. 10.
3.37      Enhancing Preschool Quality.  The project will finance the enhance-
ment of existing preschool quality services provided by the municipalities,
JUNJI, INTEGRA, and the private subsidized proprietors, especially in poor
urban and rural areas by: (a) reinforcing preschool supervision and teaching;
(b) designing, producing, and distributing teaching materials; (c) inducing
parent participation in the early stimulation of their children; and (d)
implementing an evaluation study to measure: (i) cost-effectiveness of the
alternatives used by the project; and (ii) the medium-term impact on
children's academic achievement, behavior, and skills.



- 32 -
3.38      The project will finance, under a declining basis for recurrent
costs, the strengthening of the preschool supervision and teaching by:
(a) hiring 50 new supervisors (7 for MINEDUC's urban program and 43 for
JUNJI); (b) hiring 163 preschool teachers and 164 paraprofessionals; and
(c) implementing suitable technical-pedagogical supervisory inservice training
courses for about 200 supervisors, 3,300 school principals and teachers, and
2,700 paraprofessionals of all agencies involved. The technical-pedagogical
ad-hoc committee (comprised of the MINEDUC, JUNJI, INTEGRA, and the CPEIP) are
in the process of formulating the appropriate inservice training courses
content, which will be executed by CPEIP and/or various higher learning
institutions and universities.
3.39      The project will finance, under a targeted cost-recovery policy,
the production and distribution of 102,000 sets of preschool didactic
materials especially designed for the different operating urban and rural
modalities. All subsidized preschools located in above-medium-income urban
areas will be required to purchase these teaching materials at subsidized
prices. Preliminary figures estimate that the cost-recovery policy will
generate about US$200,000 during the project lifespan. The teaching materials
will be designed to foster gross and fine coordination skills among preschool
students, as well as psychomotor and social skills. Complementary training
and teaching materials will be designed to induce parent participation in pre-
school activities in the rural areas. A technical-pedagogical committee
comprised by the MINEDUC, JUNJI, INTEGRA, and CPEIP will provide the terms of
reference of the teaching materials, whose production and distribution will be
procured from the private sector. An agreement was reached during
negotiations that regulations concerning the cost-recovery policy will be put
I         into effect prior to commencing disbursements of the preschool teaching
material subcomponent.
3.40      The project will finance parent involvement in the early stimula-
tlon and education of their children by: (a) implementing a rural, tested
prcschool model that calls for the participation of approximately 23,400,
previously trained (in 3,000 specially designed workshops) parents in the
delivery of preschool education; and (b) instituting a mass media campaign on
early childhood stimulation directed to parents and consisting of 100 short
radio and TV messages, 20 spots, 24 miniseries, and assorted printed material.
3.41      Evaluation Studiec.  The project will also finance:  (a) an
evaluation study of preschool education impact on children's further academic
achievement, behavior, and skills; and (b) a cost-effectiveness study
comparAng the three urban and two rural preschool models. The evaluation will
attempt to appraise and compare the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness
of each preschool alternative financed under this project. In the medium
term, a random sample of children of each preschool modality will be monitored
and followed throughout their further education, to attempt to assess
cognitive achievement, psychomotor and social skills development. A control
group of children with no preschool education will also be selected,
monitored, and followed. The results of the cost-effectiveness studies will
guide future government preschool expansion policies. The terms of reference
of such studies were approved during appraisal.

3.42      The content of the agreements to be signed by MINEDUC with the
municipalities, INTEGRA and JUNJI to provide didactic material; to hire
additional teachers, supervisors and paraprofessionals; to expand the school
feeding program; to construct additional classrooms; and to refurbish and
equip small rural centers was discussed during the appraisal mission. Tho
model contract to be signed with each municipality with terms and conditionis
satisfactory to the Bank would be made a condition for loan effectiveness.
Agreement was reached during negotiations that agreements will be signed
between MINEDUC, each municipality, INTEGRA and JUNJI, where the activities
described above will be carried out, before commencing implementation of the
respective part, substantially in the form of the model contract satisfactory
to the Bank. Responsibilities and obligations of the municipalities, TNTEGRA
and JUNJI under such agreements are in Annex 11, para. 11.
Strengthening the Institutional. Financial, and Managerial Capacitv of
MINEDUC, the Provinces, and the Municipalities (US$16.5 million)
3.43      The institutional capacity of the MINEDUC, its regional and
provincial educational departments, and the municipalities will be
strengthened by providing: (a) the MINEDUC with timely and relevant
information and procedures to translate effectively educational policies and
strategies into concrete programmatic actions, target resources to high-risk
schools through the municipalities, and periodically monitor sector achieve-
ments; (b) municipalities with procedures, guidelines, and training to execute
effectively educational programs derived from sector policies, and administer
efficiently the resources of their assigned municipal schools; and (c) school
administrators with managerial and technical-pedagogical supervision skills.
The ongoing decentralization process will be further supported by: (a)
enhancing the managerial and technical skills of appropriate staff of MINEDUC,
the regional and provincial education departments, as well as the municipali-
ties through training programs oriented to induce a more efficient and effec-
tive deployment and targeting of available resources; and (b) establishing an
EIS.
3.44      Strengthening the MINEDUC and the Municipal Managerial Capacities.
The project will finance the development of procedures and operational
manuals, appropriate skill training courses, relevant techniques for in-depth
analysis of the EIS, and supply of equipment (computers, printers and
peripheral equipment, facsimiles, vehicles) especially tailored for the
different levels of decision-making that conform to the Chilean education
system.
3.45      At the MINEDUC central and regional levels (SEREMIS) the project
aims to strengthen the: (a) sectoral planning, programming, budgeting,
resource disbursement, monitoring, and evaluation processes; (b) purchasing
systems; and (c) administration of personnel. At MINEDUC's provincial level,
the project seeks to strengthen the: (a) role of the provincial authorities
in PRODEPE; (b) preschool and primary pedagogical supervision systems; and
(c) administrative inspection bodies to monitor the correct application of the
SL. Prior to negotiations, the Bank received the final version of the
administrative inspection manual, to be applied by the MINEDUC Provincial
Secretariat inspectors, which will be formally adopted as a condition for loan
effectiveness. During negotiations, an agreement was reached that changes to
the Inspection Manual that materially and adversely affect the project would
be considered an event of default.

3.46      Within the Municipal Education Departments (280) and Municipal
Corporaciones (54) the project attempts to strengthen: (a) municipal
participation in PRODEPE; (b) educational micro-planning procedures for
efficient deployment and targeting of available resources; (c) personnel
Administration; (d) formulation of school construc-tion, equipping, and
refurbishing projects; and (e) financing, accounting, and auditing. One of
the immediate expected byproducts of this participatory process is to deploy
better available resources, thus increasing the efficiency and effectiveness
of the education system, and gradually reducing the overstaffing situation
that may exist in selected municipal primary schools.
3.47      At the school level the project aims to reinforce:  (a) municipal
and private subsidized proprietors awareness to MECE's objectives and periodic
improvements; and (b) the education management skills of municipal and
private-subsidized preschool and primary school principals.
3.48      Training Programs and Manuals.  To reinforce MINEDUC's central,
regional, and provincial administration as well as municipal managerial skills
and procedures the project will finance: (a) training for about 500 middle
management staff to improve their planning, programming, budgeting, and
monitoring capacities; (b) management training for 334 municipal educational
authorities (280 municipal departments of education, and 54 municipal
Corporaciones); (c) providing management skill training for about 1,200
preschool and primary school administrators; and (d) developing practical
manuals for planning, programming, administration, budgeting and monitoring
decentralized education activities. The execution of the courses will be
procured through local (higher learning institutions, universities, and the
private sector) and external technical assistance (consultants).
3.49        Educational Information System (EIS).  An EIS will be established,
linking the following ongoing information subsystems: (a) SIMCE; (b) educa-
tional statistics; (c) programming and budgeting statistics; (d) budget
disbursements; and (e) MINEDUC's administration and accounting. During the
life of the project, the EIS will be expected to include: (a) a quality
improvement project implementation monitoring information subsystem; (b) an
educational research inventory subsystem (SINIE); (c) an education physical
plant inventory subsystem; and (d) a MECE monitoring and impact evaluation
information subsystem. The project will finance the design of the EIS, the
development and purchasing of appropriate software and hardware, the
administrative support systems, the information and dissemination process, and
the required local and external technical assistance. The EIS will require 2
mainframes at MINEDUC's central level and 197 microcomputers (18 at MINEDUC
central, 45 in the Seremis, 121 at the provincial offices, and 13 at the
CPEIP).
3.50        In addition to the preschool evaluation study (para. 3.41), the
project would also finance process and impact evaluation of the following
subcomponents: (a) PRODEPE; (b) pedagogical supervision; (c) inservice
teacher training; (d) textbooks and reading materials; (e) specific inter-
ventions aimed at rural and bilingual education; (f) communication computer
network; (g) TS and the modification of the monthly average student attendance
in the subsidy formula; (h) EIS; (i) MINEDUC and the municipal maaagerial
capacities; and (j) other basic education innovations implemented by NGOs.
Assessing Alternative Cost-Effective Strategies to Meet the Needs of Primary
Education Graduates (US$2.6 million)



- 35 -
3.51        This component proposes to gather information, including policy-
oriented research, focusing on the status of secondary education, its costs
and effectiveness. Studies will explore possible alternatives that Chile
might pursue to meet the needs of a rapidly growing number of primary school
graduates, many of whom seek access to secondary school. In connection with
this information-gathering effort, the project would include an information
and communications campaign with the aim of raising public consciousness
regarding subsector issues, listening to the views of concerned parties, and
generating consensus on policies and actions that need to be taken. An
additional aim of this component will be to provide the basis for strategic
decisions on policy for secondary education as well as for preparation of a
possible second education loan to improve coverage, efficiency, quality and
equity of the subsector.
3.52        The component includes information-gathering, public consultation
activities and studies regarding: (a) the present curriculum, the process of
curriculum development, teacher training and evaluation; (b) the internal
functioning of secondary schools; and (c) economic factors affecting secondary
education and its several streams and modalities. The terms of reference of
such studies have been prepared and reviewed by the Bank, and have been
incorporated in the project's working documents. The studies will be carried
out by selected higher learning institutions, universities, and research
centers. The administration of the studies will be carried out by the CPEIP.
Technical local and external assistance would be requested if deemed necessary
to supervise particular studies.
3.53        Curriculum Development, Teacher Training and Evaluation.  The
project will finance the following studies relating to the present curriculum
and the process of curriculum development and evaluation: (a) analysis of
current practices in curriculum development; (b) development of a proposal for
curriculum change; (c) exploration of possible interactions between schools
and their surrounding communities and pr4vate enterprises in decentralized
curriculum development and adaptation; (d) preservice teacher training; and
(e) assessment of the skills and abilities that students will need to function
effectively in Chile's modern society and labor market.
3.54        Internal Functioning of Secondary Schools.  The project will
finance the following studies relating to the internal functioning of
secondary schools: (a) work practices within the secondary subsector;
(b) development of valid prototypes for an improved system of supervision for
secondary education; (c) development of an achievement assessment system
(SIMCE-Media, para. 3.12) to be applied to 130,000 sophomores; and
(d) development of an adequate system to aid students in planning their own
education and careers.
3.55        Studies of Economic Factors.  The project will finance the follow-
Ing studies of economic factors affecting secondary education and its several
streams and modalities: (a) an evaluation of secondary education finance and
management; (b) a detailed analysis of costs by type and stream; (c) a study
of the external efficiency and economic returns to secondary education, with



- 36 -
special emphacis on the technical-vocational stream; and (d) costing of the
instructional needs of a revised prototype of secondary education, including
simulations of future expenditures and financing.
3.56        Information and Communication Campaign.  The project will finance
an information and a communication campaign to be carried out at the same time
these studies are in progress. Information from the studies will form a part
of the content of the campaign, while feedback from interested stake-holders
will influence the orientation and emphasis of the studies. Since the purpose
of the campaign is to raise public consciousness, generate constructive debate
and form the basis for secondary education policies, the findings of the
studies will enter directly into the deliberations regarding national policy
and strategy and help provide accurate information to guide the debate.
IV. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Cost of the Prolect
4.01        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$243.0 million
based on estimated prices of May 1991. The total foreign exchange cost is
estimated at US$34.2 million, or 14 percent of the total cost. Table 4.1
summarizes the estimated project costs by component and main intervention
categories. Detailed project costs are shown in Annex 9.
Contingency Allowance
4.02      Physical contingencies amount to 10 percent of base costs for civil
works, and 5 percent of base costs for goods and equipment for all components.
No physical contingencies are considered for consultant services. Price
contingencies for foreign costs are based on a projected international
inflation rate of 5 percent for 1991, 1.8 percent for 1992, 1.9 percent for
1993, 3.9 percent for 1994, 4.9 percent for 1995, 4.2 percent for 1996, and
3.6 percent for 1997. Local cost price contingencies are based on a local
projected inflation of 18.8 percent for 1991, 17.2 percent for 1992,
19.7 percent for 1993, 21.7 percent for 1994, 21.1 percent for 1995,
20.5 percent for 1996, and 19.8 percent for 1997.
Duties and Taxes
4.03      Locally procured goods are subject to a value-added tax (VAT) of 18
percent. Imported goods such as computers and other office technology
equipment are subject to 14 percent of customs tax and 18 percent of VAT. The
estimated base cost of the project includes local taxes, which amount to
approximately US$14.0 million.
B. Financing Plan
4.04      The proposed project would be financed by a Bank loan of
US$170.0 million or 74 percent of total project cost net of duties and taxes.
It would cover 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures and 65 percent of
the estimated local costs. The government of Chile would finance the
remaining US$73.0 million including duties and taxes. Table 4.2 gives the
project financing plan, with a breakdown by project categories.

C. Education Sector Budxet for FY91 and Beyond
4.05        Due to increases in public revenues resulting from the recent
reform of the tax law, government will have the fiscal capability to sustain
the project. The first effects of the tax law were felt at the end of FY90,
how-ever, the first full year in which the law will be in effect is 1991.
From 1991 onward the Ministry of Hacienda has provided for a 12 percent
increase in social spending and, within the social sectors, the increase
allowed in education and health is 15 percent, reflecting the priority
accorded these sectors.
4.06        The Budget Law for 1991 provides 255.6 billion pesos for the
Ministry of Education (US$740.5 million). An additional allocation of 10.2
billion pesos (US$29.6 million) appears as a public treasury budget item to
cover the expected costs of implementing the TS during 1991, bringing the
total to 265.7 billion pesos (US$770.1 million). The substantial increase of
27 percent between the authorized budgets for FY90 and FY91 (32 percent with
the TS budget included) reflects the impact of the tax law and not a long-term
trend. The government recognizes that sector recurrent spending can only grow
in proportion with overall growth of public revenues and spending, and that
spending within the sector has to be carefully targeted to accomplish its
quality and equity objectives within budgetary constraints. The proposed
project, with its emphasis on improving quality, targeting spending on schools
serving low-income communities, and enhancing sector efficiency is fully



- 39 -
consistent with sectoral spending targets and will take place within a context
of public spending levels and policy that are far less restrictive than in
other countries in the region and are favorable to social sector spending,
especially for education and health.
D. Recurrent Costs Arising from the Project
4.07        The project is dominated by noninfrastructure expenditures for
teacher training; textbooks; educational materials and supplies; techn-J.eal
assistance and training; school feeding and health services; policy analyses;
evaluation, monitoring, and supervision. Some of the costs resulting from the
project will be continued after project completion and will become part of the
sector's ongoing recurrent costs. Indications that the project is being
sustained after completion will include continuing expenditures for inservice
teacher training, pedagogical supervision and monitoring, continued supply of
textbooks and teaching materials and supplies, achievement testing, school
feeding and health screening targeted to children of poor families, and
continued maintenance and physical improvement of facilities serving children
in poor communities. The proposed Bank loan would finance recurrent costa of
the project on a declining basis, from approximately 50 percent in the first
year of implementation (1992) to zero percent in the last year (1997). The
bulk of the recurrent cost to be financed by the Government will occur in
1996, representing US$16.9 million, which is less than one percent of the
sector budget. The increase in annual recurrent expenditures that will
continue after the project is completed, including the part of the TS directly
linked to the proposed project, has been estimated at US$22.1 million (7,625
billion pesos) (Table 4.3 below and Annex 5, Table 1). This will represent
1.8 percent of the estimated sector expenditure in the first year after the
project is completed (1998).
E. Prolect Sustainabilitv
4.08        The effect of the proposed project on total sector costs anid the
ability of the government to sustain the expenditures that will result from
full project implementation are questions of central importance. It is
necessary to clarify the relationship between increases in expenditures that
will result from implementing the project and those resulting from :Ithe govlern-
ment's other policies and investments to improve quality and equity, notably
the TS and the associated modifications in the SL. Annex 5, Table 1 shows
actual and projected recurrent spending for education, including the effect of
the TS and the SL, plus recurrent costs that will result from the project for
the period 1990 through 2004. From the viewpoint of sustainability, it is
important to bear in mind not only the recurrent cost implications of the
project but also other Government policies that will further entail recurrent
costs. Government has made a political commitment to the TS and changes in
the SL and has already provided funds in the 1991 budget for their implementa-
tion. Annex 5, Table 2 shows estimates of these costs, which will increase to
38.7 billion pesos in 1995. This amounts to 11.6 percent of the estiuimted
sector budget in that year.

during the years 1991 through 1997 will be approximately 60 percent (Annex 5,
Table 1) or 8.2 percent per year, including increases that would take place
due to system growth, the TS and the SL, and the effects of implementing the
project. This substantial increase in sector spending will be necessary to
sustain quality improvements and targeted programs for schools with difficul-
ties, and to maintain decentralization on a sound and realistic financial
basis. While this is a rapid increase, it is not unreasonable for a sector to
which government has given a high priority. It implies that education's share
of public spending (which is projected to grow at 4.5 percent per year) would
increase from 9 percent of estimated total public expenditures in 1991 to a
high of 11.6 percent in 1995, after which it would diminish slightly to less
than 11 percent. This share of public spending would be below the average for
lower middle income countries, comparable to Chile, and would not be high in
comparison with the 1988 average for all of Latin America (11 percent). The
Government is fully aware of the need to limit budgetary expansion in the
education sector and that the sector budget must remain within the parameters
established at the macro level. It has considered the projected increases
with care and is confident that they are sustainable. In view of the impor-
tance of the budget issue, it was agreed during negotiations that the Govern-
ment and the Bank will review the education budget annually with the objective
of insuring that: (a) adequate resources are provided to sustain the quality
improvement program and for effective decentralization; and (b) proposed
sector spending levels are consistent with the macroeconomic framework.
F. Project Economic Benefits
4.10        Although the principal benefits that will result from the proposed
project are improvements in the quality of basic education in Chile, it is
possible to calculate certain benefits that can be measured in money terms.
There are two categories of benefits that can be readily and appropriately
estimated: (a) cost savings resulting from reductions in the numbers of
children repeating grades and, thus, in the average number of years to
complete the eight grades of primary school; and (b) economic benefits that
will accrue to students completing basic education who otherwise would have
dropped out of school. With regard to cost savings, the project's quality-
improvement components will result in greater efficiency in use of costly
inputs because students who are learning effectively will have less tendency
to repeat grades or drop out of school. Present repetition rates are over
12.0 percent when adjusted for dropouts who subsequently reenroll in other



- 41 -
schools (see Annex 6, Tables 2 and 3). It requires 12.4 student-years on the
average for each child who completes the eight-year basic education cycle
(Annex 6, Table 5). This is a high rate of inefficiency for an education
system as well-established as Chile's; but the national average figures cited
do not fully reflect the even worse situation that exists in many schools
serving rural and low-income communities (Annex 6, Tables 2 and 3). As these
data indicate that over 200,000 student places are occupied by repeaters,
there is ample margin for improvement in internal efficiency. Given that
Chile's net primary education enrollment ratio is already very close to
100 percent, the number of children entering grade one will remain approxi-
mately the same. Total enrollment, once the project's quality-enhancement
components begin to have their effect, will thus be lower than it would have
been if repetition rates remained the same. The value of these cost savings
(adjusted to real value in 1996) would be 46.8 billion pesos, or approximately
US$135.7 million (Annex 5, Table 3).
4.11        The second category of benefits arises because fewer students will
fall behind and drop out and greater numbers of students will complete all
eight years of basic education. The ec-enomic benefits of primary education
have been well established. Considering only the economic benefits accruing
to the increased number of students completing eight years of basic education,
these are estimated to be 21.7 billion pesos (again adjusted to value as of
1996), or approximately US$62.9 million (Annex 5, Table 3).
4.12        These two categories of benefits that can be quantified and
expressed in money terms--savings in public costs of education and added
earnings of basic education graduates--constitute only a part of the benefits
of the project. These monetary benefits alone amount to a significant
US$200.0 million: more than ths amount of the loan and over 80.0 percent of
total project costs.
V. IMPLEMENTATION. PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENT, AUDITING.
MONITORING AND SUPERVISION
A. Status of Preparation
5.01        Project preparation, was financed by the Government and the Bank's
Project Preparation Facility. Each project component and subcomponent
discussed with the Bank is consistent with sector policies, objectives, and
strategies, as indicated in Annex 7. Since the project preparation coordina-
tor reports directly and or an ongoing basis to the Minister and Under-
secretary of Education, the project enjoys substantial support and commitment.
The counterpart funds for 1991 in the amount of US$4.3 million have been
included in the Government's FY91 budget (Iaw No. 19.012 of December 10,
1990).
B. Implementation Schedule
5.02        The project is expected to be implemented over a 6-year period,
from January 1992 to December 1997. Project activities started after apprais-
al (June 1991), at which time, retroactive financing was considered in order
to start the gradual implementation of PRODEP., teacher training, and key
project's studies. The implementation schedule is shown in Annex 10.



- 42 -
C. Prolect ManaAement
5.03        Implementation Structure.  The MINEDUC would be responsible for
overall implementation of the project. To assist in the oversight of project
implementation, the MINEDUC will establish a Project Implementation Unit
(PIU), reporting to the Minister or Under Secretary level. The PIU comprises
a matrix-type managerial organization with four programmatic units and three
service units as shown in the organizational chart of Annex 11. The program-
matic uinits will be in charge of coordinating and monitoring the implementa-
tion of their respective project components, whereas the service units will be
respolisible for a wide range of activities including: (a) the planning,
programming, monitoring and evaluating activities of the project as a whole;
(b) procurement, civil works, technical assistance, and personnel; and
(c) budgeting, financing, disbursement, accounting, and auditing. The heads
of the seven units will report directly to the PIU's manager, who de facto
operates as the MECE's general project coordinator. The PIU would be respon-
sible for coordination with the Bank and other Ministries, agencies, institu-
tions, and NGOs involved in project implementation. The project manager would
be assisted in policy and monitoring activities by a project Executive Council
(EC) comprised of the Minister of Education or his/her representative, the
Under Secretary of Education, the Directors of MINEDUC'S Division of Planning
and Budgeting and the Division of Education, and the Director of the CPEIP.
The PIU will also comprise a small number of experienced senior managers who
will use the Ministry's existing infrastructure to implement operational
activities. The PIU's manager would be assisted by a legal advisor. The EC
would meet regularly to review project implementation, address policy,
strategy, and organizational problems that could affect project execution, and
review project monitoring indicators. The Minister of Education and the Under
secretary would be assisted by an Advisory Council constituted by highly
respected personalities representing the education, cultural, and private
sectors, as well as political groups. The Council would meet twice a year to
provide guidance based on how society perceives the effects of MECE. During
project Jmplementation, the PIU will employ about 12 senior level profession-
als, 3 technical staff, 6 support staff. Annex 11 describes in more detail
the functions and responsibilities of each PIU's unit. The project will be
executed by different entities. Operational agreements will be signed by
MINEDUC with all autonomous entities (paras. 3.07, 3.23, 3.36, and 3.42).
Given the project complexity and the large number of entities involved in
project implementation, at appraisal the Bank discussed specific arrangement
with local consultants and specialist from UNESCO and UNICEF regional offices
to supervise the project. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the
Government will employ a project manager with qualifications and under terms
of employment satisfactory to the Bank. MINEDUC's decree establishing the PIU
would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
D. Procurement
5.04        Table 5.1 summarizes procurement under the Bank Loan.
5.05        Civil Works.  The bulk of civil works comprises adaptation of
rural facilities donated by the communities into small rural preschool
centers, refurbishing of existing deprived primary schools, and construction
of small urban preschool and primary classroom extensions. Procurement of
these works would follow Bank guideliaes and standard bidding documents would
be used. The draft of these bidding documents were reviewed during appraisal
and submitted to LACVP procurement advisor for final approval.

local salaries (including monetary incentives for teachers upgrading and
lecturing in deprived urban and rural primary schools), US$63.0 mi.llion;
evaluation and supervision, US$2.8 million; and operating costs, US$8.0
million.
(a) Small preschool and primary classroom extensions works are expected
to cost, at most, US$10,000 each, and corresponding contracts would be
awarded on the basis of price quotation obtained from at least three
eligible contractors up to an aggregate amount of US$4.8 million. In
the few cases where various civil works could be grouped together in
packages costing more than US$50,000, these would be awarded on the
basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures satisfactory to the
Bank. Such packages are not expected to exceed US$100,000 and US$3.2
million in total.
(b) The rehabilitation of classrooms to be executed by the Municipali-
ties, as well as the rural preschool adaptation to be executed by
INTEGRA, are expected to cost no more than US$8,000 per school. It
includes: school furniture repairs; painting; lighting repairs; kitchen
and toilet installations (for the rural preschool centers only); water
and sewage installations; and replacement of windows, doors, floors, and
roofs. Neither international competitive bidding (ICB) or LCB would be



- 44 -
suitable given the nature of these works. Therefore, adaptation and
rehabilitation contracts not exceeding US$8,000 and US$31 4 million in
aggregate would be awarded either on the basis of three price quotations
up to an aggregate amount of US$18.8 million, or when price quotations
cannot be obtained, through direct contracting up to an aggregate amount
of US$12.6 million.
5.06        Goods and Materials.  The bulk of goods and materials comprises
computer and peripheral equipment, school furniture, teaching materials and
equipment, and textbooks. ICB and LCB procurement will be done in accordance
with Bank guidelines and using standard bidding documents to be agreed with
the Bank. The draft documents have been submitted to the LACVP procurement
advisor for final approval.
(a) Contracts for the procurement of computers and peripheral equip-
ment, school furniture, and materials and equipment, will be awarded
following ICB (including 15 percent preference for local bidders) in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines (May 1985) when valued above
US$250,000 each. For contracts valued between US$20,000 and US$250,000,
procurement would be carried out following LCB procedures satisfactory
to the Bank up to an aggregate amount of US$2.2 million equivalent. For
contracts valued below US$20,000 equivalent, shopping procedures,
satisfactory to the Bank, would be followed up to an aggregate amount of
US$2.0 million equivalent. Computer and peripheral equipment will be
procured following a two-step ICB procurement procedure in agreement
with Bank guidelines.
(b) Textbooks will be awarded on the basis of two-step ICB procedures,
in accordance with Bank guidelines for all contracts valued above
US$250,000 each. Contracts valued below US$250,000 would be awarded on
the basis of LCB procedures in accordance with procurement procedures
acceptable to the Bank, and up to a maximum aggregate limit of
US$21.3 million equivalent.
(c) Educational materials and manuals will be awarded on the basis of
ICB procedures in accordance with Bank's guidelines for all contracts
valued above US$250,000 each. Contracts valued below US$250,000 would
be awarded on the basis of LCB in accordance with Government procurement
procedures acceptable to the Bank, and up to a maximum aggregate limit
of US$2.1 million equivalent.
(d) School feeding contracts totalling US$15.3 million are not expected
to exceed the equivalent of US$250,000 per contract and would be awarded
through LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts valued at
below US$20,000 would be awarded on the basis of price quotations
obtained from three eligible suppliers up to an aggregate amount of
US$5.5 million equivalent. When price quotations cannot be obtained,
direct contracting procedures would be used for purchases not exceeding
US$5,000 per school, and US$1.2 million equivalent in aggregate.
5.07        PRODEPE.  The maximum cost of any project to be financed through
PRODEPE would not exceed US$8,000, the average amount being about US$6,000.
Such projects may include goods (paper, pencils, ink, materials) and services
(transportation, consultants fees). Procedures to rank and select projects
are stated in paras. 3.04 through 3.08 and Annex 8. Given its nature, these
contracts with a total value of US$38.4 million will be awarded on the basis



- 45 -
of price quotations obtained from at least three eligible suppliers, and when
price quotations cannot be obtained through direct contracting up to an
aggregate amount of US$15.5 million equivalent.
5.08        Technical Assistance.  Consultants carrying out studies and
technical assistance will be hired following Bank guidelines (August 1981).
Contracts for small consulting assignments valued at US$20,000 or less, would
be formalized on the basis of standard terms of reference and employment
conditions and would not require prior review by the Bank.
5.09        Items not Involving Procurement.  The project includes the
financing of inservice training, health services, local salaries (including
monetary incentives for teachers upgrading and lecturing in deprived urban and
rural primary schools), evaluation and supervision and operational expendi-
tures for up to an aggregate amount of US$90.2 million.
5.10        Prior Review.  Prior review by the Bank would be required for all
procurement documentation for ICB contracts and for the first three LCB
contracts for goods and civil works, respectively, valued above US$50,000
every year of the project. Furthermore, all documentation for the hiring of
consultants for contracts valued above US$20,000 would also be subject to
prior review by the Bank. All other contracts would be reviewed in the field
during Bank supervision missions. The Bank would also sample on a periodic
basis the procurement practices followed in the implementation of the quality
improvement projects financed by the PRODEPE.
E. Account and Disbursements
5.11        The proceeds of the proposed loan are expected to be disbursed in
accordance with the schedule shown in Annex 12, over a period of six and a
half years, which is longer than the Bank's average country profile for Chile
(5.5 years), but shorter than the profile for Latin America (7 years). The
disbursement period was determined after taking into account the advanced
status of the project designs, MINEDUC's execution capacity, and the yearly
budget availability approved by the Ministry of Finance. Annex 12 also
illustrates in greater detail the flow of funds that will be channelled to the
different entities included in the project. The allocation of loan amount avd
the disbursement percentages are summarized in Table 5.2. Disbursement would
be made against certified Statements of Expenditures, except for contracts,
valued at above US$200,000 and contracts requiring prior review.
5.12        Based on the experience of the "900 Deprived Primary Schools
Program" and the "Programa Nacional de Fomento al Desarrollo de Innovaciones
Educativas" (para. 3.08), the MINEDUC will set up, in conjunction with the
Chilean financial authorities, suitable mechanisms to facilitate disbursement
of: (a) resources allocated to quality improvement projects in the framework
of PRODEPE; (b) resources intended for preschool and primary classroom
construction; (c) resources assigned for rural preschool and primary school
refurbishing; and (d) resources to procure goods and services during project
implementation. Confirmation of adoption of agreements with the Municipali-
ties and legal entities different from MINEDUC for the transfer of resources,
with terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to implement such
agreements, will be a condition for loan effectiveness.



- 46 -
5.13        To reduce the interval between payments made by the beneficiaries
and receipt of reimbursements from the Bank, a Special Account would be estab-
lished in the Central Bank of Chile. The Special Account would be denominated
in US dollars and would be established with an initial deposit of US$8.0
million, the average four-month requirement. Project expenditures would be
monitored by the PIU. The PIU would request replenishment of the Special
Account on the basis of standard disbursement procedures.

5.14        The Bank would finance up to US$6 millions (approximately 4
percent of the proposed loan) retroactively for expenditures incurred after
June 15, 1991 and in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. Retroactive
financing is required so that the Government may begin the gradual implementa-
tion of the pedagogical decentralization program, textooks, teacher training,
and key project's studies as soon as possible, and to facilitate the timely
start up of the project.
F. Audits
5.15        The Bank would require that an independent auditor acceptable to
the Bank: (a) audit all accounts, SOEs, and Special Accounts; (b) apply
auditing standards and procedures satisfactory to the Bank and conforming to
generally accepted auditing practices; (c) carry out its auditing work in a
timely manner (an annual report would be presented no later than six months
after the end of each calendar year); and (d) render an audit opinion or the
reasons whereby such opinion cannot be rendered. Given the geographical
dispersion of PRODEPE, the Bank required that basic elements of conventional
financial management, accounting and auditing should be included specifically
for PRODEPE in the auditing procedures of the project.
G. Proiect Monitorinz, Evaluation and Sugervision
5.16        In line with the project objectives, key efficiency, quality, and
equity indicators (Annex 13, Table 1) will be monitored to track and support
improvements in the overall efficiency and effectiveness of preschool and
primary education. In order to support spot-checking along the project's life
in any of its subcomponents, a detailed project subcomponent matrix is
provided in Annex 13, Tables 2 through 6.
5.17        Overall monitoring and evaluation of the project would be the
responsibility of the PIU. Specific tasks include: (a) preparing annual
progress reports on project implementation, which would be submitted to the



- 48 -
Bank by December 30 of each year; (b) measuring quantitative and qualitative
objectives achieved against the monitoring indicators shown in the implementa-
tion matrix; (c) updating and reviewing annually project implementation
schedules and action plans; and (d) preparing a Project Completion Report that
would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the closing date
of the Loan. Beside regular Bank scheduled supervision missions, UNESCO and
U'NICEF specialists will supervise the project under specific arrangements
dixocussed durir.g the appraisal (para. 5.03). The project also supports
Vreinarclh oriented to evaluate the impact of this project, as well as other NGO
prvjects targeted to enhance the quality of primary education and to improve
the equity of the educational system (para. 3.50). Annex 13, Table 7
delineates the supervision plan, including the skill mix needed, frequency of
mnissions, project launch seminar, annual early-term and mid-term reviews,
regular Bank and specific supervision schedules to be provided by UNESCO's and
UNICEF's regional offices, as well as local and international consultants.
Supervision arrangements are expected to result in a requirement of about 17
staffweeks (SWs) per year.
5.18        Annual early-term and mid-term project reviews will be focussing
on: (i) TS and the result of the application of the new subsidy formula
implementation; (ii) PRODEPE's implementation process; (iii) preschool
expansion and quality improvements; (iv) implementation of the EIS;
(v) fulfillment of the loan covenants; (vi) impact of the implementation of
each component on the efficiency, equity, and quality of preschool and primary
education; (vii) impact on strengthening the decentralization process; and
(viii) the PIU's performance. Agreement was reached during negotiations that
such reviews will take place. The content of the annual early-term and mid-
term project reviews was agreed during negotiations.
VI. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Expected Benefits
6G01        The principal benefits of the proposed project will be in terms of
improvements in the efficiency and quality of education, mainly for the
children in the 5,000 schools most directly affected by the project, but also
in terms of residual benefits of better quality for all of Chile's basic
education facilities. Through better teaching and other inputs into the
education process, students will attain higher levels of cognitive achievement
and problem-solving abilities necessary to perform successfully in a rapidly-
charlging modern economy. These benefits of educational quality are difficult
to quarntify. There are, however, certain benefits for which we can calculate
aconomic values. As discussed in Chapter IV and Annex 5, these will include
coEt savings resulting from 1.wer repetition and dropouts and, therefore,
fewer years needed to complete the eight grades primary school (savings are
estiraated to be 46.8 billion pesos or US$135.7 million), and economic benefits
that will accrue to the roughly 10,000 additional students who will complete
basic education each year instead of dropping out. The incremental economic
benefits are estimated at 21.7 billion pesos (US$62.9 million). In both cases
these estimates of benefits have been discounted to 1996. Bearing in mind
th-at these are the only benefits that can be readily calculated in monetary
torii-. their total value of about US$200.0 million is substantial.

6.02        The targeting criteria of preschool expainsion and PRODEPE will
ensure a poverty alleviation impact by favoring in the first case low-ineormo,
poor chi:Ldren, and in the second, high-risk, mostly poor, urban and rural
subsidized primary schools.
6.03        The participation of teachers and school principals in the design
of quality improvement projects in the framework of the pedagogical decentra-
lization, of supervisors in their ranking, and the municipal and provIncial
authorities, as well as the provincial education Councils in their seleetion,
will strengthen the decentralization process.
6.04        One of the project's components will specifically provide informa-
tion and stimulate policy debate on the objectives, benefits, and costs of the
present system of secondary education and will consider alternative strategies
for modernizing this subsector and improving its quality in cost-effective
ways. From this body of studies, conferences with national and international
experts and analysis of policy alternatives there may emerge a proposal for a
project to improve secondary education.
6.05        Finally, the proposed project will include institutional streng-
thening measures that will allow: (a) MINEDUC to translate educational
policies and strategies into concrete programmatic actions, targeting
resources to deprived schools, and periodically monitoring sector achievements
and problems through improved sector programming, budgeting, information and
analysis capabilities at its central, regional, and provincial levels of
decision-making; (b) the municipalities to execute more effectively education-
al programs derived from sector policies education system, and administer more
efficiently the resources of their assigned municipal schools; and (c) school
principals and proprietors to implement adequately technical-pedagogical
supervision and school management. One short-term benefit expected from the
EIS implementation will be the timely detection of possible wastage in
resource allocation and a better deployment of teachers and other educational
resources.
B. Risks
6.06        The major risks to project implementation are:  (a) possible
distortions in targeting project interventions; and (b) recentralization of
education services. These risks will be reduced by: (a) implementing precise
targeting criteria to benefit deprived urban and rural schools; (b) adopting
suitable operational and procedural manuals and training for provincial and
municipal education authorities, school principals, and supervisors; (c)
carefully selecting and training key personnel participating in the Project
Implementation Unit, and in PRODEPE's disbursement and monitoring; (d)
promoting the participation of the municipalities and communities in project
implementation; and (e) close supervision by the Bank.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01        Prior to negotiations, the Government submitted the following
documents for Bank's review and agreement:
(a)   draft of the policy statement for the education sector specifying:
(i) medium-term goals regarding the equity, efficiency and qiltlity



- 50 -
of primary education; (ii) the overall sector financing plan for
primary, secondary and tertiary levels of the education system;
(iii) the responsibilities at various levels of Government and the
private sector; and (iv) that the Government will allocate
requisite financial resources to sustain future education sector
expenditures (para. 2.54); This policy statement has now been
finalised.
(b)   PRODEPE's Operational Manual officially approved by MINEDUC
(para. 3.05);
(c)   the final version of the Pedagogical Supervision Manual
(para. 3.10);
(d)   the final version of the Administrative Inspection Manual
(para. 3.45); and
(e)   the basic elements of conventional financial management accounting
and auditing to be included in the implementation of PRODEPE
(para. 5.15).
7.02        At negotiations, agreements were reached that:
(a)   changes to the:  PRODEPE Manual (para. 3.05), Supervision Manual
(para 3.10); TS Law (Law 19070 dated July 1, 1991) (para. 3.27),
and Inspector Manual (para. 3.45) that materially and adversely
affect the project would be considered an event of default;
(b)   the Government will put into effect a system no later than June
30, 1992 whereby the entire teaching force will be encouraged to
participate in periodic upgrading and inservice teaching training
during the life of the project (para. 3.28);
(c)   annual budgets allocate each year of project implementation
specific minimum amount required to increase subsidy to small,
mostly rural schools (para. 3.29);
(d)   the Government will furnish to the Bank for review the education
budget annually to ensure that adequate resources are provided to
sustain the quality improvement program and the strengthening of
the decentralization process, and that the proposed sector
spending levels are consistent with the macroeconomic framework
(para. 4.09);
(e)   the Government will employ a project manager with qualification
and under terms of employment satisfactory to the Bank (para.
5.03; and
(f)   an annual early-term and mid-term project reviews will be carried
out (para. 5.18).
7.03        For Loan Effectiveness, the Bank would require that:
(a)   the project manuals (PRODEPE, supervision and administrative
inspection) be adopted by MINEDUC (paras. 3.05, 3.10 and 3.45);



- 51 -
(b)   model contract(s) be signed either with the Municipalities or
private-subsidized school proprietors concerning PRODEPE resource
allocation to the municipalities, INTEGRA, and JUNJI relating to
didactic materials, additional personnel, school feeding program,
classroom construction, and preschool and primary school refur-
bishing and remodelling (paras. 3.07, 3.23, 3.36, and 3.42), with
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank;
(c)   Government Bylaws regulating inservice teacher training certif ica-
tion based on selectivity and quality control merits be enacted
(para. 3.28);
(d)   the specific amount be allocated by the Government in the 1992
bu6get to increase the subsidy to small, mostly rural schools
(para. 3.29); and
(e)   the PIU be formally established (para. 5.03).
7.04        To commence disbursements of the primary school textbook and
preschool teaching materials components, the Bank will require the adoption of
the cost-recovery policy for primary school textbooks and preschool teaching
materials (paras. 3.17 and 3.39).
Recommendations
7.05        Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed
project would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$170 million
for the Republic of Chile, repayable in 17 years including 4 years of grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.

ITS REGIONAL AND PROVINCIAL OFFICES, AND THE MUNICIPAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
1.     MINEDUC carries its legally mandated functions of policy setting,
supervision, evaluation, and finAncial monitoring through its central,
regional, and provincial departments, largely independent of the municipali-
ties, which are in charge of the daily operation of the public schools. To
perform these activities, MINEDUC is divided into one Subsecretariat with four
divisions (Primary and Secondary Education, Higher Education, Culture, and
Planning and Budgeting), two departments (Legal and Administrative Services),
and one center (Teacher Training and Educational Research-CPEIP). The MINEDUC
has 13 Regional offices (SEREMIS) located in each of the 13 geopciitical and
administrative regions of the country, which in turn are divided into 40
educational Provincial departments. In addition, there are three decentral-
ized institutions in the eeucation sector: Junta Nacional de Jardines de
Infantiles (JUNJI), providing preschool services; Junta Nacional de Auxilio
Escolar y Becas (JUNAEB), in charge of the school feeding and fellowship
programs; and the Comision Nacional de Investigaci6n Cientifica y Tecnologica
(CONICYT), fostering and guiding scientific and technological research under-
taken in different research centers across the country (chart 1).
2.     The Undersecretary of Education is in charge of the following func-
tions: (a) planning and programming activities and allocating resources to
municipalities and proprietary schools; (b) paying municipalities and private-
subsidized schools according to student-days of actual class attendance;
(c) checking the performance and supervising the decentralized operation of
schools; (d) improving the quality of the educational services delivered by
the system; (e) sponsoring cultural affairs; and (f) coordinating the MINEDUC
with universities and several public autonomous institutions.
3.     The 280 Municipal Education Departments (DEM) have the responsibility
to administer the Municipal schools including personnel and financial
administration. The 54 Municipal Corporations are private organizations lead
by a board of directors (regulated by the Bylaws of private organizations)
that are entrusted to manage private subsidized schools (chart 2).
4.     Preschool services are provided through three principal channels.  The
first comprises municipal, private subsidized and private-paid preschools,
whose coverage is targetted exclusively to 5 and 6 year olds. The second
major group includes publicly financed programs run by an autonomous agency of
the MINEDUC, the National Board of Kinderga:tens (Junta Nacional de Jardines
de Infantiles--JUNJI), under two modalitiea: JUNJI and Jardines Infantiles
Familiares, formerly CADEL. Both of these programs provide integrated health,
nutrition, and education services, and promote social and psychomotor develop-
ment through stimulation-oriented activities targetted to preschoolers 2- to
5-years of age who are from poor families. The third principal vehicle are
preschool programs run by a Government-assisted agency INTEGRA (formerly
FUNACO), and private, nonprofit entities and NGOs, including CARITAS.

5.     Preschool education employs 9,138 preschool teachers and almost 7,000
paraprofessionals (Table 9, Annex 3). Out of a total of 16,000 people
employed, 57 percent are qualified, trained teachers and 43 percent are
paraprofessionals working in the nonconventional models (JUNJI and INTEGRA),
and in need of further inservice training. The student teacher ratio of the
municipal (29) and private subsidized preschool (35) alternatives, conform to
the average reported by UNESCO/OREALC for Latin America and the Caribbean
(LAC) as a region; these ratios are much higher than in the corresponding
private-paid preschools (20). The nonconventional modalities of JUNJI and
INTEGRA rely extensively on paraprofessionals, with relatively low number of
preschool teachers working mostly as supervisors.
6.     Over 105,000 children, mostly poor, were offered during 1989 integrated
health, nutrition, and early stimulation in preschool programs. JUNAEB,
created in 1960, administers the school feeding and scholarship programs.
JUNAEB procures the distribution, preparation, and serving of meals to
children through eligible prospective bidders from the private sector. This
program is oriented to children under 6 years of age and provides up to 800
daily calories and 15 to 20 grams of protein.
7.     The total primary education school population is being taught by more
than 67,400 teachers, 70 percent of whom work in municipal schools,
23.0 percent in private-subsidized institutions, and 7 percent in paid-private
schools. Average pupils per teacher are: 26.1 in the municipal schools, 39.6
in the private subsidized schools, and 28.4 in the private paid. The national
average is 29.4. There are indications of overstaffing in the municipal
primary schools of Temuco (Region IX), Puerto Montt (Region X) and Cohyaique
(Region XI) where the average pupils-teacher ratio is under 25, below the
Chilean national average and slightly smaller than the average ratios reported
by UNESCO/OREALC for Latin America and the Caribbean as a region (27).
However, only the thorough analysiLt of the Education Information System (EIS)
at the municipal level (para. 3.49) can determine if the over- staffing
hypothesis is valid.
8.     During 1989, the MINEDUC distributed over 1.9 million new books free
and redistributed about 5.2 million more, reaching over 2.0 million students.
The books from first to third grade are renewed annually as they are used for
student exercises; the books from fourth to eighth grades remain at the school
for two or three school cycles. Texts are accompanied by teacher guides that
describe learning objectives, provide suggestions, and give answers to the
book's exercises. Until 1983, textbooks were only provided to primary school
students; since then, some secondary courses have also become eligible.
According to a recent survey, over 50 percent of the textbooks distributed
were received by the poorest 30 percent of the population. The unit cost of
newly acquired books in 1989 averaged about US$0.80. The Government has
agreed to implement a cost-recovery policy targetted on primary textbooks
(para. 3.17).

Annex 4: EDUCATION SECTOR BUDGET AND FINANCING
1.     Table I of this Annex shows the executed education budget for the 1980-
1990 period in relation to gross product and to the total federal budget.
While there have been fluctuations in both these relationships, the general
trend in education's share has been downward. With 2.5 percent of gross
product and 8.1 percent of public spending in 1990, Chile had one of the
lowest levels of public educaticnal spending in the region. Other important
changes in educational spending, have been: (a) the initiation and rapid
increase in transfers of resources from the central government to private and
municipal schools via per capita subsidies or subventions; and (b) the
reduction in the share of post-secondary education in total sector spending.
2.     Table 2 of this Annex shows the rapid growth of subventions as a share
of public spending on education. The table presents both the budget as
originally estimated and enacted into law and the actual, executed budget,
which has tended to be somewhat higher due to supplementary payments toward
the end of each year. Table 3 of this Annex shows the relative shares of each
subsector in total educational spending in constant pesos of 1990 for the
years since 1980. The decline in the share of post-secondary education, which
received 38 percent of public spending in the sector in 1980 but only 19
percent in 1990, derives from the reforms introduced by the Government during
1981 to decrease central financing in higher education and promote private
participation. The most important beneficiaries of this shift were primary
education and the preschool level, where the percentage increase was large but
the absolute amount relatively small.
3.     In Chile, the costs per student per year unit costs in constant pesos
do not differ greatly between levels of education. There is little difference
between the costs of preschool, primary or basic education, and the secondary
level, while even public spending per university student is only three to four
times the amount spent on primary school students. Annex 4, Table 4 shows
Preschool costs are actually higher than the costs for primary education, and
costs of general secondary education (called the Scientific-Humanistic stream)
are not much greater than primary education costs.
4.     As is typically the case, the largest share of the education budget
goes for teachers' salaries. In Chile's education budget, this is not
immediately evident because some 60 percent of the total budget goes for
subventions. But since salaries account for on the order of 90 percent of the
subventions at the primary education level and substantial portions at other
levels, it is clear that Chile is no exception to the usual picture. Amounts
spent for school building and maintenance has been below 1.0 percent of the
total education budget. Since the decentralization to the municipalities,
most capital spending for education falls under the Ministry of Interior
budget. Even taking both Ministries' capital spending into account, this item
has represented a small share of sector spending, even in its highest years,
because of economic austerity. Table 5 of this Annex shows combined capital
spending by purpose.

5.     Discussion of the public budget for education would be incomplete
without taking into account two factors: the contributions of the municipali-
ties to spending for primary and secondary schools, and the role of the
private sector in financing education. In both cases there have been
significant contributions to total education spending but, as discussed in the
following sections, the main source of educational finance continues to be the
public education budget.
The Role of the Municipalities in Financing Primary and Secondary Education
6.     Decentralization of education gave municipal governments (and in some
cases, municipal corporations) and private-subsidized schools responsibility
for providing educational services. Despite this shift, the Central
Government has continued to be the most important provider of educational
finance because the decentralized authorities operate on the basis of per
capita subventions. But because the subventions have not kept pace with costs
of the municipal education programs, and because of shif*s in enrollment from
the public schools to the private sector and concommitan;. declines in subven-
tion payments, municipalities have incurred deficits in their education
budgets and have had to add payments from other sources in order to cover
these daficits.

Annex 4
Page 9 of 13
7.     Municipal schools provide places for approximately 59 percent of public
school students at both the primary and secondary education levels. Total
payments of subventions for education to the municipalities amounted to 87.7
billion pesos in 1990, or about 40 percent of the total budget of the central
Ministry of Education. By far the largest source of funding for municipal
schools is transfers via the subventions, either directly to the
municipalities or to public corporations that manage their schools.'/
According to the 1987 CASEN II household survey, subeidies for secondary
education are concentrated in higher income groups, opposite to the case with
preschool and primary education subsidy transfers. The Ministry of Hacienda
pays subventions to the municipality which, in turn, transfers the funds to
its education department or corporation. Like the private-subsidized schools,
those operated by the municipal education departments or corporations are
subject to periodic verification or audit of attendance on which the subven-
tion payments are based. The municipal education departments are obliged to
render accounts indicating the uses of the funds.
8.     In the case of many municipalities, even the substantial amount of
subvention payments does not cover the full costs of the municipal schools,
and these municipalities have had to pay additional sums from resources other
than the subventions that are intended to cover education costs. In munici-
palities that do not receive sufficient subvention payments to cover their
education costs, there are several alternative ways of making up the short-
fall. Other sources of funds include the following:
(a) Use by the municipalities of funds allocated to them from the
Department of Interior's Fondo Comfin Municipal (FCM). The FCM is
derived from 60 percent of land taxes and 50 percent of vehicle
registration fees collected throughout the county, as well as special
amounts from the municipalities of Santiago, Las Condes and Providencia,
and is distributed according to a progressive formula that gives poor
communities larger shares.
(b) Funds distributed by the Ministry of Interior and intended to meet
special needs of communities, called the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo
Regional (FNDR). The total use of funds from the FCM and FNDR to cover
educational costs in excess of the subventions was 7.9 billion pesos in
1990.
(c) Extraordinary payments by Hacienda to cover deficits in municipal
finances, including those in education departments and corporations.
These vary from year to year, and are not paid in all years. The amount
was over 10 billion pesos in 1988, a special large payment to cover
accumulated deficits, and was 2.6 billion pesos in 1990.
1/ Of the total of 327 municipalities, 54 have established corporations.
These include some of the most wealthy (e.g., Las Condes) as well as some
of the poorest. Corporations have somewhat greater flexibility in managing
the schools, but are subject to the same verification of attendance and
other controls as municipal schools.

Annex 4
Page 10 of 13
(d) Possible use of funds generated by the municipalities from totally
local sources that do not form part of the FCM, but these amounts would
be extremely small for most municipalities.
9.    The Contraloria General !e la Republica reported that the combined
amounts used by the provinces from their FCM and FNDR resources, plus the
extraordinary payment of 2.6 billion pesos, was 10.5 billion pesos in 1990, or
approximately 11 percent of total spending on the municipal schools.  In 1990,
municipalities' coitribution to total education finance (all sources) amounted
to 3.2 percent.  There is unquestionably a problem of excess of costs of
municipal schools over revenues, and this problem may be severe in the case of
some municipalities. The total magnitude of payments in addition to the
subventions is not overwhelmingly large, and will be somewhat reduced as a
result of the law modifying the subventions. The Bank has asked for a study
to be performed whicn will examine the relation between subvention payments
and use of own resources in a sample of municipalities.
10.   An obvious question is: why is there a shortfall?  A discussion of the
adequacy of the subvention payments since decentralization took place and of
the managerial efficiency of the municipal education systems and related
matters transcends the scope of this annex. Government recognizes the problem
and proposes to deal with it through a proposed reform of the subvention law,
which is linked to the TS now before the legislature. This modification would
add an estimated total of 5 billion pesos over a 5-year perio' to the basic
subventions, and would then be phased out. One of the objectives of the TS
and the modification of the subventions is to adjust the payments to
municipalities and private-subsidized schools more closely to the real costs
of providing the education. While there will be an increase in the Ministry
of Education budget due to increases in subventions and the other effects of
the TS, this increase in transfers to the municipalities will be at least
partly offset by a decrease in transfers such as Hacienda's extraordinary
payments. The education budget will reflect more realistically the full cost
of education, municipalities will receive more adequate flows of funds for
education, and there may be an incentive for municipalities to manage their
education systems efficiently in order to operate within the amounts intended
for education.
The Contributions of the Private Sector
11.   Private provision of educational services has increased rapidly
following the decentralization of education in Chile, mainly in the private
subeidized schools. Enrollment in privately-subsidized schools at the primary
education level has increased from 306,200 or roughly 15 percent of total
primary education enrollment in 1980 to 623,100 or approximately one third of
enrollment at this level. Note that these schools receive essentially all
their financing through subventions and, while they represent an important
change in the direction of private sector operation of schools and of diversi-
ty of options for parents and students, this does not constitute a major
increase in private sector financing of education. Municipalities provide
additional funding from their own resources to cover shortfalls in their
education budgets, but private operators cannot do this and survive. Private-



- 73 -
Annex 4
Page 11 of 13
subsidized schools at the primary education level are not supposed to charge
fees, but in a number of cases they do so, either on a voluntary basis (which
is not prohibited) or through small specific charges for materials or other
items. There are no data available on family payments for primary education
but annecdotal information indicates that this may add as much as 20 percent
of the subvention or more, especially for private subsidized schools serving
more affluent communities.
12.   The role of fee-paying private education in Chile has not changed
greatly during the period of decentralization, There has always been a
stratum of elite and relatively costly private schools, almost all in urban
areas, and the share of enrollment in private fee-paying institutions has
hardly changed since 1980. Primary education enrollment in private fee-paying
schools in 1989 was 131,100 or 6.5 percent of total primary education enroll-
ment, and 60,140 or 8.1 percent of secondary enrollment. The role of the
private sector was greatest in preschool, where 14.7 percent of 1989 enroll-
ment in the formal (conventional) preschool mode was in paid private schools
(Annex 3, Table 7). Private sector financing of university education is
important both as a percent of total spending for this significant subsector
and as an absolute amount. It is at the post-secondary level that private
sector financing has increased most rapidly in the last decade, as Tables 6
and 7 of this Annex show.

Sources and Relative Shares of Education Sector Financial Resources
13.    How great has the contribution of the private sector and the
municipalities been in total and how has this changed over the decade of the
1980s since decentralization. Since municipal finance of education essential-
ly did not exist prior to the decentralization and the role of private support
of education was limited, the growth in these contributions has been enormous.
In terms of share in total educational spending, there has been a notable
increase, although the public sector continues to provide the greatest part of
total expenditure. The Bank has made estimates of the private sector role.
Annex 4, Table 6 shows total sector spending from Central Government, munici-
pal resources and the private sector from 1985 to 1990. Table 7 presents the
data as percent of total education finance. The main points that emerge from
these two tables are:  (i) non-central government finance (hereafter called
"private", although non-central funding from municipal sources is actually
public and a substantial portion of this is from the Central Government)
represents a significant share of total education finance, increasing from
21.0 to 31.6 percent of the total during the years for which estimates are
available; (ii) the most important contributor to this share--in both absolute
terms and as a source of growth--has been private finance of university
education, which grew from 14.7 to 24.2 percent of total education finance
between 1985 and 1990; (iii) the shares of both the municipal and nonunivers-
ity private contributions increased in percentage terms during the period but
together represent only 7.5 percent of total educational finance; and (iv)
private funds brought total sector finance up to 8.6 percent of GNP in 1985, a
figure well above the regional average, this share has fallen sharply in
recent years. In other words, as important as the role of private finance is,
it has not compensated for the overall decline in resources flowing into the
sector.

Annex 5: RECURRENT EDUCATIONAL EXPENDITURE, PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROJECT COSTS AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS
1.    As discussed in Chapter IV, the incremental recurrent costs that result
from the project will be on the order of US$22.1 million in 1996, once the
project is fully operational. This Annex considers the financial feasibility
of this increase in recurrent expenditure together with other increases that
are expected to take place as a result of implementing the TS and changing the
subsidy law governing payments to municipal and private schools. It examines
the likely trends in recurrent costs; describes briefly the cost implications
of the TS and the reform of the subsidy law; and explores possible cost
savings and economic benefits that can be expected to result from the project,
in addition to its main effects of enhancing student learning and improving
equity.
Proiection of Recurrent Educational Expenditure
2.    Table l of this Annex presents estimates of recurrent spending in the
education sector to the year 2004, including the estimated recurrent cost
implications of implementing the TS and the revision of the subvention law, as
well as the recurrent costs resulting from the project--both during the life
of the project and afterward.  The basic projection, including the TS, would
result in fairly rapid and sustained growth in sector spending, even in the
absence of the Bank project, taking into account the Government's commitment
to improving tha quality of education and increasing the flow of resources
into the sector. Even starting from this fairly high basis, Annex 5, Table 1
shows that, while education's estimated share of total public spending would
continue to grow rapidly until 1995 due to both the TS and the project, the
share of total public spending is relatively stable and even declines slightly
thereafter. Even at its highest projected level of 11.6 percent of public
spending in 1995, it would be below the average level of public educational
spending in lower middle income countries comparable to Chile (13.3 percent).
It would be slightly higher than the 1988 average for all of Latin America,
which itself had fallen from over 14 percent in 1972.
Impact of the TS on Recurrent Edv.cational Expenditures
3.    The Government has committed itself to providing legislation that will
clarify the professional status and working conditions of teachers, a measure
that apparently enjoys wide political support. This is considered an integral
part of the Government's efforts to improve the quality of education. The
statute recently approved by the Legislature includes provisions about
reachers' pay and allowances and professional issues including inservice
training. Closely related to the statute is a revision of the law governing
subvention payments to municipal and private subsidized schools, since changes
in teachers' pay would have to be financed through these subventions. Table 2
of this Annex presents the estimated costs of implementing the statute.

4.     A portion of the added cost .esulting from the TS will have to do with
on-the-job training for teachers included in the project, and the Government
proposes that this amount be considered as part of its counterpart funding in
support of the project to improve educational quality. The figure in Table 1
of this Annex has been adjusted to avoid double-counting the part of total
project recurrent costs that would result from implementing the TS. In
summary, the analyses indicate that the total increase in the education sector
budget between 1991 and 1997 resulting from the project and the TS and subsidy
changes will be 60 percent or an average annual increase of 8.1 percent, and
that the recurrent costs that will result from the project will amount to some
1.8 percent of the sector budget in 1997.
Estimates of Savings and Economic Benefits Resulting from the Proiect of
USS22.1 Million Resulting from the Proiect
5.     rhe main purpose of this education project is to improve the quality of
basic education in Chile, that is to say, to improve student learning. It
proposes to do this through a program that will be aimed at schools with
lowest academic performance, which includes mostly schools serving poor and
often r-ural communities. This investment in better quality and greater equity
will also lead to cost savings because students receiving better quality
education will not repeat as many grades or drop out of school before
completing the basic education cycle, thus total enrollment is actually
expected to be less as a result of the project than it would have been
otherwise. Moreover, since greater numbers of students will complete all
eight years of basic education, there will be economic benefits in the form of
higher earnings among these additional graduates. These two categories of
benefits--which can be quantified and expressed in money terms as savings in
public costs of education and added income of basic education graduates--do
not constitute all the benefits of the project. It is interesting, however,
to carry out the exercise of estimating its monetizable benefits.

6.     Savings from Reduced Repetition and Dropouts.  Table 3 of this Annex is
based upon two alternative projections of basic education enrollment from 1996
(the year in which the project will be completed and can be expected to have a
favorable impact on repetition and dropouts) to 2005. The first projection
assumes no change in present rates of repetition and the second assumes a
decrease in repetition rates as a result of better teaching, availability of
texts and educational materials and other quality-enhancing inputs. The Table
shows the expected decrease in enrollment as a result of the project. Savings
from reduced enrollment are conservatively estimated on the basis of a
constant cost per student/per year of 63,000 pesos multiplied by the number of
student places saved. Discounting the total savings over the 10-year period
to present value in 1996 (7.5 percent discount rate) yields an estimate of
46.8 billion pesos as of 1996.
7.     Economic Benefits of Increasing Basic EducatIon Graduates.  As is
widely understood, providing primary or basic education is a sound economic
investment, yielding a rate of return that compares favorably with alternative
investments in any sector. The project will result in greater numbers of
basic education graduates because fewer children will drop out of school, and
hence will produce additional economic benefits. One approach to quantifying
these benefits is to calculate the present value of gains in earnings that
result from completing the basic cycle, and multiply this by the number of
additional completers, with appropriate adjustments for the year of comple-
tion. Special analyses of the CASEN II survey performed by the Bank show that
students completing eight years of education earned 36,000 pesos per year
(slightly more that US$100) more than noncompleters in 1987. Table 3 of this
Annex shows the increased numbers of graduates in each year from 1996 to 2005
and the present value (as of 1996, 7.5 percent discount rate) of the added
earnings of these graduates. The total economic benefit thus calculated would
equal 21.7 billion pesos in 1996.

cycle, calculated by the Divisi6n de Planificaci6n y Presupuesto, MINEDUC.
These data do not include migration and rd-enrollment of students between
schools and regions, therefore, they understate the amount of repetition
(except in the cases of private, fee-paying schools, where migration and
changes of school are minimal).
b/ Estimates made by E. Schiefelbein of UNESCO/OREALC for the Bank, using the
methodology that includes migration and re-enrollment at the national
level. The data for the national lev,l are more accurate than MINEDUC's
figures; private education is subject to limited migration.

2.    The following six weighted criteria are used to classify the municipal
and private-subsidized primary schools into high, medium, and low risk:
(a) SIMCE's (achievement scores) available time series; (b) a scale that
incorporates the number of primary education grades offered; (c) dropout and
repetition rates; (d) degree of rurality; (e) school enrollment; and (f)
socioeconomic status of student population. Primary schools, offering eight
grades or less, will be classified as high risk if they: (a) have scored low
on -recent SINCE tests; (b) have high repetition and dropout rates; and (c) are
located in low-income urban or rural areas according to CASEN and the Hinistry
of Planning (MIDEPLAN) classification (with 300 or less inhabitants, or 60 or
less dispersed households). A simulation of the ranking of all the municipal
and private subsidized schools is included in the working papers.

3.    The yearly PRODEPE budget will be earmarked by the PIU to the 40
Educational Provinaial Departments according to a given distribution that
takes into account the following weighted normalized criteria for the
Province:
a) urban and rural primary education enrollment;
b) primary repetition and dropout rates; and
c) MIDEPLAN's extreme poverty indicators.
An illustration of such distribution follows.
4.    Once a yearly budget distribution is prepared by the PIU according to
the above methodology, the SEREMIS will be allowed to fine tune it for their
Provinces in + or - 15 percent, based in the context of the regional situation
existing at that particular time.
5.    The information regarding the modified distribution is conveyed (not yet
assigned) by the PIU to each one of the 40 Educational Provincial authorities,
for them to set an upper bound on the number of quality improvement projects
from high, medium, and low risk primary schools to be selected and approved
during that particular year.
6.    Once a given Province approves and registers its alloted annual quota of
school quality improvement projects according to the preset criteria and
procedures explained in the Operational Manual, it informs the PIU.
7.    The PIU auchorizes the transferring to the Province of up to 70 percent
of the total cost of the approved project portfolio. Resources are disbursed
according to the attached flowchart.
8.    The school enrollment criteria in conjunction with the CASEN-MIDEPLAN
urban-rural discriminator will be utilized to establish upper and lower bounds
of the funds made available for individual quality improvement projects to be
funded. The average financing will be about US$6,000 per quality improvement
project. Selected projects that could be implemented in one year will receive
up to 70 percen: of the entitled grant in one payment at the moment of the
approval, with the remaining 30 percent to be disbursed in a final payment
upon completion of project, satisfactory to the respective municipal and
provincial authorities. Selected projects requiring more than one year
implementation will receive multi-year payments totalling up to 70 percent of
the entitled grant according to a schedule specially designed to assure
project sustainability. The recipient school is obliged to contribute
additional resources erqiivalent up to 20 percent of the quality improvement
project cost, accounted in the form of teachers' time to implement the
selected project (no more than 20 percent of weekly contra-ted time), material
resources required, physical maintenance, construction, arn' :quipping.
9.    Only quality improvement projects endorsed by a minimum of four teachers
working at the same school, and supported by the school's principal, will be
considered by the supervisors and the education authorities for funding
purposes. Schools with fewer than three teachers, especially those located in
rural areas, will be encouraged tc design their quality improvement projects

in conjunction with other schools in similar situations through appropriate
workshops involving the respective supervisor. The TS (para. 3.27) fully
supports the implementation of PRODEPE.1
10.   Before the Provincial Education authority makes the first quality
improvement project payment, agreements are signed with the school proprietor
to make him accountable for project implementation. A flowchart of such
agreement follows.
11.   An information and monitoring file  a. oppened by the Educational
Provincial authority for each quality improvement project s,nt by each
participating school (approved or not approved). Flowcharts on project
implementation monitorirg and financial control follows.
12.   Once a quality improvement project implementation is satisfactory
completed, the information is conveyed by the supervisor to the Educational
Provincial authority, and from there, to the 1"TU. The PIU then orders the
transferring of resources to the Educational Provincial authorities for them
to pay the school proprietor the outstanding balance.
13.    A quality improvement project evaluation will be implemented to analyze
PRODEPE's process and measure its impact on quality, efficiency, and equity.
1/   Article 9 defines cocurricular activities as tLose complementing classroom
teaching tasks. Article 19 provides the school institutional frame under
which teams of teachers could contribute with quality improvement projects.
Article 44 regulates the school year and establishes up to three weeks for
teacher participation in cocurricular activities.   Articles 55 and 64
stipulate that the teachers weekly time of 44 hours will comprise a maximum
of 33 hours (of 45 minutes) of in-classroom teaching activities and a
minimum of 11 hours of out-of-class cocurri-cular tasks.

Annex 11: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION UNIT
A. Protect Management Oblective and Structure
1.    The project would be managed under the authority of the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) directly accountable to the Minister of Education.
The PIU's main objective will be to implement all the projects components in
accordance with prescribed technical and legal requirements stipulated by the
Chilean Government and the Bank.
2.    The PIU comprises the project management unit and a matrix type
organization encompassing four substantive and three adjective divisions.'/
The substantive divisions are mainly in charge of coordinating the implemen-
tation of each one of the four project components. The three adjective
divisions are in charge of coordinating the: (a) planning, programming,
monitoring, and evaluating activities of the project; (b) procurement, civil
works, technical assistance, and personnel; and (c) financing, accounting, and
auditing (see organizational chart). The project management would be assisted
by: (i) a project Executive Council comprised by the Minister of Education or
his/her representative, the UnderSecretary of Education, the Director of
MINEDUC's Division of Planning and Budgeting, the Director of MINEDUC's
Division of Education, and the Director of the CPEIP; and (ii) a Legal
Advisor. An Advisory Council (AC) constituted by highly respected
personalities representing the education, cultural,and private sectors, as
well as political groups will assist the Minister and Under Secretary of
Education. The AC will provide guidance based on how society perceives the
effects of MECE.

l/   In the matrix organization theory, a substantive unit is responsible of
attaining the organization's objectives (ends), whereas a unit is
responsible for providing the services (means) necessary to accomplish
the organization's goals. The performance of the substantive units
measures the effectiveness of the organization (attainment of goals),
whereas the performance of the adjective units measures the efficiencv of
the organization (resource consumption).

Annex 13: PROJECT MONITORING MATRIX AND SUPERVISION ARRANGEMENTS
A. KEY PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
11.e key monitoring indicators to track the project's performance are
listed in the matrix below (Annex 13, Table 1). It is unrealistic in the
education sectors worldwide to set short- and medium-term targets on
efficiency, equity and quality, due to the very slow, and sometimes
unpredictable response of the educational systems to change. However, it is
advisable to monitor the change of the proposed indicators over time,
expecting improvements when compared with the corresponding base information
(current values).
