MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE FOR A PRIMARY EDUCATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Chile for US$170 million equivalent is submitted for your
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable over 17 years, including
4 years of grace, at the Bank's variable interest rate and charges.  The
Government of Chile (GOCH) would be the Borrower and the Ministry of Education
(MINEDUC) would be the executing agency.
2.        Background.  The current Chilean Administration has adopted econo-
mic policies consistent with the functioning of a private-sector-led market
economy, while promoting the improved delivery of carefully targeted social
services to enhance equity. The Government is committed to macroeconomic
stability, trade liberalization, and greater fiscal effort in the social
sectors within the constraints of a balanced fiscal budget. Productive
activities in the economy are diversifying rapidly, as Chile reduces its
earlier dependence on natural resource extraction, increases the international
competitiveness of its value-added exports, and develops its service sector,
mainly through technological innovation. These changes are increasing the
demand for an adaptable, well educated labor force. To facilitate and
accelerate this process, the Government gives high priority to human capital,
starting with an effort to upgrade the efficiency, quality, and equity of the
primary education system.
3.        Chile's quantitative education indicators compare favorably to
higher income economies: average years of schooling now attained by Chileans
are among the highest in Latin America, and adult illiteracy is among the
lowest in the region. Access problems in primary education are now largely
resolved. These positive indicators are the result of Chile's long-term
emphasis on education, as well as on more recent education sector reforms
which decentralized social development responsibilities to the administrative
regions and municipalities. However, despite these accomplishments, the
educational achievement assessment system (Sistema de Informacion Sobre la
Calidad de la Educaci6n--SIMCE) and educational statistics demonstrate that
the sector has been unable to translate educational policy reforms effectively
into programmatic actions to assure educational quality, efficiency, and
equity improvements, especially among low-income urban and rural groups.  In
general, student cognitive and problem-solving skills lag behind those needed
to contribute adequately to the achievement of the economic and social
objectives of a dynamically developing country. Educational effectiveness has
been further hindered by ambiguously defined joint responsibilities of the
MINEDUC and the municipalities in resource allocation, support services,
budgeting, and accountability.
4.        On the efficiency side, late primary school entry, repetition and
dropout remain critical issues. As a result, on average, it takes 12.4 years
to graduate from the eight-grade primary cycle. On the equity side, about 79
percent of 4-year-olds and 31 percent of 5-year-olds, most of whom live in
poor urban and rural communities, do r.ot participate in any tvep of pre-school
education.  Their resulting lack of readiness--especially ii. psy,-o-



- 2 -
motor development and social skills--contributes to the risk of repetition and
dropout during primary school. On the aualitv side, academic achievemsat
assessments undertaken in 1982 and 1988 show a national decline of 14 percent
in Spanish and 6 percent in mathematics. Furthermore, the gap between the
highest scores shown in paid-private schools and lowest scores registered in
the low-income municipal schools widened in the 1982-88 period.
5.        Given this situation, the Government's sectoral objectives includes
(a) enhancing the efficiency, quality, and equity of primary education with
specific programs targeted to low-income urban and rural poor students) and
(b) strengthening the ongoing educational decentralization initiative with
the strong participation of all levels of decision-making, including the
municipalities and the private sector. To achieve its stated objectives, the
Government has requested the Bank's technical and financial assistance in tha
context of a six-year program in primary and preschool education.
6.        Ration le for Bank Involvement.  Chile's education sector is at a
crucial development juncture.  Having now expanded the primary education
system to attain virtual universal coverage, the challenge ahead is to ensure
equity in access to high quality primary education while concurrently
enhancing the internal efficiency of the system. This will necessitate major
changes in existing educational policies and approaches, financing mechanisms,
and administration and management. Expansion of preschool opportunities for
disadvantaged children is an essential corollary to improve primary education
performance. Concurrently, the design of secondary education programs must be
carefully reassessed and modified, as necessary, to ensure that the vast
majority of graduates for whom this is the last stage of formal education can
respond to rapidly evolvwing labor market demands within a dynamic, modernizing
economy. Bank involvement in the education sector at this juncture can play
an invaluable role, beyond provision of investment financing per so, in
assisting the Government to formulate appropriate policies, institute
equitable financing schemes, and design cost-effective educational programs
which can contribute to attainment of Chile's overall dtvelopment objectives.
The proposed project, the first in the Chilean education sector since 1970,
comprises an integral part of the Bank's overall country assistance strategy
to alleviate poverty. Specifically, it will institute cost-effective measures
to increase educational opportunities for low-income urban and rural children,
a problem which has been identified as a central concern in the Bank's recent
social sector work. Bank involvement will facilitate a strong private sector
role and reinforce the decentral4.zation oi social services. It also promotes
the evolution of the educational system to the needs of a highly dynamic
economy. This project would complement sectoral financial resources already
obtained through recent tax reforms. The Bank would provide technical assis-
tance to adapt successful educational experiences from other countries. It
would also open dialogue about future Bank involvement in secondary education,
where complex curricular and financing issues cvait serious policy attention.
7.        Proiect Obiectives.  The central project objective is to assist the
Government in enhancing the efficiency, quality, and equity of primary
education in selected schools in urban and rural areas. The project would
also: (a) expand the coverage and enhance the quality of preschool education
to increase primary school preparedness and reduce late entry, repetition, and
dropout in primary schools, especially for 5-year-olds living in poverty
conditions; (b) strengthen the institutional capacity of NINEDUC central,



regional, and provincial offices, as well as that of the education departments
of the municipalities to direct and manage a decentralized education system,
and improve the managerial skills of administrators of municipal, private
primary schools and private preachools; and (c) assess alternative cost-
effective approaches to meet the secondary education needs of primary
education graduates.
8.        Prolect Descr_ition: The project would support the above objec-
tives by financing the following four components: (a) Primary education (74
2ercent of total Rroiect cost): (i) implementing 5,000 locally-based quality
improvement projects of a pedagogical decentralization program (PRODEPE)
through the participation of teachers and principals of 5,000 selected munici-
pal and private-subsidized primary schools; (ii) strengthening the educational
testing system to assess and monitor student academic achievement for about
240,000 students from either fourth or eighth grade every year;
(iii) providing inservice training for about 78,000 teachers, 8,000 school
principals, and 625 supervisors; (iv) distributing, on a targeted cost-
recovery scheme, about 24.5 million primary textbooks for all municipal and
private-subsidized primary students, about 870,000 sets of complementary
reading and teaching materials, and teaching equipment for primary schools;
(v) hiring 500 new teachers to provide eight complete grades in 500 incomplete
rural primary schools; (vi) constructing 500 classrooms in rural areas; (vii)
up-grading and refurbishing classrooms in about 2,500, mostly rural primary
schools; (viii) establ'shing an experimental education communication computer
network in 66, mostly rural, primary schools; (ix) providing health screening
and referrals to 250,000 first graders every year; and (x) establishing
monetary incentives for inservice teacher training and lecturing in deprived,
mostly rural primary schools in the framework of the Teachers' Statute (TS);
(b) Preschool Education (16 percent of total proiect cost}: (i) expanding the
coverage of preschool education for about 16,000 urban and 30,000 rural,
mostly 5-year-old children of low-income urban and rural families, by hiring
23 supervisors, 140 teachers, and 1,255 paraprofessionals; providing about
3,000 workshops to train 23,400 rural parents in the early stimulation of
their children; constructing 100 classrooms and refurbishing 75 rural facili-
ties donated by the communities; providing 18,000 daily food rations and
40,300 sets of didactic materials; and (ii) enhancing the quality of existing
preschool services by hiring 50 supervisors, 163 teachers, and 164 para-
professionals; providing inservice teacher training courses for 200 super-
visors, 3,300 preschool principals and teachers, and 2,700 paraprofessionals;
designing, producing, and distributing about 102,000 sets of teaching
materials; strengthening parent participation through training workshops and a
massive media campaign; and establishing evaluation studies to ascertain the
cost-effectiveness of each preschool alternative implemented and the medium-
term impact of preschool on the child's education, behavior, and skills;
(c) Institutional Develo=ment (7 percent of total groiect cosQ: (i) reen-
forcing managerial skills at the central MINEDUC, regional, and provincial
levels by training about 500 staff to improve their planning, programming,
budgeting, and monitoring capacities; (ii) providing management training to
670 municipal educational employees (from 280 municipal departments of
education, and 54 municipal Corporaciones); (iii) providing management skill
training for 1,200 preschool and primary school adminiitrators; and (iv)
developing practical manuals for planning, programming, administration,
budgeting, and monitoring decentralized education activities; and (v) estab-
lishing an educational information system; and (d) Secondary Education tl.0
percent of total proiect cost): financing studies on curriculum development,



-4-
teacher training and evaluation, and on external and internal efficiency of
secondary educatica to assess cost-effective secondary education strategies to
meet the future needs of greater numbers of primary education graduates.
9.        The total project cost is estimated at US$243.0 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$34.2 million (14.0 percent of the
total cost). A break-down of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Pchedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schodule B. Retroactive financing of up to
US$6.0 million would be granted for expenditures incurred after June 15, 1991.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Chile are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 9769-CH, dated September 11, 1991, is also attached.
10.       ImRlementation Arranzements.  The Borrower would be GOCH.  The
proceeds of the loan would be disbursed during a six and a half year period.
The project would be implemented through the existing organizational struc-
tures of the MINEDUC; however, project implementation will be handled by a
project implementation unit (PIU), which has been established by the MINEDUC.
11.       Actions Taken or to be Taken.  To facilitate the proposed project's
implementation, the Government has alreadys (a) enacted tax reforms to
generate additional resources for the social sector; (b) enacted a teacher
statute (Law 17070, dated July 1, 1991) including the financial resources
required for its implementation; (c) established the Provincial Educational
Councils (PECs) as advisory and participatory bodies comprising MINEDUC and
municipal authorities, teachers, and parents; (d) set in motion two projects,
the "900 Deprived Primary School Program," to improve the educational quality
of targeted primary schools, and the "National Program to Induce Educational
Innovations"; and (e) enacted the extension of the school year from 36 to 37
weeks, which should enhance school quality.
12.       MINEDUC has already presented the following project documents, offi-
cially approved by MINEDUC and satisfactory to the Bank: (a) the policy st-
atement for the education sector specifying: (i) the medium-term goals
regarding the equity, efficiency and quality of primary education; (ii) the
overall sector financing plan for primary, secondary and tertiary levels of
the education system; (iii) the responsibilities at various levels of
Government and the private sector; and (iv) that the Government will allocate
requisite financial resources to sustain future education sector expenditures;
(b) PRODEPE's Operational Manual; (c) the final version of the Pedagogical Su-
pervision Manual: and (d) the final version of the Administrative Inspection
Manual. The Bank has also obtained assurances that basic elements of conven-
tional financial management accounting and auditing would be included in the
implementation of PRODEPE.
13.       Agreements have been reached that:  (a) changes to the PRODEPE
supervision and inspector manuals, or the TS that materially and adversely
affect the project would be considered an event of default; (b) the Government
will put into effect a system whereby the entire teaching force will be
encouraged to participate in periodic upgrading and inservice teacher training
during the life of the project; (c) the Government will allocate in the annual
budgets each year of project implementation the specific amount required to
increase the subsidy to small, mostly rural schools; (d) the Government will
furnish to the Bank for review the education budget annually to ensure that



-5-
adequate resources are provided to sustain the quality improvement program and
the strengthening of the decentralization process, and that the proposed
sector spending levels are consistent with the macroeconomic framework;
(e) regulations concerning the cost-recovery policy for primary school
textbooks and preschool teaching materials will be put into effect before
disbursing for materials and textbooks; (f) the Government will employ a
project manager with qualifications and unter terms of employment satisfactory
to the Bank; and (g) the content of the annual early-term and mid-term reviews
are consistent with the project goal and objectives.
14.       For Loan Effectiveness, the Bank would require that:  (a) the model
contract to be signed with Municipalities, or private subsidized school
proprietors, concerning PRODEPE resource allocations with Municipalities and
INTEGRA concerning classroom construction, and preschool and primary school
refurbishing and remodelling, be on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank; (b) the project manuals (PRODEPE supervision and administrative inspec-
tion) be formally adopted within the education system; (c) Government Bylaws
regulating inservice teacher training certification based on selectivity and
quality control merits be enacted; (d) an amount be allocated by the
Government in the 1992 budget as agreed with the Bank, so as to establish a
more equitable subsidy; and (e) the PIU be formally established.
15.       To authorize disbursements of the primary school textbook and
prsschool teaching materials components, the Bank will require the adoption of
the cost-recovery policy for primary school textbooks and preschool teaching
materials.
16.       Benefits and Risks.  The project will:  (a) produce cost savings
resulting from lower repetition and dropouts, which is eatimated to be
US$137 million; (b) produce incremental economic benefits, estimated at
US$63 million that will accrue to the roughly 10,000 additional students who
will complete basic education each year instead of dropping out; (c) ensure
poverty alleviation impact by increasing the access of low-income poor
children to preschool education; (d) enhance the efficiency and quality of
preschool and primary education through improved educational inputs;
(e) reduce inequity in primary education by targeting through PRODEPE high-
risk, mostly poor, urban and rural subsidizei primary schools; (f) strengthen
the decentralization process through the participation of teachers and school
principals and supervisors, as well as provincial and municipal authorities in
the quality improvement projects; (g) enhance the institutional managerial
capabilities of MINEDUC at the central, regional, and provincial level, and
the municipalities including its education departments, private corporations
and administrators. The major risks to project implementation are:
(a) possible distortions in targeting project interventions, and (b) recentra-
lization of education services. These risks will be reduced by: (a) imple-
menting precise targeting criteria to benefit deprived urban and rural
schools; (b) adopting suitable operational and procedural manuals and training
for provincial and municipal education authorities, school principals, and
supervisors; (c) carefully selecting and training key personnel participating
in the PIU, and in PRODEPE's disbursement and monitoring; (d) promoting the
porticipation of the municipalities and communities in project implementation;
and (e) close supervision by the Bank.
