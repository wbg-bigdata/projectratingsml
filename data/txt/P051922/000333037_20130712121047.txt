F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Rural Development Support Project (RDSP) is to increase incomes
and reduce poverty in rural areas, while preserving the natural resource base. The project
is part of the Rural Development Action Plan (Plan d'Action pour le Développement
Rural - PADR), a broad-based program approved by the Government in 1999 to promote
sustainable growth in agricultural production, foster food security and enhance access to
basic services in the rural areas. The project would support demand-driven activities in
agricultural production and technology transfer, and strengthen capacity at national,
regional and community levels.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Even though the PDO was not changed, there were considerable attempts to make it more
measurable. As such, Key Performance Indicators evolved over the life of the project,
maintaining the spirit and overall level of achievement of original ones (see paragraph
1.3.1). At the time the project was prepared, there was no formal “Logframe? structure.
As such, the PDO and the absence of intermediate indicators were consistent with the
design standards of Bank projects at the time. Formal intermediate outcome indicators
were introduced at the time of the Additional Financing (2008).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) describes the experiences, achievements
and lessons of the Madagascar Rural Development Support Project. The project was implemented
in two stages: the Original Project (OP - Credit 3524-MAG) approved June 19, 2001 and closed
December 31, 2012, and an Additional Financing (AF - Credit 4525-MAG) with the same project
development objectives, design and implementation arrangements, approved October 23, 2008
and closed at the same time as the OP on December 31, 2012. The AF scaled up the coverage of
project activities/investments in small-scale socio-economic infrastructure and services, with the
goal of increasing the impact of the OP.

1.1.2 At the time of appraisal, Madagascar was one of the poorest countries in the world, with
an overall poverty rate of 70 percent, rising to 80 percent in rural areas. Sixty percent of rural
poor were classified as extremely poor, being unable to meet their minimum caloric consumption
needs. Agriculture provided a livelihood for 75 percent of the country’s population; however,
performance of the sector had been disappointing despite economic liberalization and the
adoption of a number of macroeconomic reforms in the nineties. Major constrains to the
development of the sector remained, including lack of rural infrastructure, poorly functioning
rural institutions, limited access to credit, burdensome regulatory limitations, and high transport
costs. Further, agriculture practices were poorly developed, suffered from a lack of support
services, and mostly were carried out in an environmentally unfriendly manner.

1.1.3 Bank-supported and other rural poverty reduction and environment projects carried out in
Madagascar in the previous decade had helped to alleviate these conditions. However, these
interventions were characterized by a sub-sectorial focus, lack of synergies and integration, and a
supply driven approach. As such, they had a limited and localized impact, as evidenced by
stagnation in yield growth for virtually all crops and production systems during that time.
Massive demand for basic services and more innovative approaches in rural areas indicated the
ongoing poverty reduction challenges facing the country.

1.1.4 Government’s Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. The need for sustained
growth in agriculture as a means to alleviate rural poverty had been emphasized in the Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy paper finalized by the Government of Madagascar (GOM) at the end
of 2000. In addition, at the time of project preparation the GOM had adopted a rural development
strategy as well as the Rural Development Action Plan (PADR), which identified the following
core policy themes along which programs and projects were to be formulated and implemented:

•   Sustainable growth in agricultural production through increased use of improved
    technologies; clear linkages with the environment and adoption of environmentally friendly
    practices; strengthened capacity for maintenance of rural infrastructure; and acceleration of
    the land titling process;
•   Partnerships in rural development, accompanied by the rationalization of the role of the state
    in rural development and the strengthening of producer organizations’ participation and rural
    finance institutions;
•   Institutional and regulatory reforms, including the promotion of decentralization and the
    reform of the regulatory framework;
•   Regional food security, through the improvement of rural transport and emergency
    preparedness; and


                                                1
•   Rural social services, including improved access to clean water and sanitation.

1.1.5 The adoption of the PADR represented a major step in the direction proposed by the
Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS – IDA/R97-7), which encouraged all stakeholders
from the public and private sectors to come together to define a rural development strategy
relying on empowered local communities. The PADR was consistent with the CAS in (a)
ensuring a pro-poor orientation of growth; (b) building human capital and institutional capacity;
(c) strengthening the public sector’s ability to deliver quality services and create a business-
friendly environment; and (d) promoting natural resources management to reduce environmental
degradation. As such, Bank support for the sector was justified as a catalyst to environmentally
sustainable economic development, business creation, more rational public investment in the
sector and export growth, and more generally as a bridge to the continuation of much needed
support in the agriculture sector. The Original Project (OP) became an integral part of the PADR
by supporting the first three pillar of the Government’s rural strategy, namely sustainable growth
in agricultural production, promotion of partnerships in rural development, and institutional and
regulatory reforms. Similarly, the Additional Financing (AF) adhered closely to the new CAS
(38135-MG, 2007-2011), which was aligned with the Government’s new development strategy
called Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), by responding to the challenge of removing constraints to
investments and growth in rural areas through economic inclusion to strengthen communities’
productive potential and integrate them into the broader economy.

1.1.6 A Bank sector review mission carried out in 2000 identified the challenges and
opportunities for alleviation of rural poverty in Madagascar and developed strategic options for
policy and programmatic action. Finding that, despite the existence of a relatively balanced
incentive structure, agricultural productivity had remained almost stagnant during the previous
decade, the Bank recommended the adoption of more innovative approaches to rural development
focused on (a) demand-driven projects implemented through decentralized mechanisms; (b)
increased farmers participation in decision making and financial contribution; and (c) improved
infrastructure and technological services. According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD),
project design sought close alignment with (a), (b), and (c).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 As stated in the PAD, the Project Development Objective (PDO) was to increase incomes
and reduce poverty in rural areas, while preserving the natural resource base. 1 The project was
part of the Rural Development Action Plan (PADR), a broad-based program approved by the
Government in 1999 to promote sustainable growth in agricultural production, foster food
security and enhance access to basic services in the rural areas. The project was designed to
support demand-driven activities in agricultural production and technology transfer, and
strengthen capacity at national, regional and community levels.

1.2.2    The key performance indicator was:



1
 The Development Credit Agreement for the OP as well as the Financing Agreement for the AF include a similar albeit
more specific PDO formulation: “to contribute to the implementation of the PADR and selected elements of the PADR
by fostering development of revenue increasing activities, thus increasing incomes and reducing poverty in rural areas,
while preserving the natural resource base.? This formulation makes reference to the Government Rural Development
Action Plan which over time became irrelevant and was substituted by the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP). The MAP
maintained support for the main elements stated in the PDO as formulated in the PAD, which the ICR uses.

    •   Productivity of major crops, livestock, fish and type of processed agricultural products
        increases by 35% one year after the completion of subprojects.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification

1.3.1 The PDO was never formally revised, but several adjustments were made to make it more
measurable. Key Performance Indicators (KPI) evolved over the life of the project, maintaining
the spirit and overall level of achievement of original ones. Intermediate outcome indicators were
introduced at the time of the AF reflecting the adoption of a formal “Logframe? structure, which
was not a design standard of Bank projects at the time the project was designed. Specifically, on
two occasions changes were made to the KPI. In 2008, taking advantage of the Additional
Financing review process, indicators were revised to better align them to the expected outcomes
to be achieved during the project, with productivity-related indicators moved from the PDO-level
to the intermediate outcome-level. In 2011, several of the key indicators were again revised as
part of project restructuring to facilitate measurement of progress achieved toward the PDO,
focus more sharply on outcomes to be achieved through the inclusion of several new performance
indicators, add several mandatory core indicators, and remove several indicators that the Project
interventions would influence only indirectly. The changes to the PDO-level indicators and key
intermediate outcome-level indicators are summarized below.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The primary target population was the same for both phases. The OP intended to reach
with at least one subproject an estimated 180,000 families, identified as poor smallholders living
in remote, low-density areas with no access to any subsidy for productive investments and with
inadequate infrastructure and services. The AF targeted an incremental 70,000 families with the
same profile, organized into 6,000 producer organizations. The planned project area covered all
of the 20 agro-ecological regions of the country, with 117 districts (out of the total 119) to be
covered under the AF. Special attention was to be given to targeting mechanisms to ensure
effective representation and participation of women, including giving priority to subprojects
proposed by women’s groups. It was anticipated that the entire rural population in the area served
by each subproject would also benefit indirectly. In addition, national and provincial 2 institutions
in the rural sector and associated with the project would benefit from improved capacity to
formulate and analyze policy, and to promote public/private coordination, as a result of project-
financed institutional development activities.

  As part of an effort to decentralize administration, Madagascar's six administrative provinces were subdivided into 22
regions in 2004. The regions became the highest subdivision level when the provinces were dissolved in accordance
with the results of the 2007 referendum. The regions are further subdivided into 119 districts, 1,579 communes, and
17,485 fokontany.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1   The OP planned to finance five components:

Component 1: Productive Investment (US$71.39 million, 67% of total project cost) financed
about 1,000 matching grants per year. These grants went to organized rural producer
organizations and village groups and were intended to finance demand-driven small-scale
productive infrastructure, agricultural production, and off-farm investments in rural areas.

Component 2: Support Services (US$11.88 million, 11% of total project cost) financed
extension services, technical support, and training to build capacity of farmers and producers
organizations for the implementation of the demand-driven productive investments and other
small scale non-productive activities. Component 2 also financed agricultural research through a
competitive grant program, and it sponsored research for strategic and upstream research.

Component 3: Community Development (US$6.13, 6% of total project cost) financed demand-
driven activities aimed at strengthening the rural communities and producer organizations.
Activities supported by Component 3 included: (a) preparation of development and business
plans for financing under Component 1, (b) development of organizational and managerial
capabilities, and (c) events for promoting beneficiaries’ participation.

Component 4: Capacity Building and Policy Development (US$5.22, 5% of total project cost)
financed technical assistance and training to build capacity in implementing agencies to reinforce
the PADR process at national and regional levels, to formulate and analyze rural policy, to
establish adequate agricultural statistical systems, and to strengthen environmental assessment.

Component 5: Project Administration and Monitoring (US$11.47, 11% of total project cost)
financed project administration and coordination activities, including supervision, monitoring and
impact evaluation (M&E).

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 The original five components were revised and consolidated into four components as a
result of the 2002 project and overall portfolio restructuring approved by the Board to improve
consistency of project design, lower transaction costs, and increase development effectiveness.
Specifically: (i) capacity building and training activities for farmers organizations (Component 2)
were integrated with the financing of productive investments (Component 1); (ii) outreach efforts
and sponsored research activities were consolidated into a single component (Component 2); (iii)
Component 3 – Community Development was folded into Component 1 – Productive
Investments; and (iv) strengthening of the environmental units of Ministries involved in rural
development (under Component 4) was discontinued, since similar activities were being
supported under the Madagascar Environmental Program. These changes to the components are
summarized below:

             Original Components                                  Revised Components
 Component 1: Productive Investment                 Component 1 – Productive Investments and
                                                    Support Services
 Component 2: Support Services                      Component 2 – Agricultural research and Training
 Component 3: Community Development                 Component 3 – Capacity Building and Policy
                                                    Development


                                                5
 Component 4: Capacity Building and Policy                   Component 4 – Project Administration and
 Development                                                 Monitoring
 Component 5: Project Administration and
 Monitoring

These four components were maintained in the AF, with virtually identical allocations by
component as under the OP. These allocations were subsequently amended to help advance
activities that were performing well (productive subprojects) at the expense of those that were
performing less well (research).

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 Suspension of disbursement: Following the change in Government on March 17, 2009,
Bank Management triggered OP/BP 7.30 (Dealing with de facto Governments), leading to a
temporary ban on written communication with Government agencies and a freeze on
disbursement. The ban was still in effect on the date when the OP was scheduled to close (April
30, 2009), thereby preventing the processing of the closing. On May 6, 2010, exceptional
authorization was granted retroactively to extend the closing date of the OP to make it coincide
with the closing date for the AF and to allow for the completion of pending subproject activities.
On the same date, the AF was declared effective. Due to an administrative oversight, however,
authorization to continue disbursements under the OP was not granted until June 2011. As a result,
even though the OP was able to resume implementation, about US$1.6 million IDA funds
remained idle for more than two years. OP/BP 7.30 remained in effect at the time of closing.

1.7.2 Additional Financing: As noted above, the AF loan (US$30 million), approved in
October 2008, was designed to scale up financing and beneficiary coverage to strengthen the
impact of the well-performing OP, which had become the centerpiece of Government’s agenda
for promoting direct investments in the rural sector. While preserving the basic design of the OP
and maintaining the same implementation structures, the AF was also intended to provide bridge
financing until the launch of the Government’s Agriculture Sector Program (ASP) and the putting
in place at the national level of new agricultural support services. The Bank’s internal review
process resulted in changes to the KPI, as noted, while implementation arrangements were
adjusted to reflect the Government’s decentralization process from provinces to regions. 3 The
project’s Financial Management (FM) arrangements were also modified, moving from
transaction-based disbursement procedures under the OP to report-based disbursement under the
AF, which was to finance 100 percent of each disbursement category.

1.7.3 Restructuring: The project was restructured a total of 10 times, reflecting the project’s
life span and the political turbulence and natural shocks it experienced. The following changes
were made:
• November 15, 2002 (Level 1 approved by the Board): (i) Components were consolidated as
     described above; (ii) implementation arrangements were improved through the inclusion of
     NGOs as strategic partners for the identification, design and implementation of agricultural
     production and off-farm subprojects; (iii) project management was enhanced through the
     appointment of a project management team modeled on private sector practices; (iv) due to
     liquidity problems, the authorized allocations of Special Accounts A and B were revised; (v)


3
  The 4 Provincial Project Implementation Units (PPIUs) were decentralized into 8 Regional Project Implementation
Units (RPIUs) responsible for coordination and implementation of project activities under Component 1.




                                                         6
    due to increasing counterpart financing problems, the disbursement percentage of expenditure
    Category 1 (Grants) was increased to 100 percent, while the disbursement percentage of
    Categories 2, 3, 4 and 5 (Civil Works; Equipment, vehicles and materials; Consultants’
    services, training and audits; and Operating Costs respectively) was increased to 100 percent
    for about one year (until December 2003); (vi) support to the environmental agencies was
    eliminated; and (vii) intermediate outcome indicators were brought in line with the
    consolidated components and project targets were adjusted by reducing the targeted number
    of subprojects from 1,000 to 800, the number of families benefited from 180,000 to 150,000,
    the percentage of subprojects geared to benefit women from 40 percent to 25 percent, the
    number of producer groups from 5,000 to 3,000, the percentage of producers that adopt
    improved agricultural technologies from 75 percent to 50 percent, and the number of rapid
    rural appraisals from 600 to 400. These changes were made because it was recognized that
    the original targets were overly ambitious.
•   August 6, 2004 (Level 2 approved by the Country Director): Reallocations of credit proceeds
    were approved as follows: SDR 13.6 million to “Grants? for agricultural and nonagricultural
    subprojects, reflecting satisfactory performance and strong demand for subprojects; SDR 1.3
    million to “Equipment, vehicles and materials;? SDR 3.8 million to “Operating costs?
    reflecting increased costs of targeting poor families in isolated communities and the need to
    carry out a full-fledged agricultural census (with a decrease in “Consultants, training, audit?
    category following inclusion of training as part of “Grants? for productive subprojects).
•   June 27, 2006 (Level 2 approved by the Regional Vice President): (i) SDR 11.58 million was
    reallocated to “Grants? for productive subprojects to permit the project to finance the
    continuing strong demand for subprojects following the rice intensification campaign; and a
    reallocation of SDR 12,500 to “Operating Costs? (with a decrease in “Grants? for productive
    infrastructure, “Works?; and “Consultants, training, audit? categories) (ii) project activities
    were amended to clearly reflect the nature of the 2005 cyclone repairs and rice intensification
    campaigns; and (iii) component outcome indicators were slightly changed to make them more
    relevant and in line with the PDO.
•   June 6, 2007 (Level 2 approved by the Country Director): (i) the Closing Date of the OP was
    extended by 18 months to permit the finalization of all remaining subprojects and training
    and disbursement of the remaining Credit balance; (ii) SDR 3.4 million was reallocated to
    “Grants? for the completion and consolidation of subprojects and strengthening of
    beneficiaries’ capacity (with a decrease in the “Consultants, training, audit and “Operating
    Costs? categories).
•   April 2, 2008 (Level 2 approved by the Country Director): Reallocations were approved as
    follows: SDR 450,000 to “Grants? for agricultural and nonagricultural subprojects;
    SDR15,000 to “Equipment, vehicles and materials?; SDR 207,000 to “Consultants’ Services,
    Training and Audits?; and SDR 558,000 to “Operating Costs.? These adjustments reflected
    the high inflation (7.2%) and primarily the increase in the price of fuel during 2007, raising
    substantially the costs of visiting project areas.
•   December 17, 2008 (Level 2 approved by the Country Director): the Closing Date of the OP
    was extended by 4 months 4 to allow completion of ongoing subprojects; (ii) SDR 355,000
    was reallocated to “Consultants? and SDR 723,000 to “Operating Costs? to cover for
    expenses generated by the preparation of the AF and exchange rate fluctuations (with a
    decrease in “Grants? for subprojects category).



4
  This extension applied only to category 1 (A) and 1 (B) of the IDA Credit Agreement (IDA-3524-MAG). All other
disbursement categories were supposed to close as scheduled on December 31, 2008.




                                                        7
•      June 4, 2010 (Level 2 approved by the Managing Director as part of the authorization to
       exceptionally resume project activities in light of OP/BP 7.30): the Closing Date of the OP
       was extended by two and half years to coincide with the AF closing date.
•      February 8, 2011 (Level 2 approved by the Country Director): (i) the Closing Date of the AF
       was extended by 18 months to compensate for delayed effectiveness and permit successful
       completion of project activities; (ii) SDR 37,500 and SDR 232,500 was reallocated to
       “Consultants, training, audits? and “Operating Costs,? respectively, to accommodate a new
       strategy for managing the project’s vehicle fleet (with a decrease in the “Materials, vehicles,
       equipment? category); (iii) the threshold level for prior review in NCB was restored to USD
       100,000, reflecting improved procurement capacity; (iv) outcome indicators were revised to
       improve measurement of PDO.
•      June 30, 2011 (Level 2 approved by the Regional Vice President): (i) the Closing date of the
       OP was extended by 18 months, resulting in a cumulative extension of five and half years, to
       avoid loss of unspent IDA funds due to the disbursement suspension in effect under OP/BP
       7.30. The closing date of the OP was made to coincide with the AF closing date; (ii) SDR
       392,610 was reallocated to “Grants?, and SDR 71,440 to “Equipment, vehicles and materials?
       (with a decrease in all other categories) to cover additional project management costs to
       maintain core functions of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) during the suspension of
       disbursement.
•      November 27, 2012 (Level 2 approved by the Country Director): (i) US$ 6.5. million was
       cancelled so as to focus efforts on sustainability of ongoing subprojects; and (ii) project
       targets were adjusted by reducing the targeted number of beneficiary from 1,060,000 to
       1,043,650.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Soundness of the background analysis: The analytical basis and justification for the
OP rested on the documented lessons from several previous operations in the rural sector across
the country and elsewhere since the early nineties. The OP project was the direct outcome of its
precursor operations, the main lessons of which had been incorporated in the government rural
strategy and its action plan (PADR), and included: (a) the need to adopt an integrated sectoral
focus to address rural growth and development nationwide; (b) the effectiveness of
decentralization in reducing bureaucracy and reinforcing accountability; (c) the importance of
using a demand-driven approach and encouraging beneficiary participation at all stages of the
investment cycle for building ownership and ensuring sustainability; (d) the importance of
building partnerships with all sector stakeholders and in particular the private sector for efficient
provision of technical services; and (e) the need to link research with on the ground extension
services and community investments. Lessons were also taken from a similar program financed
by the Bank in Mexico 5 showing that successful rural investment programs need to promote a
regional approach. The considerable amount of background analysis and consultation carried out
during the rural strategy formulation provided a solid justification for Bank support for the PADR.
The project was the first operation to support the PADR and was viewed as a vehicle for
maintaining momentum in the participatory implementation of the country’s rural development
policy. As such, it was seen as an instrument for intensifying economic activity within the viable

small farm sector, a growth enhancer for the non-farm sector, and a safety net for poor rural
families in isolated areas with natural resource limitations.

2.1.2 Assessment of project design: Overall, the project design was relatively simple and
well understood by the counterpart team. The level of complexity was no greater than that of
similar community-driven development (CCD) operations supported by the Bank in the Region
and elsewhere. It had a few significant shortcomings, including the (i) inadequate composition of
teams staffing the national and provincial level implementation units, which did not reflect the
orientation and scope of activities, causing bottlenecks for implementation; 6 (ii) fragmentation of
activities among several components and subcomponents: separation of farmer organizations’
capacity building and training from the related investments, increasing the project’s transaction
costs, and separation of research activities and associated research outreach and technology
transfer, isolating research activities from on-farm reality; (iii) processing of subprojects on an
individual basis, forgoing economies of scale; and (iv) wide range of activities, impeding a
focused effort. In addition, the initial absence of an integrated monitoring and evaluation system
hampered proper coordination, team work and information management. Most of these
shortcomings were proactively corrected early on, primarily as part the 2002 overall portfolio
restructuring described above, resulting in improved development effectiveness and accelerated
implementation. The AF design overestimated the capacity of farmer organizations to mobilize
cash contributions for matching grants, which proved a significant obstacle to smooth
implementation and completion of activities, as less than half of producer organizations were able
to fully contribute as stipulated at subproject design stage. It needs to be recognized, however,
that the capacity of farmer organizations to mobilize cash contributions was adversely affected by
the prolonged political crisis that broke out just before the AF became effective.

2.1.3 Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Indicators: Project objectives under the
OP and AF were quite ambitious and not always directly attributable to project supported
intervention and in some cases likely to be influenced by factors far beyond the control of the
project. It was indeed unrealistic to expect that the project by itself would increase income and
reduce poverty in rural areas 7 . However, objectives were reasonable given conditions on the
ground in rural Madagascar, were aligned with country and sector strategies, and remained
broadly consistent with the Borrower’s rural priorities until final project closing. The higher-level
development objective – not expected to be measured within the life of the project – sought to
reduce poverty by alleviating wide-ranging constraints, including agriculture. The single Key
Indicator, however, did not fully capture the scope or meaning of the PDO, and was not
accompanied by Intermediate Results Indicators, reflecting the absence of a formal “Logframe?
structure at the time the project was prepared. More precise measurement was needed to gauge
the actual increase in income and reduction in poverty, which are not easily measured and imply a

  Despite the focus of PSDR to increase revenues of producer organizations, the team initially did not have commercial
and financial expertise. Despite the large budget allocation for productive infrastructure projects, the team initially did
not have civil engineering expertise. Despite the clear need for proper compliance with agreed environmental
safeguards in view of Madagascar’s unique environment, the team initially did not have dedicated environmental
expertise. The concentration of strategic, administrative and operational coordination functions in the hands of a single
project director was incompatible with the vast magnitude of project activities.

  The project was designed in 1999-2000 when all projects followed the Logical Framework with inputs (costs) and
output and impact indicators. There was no requirement that PDO impact indicators be attributable to the project. As
such, the PDO and the absence of intermediate indicators were consistent with the design standards of Bank projects at
the time.




                                                            9
well-formulated and executed M&E plan. Some targets established for the OP were overly
ambitious, representing an unrealistic benchmark to adequately measure performance, and they
were not always in line with capacity on the ground. Revised and additional performance
indicators were subsequently included, and targets were reduced to levels that the project could
realistically achieve. However, the opportunity to focus the PDO and make it more measurable
was never taken up 8.

2.1.4 Integration/Decentralization: Integration of the project into programs and policies
being implemented at the local level proved to be more complex than anticipated. During the
design stage, it was imagined that the Regional Rural Development Working Groups (GTDRs)
would serve as the primary clearing houses for identifying regional priority investments, ensuring
regional participation and inter-sectoral coordination, and eventually approving subproject
proposals. In practice, the GTDRs did not have enough capacity to carry out these functions, and
their role in the subproject cycle was too loosely defined. Because the legal status of the GTDRs
was not formally recognized until 2004, for quite some time the project operated in an
institutional vacuum at the regional level. Later, questions emerged about the sustainability of the
GTDRs, as the Government’s commitment to continue financing them was weak. During the AF
phase, the role originally assigned to the GTDRs was played by the newly created Regional
Executive Directorates (DER) of the Ministry of Agriculture. In retrospect, it is clear that the
GTDRs’ capacity to perform the integration function at local level was significantly
overestimated, resulting in overly ambitious targets. It should be recognized, however, that at the
time of project design Madagascar’s institutions were in a constant flux, making it difficult to
support emerging decentralization efforts. Under these circumstances, it was nearly impossible
for an original design to predict accurately which institution would remain in place. The only
sensible approach was to keep the project design flexible, and build on a strong Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) as the main tool to deliver an ambitious program at the local level in a
difficult environment.

2.1.5 Communally versus individually managed subprojects: The design requirement that
subprojects be implemented by producer groups comprising no less than 10 individuals from
different households proved to be a constraint, as such groups did not always exist in areas being
targeted by the project. Even when such groups did exist (or in cases where they were formed for
the purpose of implementing a subproject), the lack of a commitment to collaborative work often
undermined their effectiveness, leading to the abandonment of many subprojects. Mainly for this
reason, the eligibility criteria for subprojects were gradually relaxed, and over time the project
supported increasing numbers of subprojects that were implemented by more natural-sized
producer groups dominated by members of the same household, or producer groups comprising
fewer than 10 members.

2.1.6 Adequacy of Government’s commitment: The project was formulated within the policy
and institutional framework of the PADR. The Government was fully-committed to the project
methodology, objectives and activities under both stages, and it collaborated closely with the
Bank to improve key design elements and resolve problems at each stage. This commitment
flowed through into the implementation phase, as reflected for example in the swift response to
the 2004 rice crisis that temporarily derailed the project (see section 2.2), in the Government’s

  Even though the PDO was not changed, there were considerable attempts to make it more measurable. The PSDR
team tried to measure the project impact both inside and outside beneficiary areas, which was the standard at the time.




                                                         10
strong support for the Additional Financing, and in its decision to allocate public funds during the
disbursement freeze period (2009-10) to allow project staff to continue working.

2.1.7 Risk assessment: Risks were correctly projected by the PAD based on previous
experiences with similar projects, but there were omissions both in the types of risks that were
identified and in the planned risk minimization measures. For example, after identifying the risk
associated with political interference in the selection of subprojects, the PAD might have called
for the establishment early on of a strong monitoring and evaluation system 9. Also, the pervasive
lack of adequate technical assistance in rural areas should have been recognized, and a mitigation
framework designed and implemented earlier on, especially in light of the project’s productive
goals and consequent need for sustained, specialized support. The risk analysis obviously could
not have predicted the political crises of 2001 and 2009, which affected the entire Bank portfolio
in Madagascar, and magnified the risks already identified at appraisal. The political crises were in
the end the major implementation bottlenecks.

2.2 Implementation

Box 2.2.1: Developments in the project’s external environment
    The external environment in which the project operated was characterized by significant developments
    that affected its performance and required extensive flexibility and continuous adjustments. Madagascar
    is characterized by a state of increasing fragility, with chronic political instability and vulnerability to
    economic and natural shocks as the main external risks.




    Over the twelve years of project implementation, the country experienced five years of political crisis on
    two occasions, the most recent of which has been ongoing since 2009 with an unconstitutional regime
    change. After having been one of the most rapidly growing African economies, Madagascar plunged into
    a deep political crisis at the beginning of 2002, which led to a freezing of Madagascar's assets abroad, a
    suspension of foreign exchange trading and a closure of the treasury bond market for several months.
    Economic activity fell sharply, poverty increased, and revenue losses of the public sector were immense.
    Farm produce prices, especially in isolated areas of the country, were cut in half, causing an
    unprecedented drop in rural incomes and putting future production at risk. Following the resolution of
    the 2002 crisis, the country experienced positive developments in social, economic and governance
    indicators until early 2009 when the second, ongoing political crisis erupted, wiping out years of
    achievements, setting the development clock back, and leading to a decline in economic growth. The


9
 The Bank team, however, feels that no M&E system would have survived the political pressure coming from the top,
where the President himself had a personal interest in agriculture policy and frequently made personal policy changes.




                                                         11
 prolonged and severe political crisis has caused major economic and social impacts that have been
 exacerbated by a series of external shocks and a withdrawal of most external funding -- the economy has
 stalled, poverty has sharply increased, the ability to deal with exogenous shocks is severely curtailed,
 and infrastructure has deteriorated.

 Madagascar is among the countries with the highest risk level of natural disasters, such as droughts,
 cyclones, locust plagues, and floods, which regularly undermine growth and poverty reduction.
 Moreover, in the last three years, the rise of rice prices has created the context for an impending food
 crisis. Each year, an average of three to four cyclones make landfall on parts of Madagascar causing on
 average damage of US$50 million per cyclone. During the life of the project, the country suffered from
 several major cyclones, some of them the most violent cyclones in Madagascar in the last 40 years
 (Gafilo in 2004). In 2008, three consecutive cyclones affected 84 percent of the national territory,
 causing economic losses equivalent to 4 percent of GDP. Damages from the 2012 cyclone season have
 been estimated to be in the same range. In 2010, about 60 percent of extremely poor households suffered
 a catastrophic event or a combination of catastrophic events (e.g. cyclones, floods, droughts, locust
 infestations, plant diseases) that adversely affected their economic well-being. As such, these risks are an
 integral risk to the country's development and the Bank's program.

 Extended political crisis and natural disasters have increased the vulnerability of large segments of the
 population. The rural population, whose income is highly dependent on agriculture, has been especially
 affected by the natural and man-made crises, as a weakening demand for food (associated with the
 overall decline of the economy) has been compounded by a series of agricultural supply disruptions
 caused by natural disasters. As a result of these combined shocks, many rural households have depleted
 their assets and lost their main source of income, leading to sharp declines in income and welfare in rural
 areas.

2.2.2 The 2002 and particularly the 2009 political crises greatly disrupted project
implementation and had a pronounced social and economic impact especially in rural areas. The
launch of the project was complicated by the political climate leading up to the presidential
elections of December 2001 and the subsequent period of conflict and uncertainty in the country
that paralyzed the project for six months (until July 2002). The ensuing lack of clarity regarding
decision-making authority between and within Government agencies prolonged the period
required to achieve full implementation, particularly for activities in which the Ministry of
Agriculture was supposed to play a leadership role (i.e., the competitive grant scheme for applied
research, capacity building, and policy development). However, after the new Government
assumed power in July 2002, the enabling conditions for effective implementation were restored
rather swiftly. As a result, the project got back on track rather quickly, greatly expanded its
presence and impact in the field, and performed well until the closing of the OP, with the
exception of the difficulties of 2004 and 2005 (see section 2.2.3).

2.2.3 The outbreak in late 2008 of civil disturbances leading in early 2009 to the change in
government and the subsequent triggering of OP/BP 7.30 came at an unfortunate time, with the
OP about to close and the AF not yet effective. Political paralysis, coupled with the severe fiscal
constraints experienced by the Government following the suspension of most development
assistance, resulted in a major disruption of the project, as funds were not available to cover
project management costs during the 18-month disbursement freeze. The capacity of the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) eroded rapidly because of staff defections, affecting the capacity of
the Borrower to maintain effective control over project records, management systems, and
physical assets, both at the central and regional level, and posing a fiduciary and reputational risk
for the Bank. In May 2010, the Bank’s senior management granted exceptional authorization for
the AF to be declared effective, and from that point on activities under Component 1 resumed
swiftly with the recruitment of new staff, payment of outstanding invoices, and identification and
evaluation of new subprojects. Activities under Component 2 and 3 continued to suffer delays as


                                                     12
direct transfer of funds to government agencies was prohibited, even after the project was granted
an exemption to the disbursement freeze.

2.2.4 Political interference was a major risk to the project between 2004 and 2005.
Following the 2004 rice crisis, the project fell victim of its own visibility, as the regime in power
placed intense political pressure on the project to finance a rice intensification campaign and
support cyclone repair works outside of the approved work plan. This pressure resulted in
significant over-commitment of credit proceeds and loss of financial and monitoring control by
the project team. 10 Strong remedial measures were taken at that time, resulting in a declaration of
misprocurement and ineligible expenditures, major cancellations of subprojects, hiring of a
fiduciary oversight company, launching of financial and procurement audits, strengthening of the
operational manual, and commissioning a review by Madagascar’s anticorruption committee.
Thanks to these remedial measures, the political interference stopped, and the project regained its
institutional reputation as well as its perceived integrity.

2.2.5 Frequent turnover in MAEP and PIU personnel affected the performance of the
project. In addition to the disruptions caused by the political crises, the project had to absorb
changes in the management team in mid-2003 (following the 2002 restructuring) and in 2005 (as
a result of the declaration of misprocurement). These changes eventually served to strengthen
implementation capacity, but they were disruptive in the short run because newly hired staff had
to climb a steep learning curve. Similarly, resignations of several mid-level staff in 2007-08
precipitated by the looming closure of the project created further disruptions, although these did
not affect the top management of the PIU. The fact that both the Minister of Agriculture and the
president of the project Steering Committee changed frequently throughout the life of the project
made it difficult to establish an effective interface between the project and its host Ministry, a
problem which persisted until the end.

2.2.6 The uninterrupted political support to PSDR was a positive factor. Despite the
political crises and the strong political pressure to which it was subjected at various times during
its implementation, the project remained an important if not the most important element of the
country’s rural development agenda during both the OP and AF phase. The successive
governments showed a consistent commitment to rural development and to protecting and
supporting the project as a major instrument for the implementation of their rural development
policy and for improving productive assets of poor rural households.

2.2.7 Institutional capacity to appraise and support productive investments was uneven:
Weak institutional capacity of producer organizations and lack of qualified and experienced
service providers in sufficient numbers was another reality that the project had to deal with since
its launch. The institutional assessment at the time noted that excessive centralization of decision-
making was undermining the capacity of communities and local governments to manage their
own affairs, which the PAD recognized was key for the success of the project. To mitigate the
risks associated with the limited institutional capacity of local entities and groups, the project
called for the participation of collaborating institutions and private strategic partners, through the
adoption of a wholesale approach to subproject implementation, which replaced the demand-
driven approach for capacity building that was followed since the project launch. Despite the


10
  The project engaged in two major operations outside the approved Annual Work Plan: a rice intensification
campaign and repairs to cyclone-damaged infrastructure, for a total of 4,200 subprojects. Project funds were over-
committed by nearly SDR 23 million.




                                                       13
uneven quality of the technical assistance, this approach proved to be successful, as reflected in
an increased rate of disbursement. That said, the ability of strategic partners to rapidly develop
the capacity to effectively manage subproject activities may have been overestimated. Farmers
associations continued to suffer from important institutional weaknesses, which impaired their
capacity to make the strategic business choices needed to maximize profits and react to shocks.
The challenges of giving farmers long-term support links to markets, financial institutions and
expert advice persisted throughout the life of the project, although they were partially addressed
under the AF by the creation of “technical pools,? which ensured quality at entry and technical
support of subprojects after their approval.

2.2.8 Strategic reorientations helped focus the project and increase impact and visibility
but created delays. Initially, the project did not have a consistent strategy to prioritize among
subprojects. As a CDD project, it attempted to respond to the needs of beneficiary communities,
which it did by supporting any and all proposals that were in conformity with the very broad
eligibility criteria. 11 Starting in 2005, after evidence had emerged that many subprojects were
closing as soon as project financing had run out, eligibility criteria for subprojects were tightened
and screening procedures were introduced in an effort to improve the likelihood that subprojects
would be sustainable. These changes led to a more strategic and market-oriented approach. The
project’s strategic direction was further adjusted in 2011 following the resumption in
disbursements and the ensuing portfolio restructuring, which was designed to concentrate IDA
resources on high pay-off activities, achieve critical mass, re-orient activities geographically and
exploit synergies with other Bank operations. The changes introduced at that time improved the
quality of many subprojects but also slowed the pace of implementation and impaired the
project’s ability to disburse. In addition, the introduction under the AF of a requirement that some
subproject beneficiaries pay part of their contribution in cash (previously they had been allowed
to pay their contributions entirely in kind) proved to be an obstacle to subproject implementation.

2.2.9 PSDR became a critical instrument for rapid response to climate shocks. Project
investments were negatively impacted by several major cyclones that strongly hit Madagascar
especially in 2004 and 2005. Several subprojects were wiped out and had to be rebuilt, and
selected beneficiaries were exceptionally allowed to receive a second grant. From its early stages,
the project helped mobilize resources for damaged agriculture infrastructure during many of the
cyclone seasons, and played a key role in containing the drought in the south.

2.2.10 Mid-term Review contributed to improved performance quality. A timely Mid-term
Review (MTR) with good follow-up was influential in correcting and strengthening the
implementation trajectory of the OP. The MTR Action Plan recommended: (i) launching a
systematic and dedicated capacity building effort for producer organizations; (ii) improving the
realism of subproject design; (iii) ensuring greater selectivity of proposals; (iv) establishing closer
linkages between subprojects and the research programs; (v) improving access to markets and
increase the effectiveness of slash-and-burn control measures by pursuing closer coordination
with other programs and projects; and (vi) further accelerating project implementation by
strengthening the national and regional project teams. The Bank team worked with PSDR to
implement the plan, and most recommendations were implemented with positive effects.


11
   According to the PAD, virtually any agricultural production and off-farm activities were in principle eligible for
financing, including but not limited to the establishment of seed and plant nurseries, improvement in existing farming
systems, diversification of production systems and a wide range of crops, the development of minor stockbreeding,
aquaculture, apiculture, home garden production, handicrafts, various types of woods and iron work, etc.

2.2.11 A “Quality of Supervision Assessment? review conducted by the QAG in 2004 rated
overall project supervision as “satisfactory.?

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Design: The M&E system was designed to reflect the comprehensive scope of PSDR and
adopt an M&E approach that would allow for full participation of beneficiary rural communities
through the establishment of rural management committees. Additional elements of the system
were an internal monitoring conducted by M&E staff at both the central and local level, and
periodic supervision and evaluation of project performance and impacts. The overall design of the
M&E system had some weaknesses, as it was primarily focused on the measurement of inputs
and outputs, rather than results and impacts. The Results Framework reflected the old-style
project Logframe mentality and lacked intermediate outcome indicators that would have allowed
project performance to be tracked during the early years of implementation.

2.3.2 Implementation and utilization: Overall, the performance of the M&E system was
adequate but not exceptional. During the first year of project implementation, the system suffered
from considerable deficiencies, and as a result it did not permit an adequate assessment of project
performance. These shortcomings were subsequently rectified, and the M&E system was
strengthened through integration with the overall project Management Information System (MIS).
Following these improvements, the project M&E unit was able to collect and report on
performance indicators. However, data collection and reporting procedures were often informal
and ad hoc, and performance indicators remained heavily focused on inputs and outputs.
Processing and timely dissemination of M&E data was not supported by a well-defined and
transparent system, thus limiting the usefulness of the data and making it difficult to
communicate the achievements of the project to larger audiences. In order to enhance M&E
capacity to measure project performance, and considering the difficulties of assessing the
cumulative impact of a myriad of small-scale subprojects, the project financed periodic one-off
impact assessment studies to measure progress achieved against performance indicators. 12 These
helped adjust the design and implementation of subsequent support to productive investments,
including the AF. Additional efforts were made to strengthen the system under the AF through
the development of an excel-based tool that allowed the use of M&E data for decision-making.

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards/Environment: The project was a Category B with an Environmental
Management Plan and a Pest Management Plan. Implementation arrangements for mitigation
measures were specified in MOUs negotiated between PSDR regional offices and subproject
beneficiaries. Implementation of mitigation measures was done by the beneficiaries themselves,
with the support of local service providers. PSDR technical staff were responsible for monitoring
implementation and for ensuring that no adverse environmental impacts were occurring.
Activities carried out to ensure compliance with applicable environmental safeguards policies
were in general satisfactory, and environmental themes were incorporated in training courses.
Bank supervision mission identified minor implementation issues of some mitigation measures,



12
   The impact assessment studies introduced IRR calculations as a common denominator for all subprojects, thereby
allowing measurement and comparison of impact of subprojects across the portfolio.




                                                        15
which were promptly corrected. On the whole, mitigation measures associated with individual
subprojects were implemented reasonably well by subproject beneficiaries.

2.4.2 Although the implementation of environmental safeguards policies was generally
satisfactory throughout the life of the project, implementation performance declined following the
disbursement freeze instituted in March 2009, as the support being provided by local service
providers to assist beneficiaries in the implementation of mitigation measures stopped. Similarly,
monitoring by PSDR technical staff of the rate of adoption of mitigation measures and assessment
of the environmental impacts of project-financed activities ceased. Environmental monitoring and
support activities were resumed and strengthened under the AF through the establishment of
technical pools.

2.4.3 During project preparation, two safeguards policies were triggered: OP/BP 4.01
(Environmental Assessment) and OP 4.09 (Pest Management). During implementation, questions
about the applicability of OP 4.37 (Safety of Dams) were raised with regard to a number of
proposals relating to the rehabilitation or development of small-scale irrigation schemes.
Considering that safety risks associated with irrigation systems being financed under the Project
were minimal and that the affected subprojects were at an advanced stage of design or
implementation and could not be stopped without risking timely achievement of the PDO, the
policy was not triggered. However, as a precautionary measure and to make sure that the spirit of
the policy was respected, PSDR was asked to prepare guidelines for the management of small
dams and applied these guidelines systematically to all irrigation schemes financed by the project.

2.4.4 Procurement: The project established early on a satisfactory system to carry out
procurement processes. However, as the procurement load became heavy due to the number,
diversity, type and technical complexity of the subprojects, the project experienced delays
requiring continuous need for specialist consultants to ensure compliance with procurement
procedures.

2.4.5 In view of the problem faced by the project in 2005 as a result of the financing of
cyclones repairs and the rice intensification campaign outside of the approved work plan (see
section 2.2.3), the Bank launched an independent procurement audit which revealed significant
irregularities with mini-tractors procured under direct contracts by the PIU, as well as suspicion
of fraudulent pricing. The audit also found potential problems with other three contracts, namely
cyclone repair works, procurement of fertilizers, and agri-business contract with a local
consulting firm. After a thorough internal review, the Bank officially declared misprocurement in
June 2006 on the purchase of 750 mini-tractors for a total commitment of US$1.6 million,
requested reimbursement of US$ 435,024 and canceled US$ 718,327 in credit proceeds.

2.4.6 Following the extensive corrective measures taken in 2005, the procurement function
improved significantly and remained overall satisfactory throughout the OP, with a well-
established and functioning procurement unit. During the 2009 political crisis, procurement staff
were placed on unpaid leave and the procurement function lapsed. The AF made significant
efforts to rebuild procurement capacity, including the hiring of a Fiduciary Firm responsible for
supervising all procurement processes under the project. However, minor weaknesses in the
procurement system mostly due low capacity remained which delayed implementation of the AF.

2.4.7 Financial Management: The financial management aspects of the project were handled
by project staff directly contracted by the PIU, assisted by fiduciary agents (accounting firms)
that were contracted over specific periods of the project to provide support and capacity building.



                                                16
Overall, the project had appropriately qualified and experienced personnel in charge of financial
management. The internal controls were spelt out in a Procedures Manual, amendments to which
were made on a periodic basis to take into account changes in the project’s operations. The
project had adequate financial management arrangements over the course of the implementation
period. In most cases, the quarterly financial reports and annual audit reports were submitted to
the Bank on a timely basis, and recommendations made subsequent to implementation support
missions were appropriately implemented. The audit report for the year ending on 31 December
2010 (IDA Credit 4525 MAG) was submitted four months past the due date, owing to late
commencement of the procurement process for external audit services.

2.4.8 At the time of preparation of the ICR, the project had not yet submitted the
documentation needed to determine the outstanding balances in the Designated Accounts. The
amount that needs to be accounted for USD 7.1 million and the project team is working to ensure
the submission of the related statements of expenditure before the end of the grace period (30
June 2013). The financial management of the project was rated as moderately satisfactory at the
project closing date.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Transition arrangements to regular operations: An agreement signed between the
Ministry of Agriculture and PSDR in December 2012 establishes the transitional arrangements
for efficient support, supervision and monitoring after project closure. Such arrangements include
technical support on the part of the Ministry for the execution/completion of subprojects, the
formal reception by the Ministry of infrastructure subprojects, and the provision of technical and
socio-organizational assistance to water user organizations for management and maintenance of
infrastructures after the project closure. The regions need to continue investing in social and
institutional capital during the transition period and after. There are potential transitional risks
from technical and organizational weaknesses in monitoring and vigilance, but not so much from
the interruption of programs due to changing political and/or economic priority.

2.5.2 While PSDR launched an important process, critical shortcomings persist in rural
Madagascar, affecting the livelihoods and competitive conditions of small producers. These have
become even more critical as a result of the prolonged and severe political crisis, which has
caused major economic and social impacts that have been exacerbated by a series of external
shocks, and a withdrawal of most external funding. These concomitant events have caused a
dramatic increase in the incidence of poverty, especially among the most vulnerable population,
with a reduction of social protection safety nets, income-earning opportunities, and maintenance
of lifeline infrastructure. The short-term Bank response has been the launch of the Emergency
Infrastructure Preservation and Vulnerability Reduction project, which among other things is
supporting: (i) distribution of improved seed, fertilizer, tools and associated technical assistance
to enable rapid increases in production of food staples, mainly rice but also other crops; and (ii)
rehabilitation and maintenance of small-scale agricultural infrastructure, primarily micro-
irrigation systems. The initial set of subprojects to be financed consist of subprojects pre-selected
for financing under PSDR, for which technical design studies have already been prepared.

2.5.3 The longer-term Bank response to the remaining rural development challenges of
Madagascar has been to shift strategic approach and focus on linking smallholders into
commercial value chains and finding ways to support small and medium enterprises to identify
and implement profitable commercial agriculture opportunities with some punctual public
support. For this purpose, a new operation is being prepared.



                                                 17
2.5.4 On the Government side, efforts are ongoing to build on the positive experiences of
PSDR in setting up a decentralized funding mechanism for demand driven interventions and the
provision of still much needed technical support and assistance. Specifically, the Government has
designed and is putting in place rural development funds which will function as basket funds for
rural development subprojects at the regional level. Additionally, Agriculture Support Centers
(CSA) are being established and strengthened to provide technical assistance, taking advantage of
capacity building efforts developed under PSDR. Further, CSA are using procedures and
processes developed and tested under PSDR for the identification, selection and financing of
subproject proposals (list of activities eligible for support, level of subsidy, repayment periods,
etc.).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: High overall relevance
3.1.1 The development objective of PSDR was highly relevant when the project was prepared,
and it remains highly relevant today, more than a decade later. Promoting the development of
revenue-increasing activities in rural areas is fundamental for the future growth and poverty
reduction in the country. The objective also remain broadly consistent with the 2007-11 Country
Partnership Strategy and the 2012 Interim Strategy Note, explicitly via the challenge of reducing
vulnerability and improving resilience in addressing the most urgent problems posed by the crisis,
including a dramatic rise in poverty levels. The follow-on Emergency Infrastructure Preservation
and Vulnerability Reduction operation focuses on preserving key lifeline infrastructure and
reducing household vulnerability, for which preservation of productive capacity in agriculture is
key. The types of investments, although smaller in scope, remain similar to PSDR with a focus on
reducing household vulnerability in crisis-affected areas through investments designed to boost
agricultural production, safeguarding food security, and providing short-term employment
opportunities. PSDR was one of the GOM’s core investment instruments for putting the
government’s investment strategy into operation and the new project continues to build on its
strengths, core objectives and vision.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 Achievement of the PDO was substantial and is rated Moderately Satisfactory overall,
based on the result of independent studies which show the many important achievements of the
project under both phases (OP and AF). Overall, as shown by the evaluation studies and the
impressive degree of penetration in the rural areas, PSDR had a positive impact on rural
development in Madagascar. The project benefitted more than 10 percent of rural population and
was active in more than 70 percent of rural communes, half of which located in remote areas,
more than doubling the appraisal target of beneficiary groups. The project had a positive impact
on income and quality of life, production, and farmers’ organizational skills and savings.

3.2.2 As a national project that operated for more than a decade throughout the entire country
and financed thousands of subprojects, many of which were located in extremely remote
locations, PSDR had a huge footprint. Because PSDR was the centerpiece of the Government's
rural development strategy for so many years, it received a great deal of publicity, to the point
that it would be fair to say that there are very few people in Madagascar who have not heard
about PSDR. The project was one of the few programs available to the government that could be
used to channel resources to rural communities throughout the country. Another consequence of



                                                18
having had such an extensive reach is that PSDR ended up being the de facto national agricultural
extension service for quite some time and an important interface between farmers, agribusiness,
and sector institutions.

3.2.3 The project’s impact, however, did not extend beyond the sum of its achievements. As a
national program with a strong demand-driven approach that directly responded to the
communities’ needs, PSDR became eventually involved in a wide range of activities. Further, as
a result of its national presence, the project was pulled in different directions to address the
challenges arising from the external shocks, rather than becoming an instrument for long-term
development assistance. Despite the strategic reorientations carried out during implementation,
aimed at strengthening its strategic focus and embracing a market-oriented approach, the project
and the thousands of subprojects it financed did not reach a critical mass nor had a strong
catalytic effect on the rural space, with added sustainability concerns.

3.2.4     Indicator 1: Average revenue increase among beneficiaries (30%).

Achieved: Subproject impact evaluations 13 carried out during 2012 show that, as a result of
project interventions:
• Average beneficiaries’ revenues have increased by 38 percent, compared to stagnation in
    revenues for non-beneficiaries for the same time;
• More than 80% of beneficiaries report an increase in income of more than 30%, with
    beneficiaries engaging in agriculture activities registering a higher increase, followed by
    those engaging in productive infrastructure (see Table 3.2.3.1);
• Average revenue per beneficiary per subsector has increased by about 84%, a positive trend
    that was maintained until the end of the project;
• Increase in income was primarily supported by increase in production, particularly for
    households with access to irrigated land and improved technologies for rice, corn and peanut
    production. The vast majority (88 percent) of beneficiaries report an increase in production
    compared to the situation before the project;
• Overall, more than 80 percent of beneficiaries report an improvement in their livelihoods 14,
    and 92 percent consider that subprojects have responded to their priority needs;
• Higher scale of production and social cohesion facilitated the farmer organizations link to
    institutions of micro-finance. The majority of producer organizations are now members of
    financing institutions, although they use them mostly for saving purposes, and 6,467 saving
    schemes have been established.

3.2.5 Indicator 2: Infrastructure functioning one year after completion and mechanism in
place to finance operations and maintenance (85%).

Partially Achieved: Ninety percent of financed infrastructure is still functional one year after
completion, is in very good condition, and has been built according to specifications. However,
the arrangements for operation, management and maintenance remain unclear and not well
understood by most beneficiaries, particularly regarding subdivision of responsibilities,
determination of O&M costs, and mode of payment and collection of maintenance fees, which are
often insufficient. That said, the following elements point to a positive trend: (i) legally binding
community agreements (DINA) describing roles and responsibilities for O&M activities are in
place for the majority of producer organizations; (ii) Management Committees have been formed
for each infrastructure site, composed of representatives of beneficiaries and users associations;
(iii) basic training on O&M has been provided and organizations have been restructured and their
governance bodies put in place; and (iv) saving funds have been created by some organizations to
cover ordinary maintenance.

3.2.6    Indicator 3: Subprojects functioning one year after completion (85%).

Partially Achieved: Ninety percent of beneficiaries under the AF are using the agricultural
techniques and technology acquired under the project one year after completion of subprojects, 15
while 80 percent of subprojects financed under the OP are still operational one year after
completion 16. The majority (90 percent) of beneficiaries are willing to continue their subproject
after project closing, although only 72 percent report having the material means and 47 percent
the financial resources to do so. End-of-project impact evaluation studies show that 66 percent of
subprojects have a satisfactory IRR (21%) compared to 58 percent in 2008. These figures are
indicative of the increased awareness of the need for farms modernization on the part of
producers, who were for a long time weakened by the lack of access to training and technical
assistance.

3.2.7 Indicator 4: Subprojects having satisfactorily developed and implemented an
Environmental Action Plan (70%).

Achieved: Field assessments conducted in December 2012 as part of the project final evaluation
estimate that 75 percent of subprojects have adopted an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) during
implementation, while 87% of beneficiaries states that they comply with such Plan. The positive
result was consolidated during the AF, through the improved supervision carried out by the
“technical pools?. The final subproject impact evaluation reports that 91 percent of producer

organizations apply the environmental measures recommended by the EAP, with reforestation
being the measure adopted by most of beneficiaries. The project went beyond a narrow approach
covering only the screening of subprojects and the specification of mitigation measures to one
that actively promoted sound environmental management by: (i) developing alternative
agricultural practices to slash-and-burn production systems; (ii) launching efforts to include
environmental considerations into commune development plans; (iii) exploring revenue-
generating potential of non-timber forest products; and (iv) facilitating forest-management
transfer contracts with communes. Further, links between PSDR and the Third Environmental
project helped to a large extent maintain population support for the national park system and
prevent continuing encroachment.

3.2.8    Indicator 5: Direct project beneficiaries (1,060,000), of which female (29%).

Achieved: The project benefitted a total of 1,190,295 beneficiaries, 34 percent of those being
women. Through strong participation in the elaboration and implementation of subprojects, and
their gradual integration in production activities, women are now enjoying an increased share of
responsibility within the producer organizations, and play an important role in the maintenance of
activities.

3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1 The evaluation of PSDR efficiency was made difficult by the lack of a complete set of
quantitative data. An economic and financial analysis reviewed 4 types of productive subprojects
(rice, beef, dairy, and poultry) collectively representing about 64% of the most common
subprojects financed by end-2012. The productive investment subprojects (Component 1) plus
associated project management expenses represented about 95 percent of the overall project cost,
thus, the analysis of the efficiency of productive investments gives an adequate assessment of the
overall project efficiency. The methodology and results are detailed in Annex 3. Main results are
as follows:

3.3.2 Overall project’s efficiency: Using cash flows from four types of subprojects (rice, beef,
dairy and poultry), financial and economic indicators were calculated to evaluate the overall
project profitability. Both financial and economic NPV were positive. Financial and economic
IRR were greater than the opportunity cost of capital (OCC) of 12 percent, at 38% and 26%
respectively.

3.3.3 IRRs of subprojects: The efficiency analysis on the beef, dairy, rice and poultry
subprojects used financial and economic indicators such as net present value (NPV) and internal
rate of return (IRR), with conservative key assumptions. IRRs ranged from highs of 38% and
29% for dairy and rice respectively, and lows of 11% for beef. NPVs were high and positive,
except for the beef model. Findings suggest that financial returns are robust for all subproject
types except beef, even under conservative assumptions.

3.3.4    The analysis for the beef model was carried out under both a “before financing? and
“after financing? scenario 17. The beef model subproject “before financing? was not financially
viable given that the IRR was less than the OCC, and the NPV was negative. This was also true in


17
  The analysis under a “before financing? and “after financing? scenario was applied only to the beef model because,
based on data available, the beef model was the only subproject that required loan repayment. For the other subprojects,
which were financed by grants, the “before financing? and “after financing? scenario did not apply.




                                                          21
the “after financing scenario, with some improvement in the indicators. With a change in the
discount rate from 12% to 11%, which is realistic considering the limited opportunities in the
project area, the NPV after financing was positive and suggested an attractive subproject 18. With
a discount rate of 10 percent, the NPV before and after financing was positive.

3.3.5 For the dairy model, the subproject was financially viable (IRR of 38% and positive
NPV) but in terms of economic efficiency (labor market adjustment) the project was not attractive
with a negative economic NPV and an ERR less than the OCC. For the rice model, conservative
assumptions on yield were considered, and the financial and economic efficiency indicators
showed profitable rice subprojects, with an IRR of 29% and positive NPV.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1 The overall outcome rating of Moderately Satisfactory is based on: (a) original and
continuing high relevance of project objectives and design to the needs of the poorest rural
population in Madagascar; (b) an overall moderately satisfactory outcome for PDO achievement,
tempered by concerns about O&M practices and sustainability of subprojects. With some
exceptions, the project was able to meet/exceed intermediate outcome targets under both the OP
and AF, although with delays and bottlenecks caused by political crises and misprocurement; and
(c) indications of economic and financial efficiency based on an analysis of a limited sample of
successful productive investments. Further, there is evaluative evidence of substantial
institutional development at the local level and in community associations. Overall, the project
provided an appreciable contribution to the improvement of agricultural development and rural
incomes in support of Madagascar’s rural development strategies.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Poverty impact: Poverty reduction in rural areas was a specific objective of the project.
However, as mentioned in section 2.1.3, there is an attribution problem, considering the difficulty
of directly linking to the project specific impacts on poverty reduction in rural areas.
Consequently, the ICR focuses its analysis on poverty reduction among beneficiaries. The results
of economic and financial analysis, beneficiary responses about wellbeing, employment and
income show the project’s actual and potential poverty impact. A 2012 beneficiaries’ survey
reports that the percentage of poor beneficiaries decreased by 33 percentage points as a result of
the project (see Graph 3.5.1.1). A high proportion of productive investments were subsistence
support which alleviates poverty. The large number of agricultural production investments,
improved irrigation infrastructure and access to microfinance services has positioned many rural
families for a higher level of productive activity; poverty reduction is now latent in the productive
assets of many poor communities. Further, poverty targeting was accurate and independent
studies confirm that the project reached its targeted poor clientele under both phases. Specifically,
PSDR was successful in reaching out to population in isolated areas, which, given the strong
correlation between poverty and isolation, is a positive sign as far as its poverty impact is
concerned.



18
   The analysis with different discount rates was done for the beef model because the NPV for this model was negative.
For other subprojects it was not applied given that their NPVs were high and positive.

Graph 3.5.1.1: Poverty trend among beneficiaries:

3.5.2 Gender: The project was serious about reaching women and made significant progress.
Women’s participation in productive subprojects exceeded the 29% target: over 34% of
productive subprojects were presented/executed by associations led by women. More than 30
percent of the members of farmer organizations supported by the project were women. More and
more women are integrated in productive activities and some of them run farms. Where they were
strongly represented (e.g., rice husking, livestock, sewing, handicrafts), the organizations had
generally higher levels of savings and income than those dominated by men. This is especially
satisfying since the PAD expected women to benefit primarily from productive subprojects.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
3.5.3 The project contributed to a re-dynamization of rural development, the re-emergence of
synergy and collaboration among actors responsible for rural services and a renewed interest in
the modernization and diversification of agriculture activities, especially in the absence of formal
agriculture extension services in Madagascar. The numerous partnerships facilitated by the
project (between farmer organizations and private enterprises, micro-credit institutions,
government, commercial banks, research organizations and other donors) show notable evolution.
However, the decision to build a strong PIU with parallel implementation structures -- which was
seen as necessary to deliver a multitude of subprojects in a difficult environment -- did not allow
the project’s integration into the regional entities, and eventually the building of a strong
decentralized institutional structure.

3.5.4 At the local level, improved organization and professionalization motivated by a sense of
empowerment and genuine appropriation of the project’s goals to curb chronic food insecurity
boosted the status and legitimacy of the farmers and producer organizations. Institutional growth
was also demonstrated by the following: increased capacity of groups benefiting from subprojects
to participate in planning and management of local development, manage and administer funds;
demonstrated efforts to form strategic alliances with the municipalities and other local
organizations for commercial purposes; expressed awareness of the importance of maintaining
their investments; increased bargaining power vis-à-vis the various partners (local authorities,
financial institutions) and new-found readiness to approach local authorities about community
needs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)



                                                        23
3.5.5 PSDR survived political and internal operational issues to become the Government’s
flagship sector investment program. It is widely-viewed as a model of a new relationship between
the national government and the private sector through a shift away from the traditional top-down
approach, all major catalysts to regional commitment to the program. At the public/private sector
level, PSDR has become the brand-name public policy instrument for support to small and
medium-sized producers.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
3.6.1 Beneficiary Surveys. A comprehensive beneficiary survey 19 was conducted in 2005 to
gauge beneficiary organizations’ attitude. Survey results showed: (i) overall 77 percent of
beneficiaries were satisfied with the project and its response to their expectations and priority
needs. The project was perceived as having improved and diversified production activities thus
contributing to reduced food insecurity; (ii) most beneficiaries reported being satisfied about the
management of funds which was found to be transparent by 73 percent of beneficiaries; (iii) most
beneficiaries believed farmers organizations had reached a greater level of maturity; (iv) women’s
participation in producer organization had increased, with more than 32 percent of members
being women; and (v) a positive trend in the establishment of links with micro finance institutions
was perceived, with 53 percent of producer organizations becoming a member. The main areas of
weakness were found to be: (i) training and the lack of customization to the specific needs of
beneficiary producers; (ii) the lack of adequate monitoring at the regional level; (iii) the lack of a
quality control mechanism for the provision of inputs; and (iv) the identification of market access.
In addition, a few Borrower studies based on beneficiary surveys were carried out during project
implementation. Findings are summarized in Annex 5.

3.6.2 Two separate rounds of stakeholder consultations were conducted to obtain feedback and
distill lessons learned. The first round of discussions involved a workshop held in July 2012 with
the key agencies and individuals with strong influence over the direction of agriculture and rural
development strategies and policies. The second round of discussions, held in November 2012,
involved a wide range of participants including representatives from 22 Producer Organizations
(one each from the 22 Regions benefitted by PSDR), the Ministries of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Livestock, the Regional Directorates for Rural Development, the Agriculture Support Centers
(CSA), the private sector, and researsch institutions (FOFIFA). Key feedback obtained include:
(i) so as to ensure homogeneity, criteria for group formation need to include the level of
education in addition to the degree of expertise and experience; (ii) regular internal meetings,
establishment of a network of partners, collaboration between the project and the line Ministry
are key for effective management and coordination; (iii) mainstreaming of environmental
considerations is essential, regardless of project scale; (iv) beneficiaries’ contribution needs to be
established based on poverty level rather than geographical location; and (v) the establishment of
a permanent monitoring system of subproject is fundamental for follow up and learning. Overall,
the beneficiaries acknowledged the important contribution made by PSDR to the improvement of
their quality of life and were generally satisfied with the support received from the project. In
particular, it was noted that the project, through the introduction of beneficiaries’ contribution,
helped promoting a change of mentality towards entrepreneurship and thus increasing ownership
of activities and investments financed.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

4.01 Sustainability of subprojects is determined by the financial viability, the maintenance of
organizational structures for implementation and the continued adoption of improved techniques,
the existence of markets and compliance with environmental action plans for sustainable
production. This rating takes into account the following: (a) the percentage of subprojects
remaining functional by 2012 is high for the AF, but lower for the OP; (b) economic analysis of
selected productive subprojects suggests varied degrees of sustainability; (c) the ability of
producer organizations to negotiate with financial partners and establish savings mechanisms has
grown, but their management capacity needs further strengthening, and their financial viability
and access to credit remain weak; (d) networks of technical partners are being put in place, but
their development remains precarious due to factors external to the subprojects, namely the
isolation of production sites and the difficulties of communication for disseminating both
technical and commercial information; (e) access to new markets remains a constraint,
particularly due to isolation, lack of communication, and insufficient marketing activities (fairs
and word of mouth are currently the most common channels used to market the products); (f) the
socio-organizational capacity of producer organizations has improved but needs further
strengthening. O&M practices are still weak but the probability of survival of producer
associations that are in charge of operation and maintenance is promising due to follow up
support of local authorities; (g) two out of three producer organizations have adopted the
recommended technologies in the implementation of their subprojects. Given that such adoption
has had a positive impact on productivity and income, prospects for broader dissemination are
good; (h) sound environmental management is increasingly taking place which is an indicator of
enhanced awareness of the importance of sustainable production.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 Preparation of the project spanned some 18 months and included extensive background
analysis and consultations at the central and regional level. The project design was innovative and
consistent with the Government’s rural strategy and priorities and the Bank’s CAS, and reflected
the core lessons of previous, similar operations. It was innovative in (i) adopting an approach to
fostering co-participation between the central and regional governments on agricultural and rural
development, and to institutional collaboration across sectors; and (ii) introducing a demand-
driven approach to rural development and poverty reduction. However, as mentioned in section
2.1.2, the design of both the OP and AF presented some shortcomings (fragmentation of activities
among several components, wide range of activities, processing of subprojects on an individual
basis, decentralized approach based on the GTDRs) and was not always in line with capacity on
the ground, causing delays in the initial phase. The Results Framework was reasonable, but the
design of indicators to capture the full implications of revenue increase and poverty reduction was
limited, while other indicators reflected unrealistic benchmarks to adequately measure
performance.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory



                                                25
5.1.2 Supervision was characterized by: (i) regular, well-documented missions, with
randomized field visits to communities and subprojects, and considerable follow-up with TTLs
based in the field; (ii) a focus on fiduciary capacity and performance, with consistent, intensive
supervision of procurement in the post-crisis period (2004-05); (iii) clear identification of
capacity needs; (iv) strong MTR including comprehensive Action Plans, and sustained follow-up
with PSDR, with some weaknesses though on the M&E aspects; and (v) intense, pragmatic,
rigorous efforts to salvage the operation post-crises; (vi) quick diagnose of implementation
problems and strong proactivity in seeking restructurings, especially during difficult times.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3     This rating reflects the Moderately Satisfactory preparation performance and the
Satisfactory rating for supervision. It reflects the Bank’s efforts to innovate and test a CDD model.
However, the project’s operational strategy and content under the OP was not matched by
institutional capacity on the ground in key areas. This rating is reinforced by design flaws (e.g.,
on the beneficiaries’ contribution) in the AF which might have been avoided or at least mitigated
by further analysis at appraisal and more timely action during supervision. Overall, during
supervision, Bank teams were conscientious in working with the government and other partners
in facilitating the implementation of the project. They clearly and accurately identified in a timely
manner the operational bottlenecks and the appropriate remedial responses to be undertaken.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1 Government showed high degree of support for a new, decentralized and demand-driven
project approach giving substantial latitude to the regions to determine their rural investment
priorities. But, political pressure resulting in misprocurement and likely fraud and corruption, as
well as severe political crises, put PSDR at risk with significant impact on its implementation,
and effort to restore normalcy was arduous. Once conditions improved, Government reconfirmed
PSDR as the hallmark of its agricultural and rural development program and its support,
including budgetary, has not waned. Similarly, commitment to the Additional Financing and the
follow-on operation has been strong, despite the ongoing political crisis.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.2 The Ministry of Agriculture showed consistently strong, committed effort, even with
formidable obstacles from 2009 onwards, to collaborate with the Bank team in moving the project
forward. It was very responsive in restoring enabling conditions for effective project
implementation following political and internal crises. However, implementation of component 2
and 3 (under the direct responsibility of the Ministry) was somewhat weak and characterized by
poor accountability in the use of funds and lack of clarity about incremental benefits generated.
The Project Implementation Unit had a monumental set of responsibilities, and was successful in
gradually establishing an adequate regional field presence for the processing of a large number of
subprojects all over the country. However, it focused too much on quantitative targets at the
expense of qualitative ones, namely provision of technical assistance and screening of subprojects.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance



                                                26
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3 On balance, overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the
Moderately Satisfactory performance of both the Government and the implementing agency. The
rating reflects: (i) the complex realities of the initial (2002) and the closing (2009) years which
brought the project to a complete freeze; and (ii) the professionalism and dedication of the
technical and administrative teams, close collaboration with the Bank in the post-crisis periods to
rescue the project and maintain it alive, role in bringing PSDR to a successful close, and
accomplishments in physical targets and environmental issues.

6. Lessons Learned
6.1.1   The following lessons are among the more important:

Innovative CDD operations in the rural sector, especially when operating in a fragile
environment, require an extended horizon, a high degree of flexibility, continuous support
for progressive capacity-building and repeat financing to maximize impact, learning and
sustainability. The time required for projects such as PSDR to implement and mature greatly
exceeds Bank averages. This is even more relevant in fragile conditions, like those experienced in
Madagascar, where projects need to constantly adapt to changing external circumstances. The
importance to such projects of: (i) a high degree of flexibility to respond to external shocks and
adapt in terms of the type of support they provide; (ii) unique outreach and implementation
arrangements for channeling support where it is needed; and (iii) experienced, multi-skilled,
cross-sector Bank and Borrower project teams with continuity of leadership cannot be over-stated.
CDD projects can indeed become critical instruments for rapid response to external shocks.

Differentiated targeting and support, and clarity of subprojects’ objectives are key factors
to ensuring project sustainability. This type of project should differentiate between target
groups and subproject objectives, particularly between (i) the poorest segments of the rural
population, usually characterized by very low capacity, for whom the goal is ensuring food
security; and (ii) farmers with proven farming experience and an entrepreneurial approach to
production and marketing for whom the goal is to ensure financial sustainability over time.
Financing criteria and the level of subsidy provided through matching grants should be adjusted
to the degree of vulnerability of the targeted group, geographical location, and the nature of the
subproject. Beneficiaries belonging to group (i) may need to receive grants, with beneficiary
contributions assigned in-kind rather than cash, whereas group (ii) beneficiaries may be more apt
to be linked to micro-credit, with beneficiary contributions in cash. Under the project, the
capacity of farmer organizations to mobilize cash contributions was overestimated and not
adjusted to local conditions. Such capacity was further adversely affected by the prolonged
political crisis that broke out just before the AF became effective.

Quality of subprojects needs to be vigorously pursued by paying continuous adequate
attention to financial and commercial aspects. The promotion of new and economically viable
businesses requires strong long-term technical and organizational support, including rigorous
screening of potential agro-businesses. The market analysis is the critical point of a large number
of small investment projects in rural areas. Under the project, the level of market analysis was
very heterogeneous. In those cases where a link to the market was identified early on, with the
establishment of commercial contracts that guaranteed a certain degree of security for the
additional production generated by the subproject, subprojects remained functional with increased
chance of sustainability. As such, subprojects should be promoted based on real market demand
and according to the identified priority, commercially viable sub-sectors within each region.



                                                27
Leveraging maximum impact from resources allocated for subprojects requires the
identification of investment proposals in a transparent, strategic and participatory manner,
promoting competition for support through targeting mechanisms which ensure high quality,
sustainable subproject proposals consistent with project development objectives and sector
priorities. A hard budget constraint, made known to communities and local authorities in the
participatory planning process, is helpful for introducing a degree of rigor in prioritization.

The sourcing and quality of technical assistance needs focused attention from the earliest
stages of project development. Allocating a portion of subproject cost for technical assistance
cannot resolve the fundamental problem of the scarcity and quality of such services in rural areas.
CDD projects need to support an intense effort to build up such services over time, with a focus
on: (i) building a sustained, long-term support for producer organizations; (ii) responding to the
specific needs of potential entrepreneurs; (iii) tailoring the support to the unique technical,
institutional and financial endowments of each region; (iv) ensuring adequate presence in rural
areas through massive decentralization of staff and providers; (v) grouping service providers by
area of specialty and introducing a black list of non-performers; and (vi) supporting "training of
trainers."

Targeted groups/beneficiaries need to be functional to ensure long-term sustainability of
investments. Several evaluation studies show that many organizations appear to have been
formed expressly for the purpose of securing a subproject and that beneficiaries tend to revert
back to their “natural? grouping centered on households or to produce individually once they
have accessed funds for implementing their productive activity. This shows that the conditions for
effective collective action are more complex than shared vulnerability alone. As a general rule,
support to production should target members in its natural production unit, while support to
producer associations should focus around services where farmers can benefit from economies of
scale (i.e., procurement, marketing, and training). As such, project design needs to include
flexibility to allow for financing of smaller groups and/or individual enterprises.

When CDD projects are heavily focused on demand-driven approaches tensions can arise
between responding to the communities’ needs and building a critical mass necessary for
sustained growth and rural development. As part of project design, a clear strategic and
prioritazation framework, adjustable over time, is fundamental to ensure that CDD projects are
strategically focused and have a catalytic impact on the rural space, rather than responding to ad
hoc needs thereby dissipating the focus from the original objectives.

Implementation arrangements for national programs requiring a strong and massive PIU
are not conducive to strong alliances with local-level governments and institutions and
decentralization efforts. The instability and lack of clarity in the institutional structures call for
the establishment of sizable PIUs that ensure a substantial presence at the local level needed for
implementation of projects such as PSDR. Such massive, parallel, decentralized system, however,
is not an incentive to empower regional organizations and eventually has a feebler impact at the
decentralized level. In the end, this may be a missed opportunity as evaluation study showed that
subprojects that have been successful are those who have been able to develop and benefit from
the development of partnerships and networks with other local institutions, producers federations
and potential buyers. This has created a synergetic effect beneficial for subprojects in terms of
improved accessibility to local services and markets.

Establishing strong ‘firewalls’ in participatory planning and sub-project selection
procedures is fundamental to protect projects from political influence. CDD projects can


                                                 28
easily fall victim to political manipulation, especially in fragile situations. Strong political
interference and potential fraud and corruption should not be considered sufficient reasons to
close an otherwise well performing project. Participatory mechanisms, strong and proactive
corrective measures coupled with intensified supervision can go a long way in creating a stronger
system of checks and balances and eventually putting a much needed project rapidly back on
track. Strong corrective measures also provide an incentive to curb future corruption attempts.

The development of synergies and collaboration with parallel operations through formal
agreements can improve impact on the ground and sustainability. PSDR collaborated
actively with several ongoing operations to avoid overlaps and enhance impact on the ground.
Synergies were created with CELCO (the implementing agency for the Third Environmental
Project – PE3) and ANGAP (now Madagascar National Parks) to help facilitate the selection by
local populations living in and around national parks of alternative sources of income. Similarly,
PSDR established important synergies with the Integrated Growth Poles (PIC) project which,
focusing on strengthening farmers’ negotiating capacity and linkage to the markets, helped
develop productive chains and increase the viability of PSDR-supported productive activities.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1      The components and main accomplishments under the project were as follows:

2.2     Component 1: Productive Investments and Support Services was to finance matching
grants to organized rural community associations for about 4,000 and 2,200 small-scale
investment subprojects under the Original Project and Additional Financing respectively. The
component was to finance the following types of subprojects, both under the OP and AF: (i)
investments in productive rural infrastructure; (ii) productive agricultural activities; (iii)
productive non-agricultural activities; and (iv) the provision of advisory services and capacity
building support for producer organizations. Following the 2002 restructuring, the component
was also to finance extension services, technical support, and training to build capacity of farmers
and producers organizations for the implementation of the demand-driven productive investments
and other small scale non-productive activities. Total cost at project completion was 109% and
68% respectively, of the appraisal estimate.

2.3      The Project financed a total 9,510 subprojects benefiting around 238,000 families
(without repetition) or some 1,190,000 persons (average 5 persons/family) implying that the
Project reached more than 10 percent of the total rural population, and 50 percent of population
living in remote rural areas. The project exceeded its subproject target under both Phase I (6,892
vs. target of 4,000) and Phase II (2,618 vs. target of 2,200).

2.4      About 85 percent of subprojects fell under the productive agricultural activities category,
with productive infrastructure accounting for 12 percent and productive non-agricultural activities
for 3 percent of total subprojects. In terms of cost, infrastructure development represented more
than 44 percent of total component costs, agricultural activities 53 percent and non-agriculture
activities 2 percent (see table 2.4.1).

2.5     Productive Infrastructure. More than half of productive infrastructure subprojects were
hydro-agricultural development indicating the importance attached to rice production, at least
from the perspective of food security. At project closure, the number of small dams financed was
657 against a forecast of 643, a rate of realization of 102 percent. However, considering that 85%
of subprojects supported agricultural production, the demand for infrastructure in support to
upstream and downstream production operations appears small, with only 2 percent of
subprojects dealing with processing of agricultural products and storage. These figures suggest a
weak integration of subproject activities into market outlets. Achievements include:



                                                32
•   More than doubled additional area provided with irrigation and drainage services (30,069 ha
    vs. target of 14,300);
•   Water users provided with irrigation and drainage services largely surpassed the target
    (31,842 vs. 25,280);
•   Water user associations that are operational surpassed the target (657 vs. 643);
•   Infrastructure built or rehabilitated: 657 dams (vs. target of 657), 205 processing units (vs.
    target of 190), 169 storage facilities (vs. target of 165); and 28 slaughterhouses (vs. target of
    30).

2.6     Productive agricultural activities. Subprojects focused on the development of
techniques for rice, maize and peanuts cultivation, with positive increase in production.
Specifically, achievements include:

•   The area cultivated with improved technologies and/or inputs provided through the
    subprojects increased by 42,927 ha, surpassing the target of 39,150ha;
•   Increase in rice production by 37 percent and 64,971 tons compared to a target of 30 percent
    and 64,200 respectively;
•   Increase in maize production by 24 percent and 3,282 tons compared to target of 20 percent
    and 4,600 respectively;
•   Increase in peanut production by 32 percent and 1,242 tons compared to target of 20 percent
    and 1,350 respectively;
•   Satisfactory average financial rate of return of subprojects (21% vs. target of 15%);
•   Area cultivated with improved technologies and inputs provided through Project-supported
    subprojects surpassed the target (42,927 ha vs. 39,150).
•   Saving schemes established and functioning surpassed the target (6,467 vs. 5,982);
•   Targeted producers largely satisfied with agricultural services received (94 percent vs. a
    target of 90 percent);
•   More than 753,000 client days of training provided.

2.7      Productive non-agricultural activities. These activities represented about 3 percent of
total subprojects. The survey results consistently show that more than 70 percent of rural
households engage in non-agricultural activities (crafts in particular, typically over 10%) as
secondary activity and with a relatively negligible contribution to income (on average less than
5%). Requests for support in this area were limited, due to difficulties in the supply of inputs
(fibers, scrap, etc.) and links to market.

2.8     The most common subprojects financed under each phase are ranked as per Table 2.6.1,
including numbers of families benefited in each case. The types of subprojects are remarkably
similar between phases, with the exception of the exit of vanilla production, beekeeping, and
dairy cows raising.

2.9      The table below shows that about 75% of OP subprojects proposed were not financed,
and about 57% of AF proposals. The rejection rate by subproject category was higher for
productive infrastructure, and lower for both agricultural and non-agricultural activities. In
aggregate, the rejection rate was 71%. The reasons for non-financing were diverse. One basic
reason is that the PIU did not track receipt of proposals in real time, so for quite some time they
were unaware that many more proposals had been submitted than could ever be funded, and
consequently they were slow to announce publically that receipt of new proposals was being
suspended. The fact that so many proposals were received may have created false expectations
among some potential beneficiaries, but it also allowed the PIU to be more selective in deciding
which subprojects to finance (which was a good thing). Proposals were rejected for many
different reasons: (i) incomplete proposal, or poor quality proposal; (ii) group submitting the
proposal did not meet the eligibility requirements; (iii) funding requested for activities that were
not eligible for project funding (e.g., power tillers, establishment of perennial crops); (iv) funding
requested for activities deemed commercially non-viable; (v) need to maintain a regional balance
in distribution of subprojects (in some regions the local authorities mobilized many beneficiary
groups to submit proposals quickly in an effort to capture a large share of PSDR benefits).

2.10    Technical assistance. Technical assistance performance was fair under the OP but
improved under the AF. The uneven quality of the "partenaires strategiques" under the OP was
recognized and solved by developing an informal "black list" of poorly performing partners, and
grouping the technical assistance providers by their areas of specialty. Technical assistance was
provided to about 5,800 subprojects under the OP and about 3,737 subprojects under the AF.

2.11     According to a 2012 survey, only half of producer organizations were satisfied with
technical assistance provided on the ground, due to (i) insufficient support for the elaboration of
subproject profiles, (ii) lack of educational materials available to the beneficiaries, (iii) lack of
consideration of the different crops’ seasonality (iv) inadequate and/or insufficient supervision,
and (v) lack of transparency and insufficient communication. In direct response to the challenges
experienced under Phase I, PSDR made a significant effort to compensate under the AF with the
establishment of “pool techniques?. As a result, training and subproject supervision was delivered
on a more permanent basis. This new arrangement allowed the project to: (i) monitor subproject
activities in real time thanks to an effective and timely feedback system; and (ii) prioritize
interventions.

2.12     Component 2: Support Services was to finance support for the strengthening of the
capacity of main agricultural research institutions and better dissemination of the stock of new
and promising technologies. Total cost at completion was about 20% and 15% of the appraisal
estimate, respectively. One reason explaining why the cost of this component at completion was
far below the initial estimates is that the public agency that was charged with implementation of
Component 2 (FOFIFA) had very weak capacity and was very slow to submit and then
implement the agreed work plans. Further, under the AF, after PSDR was granted an exemption
to the disbursement freeze that had been implemented after OP 7.30 was triggered, direct
transfers of funds to government agencies was prohibited.

2.13    Thematic research. Two public institutions FOFIFA (National Center for Applied
Research for Rural Development) and FIFAMANOR (Fiompiana Fambolena Malagasy
Norveziana) received funding under PSDR to conduct thematic research activities to address
medium or long-term constraints to the intensification, diversification and/or sustainability of
production systems. FOFIFA research activities, covering the entire country, focused on six
themes including plant and animal genetics, soil fertility, phytosanitary management, social
sciences and the agri-food sector. FIFAMANOR worked in one target region on two themes, (i)



                                                   35
conservation and management of genetic resources and (ii) agro-food research. Technical sheets
for each regional crop were developed and used for developing training materials for service
providers supporting the development of investment subprojects, thereby ensuring the link
between research and productive activities on the ground. Support under this component has
contributed to obtaining better performing varieties of tubercles, and to improving the ration
formula for feeding dairy cows. The dissemination of research results was done through the
institutions’ own extension services and partner NGOs. It should also be noted that support for
thematic research has enabled these institutions to acquire scientific and technical equipment to
improve research results.

2.14    Applied research. The Competitive Agricultural Research Fund (FCRA) established
under PSDR financed 26 research projects under the OP; eight of these subprojects focused on
data collection to fill significant gaps in terms of basic scientific and technical data. Proposals for
applied research themes generally came from productive investment subprojects. Just over half of
the 140 themes proposed during the OP came directly from producers facing problems in the
implementation of subprojects; 21 percent of proposals came from branches of the Ministry of
Agriculture, while requests from the private sector and research institutes accounted for only
8.7% and 6.7% respectively. Results were disseminated through 5 documentaries, CDs, and
FCRA and PSDR websites. Under the AF, several research projects could not be developed due
to delays in procurement processes and were cancelled.

2.15    Main results under this component are the following:

•   Research studies developed did not achieve the target (26 vs. 36). Ten research projects,
    which were experiencing delays in processing, were cancelled following the partial
    cancellation of the AF credit in November 2012;
•   The National Germplasm Bank was rehabilitated and material at risk regenerated;
•   The national agricultural research strategy has not been completed. A preliminary diagnostic
    study on the national agricultural research system has been prepared as a basis for the
    development of the strategy.
•   Eighty seven percent of producers have adopted improved agricultural technologies
    developed under the project.

2.16     Component 3: Capacity Building and Policy Development was to finance technical
assistance and training to build capacity in implementing agencies at central and regional level to
formulate and analyze rural policy, to establish adequate agricultural statistical systems, and to
strengthen environmental assessment. Total cost at completion was about 50% and 26% of the
appraisal estimate, respectively. Similarly to Component 2, the cost of this component at
completion was far below the initial estimates, reflecting: (i) the very weak capacity of the public
agency responsible for implementation of Component 3 (UPDR); and (ii) the prohibition of direct
transfers of funds to government agencies following the disbursement freeze that had been
implemented after OP 7.30 was triggered.

2.17     The component implementation was the responsibility of the for Rural Development
Policy Unit (UPDR), which played a strategic role in supporting decision making through the
preparation of studies aimed at assessing the impact of macro-economic, legislative, regulatory
and tax provisions on rural areas and at supporting the development and monitoring of rural
policies. Main results under the component are the following:

Under the OP:



                                                  36
•   The National Rural Development Program (PNDR) was developed and approved;
•   All planned Regional Rural Development Programs (PRDR) were prepared on the basis of
    the PNDR;
•   The Rural Development Policy Letter was developed and used for the elaboration of the
    PNDR;
•   The agriculture census was completed and disseminated;
•   The agricultural statistics system is operational, Regional Agricultural Statistics Units
    (URSA) were expanded and strengthened and newsletters on the market information system
    (SIM) were developed and published.

    Under the AF:
•   Planning for the elaboration of the Agriculture Sector Plan (PSA) was developed, with
    regional workshops carried out in all 22 regions;
•   Agriculture Support Centers (CSA) were partially strengthened (21 vs. a target of 40), and
    CSA was established;
•   Regional Grant Approval Committees were established (12 with PSDR financing and 4 with
    other donor funds for a total of 16 as per the target).

2.18     Component 4: Project Administration and Monitoring financed project administration
and coordination activities, including supervision, monitoring and impact evaluation (M&E).
Total component cost under each phase was 163% and 91% respectively of estimated cost at
appraisal. The amount disbursed under Component 4 exceeded the budgeted amount and was in
excess of the 15% rule of thumb figure that is often used as a reasonable amount. The main
reason why Component 4 was overspent, is that key PIU staff were kept on board during the
extended period under OP 7.30 when disbursements were frozen (their salaries and benefits were
paid using project funds that were in the designated accounts when the disbursement freeze went
into effect).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

3.1      The evaluation of PSDR efficiency was made difficult by the lack of a complete set of
quantitative data. An economic and financial analysis reviewed 4 types of productive subprojects
(rice, beef, dairy, and poultry) collectively representing about 64% of the most common
subprojects financed by end-2012. The productive investment subprojects (Component 1) plus
associated project management expenses represented about 95 percent of the overall project cost,
thus, the analysis of the efficiency of productive investments gives an adequate assessment of the
overall project efficiency.

3.2     Overall project’s efficiency: Using cash flows from four types of subprojects (rice, beef,
dairy and poultry), financial and economic indicators were calculated to evaluate the overall
project profitability. Both financial and economic NPV were positive. Financial and economic
IRR were greater than the opportunity cost of capital (OCC) of 12 percent, at 38% and 26%
respectively.

3.3     Economic and financial results of individual subprojects. Because of data availability,
the analysis was undertaken for four types of productive subprojects (rice, beef, dairy, and
poultry) collectively representing about 64% of the most common subprojects financed by end-
2012.

3.4     Beef. Two financial indicators were calculated: the NPV and IRR before and after
financing 21. Before financing, using a 12 percent discount rate, the project was not financially
viable because the IRR was less than the assumed opportunity cost of capital (OCC). Furthermore,
the NPV was negative. This was also true for the after financing, with some improvement in the
indicators. An IRR equal to11.5% (Table 3.4.1) meant that the cost and benefits of the beef
project were almost equal and the project might have been financially attractive enough to be
implemented.

TABLE 3.4.1: FINANCIAL COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS INDICATORS FOR BEEF

                             Before financing                                 After financing
 FRR                         10.9%                                            11.5%
 NPV                         -685                                             -238

3.5     With a change in the discount rate from 12 to 11 percent, which is realistic given the
limited opportunities in the project area, the NPV before financing was negative (-32 Ar), while
the NPV after financing was 274 Ar, which yielded an attractive subproject. With a discount rate
of 10 percent, the NPV was 705 Ar before financing and 862 Ar after financing (see Table 3.5.1).




21
   The analysis under a “before financing? and “after financing? scenario was applied only to the beef model because,
based on data available, the beef model was the only subproject that required loan repayment. For the other subprojects,
which were financed by grants, the “before financing? and “after financing? scenario did not apply. The financial cost
benefit analysis “before financing? means the exclusion of total debt service (including the interest repayment on the
loan disbursement at the start of the project, the unpaid loan balance after loan repayment, and loan repayment
(principal)). The cost benefit analysis “after financing? included the cash “before financing? plus the loan disbursement
deducted from the total debt service.

3.6      Sensitivity of beef subprojects. In order to test the robustness of the beef subprojects, a
sensitivity analysis was performed on different financial and economic indicators (NPV, IRR).
Two types of sensitivity analysis were used: the Variable-by-Variable (VBV) analysis and the
scenario analysis. The VBV consisted of increasing the total cost and decreasing total benefit of
the subprojects with different amounts (+5%, +10% and 20%). The scenario analysis made those
changes simultaneously. The VPV analysis suggested that the project was sensitive to an increase
of aggregate costs or decrease of aggregate benefits: from a decrease of 5% and plus in benefits
and an increase in costs of 5% and plus, the project became unprofitable (negative NPV and
EIRR less than the OCC. See table 3.6.1).

3.7      Dairy. Financial and economic analyses were performed, with the use of a subsidy rate of
80% for the financial analysis, and of a conversion factor for labor of 0.5 for economic analysis.
The project was financially viable (Table 3.7.1) since the IRR (38%) was greater than the OCC of
12 percent, and the NPV showed that the project would generate 6.8 million Ariary. In terms of
economic efficiency indicators, the project was not attractive; with a negative economic NPV and
relatively small IRR (<12%).

3.8     Sensitivity of dairy subprojects The sensitivity analysis showed that dairy subprojects
were robust since the financial NPV is positive for increase of costs from 5% to 20%, and
decrease of benefits by the same percentage change. Similarly, the IRR was greater than the OCC
for these changes. On the contrary, the economic NPV was negative with an increase of costs (or

an increase in costs (or a decrease in benefits) by 10% and more (table 3.8.1).

3.9     The scenario approach for the economic indicators showed that the dairy subprojects
were not sensitive to simultaneous changes in costs increase and benefits decrease. The financial
NPV was negative and the financial IRR less than the OCC only when the costs increased by
10% coupled with a decrease of more than 20% in benefit or the benefits decreased by 20% with
a simultaneous increase of costs by 10% and more. Hence, these efficiency indicators were not
sensitive to small changes in aggregate costs and benefits (5%-10%). Conversely, the economic
NPV and IRR are very sensitive to small changes (increase of costs by 5% and more and a
decrease in benefits by 5% or more yields negative efficiency indicators. Table 3.9.1).

3.10    Rice. Conservative assumptions on yield over time have been assumed for the rice
subprojects. Quantities of inputs under a “without project? situation were on average half of the
quantities “with the project situation?. The financial cost of labor for rice (2500 Ar. /day) was
adjusted to an economic cost of labor (1250 Ar. /day), or a conversion factor of 0.5. Other inputs
were costed using current market prices. For the rice output price, the current export parity price
(633 USD/T or 1012 Ar. /kg) was derived from the calculation done by the impact evaluation
study as shown in Table 3.10.1. The financial and economic efficiency indicators showed
profitable rice intensification subprojects, with a financial IRR (29%) greater than the OCC and a
positive financial NPV (339873 Ar.). With assumptions on adjustment of labor costs, rice output

a high profitability of the rice subprojects.

3.11     Sensitivity of rice subprojects. In order to assess the strength of the assumptions for the
rice subprojects a sensitivity analysis was performed on different financial and economic
indicators, such as financial and economic NPV. The VBV consisted of increasing the aggregate
cost or decreasing the aggregate benefit of rice subprojects with different amounts (+5%,+10%
and 20%). The intensification rice subprojects were not profitable financially with a total cost
increase of over 20% or a decrease in benefit of the same amount. Nevertheless, the projects were
economically sound, with a positive economic NPV with VBV. For the scenario analysis, the
NPV for the rice model was sensitive to a simultaneous change in aggregate costs by 5% and
more (decrease) and increase in aggregate benefits by 10% and more. But the sensitivity analysis
for the Economic NPV indicated that the project was still viable; the rice subprojects are robust in
the VBV and Scenario analyses (table 3.11.1).

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1    The Project was the subject of a comprehensive beneficiary survey and a few survey-
based studies, which give important insights into PSDR achievements. The results are
summarized below.

Beneficiaries’ Evaluation of PSDR (Cabinet MIARA-MITA, 2005)

5.2     The evaluation was conducted on the basis of a sample of 600 subprojects implemented
or under implementation since the beginning of the project until mid-June 2005 and distributed in
the country’s 22 regions. Agriculture production activities represented 45% of the sample
subprojects, with livestock representing 37% of the sample. Results were as follows.

5.3     Overall, the project has responded to the priorities and expectations of beneficiaries and
greatly contributed to promote a new dynamism in rural development. Further, access to rural
services has favored a renewed interest in the modernization of agriculture and livestock activities.
The majority of beneficiaries have experienced an increase in production following the
implementation of subprojects, with positive impact on income and livelihood. The responses
provided by beneficiaries with regard to the project key indicators revealed that the project was
on track to achieve its objectives, particularly regarding the rate of adoption of new technologies
and the increased ability to establish savings. However, overall satisfaction with technical
assistance providers was low, while satisfaction with participatory processes was high, thus
fostering the consolidation of farmer organizations.

5.4     Productive infrastructure subprojects. Overall, beneficiaries were satisfied with the
implementation of productive infrastructure subprojects, which were perceived as having a
positive impact on production and consequently on income. Beneficiaries felt that they actively
participated in the decision –making regarding subprojects identification and selection, but such
participation weakened during the implementation phase with construction firms taking over
responsibility. Collaboration between local authorities and technical assistance providers was
weak, with lack of clear definition of roles for the construction and maintenance of infrastructures.
Less than half of beneficiaries are satisfied with the service provided by technical assistance
providers.

5.5     Livestock activities. The majority (63%) of beneficiaries were satisfied with the
subprojects and the impact on production, livelihood and local development. Subprojects were
considered a priority for almost all beneficiaries, who participated actively in their selection,
implementation and maintenance. More than half of beneficiaries believed that the subprojects
contributed to the achievements of their objectives, and were satisfied with service providers’
performance, while 80% perceived that funds were allocated in a transparent manner.

5.6      Agricultural activities. The majority of beneficiaries (79%) perceived that subprojects
financing agricultural activities have responded to their expectations, while less than half (42%)
experienced an increase in income as a result of enhanced production. The majority (75%)
believes that the project improved their living conditions, with 69% feeling responsible for the
material and financial inputs provided by the subprojects. Only 37% of beneficiaries were
satisfied with their participation in the procurement processes, and about half were satisfied with
service providers.

5.7     Non-agricultural activities. On average, beneficiaries’ expectations were only partially
met, due to delays in the allocation of funds, insufficient training, and poor participation in some


                                                44
phases of the subprojects’ implementation. However, participation in the design phase was high
with significant ownership of selected subprojects. The performance of service providers was
considered satisfactory by less than half of beneficiaries.

Ex-Post Evaluation of Productive Investment Subprojects under PSDR (Cabinet RConseil,
2005) and Ex Post Evaluation of productive investment subprojects under PSDR (Savaivo,
2008)

5.8      The results of the 2005 and 2008 evaluations, summarized in Table 5.8.1 below, show
that the project was increasingly on track to achieve its objectives, with overall satisfaction of the
majority of beneficiaries.

Economic Evaluation of Productive Investment Subprojects under PSDR (Cabinet MIARA-
MITA, 2012)

5.9     The study was based on a random sample of 205 subprojects financed between 2007 and
2008, targeting 1,260 beneficiaries in 16 regions. The study highlighted the following project
strengths and weaknesses:

Project strengths:

    •   Positive economic and social impact that helped improve living conditions and increase
        income;

    •   Response to the huge needs for support in the different regions of the country and
        especially in remote and isolated areas (12% of subprojects took place in remote areas);

    •   Access to training and mentoring for producers;

    •   Inclusion of gender aspects in the implementation of activities;

    •   Promising sustainability of activities, as evidenced by high rate of adoption of new
        technologies, increased access to micro-finance institutions and saving capacity;

Project weaknesses:

    •   Subproject selection characterized by the promotion of a large range of activities
        resulting in dispersed efforts and inadequate/inefficient monitoring and supervision;

    •   Weak performance of service providers who lack professionalism thus having a negative
        impact on quality of implementation;

    •   Inadequate monitoring of subprojects after the design and formulation phase.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

6.1       Two separate rounds of stakeholder consultations were conducted to obtain feedback, and
distill lessons learned. The first round of discussions involved a workshop held in July 2012 with
the key agencies and individuals with strong influence over the direction of agriculture and rural
development strategies and policies. The second round of discussions, held in November 2012,
involved a wide range of participants including representatives from 22 Producers Organizations
(one each from the 22 Regions benefitted by PSDR), the Ministries of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Livestock, the Regional Directorates for Rural Development, the Agriculture Service Centers
(CSA), the private sector, and researsch institutions (FOFIFA).

6.2     Key feedback obtained during the July 2012 workshop include: (i) so as to ensure
homogeneity, criteria for group formation need to include the level of education in addition to the
degree of expertise and experience; (ii) regular internal meetings, establishment of a network of
partners, collaboration between the project and the line Ministry are key for effective
management and coordination; (iii) mainstreaming of environmental considerations is essential,
regardless of project scale; (iv) beneficiaries’ contribution needs to be established based on
poverty level rather than geographical location; and (v) the establishment of a permanent
monitoring system of subproject is fundamental for follow up and learning.

6.3.     During the November 2012 workshop, the beneficiaries acknowledged the important
contribution made by PSDR to the improvement of their quality of life and were generally
satisfied with the support received from the project. In particular, it was noted that the project,
through the introduction of beneficiaries’ contribution, helped promoting a change of mentality
towards entrepreneurship and thus increasing ownership of activities and investments financed.

6.4       Main achievements highlighted by participating stakeholders included:

•     Increase in production and income for agriculture and off-farm activities (e.g., handicraft);
•     Organizational strengthening, increased capacity to manage resources and projects (e.g.,
      shared responsibility for maintenance and operation of infrastructure, improved procurement
      capacity);
•     Improvement of infrastructure;
•     Decrease in social conflicts for access to resources (i.e., water).

6.5       Main obstacles emphasized by participating stakeholders included:

•     Delay in obtaining financing and in procurement of material and equipiment, which delayed
      activities in the field (conflict with production calendar year);
•     Difficulties in fulfilling the beneficiaries’ contribution, which in some cases led to the
      inability to realize the infrastructure work, while in other cases farmers had to indebt
      themselves;
•     Poor quality of some infrastructure work and material;
•     Lack of technical capacity to implement subprojects, and difficulties purchasing certain
      materials/inputs (e.g. fertilizaers and pesticides);
•     Insufficient and/or inadequate training for use of equipment and for production in specific
      regional condition; weak link between research and technical assistance;
•     Difficulties in maintining the membership of community associations, unless there is a high
      degree of family connection;
•     Insufficient support for market access;


                                                 47
•     Lack of appropiate storage facilities;
•     Heavy focus on agriculture production, with little support for fisheries and livestock
      subprojects;

6.6      Main concerns raised for sustainability of activities:

•     Other sources of financing;
•     Training/capacity building for identification of market opportunities and access;
•     Technical assistance and training for O&M;
•     Sensitization of beneficiaries to strengthen ownership of investments, rationale for
      contribution, and participation of all community members in O&M.

                                                                        Unofficial Translation

                            Rural Development Support Project
                                 Republic of Madagascar

    A. Executive Summary

7.1      The preliminary results of the ex-post evaluation carried out during the project (over the
period 2004-06) confirm that the subprojects reached the targeted recipients and had a
considerable impact both on the level of productivity and income. The project had reached close
to three-quarter of the country’s rural communes, half of which in isolated areas.

7.2     As of December 31, 2012, this trend is maintained as PSDR’s results show that 9,510
rural organizations (versus a target of 6200) and nearly 1.2 million people (i.e., approximately
10% of the rural population of Madagascar) in 240,000 rural households (versus a target of
150,000) directly benefited from the project.

7.3     Component A achievements are interesting, with results higher than the targets in the
majority of cases and even well beyond in certain cases (1177 productive infrastructure
subprojects delivered; 8032 agricultural subprojects financed and 301 non-agricultural
subprojects financed). Some beneficiaries were able to continue their activities beyond PSDR
and/or extend or diversify their activities. Some beneficiaries acquired negotiation skills in
particular with their commercial partners.

7.4      With regard to Component A.4. (Support Services): (i) technical and organizational
trainings were capitalized by the majority of the recipients; (ii) compliance with environmental
action plans indicates a special attention to sustainable production; (iii) experiences under the
initial phase allowed for the identification and filling of the gaps for environmental management:
each Regional Executive Directorate (DER) now has an environmental specialist responsible for
following up closely the implementation of subprojects environmental aspects.

7.5     With regard to Component B, thematic and applied research adequately responded to the
farmers’ concerns and the analysis of their problems. More than 80% of subprojects beneficiaries
adopted the innovating technologies brought within the framework of the thematic research
support between 2001 and 2009 (during the initial financing); 26 research projects, financed by
FCRA were implemented.

7.6     With regard to Component C, the UPDR contributed in a substantial way to the
strengthening of sectors of national scale and to the strategic support for the elaboration of the
rural development national plan (PNDR). In addition, the establishment and support to eleven
GTDR during the initial financing and contributions for the establishment of twelve Regional
Steering and Allocation Committees (CROA) and the strengthening of twenty one Agricultural
Service centers (ASC) during the additional financing phase are substantial achievements that
promoted the synergy of actors in rural development and the strengthening of the process of
regionalization and decentralization.




                                                49
7.7     With regard to Component D, the changes in strategies, approaches and work
methodologies, and the restructuring made during the life of the project influenced management
costs and project management. PSDR intervention is deemed relevant, effective and efficient for
the period 2001-2012.

7.8     Partnership:
• The “Partenaires Strategiques? have varying capabilities across regions and sectors and
    cover different situations;
• Relationships with financial institutions have influenced the development vision of producer
    organizations and their activities could develop;
• Despite problems encountered in developing a system for the recovery of funds to cover the
    operating expenses for the continuity of productive investment subprojects, a little less than
    half of the producer organizations have been able to achieve financial savings except
    members with savings in kind (source: surveys EEDR MAMOKATRA, December 2012).

7.9     Impact:
• The project had a significant impact on increasing the income improving the living conditions
    of farmers who benefited from subprojects; 80% of project beneficiaries have seen their
    incomes increased by at least 30%;
• Thanks to the project, the majority of beneficiaries experienced an increase in the volume of
    production, which will have an impact on improving food security;
• It can be argued that 88% of subprojects remain functional one year after reception (source:
    Economic Assessment Results MIARAMITA confirmed by the PSDR Results Framework,
    December 2012);
• The project had a significant impact on increasing income of subprojects beneficiaries.
    Indeed, following the economic assessment by the Cabinet MIARAMITA, 80% of project
    beneficiaries have seen their incomes increased by at least 30%.

7.10    Sustainability:
• The appropriation of subprojects by the beneficiaries is the result of the use of participatory
    planning techniques, the involvement of vulnerable producers and women (34%) in the
    process of decision making. These ownership elements reflect the interest to sustain
    subproject activities.
• Mechanisms for subprojects ownership on the part of beneficiaries are generally operational
    (organizational and functional structure);
• Environmental protection is an achievement of the Project. The Environmental Action Plans
    (EAP) are complied with by 75% of beneficiaries according to the Results Framework of
    December 2012. The survey conducted as part of this study confirmed that more than 88% of
    producer organizations are complying with the terms of the EAP.

7.11    We can conclude and confirm that the overall objective of the project has been achieved
as 80% of targeted rural households feel that their incomes increased by at least 30%. Given the
good performance of PSDR and the many complaints collected during the field surveys, best
practices from the PSDR experience deserve to be capitalized and elaborated in the framework of
commercial agriculture where each stakeholder will continue to benefit and improve their income.
