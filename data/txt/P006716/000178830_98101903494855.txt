APPRA1AL OF EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMiJARY
i.        The Government of Colombia, has made a request to the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development for a loan to expand and improve
secondary education.
ii.       The proposed project, comprising the construction and equipment
of ten secondary schools, would introduce a new concept of education to
Colombia: comprehensive schools that prepare students both for the labor
market and further studies. The schools would emphasize that science,
agriculture, engineering and commerce form part of general education as
well as constituting prevocational training.
iii.      Total enrollment would be 48,0oo students, half attending during
the morning and the other half in the afternoon. Annual output at the
senior secondary level would be 7,300 of which 75 percent would have pre-
vocational training in agriculture, engineering, commerce or social services.
iv.       The large enrollment at each school (due to two-shift working)
would allow efficient use of staff and a high student:teacher ratio of 25:1.
Further economies would be achieved by the employment at high utilization
factors of language la.boratories and well-equipped workshops and science
departments. Space would be included and designed to permit future use of
instructional television.
V.        The ratio of applicants for admission to the project schools to
the number of available seats would be sufficiently high to provide entrants
of adequa.te quality. Graduates of the project schools should meet no
employment problems.
vi.       The supply of administrative, counseling and teaching staff would
be satisfactory if training programs presently under way are fully executed.
vii.      Competent architects, engineers and contracting firms are
availa7ble in Colombia.
viii.     Estimated costs for construction, furnit-re and equipment a-re
reasonable. Procurement for these items would follow international
competitive bidding.
ix.       The government has agreed to establish a. unit to implement the
project with responsibility for physical construction, staff training and
curriculum revision. Execution would be based on a PERT analysis.
x.        The proposed project would cost about US$15.2 million equivalent
over an implementation period of four years, 1968-71. The foreign exchange
component is estimated at US$5.4 million equivalent. The capital contri-
bution and recurrent costs raised by the project are within the capacity
of the government.



- ii -
xi.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan in the amount of US$7.6
million equivalent, which would cover the whole of the foreign exchange
component plus 22 percent of the local cost and be equal to 50 percent of
the estimated total project cost. The term of the loan would be 25 years
including a grace period of 10 years.

APPRAISAL OF EDUCATION PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In October 1967 the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development received a request from the Government of Colombia for finan-
cial assistance to construct ten large comprehensive schools. Prior to
the request, Unesco had identified the need for an expansion of secondary
school facilities, to follow a comprehensive system. This was followed
by an extensive and lengthy preparation since the introduction of compre-
hensive schools would imply a substantial change from the current educa-
tional system in Colombia. Unesco and USAID missions assisted the gov-
ernment in the preparation of the project for presentation to the Bank.
1.02      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission,
composed of Messrs. M. Hultin, general educator, K. M. Thint, architect,
P. Eklund, economist,and A. G. Apodaca (FAO), agricultural educator, which
was in Colombia during November and December 1967.
2. BACKGROUND
2.01      Colombia has an area of 1,139,000 km2, about twice that of
France, and some 19 million people. The population is concentrated in
the coastal plains and the mountain highlands of the western half of the
country (see map). Population growth has become a serious problem, rising
from an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the 1940's to an officially estimated
current rate of 3.2 percent per year. If this rate is sustained, Colombia
would double her population each 22 years, but a five-year family planning
program, 1968-72, will cover urban as well as rural areas and is expected
to lower the birth rate.
2.02      The rapid increase in population has caused a downward shift
in the age distribution. In 1951, those aged 15 and under formed 39 per-
cent of the population.  This proportion rose to 46 percent in 1964
(Annex 1). As a result of this shift, plus an increased school enrollment,
a declining percentage of the population participates in the labor force;
between 1951 and 1964, the labor force declined from 34 percent to 29 per-
cent of the population (Annex 2); in other words, 29 percent of the popu-
lation had to support the 71 percent economically inactive in 1964.
2.03      Another demographical force at work in Colombia is a shift of
population from rural to urban areas. Between 1951 and 1964, the rural
population decreased from 61 percent to 48 percent of the total and it
is expected that this rural-urban migration will continue. Contributing
factors are the discrepancy between wages in agricultural and urban
sectors and the widespread unemployment in the countryside.



- 2 -
2.04      The growth rate for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaged
4.5 percent over 1960-65; growth of GDP was 5.3 percent in 1966. In-
vestment by the Central Government has increased considerably during the
last two years (1966-67). The investment program has focused on projects
of high priority and project execution has been improved through reorga-
nization of the major agencies involved. Further increases in public
investment are expected, with one objective, the attainment of higher
productivity in industry and agriculture. GDP is expected to grow 6 per-
cent per year. The Government plans to continue the existing framework
of exchange, monetary and wage policies, which are given credit for helping
to improve the balance of payments situation in 1967 and reducing inflation
from an average of 17 percent in 1962-66 to 7 percent last year.
2.05      An increasing and properly trained part of the economically active
population must become engaged in manufacturing, construction, transport and
similar activities, if the projected economic growth is to be achieved. Also,
a low productivity in agriculture must be raised through an improvement of
management and of the labor force. The table below shows the economically
active population by main sectors in 1964 and the projected distribution
in 1970.

3. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
The Structure of Education (Annex 3)
3.01      Primary education lasts five years. An entrance examination
qualifies for admission to secondary schools. General secondary edu-
cation is divided into a four-year junior course (Plan Basico) followed
by a two-year senior course (Bachillerato). The senior secondary course
is essentially for university aspirants.



- 3 -
3.02      Primary and junior secondary school leavers are offered voca-
tional education of several types. Higher education is available at
universities and specialized post-secondary institutes.
The Administration of Education
3.03      Colombia has a mixed system of national, departmental, municipal
and private education. Departments have semiautonomous governments; the
central government also has limited supervisory authority over non-govern-
mental education. Many school administrative posts are filled by political
appointment. The result is a considerable disparity in school quality.
3.04      At the national level, the Ministry of Education is the most im-
portant agency. There is need for better administrative leadership from
the center but, with the assistance of Unesco, the administration of the
Ministry is being reorganized to improve supervision and to foster educa-
tional planning, teacher training, curriculum reforms and modern school
construction. Assurances have been obtained fran the government that this
reorganization and reform will be completed.
3.05      The Ministry delegates the planning and execution of school pro-
jects to a semiautonomous agency, the Oficina Administrativa para Progra-
mas Educativos Conjuntos (OAPEC). The need for administrative improvements
within OAPEC has been apparent for some time; by the end of 1966, the agen-
cy had utilized only 17 percent of available investment funds. More flexible
budgetary practices are needed. OAPEC is now being reorganized with USAID
assistance and a new, larger staff is being recruited. Higher efficiency
is, therefore, expected. The Ministry of the Interior also finances some
school construction through the Gommunal Action Program, which will be
coordinated through the Ministry of Education in the future.
School Enrollment (Annexes 4, 5, 6, 7)
3.06      Past and projected enrollments in education are as follows:
1955        i965        1975
Primary Education                      1,240,000   2,270,000  4,060,000
Enrollment as Fraction of Age Group        54%         6L%         81%
Secondary Education                      119,000     40h,00O   1,303,000
Enrollment as Fraction of Age Group         7%         15%        37%
Higher Education                          13,000      43,200     199,000
The projected primary school enrollment of 81 percent in 1975 is appropriate.
Secondary school enrollment in Colombia is still low for a country of its
stage of development. Comparison with some other American countries is given
in the following table:



Secondary School Enrollment as a Percentage of
Relevant Age Group
Country                             Percentage
Guatemala                                9%
Colombia                                15%
Mexico                                  17%
Brazil                                  22%
Venezuela                               28%
Argentina                               40%
U.S.A.                                  93%
The estimated increases in secondary and higher education are based on social
demands for education and include expansion in the private school sector.
The private school sector's contribution to economic development is limited,
however, for reasons mentioned below. To ensure an adequate degree of re-
sponsiveness to economic needs, Colombia plans on a significant expansion of
the public schools.
Primary Education
3.07      Eighty-six percent of primary education is given in public schools,
which are free, and 14 percent in private schools. The average primary school
has 96 students. Class sizes, varying from 10 to 70, imply an uneven use of
staff and facilities. Urban schools contain 64 percent of the enrollment
although only 52 percent of the population is classified as urban. The drop-
out rate in rural areas is high, partly because rural schools often go no
further than second grade. Only 3 percent of rural students finish primary
education as against 44 percent for urban students.  About 40 percent of the
primary teachers have not received adequate professional training; many work
only part-time, while others work extra hours to a degree incompatible with
full efficiency.
3.08      The need for improving primary education is recognized by the gov-
ernment; some reforms have been implemented, others are being considered.
Instructional television has been successfully introduced at the primary level.
Double shift working, automatic promotion and coeducation are being introduced
in rural areas to make better use of teachers and facilities. A full five-
year course will soon be offered in most parts of the country and the dropout
rate should then fall.
Secondary Education
3.09      In 1965, secondary enrollment was 404,000, of which slightly less
than half (48 percent) were girls. Secondary education is spread over the
country in small, uneconomical units averaging 140 students. Boarding schools
are not common.



3.10      Both public and private secondary students pay fees.   The public
school fee, ranging between US$2-20 equivalent per year, varies with the
parents' income. The fee in private secondary schools is considerably higher
at US$60-85 equivalent. It is estimated that only about 10 percent of the
population can afford private schools. Since these schools offer 54 percent
of available spaces, the fortunate 10 percent have access to 20 times as many
secondary school places per capita as the other 90 percent. Colombia thus
does not adequately exploit the resources of talents that exist in low income
groups, not to mention the possibly adverse social consequences of continuing
the present imbalance of opportunity.
3.11      The intake into secondary schools has been fairly high compared to
the output of primary schools, mainly due to the proliferation of private
secondary schools. The projected improvement of primary education will in-
crease the number of primary school leavers and reduce the index of oppor-
tunity unless more secondary education is made available at modest fees.
Expansion is also needed on manpower grounds (para. 4.04). It should ap-
propriately take place in the public sector of education.
3.12      There were 30,800 secondary school teachers in 1965; only 21,600
are considered to be fully qualified. Few teachers are appointed full-time.
Most teachers serve two or even three schools and teach many different classes
per week. In spite of this, utilization of the teaching staff is low, mainly
due to small classes in the upper grades. Necessary steps to improve the
situation are a gradual abolition of the part-time teaching system and a
systematic upgrading of the teaching force.
3.13      General secondary education enjoys high prestige in Colombia.
Expansion over the last decade has raised enrollments to 276,000 in 1965;
about 36 percent of the students were girls; output at the two examination
levels was 44,000. The rapid expansion has led to an over-utilization of
existing schools and many new, mainly private, schools have been established
in poor facilities which were not originally intended for school purposes.
Despite the high prestige of general secondary schooling, dropouts and
repeaters are common - only 25 percent of the entrants finish education.
3.14      With a curriculum based on the humanities, the goal of general
secondary education has been almost entirely preparation for university.
Syllabuses give very little emphasis to modern society and its needs in
agriculture, industry, commerce and social welfare. Student schedules tend
to be rigid and over-loaded and examinations encourage rote learning.
3.15      Most public general secondary schools have no laboratories or work-
shops. Libraries are inadequate. Equipment for modern teaching is lacking
although some schools have recently adopted new methods in teaching mathe-
matics and science. There are a few good private schools but the majority
are no better than the public schools.
3.16      Almost all graduates from the upper secondary (Bachillerato) level
proceed to further education. Of the Plan Basico graduates, about 60 per-
cent continue on to the higher forms; the remaining 40 percent go to the
labor market where many experience considerable difficulty in finding employ-
ment.



- 6 -
3.17      Industrial secondary schools are found in 20 of 22 provinces.
In 1965, these schools, of which 85 percent are public, trained 16,500 as
skilled workers and a much smaller number as middle-level technicians.
The supply of middle-level technicians to the labor market was 700 in 1965
and is expected to increase to 1,700 in 1970 through better use of existing
facilities and some expansion of private education. The standard of the
industrial schools is low. The graduates have generally found jobs due to
the shortage of skilled workers and middle-level technicians of any kind;
however, neither students nor employers appear satisfied with the education
received. The government considers that the need for more middle-level tech-
nicians could be met within a framework of comprehensive education and in-
service training courses (compare paras. 4.03 and 3.21) more efficiently
than by construction of new vocational schools.
3.18      Agricultural education is offered in 43 public agricultural schools
at junior secondary and primary level. Enrollment was 4,000 students in
1965. The typical agricultural school operates in a rented building without
laboratories and other special facilities. A 25 ha farm with some equip-
ment and livestock is usually available. The quality of the graduates is low.
The schools do not meet the demand which is for skilled farmers or middle-
level agricultural technicians. Very few graduates take up farming: most
proceed to further education and those who enter employment receive inferior
posts in public agencies. The agricultural schools have not achieved what
has been expected from them and the government will review its policy in
this sector. The on-going reform of agricultural education at secondary and
post-secondary level should be combined with a gradual reduction of the
number of agricultural schools at primary levels.
3.19      Seven agricultural institutes at senior secondary and post-secondary
level offer specialized training of a terminal character. Enrollment was 550
students in 1965. The graduates from these institutes are in demand and find
well-paid employment but a problem has been the greater prestige attached to
entry into the academic schools. However, three of the institutes are being
reorganized, expanded and improved under a UNDP Special Fund Project. The
introduction of agricultural options into general secondary schools should
help to direct students to the institutes, particularly after the latter are
upgraded, and so increase the output of agricultural middle-level technicians
from 60 in 1965 to 380 in 1970.
3.20      Commercial schools had 49,000 students in 1965; output was 6,400.
Three-fourths of these schools are private. Secretarial courses are most
common and employers are generally satisfied with the graduates. The overall
school output is higher than the estimated manpower requirements for this
type of worker but the demand exceeds the supply because 80 percent of the
students are girls; some graduates never enter the labor market and others
stay only a short time before leaving to marry. There is a lack of facilities
for training in modern business methods in accounting and bookkeeping.

3.21      Apprenticeship and on-the-Job training programs are organized by
Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje (SENA), an autonomous government agency.
SENA operates 52 training centers as part of the program. The quality of
the training is excellent and the courses enjoy a high reputation among
employers. The courses vary in length from a few weeks to three years and
cover industry, agriculture, commerce and social service. The training
program covered 23,100 people in 1965: 9,900 in industry, 4,600 in agricul-
ture, 8,400 in commerce and 200 in social services.
3.22      Informal agricultural training is also provided by several other
agencies and extension services as, for example, the coffee industry which
operates 21 rural education centers.
Primary Teacher Training
3.23      In 1965, there were 57,000 students in primary teacher training
colleges. These provide a four-year course following completion of primary
education and a two-year course based upon a junior secondary course. Girls
formed 80 percent of the enrollment. One-third of the colleges are private.
The output from the two graduation levels, 5,000 in 1965, is planned to in-
crease to 14,000 in 1970. Overproduction of 7,000 primary teachers is fore-
seen for 1975 and indicates a need to review expansion plans (para. 4.04).
Secondary Teacher Training
3.24      Projections for the decade 1965-75 show that 31,000 secondary
teachers should be trained to fill replacement and new posts to meet the
projected rise in public secondary school enrollment. The estimated supply
from twelve university faculties of education and other institutions is
16,000; this estimate is based on an increase in the annual output from 500
in 1965 to 3,000 in 1975. Three thousand unqualified teachers are at present
in the public education system; the majority of whom could be upgraded during
the period. Disregarding private school needs, a shortage of 12,000 teachers
would still remain.  The government will, therefore, start additidnal training
programs    (paras. 4.04 & 5.18).
3.25      Improved teacher training is expected from the three main univer-
sities - Universidad Nacional, del Valle and de Antioquia - which,with the
help of a proposed UNDP project, should be able to make significant improve-
ments in their physical facilities, reform their curricula and reduce dropout.
Higher Education
3.26      In 1965, higher education was given to 37,000 students in 31 national
and private universities. Private universities account for 44 percent of the
students. In addition, outside the university system, there are numerous
post-secondary institutes with a total enrollment of 6,000 students. The out-
put of university graduates was 4,500 in 1965. The completion rate is lowest
in engineering and education where only one student out of three graduates.



- 8 -
3.27      Higher institutions have multiplied to a point at which acceptable
standards cannot be maintained; many of the institutions would not be regarded
as offering higher education by international standards. The government is
aware of this and a program has been launched, (a) to strengthen the semi-
official National University Fund (El Fondo Universitario Nacional) in plan-
ning, financing and administration of the universities, (b) to adjust student
intake more nearly to manpower demand, (c) to make student admission policy
more rigorous, (d) to improve staff training, and (e) to adopt (through
legislation) minimum standards of staff and physical facilities. Several
agencies are assisting the Colombian Government in this program to improve
higher education (para. 3.30).
3.28      The official forecast for enrollment in higher education by 1975
is 199,000. However, a survey of higher education started in 1966 by the
University Fund and financed jointly with USAID does not corroborate this
figure. On the contrary, such an expansion would result in an over-production
of university graduates in a number of fields, even if only public univer-
sities are considered (para. 4.04). The future enrollments in higher educa-
tion are predicated on the continuing expansion of the secondary system. If
expansion at the secondary level should continue to emphasize academic paths
of learning, there would probably be no alternative to over-expansion of
higher education -- public pressure might demand it. Thus, there is an
urgent need to restructure the system and create socially acceptable terminal
points below the university level. This could save expensive over-investment
in higher learning and provide trained middle-level manpower essential to
economic growth.
Foreign Aid
3.29      Most foreign assistance for education in Colombia has been con-
centrated on higher education with particular emphasis on science facilities,
administrative and financial organization, teacher training and agricultural
teaching and research. The principal agencies have been UNDP, the Inter-
American Development Bank, USAID and Ford and Rockefeller Foundations.
3.30      External assistance is expected to continue with emphasis on second-
ary as well as university education. UiNDP is considering a secondary teacher
training project in the three main universities. The Inter-American Develop-
ment Bank plans to disburse some US$18.4 million equivalent to Colombian
universities in 1968 through 1970. USAID is expected to provide continued
technical assistance for secondary education (paras. 5.13, 5.15, 5.16).
4. THE NEED FOR EXPANSION AND IMPROVEMENT
OF SECONDARY EDUCATIOiN
Quantitative Need
4.01      The only general manpower study in Colombia was published in 1964
by Instituto Colombiano de Especializacion Tecnica en el Exterior (ICETEX).
This is based upon an incomplete sample with the agricultural and commercial



- 9 -
sectors under-represented. The Bank obtained a rmcre satisfactory basis for
projecting future manpower demands by using data from the 1964 census which in-
cluded a complete inventory of occupations; these were then tabulated by broad
economic sectors and educational attainments. The 1965-75 manpower demand pro-
jection is based on the Colombia Planning Department estimates of 1965-75 output
and productivity by sector. An annual increase of 6 percent in GDP in real terms
is assumed.
4.02      In terms of educational investment priorities, the major gaps and re-
sulting constraints to further economic development in industry and agriculture
are in secondary education. This is supported by discussions with public
authorities and private enterprises which confirm that current outputs of middle-
level technicians from schools and training centers are too low.
4.03      However, the government plans to restructure the education system in
such a way that students move away from academic education into various fields
of middle-level vocational training. These plans involve some expansion but
more important, a change from the present system where nearly all upper-cycle
secondary education is preparation for university entrance to a diversified
upper-cycle which, while providing a sound secondary education includes tech-
nical options such as industrial, agricultural and commercial subjects.
4.04      The effect of the plans to restructure public education is tabulated
below. The estimated aggregate supply at the current rate of school and uni-
versity graduates entering the labor market in 1965-1975 is compared with the
supply from the proposed expanded system. The table also shows how the labor
market demand would be met. Annex 8 gives further details.

- 10 -
On the supply side the total number of secondary school graduates would in-
crease from 252,000 to 264,000. The shortage of middle-level manpower in
industry and agriculture would be reduced from 20,000 to 6,000 in the pro-
jected period and the ratio of academic graduates to vocational graduates
in public schools wqould be reduced from 5:1 in 1965 to less than 2:1 in
1975. The possible expansion of private secondary education is not con-
sidered in the table. It is the experience that such expansion would take
place in general and commercial education, which would close the gap of
13,000 in that sector in 1976. There would be a considerable over-supply
of primary teachers and an even greater surplus of high level manpower.
This surplus remains even if a number of graduates in other sectors of high-
er education are used to cover the short-fall in the number of secondary
school teachers.
4.05      Even allowiing for the limited accuracy of manpower projections,
the government's secondary school program with high emphasis on vocational
subjects is justified. The intake to primary teacher training colleges and
higher education must, however, be restricted.
Qualitative Need
4.06      A qualitative improvement of Colombia's secondary school system
is needed. The number of repeaters, dropouts and failures must be reduced.
The comprehensive school system with emphasis on science and prevocational
and vocational options which is being introduced by the government should
provide the improvement needed but also necessitates modern facilities and
well-trained teachers.
4.07      Few of the existing secondary schools in Colombia would be suitable
for conversion into comprehensive schools. They occupy rented private houses
and cannot be remodeled or expanded to provide for adequate teaching of a
curriculum with practical as well as academic subjects or permit an economical
student:teacher ratio. Very few schools - vocational or academic - have the
necessary equipment for teaching modern courses in science, agriculture,
engineering, commerce or social services.
5. THE PROJECT
5.01      The proposed project would comprise the construction and equipment
of ten comprehensive secondary schools (Institutos Nacionales de Educacion
Media, INEI). There would be six main study options:   humanities, science,
engineering, agriculture, commerce, social service. Total enrollment of
these schools would be 48,000 students. The schools would be two-sessional,
with half the students attending in the mornings and the other half in the
afternoons.  Estimated annual output would be 7,300 bachilleres, three-fourths
of whom  would be in prevocational streams.  All schools would be day schools.
A total of ten staff houses would be included. The cost is estimated at
US$15.2 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of us$5.4
million equivalent. The project would be implemented during 1968-71, and the
schools would be fully utilized with double shifts in 1975.



- 11 -
5.02      The government has proJected an increase in public general second-
ary school enrollment from 119,000 in 1965 to 300,000 in 1975. The ten INEM
project schools would provide 27 percent of the new places. The government
has planned to construct an additional nine INEM schools with 35,000 students
in a second phase; comprehensive education would then be offered to 28 per-
cent of all students in public general secondary education in 1975.
5.03      All project schools would offer a six-year course and would be co-
educational. They are located in departmental capitals and enrollments vary
with the population of the catchment areas for each school from 3,140 to 6,o80
students per school (Map, Annex 9). These large enrollment figures would
permit significant economies, not only in physical construction, but also in
administration and staffing. There would be a high utilization of teaching
facilities and consequently a low cost per student. The educational program
offered would be more diversified and the staff would encompass more special-
ized skills than is possible in smaller schools.
Aim and Content
5.04      The education program in the INEMI schools would differ markedly
from the existing school programs in Colombia. A number of general subjects5
such as Spanish, foreign languages, social studies, mathematics, science,
arts and physical education, would be core subjects but vocational orien-
tation and study methods would also belong to this common core. All sub-
jects would be compulsory in the first two grades but there would be an in-
creasing number of options in the higher grades, with approximately 40 per-
cent of the time devoted to specializations in various fields, such as
humanities, science, mechanical and electrical science, industrial chemistry,
construction, agriculture, secretarial courses, accounting or social services.
Guidance counsellors would assist the students in choosing suitable options
and remedial teachers would be available for special tuition.
5.05      The schools would not all have the same options. Overall, however,
student placement or choice among the various streams would conform with es-
timated labor market demands and take cognizance that almost half of the stu-
dents would be girls. The distribution of students between options would be
approximately as follows:
Humanities        11%
Science           12%
Engineering       24%
Commerce          30%
Agriculture       13%
Social Services   10%
5.06      The graduates from these prevocational streams should not be
regarded as fully trained. Further training would be required, either on-
the-job or in courses to be organized by SENA or agricultural organizations.
They would, however, have had a good induction into skills as a basis for
further training. Commercial graduates would be an exception in that they
could, in general, enter employment upon leaving school.



- 12 -
5.07      The close cooperation of agriculture, commerce and industry will
be required to keep the practical courses up-to-date and suited to employment
needs. These requirements, plus the general need to develop close links
with employers, would be met by the establishment of local advisory
committees comprising representatives of public and private agencies and
enterprises. The committees would also be valuable links with the community,
advising the school on practical subjects, assisting with vacation employ-
ment and with placement after graduation. The Banlt has received assurance
from the Government that such committees will be formed for all project
schools. Further, the proposed school design will permit future use of
computerized educational data processing to raise administrative efficiency.
5.o8      The schools would also cooperate with SENA and agricultural
institutes in order to keep their subject matter up-to-date and, where
practicable, complementary. Where INEM schools are located close to SENA
and agricultural training centers, it might be advantageous to hire part-time
instructors from these organizations.
5.09      The curricula, of INEM schools would minimize the unpopularity which
attaches to vocational education at the secondary level. The practical
streams would offer prevocational training, thus preparing students for
employment or further technical training, but these streams would also include
sufficient academic education to enable students to proceed to post-secondary
institutes or universities.
5.10      About one-fourth of INEM students are expected to choose academic
streams. The curricula in these streams would differ from the existing
general secondary schools in that, in the first two years, there would be
mandatory courses in agriculture, engineering, commerce or social services
added to the academic subjects in order to give academic students an under-
standing of and interest in economic pursuits. These practical courses
would be regarded as part of general education, just as are courses in
philosophy, history, etc.
5.11      At the end of the six years, all successful students would receive
a bachillerato degree, regardless of option. It is essential that the
universities in Colombia should formally recognize the degree awarded by
these schools and an assurance to this effect has been received.
5.12      The physical facilities and equipment of the INEM schools will
support the practical subjects contained in the curricula. There will be
separate laboratories for each science subject, language laboratories,
office practice rooms and workshops for each engineering subject. Some
rooms will be designed so that they can be combined for large-group team-
teaching. Other provisions will also be made for future use of instruc-
tional television in the project schools. As stated earlier, these modern
facilities would have high utilization ratios because of the size of each
project school.
5.13      The preparation of new curricula for the INEM schools has already
begun with technical assistance from USAID and this assistance is to
continue. Assistance and cooperation will be secured from SENA and inter-
ested employer groups (para. 5.08). It is important that the revised
syllabi should be completed in early 1969.



- 13 -
Administrative Staff
5.14      Because of their size, the DIEM schools will be able to provide
administrative services that are not found in the existing secondary schools.
As an example, the largest of the project schools, in Bogota, would have
6,080 students and 240 teachers with the student body divided into separate
administrative sub-units of 1,000 students (500 in each shift). It would
have a non-teaching staff of 140 including principal, 6 vice-principals,
administrative director, librarian, counsellors, health, clerical and main-
tenance personnel and provide various kinds of specialized service. Even
so, the student:staff ratio would be 45:1 against the 30:1 ratio found in
existing secondary schools. The administrative services at the Bogota school
would thus be better and cheaper than is found in the small existing schools.
5.15      The size and administrative complexity of each project school under-
lines the need for highly skilled administrators. USAID has launched a
training program for Colombian school administrators; 17 Colombians are now
on a one-year course in the U.S.A. Additional administrators will receive
similar training in 1969.
5.16      School guidance and counselling is a relatively new concept in
Colombia. Some universities have courses for preparing guidance counsellors
but over the short-term there is a good case for sending counsellors abroad
for training. Therefore, approximately 16 counsellors would be trained in
1968 and 1969 through USAID in a University of New Mexico program.
Teachers
5.17      A valuable feature of the INEM schools would be the diversified
teaching staff and again, due to economies of scale, the use of the teaching
force would be efficient; the student:teacher ratio would be 25:1, as com-
pared with 13:1 in existing schools. The majority of the INEM teachers would
be employed full-time.
5.18      The government is expanding the training of secondary teachers
within the regular university framework (para. 3.24). Special accelerated
training courses are, however, needed for the INEM schools. They would in-
volve upgrading 1,000 secondary teachers selected from schools all over Co-
lombia, training 750 professionals from other careers, and special courses
for 1,750 university students. This program, for which a schedule has been
prepared, would start with 1,000 participants, no later than 1968, in the
three main universities. Assurances as to its implementation have been ob-
tained from the Colombian Government.
Cost of Project
5.19      The estimated capital costs of the various components of the pro-
ject are shown in the table (Annex 10 gives further details). The total
cost of the project would be the equivalent of US$15.2 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$5.h million equivalent.

Total cost of project        15.15          100           5.43
5.20      The Government of Colombia is providing the sites without cost
to the project. Suitable sites have been selected for all 10 schools but
not all have been acquired. To assure prompt start of construction, acqui-
sition of sites for the project schools would be a condition of effective-
ness.
5.21      The construction cost estimates for the proposed project have been
derived from recent school building experience in Bogota, with data on square
meter costs adjusted for the particular type of space involved and regional
differences in costs.  The average building cost per m  at US$44 equivalent
includes an allowance for earthquake protection. Based upon recent price
trends (para. 5.27), an allowance of 7 percent is included to cover the
anticipated real rise in building costs during the implementation period
of four years. A further 10 percent has been allowed for unforeseen
construction and site development costs to make a total contingency allowance
of 17 percent. Specific building costs would differ from the average de-
pending on regional variations.
5.22      Equipment and furniture lists have been reviewed and are reason-
able in scale and estimated costs. A contingency provision of 12 percent
is included to meet the possibility of rising costs.
5.23      Schedules of acc2mmodation (Annex 11) give an average gross area
per student place of 6.6 m ; this is economical for this type of school.
Classrooms, laboratories and workshops are for classes of 40 students; the



- 15 -
average space utilization, 55 periods -i week, is very high, due to the double-
shift system. The gymnasium will be multi-functional, serving also for group
teaching, examinations and as a snack area. Due to the size of the schools
and site limitations, it is expected that most schools will be designed as
two or three story buildings. The accommodation schedules allow for double
shift use of the schools and a clause has been included in the proposed loan
agreement to ensure that double shift working is employed.
5.24      On a double-shift basis, excluding contingencies site development
and professional fees, the construction cost per pupil is US$140; furnitura
cost per pupil is US$33; and equipment cost per pupil is US$63. The total
capital cost per pupil at US$275 equivalent, is reasonable for this type of
school. The total capital cost per pupil would be much higher, about US$460,
if these schools were to function an a single-shift basis (35 perioc a week
space utilization). The foreign exchange component of US$5.4 million equivalent
is about 36 percent of the total project cost and this component is estimated
at 18 percent of construction, 10 percent of site development, 25 percent of
furniture and 100 percent of equipment.
5.25      It is estimated that the recurrent costs generated by the proposed
ten schools would amount in 1965 prices to pesos 56 million per year by 1972.
However, the mission regards the budgeted salaries for teachers in the pro-
ject schools as too low to attract the necessary number of competent teachers
on a full-time basis.  This adjustment might raise recurrent costs to pesos
70 million in 1972, about US$113 1/ equivalent, per pupil each year which
is reasonable and within Colombia's financial capacity. (Paras. 6.06, 6.09).
Building Construction
5.26      The standards cf architectural design and building construction
vary considerably throughout the country; imaginative design and good con-
struction are found in Bogota and the larger towns. There are no national
building by-laws but larger towns have safety and health regulations. Ar-
chitectural and engineering practice follow acceptable procedures.
5.27      The construction industryts share in GDP represents only about 3
percent. In recent years the total building activity has decreased from
3 percent of GDP in 1960 to 2.6 percent in 1966. Construction costs have
remained fairly stable. During 1960-66, material costs increased by an
average of 4 percent and labor costs by 1.9 percent per year.
5.28      There are about 700 building contracting firms in the country.
About a third of these firms have experience in large size projects and
belong to the contractors' association. While the hub of the building
and construction industry is at Bogota, there is a good geographic dis-
tribution of capable contractors in the larger towns where the project
schools would be built.

5.29      A large proportion of building materials is locally manufactured
but with a high component of imported raw materials; this is also true of
school furniture, which usually is made of tubular metal. Sanitary and
electrical fixtures and practically all specialized instructional equip-
ment are imported.
5.30      The architectural section within OAPEC has been responsible for
the coordination and implementation of the Ministry's building program.
This unit is involved in a reorganization which should improve its capa-
bilities (para. 3.05). For the country as a whole, there are about 1,200
architects and some 2,000 engineers who are engaged in the building industry.
A number of local firms of architects and engineers have worked on school
projects and are well qualified and experienced.
5.31      Tendering is normally public; it is advertised in the local press
and radio. Bids are considered by a special tender committee; the lowest
evaluated bid is usually accepted.
Execution of the Project
5.32      The government has decided to establish within OAPEC a unit for
implementation of the project. This unit under a project director would
be responsible for school construction and curriculum revision, as well as
for the coordination of teacher training. Implementation scheduling has
been analyzed by the PERT technique and the results should prove very use-
ful. The part of the unit dealing with physical implementation should in-
clude an experienced and competent architect, an educator knowledgeable in
school construction and administration, and an official experienced in
accounting and auditing procedures; all of these executives should have
full-time appointments. Appointments to the posts of project director,
architect and educator should be subject to Bank approval. The project
unit should have the necessary supporting staff to carry out preparation
of (i) educational specifications for the teaching accommodation; (ii)
basic designs and architectural briefs; (iii) final furniture and equip-
ment lists.
5.33      The itinistry of Education has a7reed to emnloy consultants
acceptable to the Bank for the desi7n and supervision of the project.
Superintendence of construction would be the responsibility of the
architectural section within OAPEC.
5.34      International competitive bidding for the supply of all equipment
and furniture and for the construction of the schools would be used for the
proposed project.   Items would be grouped to the maximum extent practicable
to form sizeable bid packages and to permit bulk procurement. Procedures
for the prequalification of contractors and selection of consultants would
be acceptable to the Bank.
5.35      Administrative and financial procedures would be established for
the proper maintenance of the buildings.  Assurances have been obtained from
the governmrent during negotiations that adequate funds will be provided for
satisfactory maintenance of the schools and supplies of educational materials.

Loan and Disbursements
5.36      A Bank loan of US$7.6 million would represent 50 percent of
the total estimated project cost. It would cover the estimated foreign ex-
change component and 22 percent of local costs. The government would pro-
vide the balance of funds necessary for the project.
5.37      The Bank would disburse or reimburse (i) 100 percent of foreign
exchange costs for equipment and furniture procured abroad, and (ii) on a
percentage basis for civil works, professional fees and locally procured
furniture. In case of a change in the total cost of the project, this
percentage would be adjusted at the Bank's option, in order to spread
disbursements throughout the construction period, and to the extent prac-
ticable to maintain an average contribution of 50 percent by the Bank
towards the total cost of the project. The funds would be disbursed over
a four-year period (Annexes 12a, 12b). Any funds that are not disbursed
at the completion of the project would be available for cancellation.
6. COST OF EDUCATION
Financing of Education
6.01      The major responsibility for financing primary and secondary edu-
cation, including vocational schools and primary teacher training insti-
tues, rests with the Central Government and the Departmental Governments.
The contribution of municipalities is small. The departments have diffi-
culties in meeting the rising costs of primary education and the Central
Government has, therefore, absorbed an increasing part of teacher salaries.
To help meet continued difficulties, a tax on liquor sales was earmarked
to departments in 1966 for the purpose of paying teachers' salaries.   In
1968, additional funds deriving from a percentage of the general sales tax
is expected to become available to the departments to meet the planned en-
rollment expansion in education. The revenue from this tax, together with
an increase in the land tax, should assure more continuity in the local
financing of education.
6.02      Informal vocational training is mainly in the hands of SENA
(para. 3.21). SENA funds, financed by a 2 percent payroll tax on all enter-
prises with more than ten employees, are sufficient to provide the orga-
nization with good teaching facilities and a well-paid staff of instructors.
6.03      Universities are administratively autonomous. Finance from the
government is drawn from the National University Fund (para. 3.27), which
receives transfers from the Ministry of Education and makes the allocations.
The government has not yet established controls over how its funds are used,
i.e., for recurrent or investment purposes. A current university study
(para. 3.28) should provide valuable information on projected expansion
plans and how these would be financed.

Expenditure on Education, 1960-65
6.04      Total public expenditure on formal education rose by more than
8 percent per year in constant prices from 1960 during the first half of
the decade.  In 1965, actual expenditures amounted to pesos 1,516 million.
Of the total, expenditures by the Ministry of Education accounted for pe-
sos 782 million; other ministries spent pesos 104 million. Departments
and municipalities spent pesos 580 million. SENA and other official and
semi-official entities contributed approximately pesos 178 million on in-
formal education. When contributions from the private sector are included,
total expenditure on education in 1965 amounted to pesos 2,304 million, or
3.9 percent of GDP (Annex 13).
6.05      Between 1960 and 1965, the Ministry of Education total budget, as
a percentage of Central Government expenditures, increased from 9.7 percent
to 13.5 percent. The Mlinistry1s investment expenditures declined, both in
relative and absolute terms, falling from 20 percent to 10 percent of total
expenditure due to slow implementation of school projects (para. 3.05). Re-
current expenditures increased, with the funds being mainly transferred to
departments and universities; at the departmental level, most revenues were
channelled to secondary education, and as one exception to the increase in
recurrent costs, administrative expenses have been fairly stable due to a
prudent wage policy. Annexes 14 and 15 show recurrent expenditures by main
sectors.
6.06      When related to the educational facilities and services supported,
the recurrent cost per secondary student, US$174 per year, is considered
relatively high. The recurrent cost per student in the INEM schools would
be considerably lower or US$113 per year (para. 5.25).
Expenditures on Education, 1965-72
6.07      Over 1968-72 the total public investment needed to match the
planned school expansion is projected as follows: pesos 700 million for
primary, 740 million for secdndary and 300 million for higher education
(Annex 16). The domestic counterpart funds for the proposed Bank project
(pesos 88 million at 1965 prices) would represent 12 percent of total pro-
jected public investment in secondary education.
6.08      Recurrent expenditure in secondary and higher education would in-
crease very rapidly in the period ahead, under current plans. Secondary edu-
cation would increase by 16 percent per year, about twice the yearly increase
for primary education (Annex 16). The INEM schools would account for only
a small fraction of the recurrent budget in 1972 or pesos 70 million.
6.og      While significant reduction could and should be made in some
aspects of the total program, the projected increase in public expenditure
on education, from pesos 1,516 million in 1965 to pesos 2,600 million in
1972, indicates how small a portion of the total is represented by the project.
Public education expenditure would rise from 2.6 percent to 3.0 percent of



- 19 -
GDP. As a percentage of total tax revenue, they would decline from 26 per-
cent in 1965 to 20 percent in 1972, since total tax revenue is projected to
double in the same period. This decrease does not justify the government's
projected program, but the fiscal improvement indicates that the Colombian
Government would be able to meet both capital and recurrent expenses caused
by the proposed project. The ongoing family planning program is expected
to improve the situation further in the 1980's by a 15 percent cost saving
in public primary education. But, it is emphasized that Colombia has many
pressing uses for these fiscal resources; expenditure on education should
be regarded in terms of its component parts and how each contributes to
national objectives.

7. CONCLUSIONS AID RECOMMNDATIONS
Conclusions
7.01      During 1965-75, Colombia's requirements for skilled manpower call
for 277,000 at middle-level and 541,000 at professional levels to enter the
labor market. The existing secondary school system cannot meet the demand
and must, therefore, expand and the present structure is not fully respon-
sive to types of manpower needs (para. 4.04).
7.02      While the proposed project would make a direct contribution to
meeting the demand for middle-level technicians -- three-fourths of the
annual output of 7,300 from upper secondary would have prevocational training
-- its main purpose would be to introduce a new concept of education into
the system, with emphasis on the basic preparation of skilled manpower for
industry and agriculture (para. 5.04).
7.03      The project schools would be located in major cities and have
catchment areas with a sufficient number of adequately trained primary
school leavers (para. 5.03).
7.04      The supply of administrative staff, guidance counsellors and
secondary teachers will be sufficient if the scheduled training programs
are fully implemented (paras. 5.15, 5.16, 5.18).
7.05      Modern school buildings and equipment would permit efficient
teaching. The building designs would conform to acceptable standards.
The utilization of the facilities would be very high due to adoption of the
double-shift system. Furniture and equipment lists are adequate and
economical. (Paras. 5.22, 5.23).
7.06      There is an adequate number of competent contractors in Colombia
to carry out the project. No shortage exists of competent architects and
engineers. (Paras. 5.28, 5.30).
7.07      Procurement procedures would be in accord with Bank guidelines
(para. 5.34).
7.o8      The proposed project would account for a very small part of edu-
cational expenditures (paras. 6.08, 6.09).
Assurances and Recommendations
7.09      Satisfactory assurances have been obtained during loan negotiations
that the following actions have been or will be taken by the Government of
Colombias



- 21 -
(a) Execution of the ongoing reorganization of the Ministry of
Education to expedite teaching reforms, ensure continuous
training and upgrading of teachers and improve budget
practice, educational planning, school construction and
educational supervision (paras. 3.0h and 3.05).
(b) Review of agricultural education at primary and secondary
level to commence not later than January, 1969 (para. 3.18).
(c) Continuation of the present policy of diverting students
from academic to prevocat_onal or vocational streams in
secondary education and thereby increasing the supply of
skiUed middle-level manpower and avoiding over production
of university graduates (paras. 3.27, 4.o3, 4.05).
(d) Formation of local advisory committees and cooperation with
SENA and appropriate agricultural organizations for curriculum
revision and the establishment of complementary courses
(paras. 5.06, 5.07, 5.08, 5.13).
(e) Completion of curriculum revision for IliEYi schools by April,
1969 (para. 5.13).
(f) University recognition that all INM graduates would qualify for
university entrance (para. 5.11).
(g) Training of administrative staff, guidance counsellors and
teachers for the project schools (paras. 5.15, 5.16, 5.18).
(h) Appointment of a majority of fTull-time, qualified teachers
in all project schools under improved conditions of service
(paras. 5.17, 5.25).
(i) Engagement of consultants to design and supervise construction
of the project schools (para. 5.33).
(j) Provision of adequate funds for satisfactory maintenance of
schools and supplies of educational materials (para. 5.35).
7.10    As conditions of effectiveness of the loan, the government has agreed
to (i) acquire all sites for the project schools (para. 5.20) and (ii) esta-
blish a project unit within QAPEC for the execution of the proposed project.
The project director, architect and educator would be acceptable to the Bank
and the architect and educator employed full-time on the project (para. 5.32).
7.11    The project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US $7.6 million
equivalent which would amount to about 50 percent of the estimated project
cost of US $15.2 million equivalent. It is proposed that the loan should be
for 25 years including a grace period of ten years. Foreign exchange costs
are estimated at US $5.4 million (paras. 5.19, 5.36).

g Mission projection of expenditures on formal education, excluding practical
training, based on official enrollment projections.
j/ In order to avoid a surplus of primary teachers, the enrollment in primary
teacher training should be reduced. The ensuing savings would amount to
pesos 105 million in 1968-72.
Fees in public secondary education started in 1967.
2   In order to meet the deficit of middle-level teachers, an additional public
secondary teacher training program will be necessary. For this purpose, on
the assumption that this program starts in 1968, an additional expenditure
of pesos 109 million is required in 1968-72, of which pesos 26 million is
the cost of training teachers for the 10 proposed project schools.
