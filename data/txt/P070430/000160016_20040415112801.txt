3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

This project was part of the first phase of an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) operation in St. Kitts and Nevis,
St. Lucia, Dominica, Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The program aimed to support the physical
and institutional efforts of the five member countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to
strengthen disaster recovery capacity and emergency preparedness management. The nations' low level of
preparedness, lack of mitigating measures and limited disaster response capability had been evidenced by the
devastating impact of Hurricane Georges on St. Kitts and Nevis in September 1998.

    l     The first phase of the program (APL1) was to support the immediate reconstruction and rehabilitation of
          infrastructure in St. Kitts and Nevis and disaster mitigation works and institutional strengthening in St.
          Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and Dominica.

    l     The second phase (APL2) was to support these same activities in Grenada and St. Vincent and the
          Grenadines.

    l     APL3 was to focus on additional physical investments identified through hazard mapping analysis and
          was to provide further long term institutional strengthening. Funding for this phase was eventually
          allocated to APL2. As a result APL3 did not materialized as originally expected.

    l     APL4 was to provide contingency funding for any eligible OECS member in case of a severe natural
          disaster during the six year program period. Funding for this phase remains available until the
          completion of APL2 expected for January 31, 2006.

It was considered at the time that setting up individual loans for all five countries involved in the program would
be inefficient. As a result, the Bank opted to set up a regional facility to address disaster risks rather than a series
of emergency operations with individual countries. The typical APL approach was modified to provide an
horizontal dimension that would allow countries to join in different phases based on their stages of preparation
(APL 1-3). At the same time, it was also considered more efficient and forward looking to set up a contingent
facility with allowance for post-catastrophe mitigation work that could be called upon in the event of a natural
disaster during project implementation (APL4). The emergency funding would take advantage of the shared risk
characteristics of the group of countries.

The development objectives of the project in St. Lucia were:

    l     To strengthen key economic and social infrastructure and facilities with the aim of minimizing damage
          caused by future natural disasters and reducing the disruption of economic activity in the event of disaster
          emergencies (pre-disaster works);

    l     To reconstruct and rehabilitate key social and economic infrastructure following disasters to allow quick
          recovery and minimize disruption of economic activity (post-disaster works); and

    l     To strengthen the country's institutional capacities to prepare for and respond to disaster emergencies in
          an efficient and effective manner.

The objectives were clearly stated and relevant to the situation of St. Lucia, which has long been vulnerable to
severe storms and hurricanes resulting in loss of life and infrastructure and property damage. The project financed
structural and non-structural measures to protect people, infrastructure and property from future hurricane damage.
In addition, it sought to build institutional capacity at the national and local levels, including the public and private
sectors, in order to confront natural disasters more effectively in the future.

The project supported two principal goals of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS): supporting infrastructure and
safeguarding the economy. However, the CAS contained no explicit reference to disaster management. This issue
was addressed in an updating economic memorandum which was circulated to the Board in conjunction with the

1998 Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for the project and had a clear reference to disaster management
reduction as an important objective of the CAS. The first and third objectives were most relevant to St. Lucia at
the time of entry, since there had been no recent hurricane for which reconstruction was necessary.

3.2 Revised Objective:

The objectives were not revised

3.3 Original Components:

I. Physical Prevention and Mitigation Works. Strengthen public infrastructure and retrofit public buildings to be
used as shelters (US$ 5.94 million)

    l    Hewanorra Airport Flood Protection Works: Flood protection works, including a hydrological assessment
         of a river and, detailed engineering for sea defenses of the airport and a ring road and an assessment of
         nearby beach movement. (Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport and Public Utilities -
         MCWTPU together with St. Lucia Air and Sea Ports Authority - SLASPA).

    l    Bridges and River Training: Bridges and river training works at Marc Floissac and Caico, including the
         acquisition of a stock of Bailey-type bridges. Studies of floods. Strengthening capacity at MCWTPU by
         providing Bailey-type components and replenishing the stock of gabions (heavy wire baskets used to build
         small-scale drainage works when filled with rocks).

    l    Cul de Sac Valley flood prevention works: Bridge construction, drainage, embankment works and raising
         the West Coast Road (MCWTPU).

    l    Supplementary reservoir for Victoria Hospital (MCWTPU).

    l    Disaster Management (Shelter) Program: Retrofitting schools as emergency facilities and installing
         sanitary facilities. Capacity building, emergency equipment and improved security (Ministry of
         Education, Human Resources Development, Youth and Sports ­ MEHRDYS)

II. Strengthening the Office of Disaster Preparedness (ODP) (US$ 0.86 million)

    l    Technical assistance to the National Office of Disaster Preparedness: Capacity building in disaster
         preparedness and management, technical assistance for mobilizing support from businesses and industries
         and emergency planning and mitigation activities.

    l    Emergency communications system: A system to communicate among all national and local levels,
         including base station radios, repeaters, and mobile radios for District Committees.

    l    Disaster equipment and loss reduction materials: Provision of stocks of emergency supplies and "loss
         reduction materials" such as generators, water purification equipment, plastic sheeting, chain saws,
         lanterns, and first aid supplies (managed by ODP; stored locally).

III. Strengthening the Early Warning System (US$ 0.44 million)

    l    Support for the National Meteorological Service (NMS): provision of an enhanced satellite receiving
         station with high-resolution imaging. Upgrading a Star IV computer terminal, a component of the World
         Area Forecast System. Providing Computer equipment to acquire and distributing meteorological and

         provided training in organization and functions of the committee and in "Surviving the Next Disaster,"
         and other skills such as search and rescue and donations management. External sources of assistance
         were to be sought. Disaster committees would be provided with emergency equipment and disaster
         supplies to be stored in a safe place.

V. Institution Building (US$ 0.24 million)

    l    Vulnerability Reduction of Public Buildings: An assessment of public buildings to develop optimal
         vulnerability reduction measures through mitigation/retrofitting and/or an insurance strategy to minimize
         risk at a reasonable cost. Review existing building codes and land use planning and recommend
         improvements. Recommend improvements in the insurance sector.

    l    Hazard Analysis/Vulnerability Mapping: Support for the preparation of a hazard and vulnerability map
         for St. Lucia to identify hazards and use the information to plan for disaster preparedness and mitigation.


    l    Building Codes: Pursue adoption of a national building code and its effective enforcement (St Lucia had
         been reviewing its code with help from the Caribbean Disaster Mitigation Project - CDMP).

VI. Project Management (US$ 0.61 million)

    l    Technical assistance, equipment, workshops and audits.

3.4 Revised Components:

A mid-term review took place in January 2002 and the following variation introduced in an amendment to the
loan/credit agreement:

Works on the Cul-de-Sac Valley flood prevention works (bridge construction, drainage, embankment works) were
not undertaken after the feasibility study and environmental assessment because of the high cost. This was an
indication that some components of the original project were overly ambitious and costly. Some of the savings
were allocated at mid-term to a drainage and coastal protection study Dennery. Gabion works were also added at
the end of the project (see section 4.2).

The Community Based Disaster Management Component (IV) was bolstered with a Training and Capacity
Building component. It included five types of training, including community based disaster management, training
for shelter managers, media training, and training for the PCU and NEMO, and institution building.

The equipment procurement and training activities of Community Based Disaster Management were integrated
into the component for providing disaster equipment and loss reduction materials.


3.5 Quality at Entry:

Project preparation was rushed even though implementation capacity was weak at the time. A Project Concept
Document was prepared in June 1998, and the Commonwealth Ministerial Group met with the President of the

World Bank in July 1998. A preparation/pre-appraisal mission visited St. Lucia in September 1998. Negotiations,
Board Approval and Signing were all accomplished in December 1998.

A Quality at Entry Assessment was carried out in March 1999 by QAG for the whole APL program. QAG gave an
overall rating of 2 (satisfactory). Most of the detailed ratings were also graded satisfactory. The project was rated
Highly Satisfactory for strength of borrower ownership, for adequacy of sector knowledge and for the strategy
underpinning the project. QAG also gave a Highly Satisfactory rating to the use of lessons of previous experience.
On the other hand, QAG gave only a Marginal rating for the adequacy of arrangements for mitigation/managing
environmental impacts during implementation, indicating more attention should have been given to strengthening
environmental management capacity. The project was also ranked Marginal on the adequacy of information on
financial management because it was silent on the LACI process. The capacity and incentives of the executing
agency were judged Marginal, because the ministries' capacity was not assessed and the PCU was untested. QAG
felt that institutional risks were not adequately accounted for in project design and performance indicators were too
general. QAG gave an Unsatisfactory rating to social impact monitoring.

There was no immediate emergency situation in St. Lucia at the time of preparation. As a result, the
appropriateness of using the ERL instrument was not justified. Many components were poorly defined during
preparation and had to be reappraised during implementation. In addition, the large number of sub-components
made this a rather complex operation, given the weak institutional capacity and the need to coordinate among
multiple agencies. Also, most of the project's components required a large amount of planning and engineering
design, so rapid implementation was never possible.

To advance preparation, a Disaster Coordinator was appointed at the beginning of the project, and a Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) was set up in the Ministry of Finance to implement the project. However, the PCU had
never managed World Bank loans. Although the loan also provided for expert assistance in line ministries,
implementation capacity remained a problem during the first two years of the project period (see Section 5.3) and
led to long delays in implementation. Therefore this ICR rates quality at entry as unsatisfactory.



4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

The project has supported major advances to meet the development objectives set forth in the PAD:

    l     Key economic and social infrastructure and facilities were strengthened to minimize damage and
          economic disruption from future natural disasters (pre-disaster works). There were important flood
          control, bridge strengthening and flood mitigation works, and schools were retrofitted as emergency
          shelters. A large amount of emergency equipment is now available for use in future disasters (see Section
          4.2).

    l     The objective of rehabilitating social and economic infrastructure following disasters was not relevant in
          St. Lucia at the time.

The country's institutional capacities to prepare for and respond to disaster emergencies were strengthened. A
seven member National Hazard Mitigation Council (NHMC) was established and a Disaster Preparedness and
Response Act was passed in 2000. Other initiatives included: (i) revision of the National Disaster Emergency
Management Plan; (ii) strengthening the liaison with the private sector to implement the Plan; (iii) proposing a
National Building Code and preparing an action plan and legislation for implementation; (iv) strengthening a
hazard analysis and vulnerability mapping group; (v) implementing new procedures at the National Meteorological
Service; (vi) and strengthening the preparedness of communities through NEMO-sponsored training.

Achievement of development objectives is rated satisfactory.

4.2 Outputs by components:

I. Physical Prevention and Mitigation Works. Although some of the works could not be implemented, as indicated
below, implementation was largely successful in strengthening public infrastructure and retrofitting public
buildings to be used as shelters.

    l    Hewanorra Airport Flood Protection Works: The EIA and designs for a drainage scheme were delayed.
         The works contract was only signed in April 2002. This delay was one of the reasons for extending the
         project. The airport is now protected against the floods recurring on average every 20 years. Coastal
         flood protection was postponed after a natural increase in the sand bank was observed.

    l    Bridges and River Training: Designs and EIA were prepared during the first year of the project. Works
         on the Marc Floissac and Caico bridges began in August 2002 and were completed. The stock of Bailey
         metallic bridges was delivered in June 2002. Sixty meters of metallic bridges were procured but only 24
         were used on the Caico Bridge, leaving extra metallic bridge sections for future needs. Because of cost
         savings of US$ 1.5 million, the Bank agreed in November 2002 to finance additional gabion works.
         These works were completed on time with no cost overrun (due diligence checks by the Bank team
         included verification that they did not infringe on the Bank's environmental safeguards).

    l    Cul de Sac Valley bridge reconstruction and Dennery flood prevention works: Designs and a detailed
         environmental assessment were undertaken under the project. However, actual works were cancelled from
         the project because the cost estimates exceeded the amount allocated and it was decided that a detailed
         development plan was required before undertaking the investment. Savings were reallocated for the study
         of coastal protection in Dennery which was completed and recommends a sea wall to protect a large part
         of the town from inundation. Three offshore breakwaters are also recommended to enable eroded beach
         areas to be reconstituted.

    l    Supplementary reservoir for Victoria Hospital: Land acquisition delayed this component, but works are
         now completed. The water reticulation system at the hospital was also upgraded.

    l    Disaster management and strengthening program for schools and libraries: Emergency and sanitary
         facilities were installed in 15 schools (reduced from original 23). A shelter management manual was
         produced, and shelter managers were trained. Emergency equipment was procured for the shelters (fire
         extinguishers, water tanks, plastic sheeting, electric generators). The schools now have cooking and toilet
         facilities. The school principals, designated as shelter managers, trained as emergency managers under
         the project.

II. Strengthening the Office of Disaster Preparedness. (ODP/NEMO - US$ 0.86 million)

    l    Technical assistance to the National Office of Disaster Preparedness (ODP): The ODP was renamed
         National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) in the course of the project. A new Director
         was appointed in 2002. NEMO serves as the secretariat for the National Hazard Mitigation Council
         (NHMC) which is chaired by the Minister of Works and advises him on a range of disaster related issues.
         It coordinates the activities of the District Disaster Committees and chairs a Hazard Analysis and
         Vulnerability Mapping technical working group with NHMC (see item V, Institution Building), A
         Disaster Specialist, a Business Technical Advisor and an Emergency Planning and a Mitigation Technical
         Advisor were employed to assist NEMO during the project.

    l    Emergency communications system: Emergency communications equipment was purchased in 2002. The
         system is designed to communicate among all national and local levels. Potential users have been trained
         and NEMO and the MET office carry out weekly tests of the equipment.

    l    Disaster equipment and loss reduction materials have been procured by NEMO and are stored in central
         government warehouses. Much of this material will be distributed to nine satellite warehouses which are
         almost completed. There are plans to construct an additional nine warehouses. Teams are being trained in
         its use. NEMO and the government Audit Department will audit the district committees to ensure the
         equipment is properly safeguarded.


                                                          - 6 -

III. Strengthening the Early Warning System.

    l    Support for the National Meteorological Service (NMS): Equipment (computers, printers, etc. and
         communications) was installed at Hewanorra and George Charles Airports. Meteorological equipment
         was procured in February 2002. A satellite receiving system was also procured.

    l    Development of a Ham Weather Radio Observation Network: The Ham weather radio equipment was
         purchased in February 2002. There are four stations around the country. Ham station operators were
         trained in March 2002. Because the systems report only basic weather data, they may be upgraded to full
         weather systems.

    l    Development of a Local Flood Warning System: A consultant designed the system (e.g. extent of
         hydrological assessment, communications links). The purchase of equipment (sensors, transmitters,
         repeaters and stations) was completed in December 2002. The system now measures rainfall amounts in
         real time in 14 stations throughout the country.

    l    Technical Assistance and Training: (Training for NMS staff included in item IV).

IV. Training and Capacity Building (revised component)

The training program for each year has been monitored by PCU in coordination with all implementing agencies.
The following types of training were provided:

    l    Community Based Disaster Management: NEMO contracted the Red Cross to provide training modules
         for District Disaster Committees (DDCs). Some 330 people were trained in 148 districts.

    l    Shelter Managers: Training was prepared by the Ministry of Education for shelter managers partly
         financed by OFDA. A manual was prepared for this training and 600 copies prepared. About 98% of all
         school principals were trained.

    l    NMS: Employees were trained in the use of the flood warning system and maintenance of meteorological
         instruments. Equipment for in NMS media training was purchased in 2002 and in 2003.

    l    PCU: Staff were trained in financial management, project management, procurement and consultant
         selection.

    l    NEMO: Training was provided for NEMO staff and technical staff in ministries.

    l    Institution Building: Training for government staff and private contractors was provided in Building
         Codes and Guidelines, and a public awareness campaign was used to generate interest in using the codes,
         even though they were not yet officially adopted. The Ministry of Planning received Geographic
         Information System (GIS) training.

V. Institution Building

    l    Vulnerability Reduction of Public Buildings: An inventory of public buildings was completed by
         MCWTPU providing a basis for the analysis of government assets and identification of vulnerabilities
         which could be incorporated in a possible follow-up project.

    l    Hazard Analysis: The NHMC Hazard Analysis and Vulnerability Mapping technical working group
         undertook an assessment. Consultants produced a series of hazard maps for use at the national level by
         disaster management and government agencies.

    l    Vulnerability Mapping: A GIS plan was promised by the Ministry of Planning but not submitted. Some
         training was done, but no work was produced.

    l    Building Codes: Codes have been developed and public consultations held. A regulation was ratified and
         issued in September 2002 to become effective in 2004. Printing of the building code is completed, and
         initial training for public officials and contractors has been completed. Specialized training is being

          planned as part of a follow-up project.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

Given the small size of individual investments, it was not possible to calculate ERRs for this project.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

It was not possible to calculate a financial rate of return for this project.

4.5 Institutional development impact:

Important steps were taken by the Government to prepare for and respond to disasters. The Government organized
the National Hazard Mitigation Council (NHMC) prior to effectiveness and enacted the Disaster Preparedness and
Response Act #13 of 2000. It identifies and manages disaster mitigation works (chaired by the Minister of Works).
NHMC is an agency under the Prime Minister's office which coordinates all disaster management activities and
organizations in the country, including governmental, private and volunteer organizations.

As discussed earlier, NEMO is responsible for emergency planning and mitigation and business disaster. With the
support of consultants, it has revised the National Disaster Emergency Plan and developed a liaison with the
private sector and a private sector disaster emergency plan. NEMO has also undertaken the strengthening of
district disaster committees and has sponsored training and the adoption of a Shelter Manual and Training
Handbook.
.
The Ministry of Physical Development has undertaken the ratification of and provision of training on the National
Building Code and the creation of a Hazard Analysis Vulnerability Technical Group within NHMC. The National
Emergency Management Advisory Committee (NEMAC) has been created with a wide representation (community
organizations, professional associations, and business/industry representatives). Under law it must meet regularly
to plan and supervise disaster management activities in the country. All representatives give periodic reports on
their respective disaster management activities.

The National Meteorological Service (NMS) has established new procedures and has been provided with
communications and meteorological equipment under the project. Its employees were trained in equipment
maintenance. New procedures were implemented (e.g. weather information voice mail, dedicated phone lines)
improving its early warning capacity. NMS has also received training that enables it to disseminate weather
information in easily understandable language in both English and Creole.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

When Hurricane Lenny struck St. Lucia in December 1999 a special mission discussed possible additional Bank
assistance with Government. Housing relocation was the greatest concern, but was not added to the project
because of the likely delays implicit in the Bank's resettlement policies.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

There were important delays in the government appointing NEMO and the PCU officials (see section 5.3).
Coordination among government ministries was insufficient at the beginning of the project. There were no regular
meetings of the Hazard Mitigation Council. This situation improved as the project progressed.




                                                           - 8 -

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

The PCU was very slow to begin functioning which led to procurement and disbursement delays. By June 1999,
the full staff was not in place and Terms of Reference for its positions had not yet been submitted to the Bank. By
March 2000 the Project Coordinator and Project Accountant were in place. It was agreed that a Deputy
Coordinator would be hired to help the Project Coordinator, who had other duties. Late recruitment of PCU staff
led to an unsatisfactory rating in Implementation Progress and Project Management at the end of 2000. There
were also long delays in procurement and in the initiation of civil works contracts. In November 2001 the Deputy
Project Coordinator was dismissed, but procurement was still slow and the project was rated unsatisfactory at the
end of the year. Even in 2002 the PCU continued to be understaffed (two persons, no staff support and poorly
equipped), and it was about to begin managing another project. After mid-2002 the performance of the PCU
improved which contributed to the successful conclusion of most of the project components. The project accountant
was made Deputy Director, the Administrative Assistant was made Contract Assistant and another Administrative
Assistant was recruited. Efficiency improved. On balance, therefore, because the management of the PCU was
improved, implementing agency performance can be considered satisfactory.

5.4 Costs and financing:

The total cost of the project was US$ 7.65 million as compared with an appraisal estimate of same amount. Over
US$ 5 million was for prevention and mitigation works (see Annex 2). Annex 2 also shows a breakdown of
project costs by procurement arrangements and by source of funding (Bank and Government).

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

The National Hazard Mitigation Council (NHMC) was established prior to effectiveness, and government enacted
the Disaster Preparedness and Response Act #13 in 2000. These have provided the institutional underpinnings
disaster preparedness.

NEMO was established when the National Office of Disaster Preparedness was transformed into NEMO in
February 2000. It has undertaken revision of the National Disaster Management Plan and the creation of a liaison
with the private sector and a private sector disaster emergency plan. New procedures have been established in the
Meteorological Department. A Hazard Analysis Vulnerability Technical Group has been formed within NHMC,
and new procedures have been implemented within the National Meteorological Service (NMS - see Section 4.5).
NEMO is expected to continue as the nodal agency for disaster preparedness. Plans are moving forward to
construct an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) for NEMO which will be the focal point for disaster
preparedness and mitigation. The main issues in its sustainability are its lack of adequate staff, especially after the
technical assistance provided under the project ends this year.

The National Meteorological Service (NMS) has procured communications and meteorological equipment, and its
employees were trained in equipment maintenance. New procedures were implemented (e.g. weather information
voice mail, dedicated phone lines). Its activities are expected to be sustainable.

Emergency shelters and equipment storage facilities have been built, and managers have been trained to maintain
them and use them in emergencies. Safeguards are in place to ensure that the equipment will not be misused.

A building code has been developed, aired publicly and training programs have been held for inspectors. The
introduction of the code should over time improve the sustainability of structures in the country.

Sustainability is rated likely.




                                                          - 9 -

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

Maintenance of bridges and river training works on the Marc Floissac and Caico bridges is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Communication and Works. Additional gabion baskets are available for mitigation works; metallic
bridge sections are available for emergencies.

Maintenance of water supply improvements at Victoria Hospital is the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, and
the maintenance and management of retrofitted emergency shelters at schools is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Education.

NEMO is responsible for continuing the management of disaster preparedness at the national level, including
education of emergency workers, maintenance of stocks of emergency materials, and promoting public awareness.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

The Bank team moved the program from the stage of the Project Concept Document to signing in six months.
However, it appears that not enough time was invested in project preparation. Some cost estimates in the PAD
were inconsistent with the Loan Agreement and had to be rectified during implementation. The large number of
sub-components made this a rather complex operation given the weak institutional capacity requiring coordination
of multiple agencies.

It is questionable whether the use of an ERL was justified. There was no emergency situation in St. Lucia at the
time. Because preparation used an emergency approach, components were identified quickly as there was little
time for in-depth analysis. Moreover, while equipment procurement and some emergency works could reasonably
be expected to be accomplished within the original emergency time frame, other types of components such as
institution building, larger works (which required lengthy design, tender and execution periods) and training were
ambitious for a three-year implementation period.

It was also questionable whether the APL instrument was appropriate in this case. Although it seemed efficient at
the time to group projects for all five OECS countries in one adaptable program, these operations (nine
loans/credits in total) eventually had to be unbundled and treated as separate projects in the Bank's record because
different P0 numbers were required to monitor each project separately.

Therefore, although the Bank worked quickly to respond to the Borrower's request and an innovative approach was
used to develop of regional program, Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory.

7.2 Supervision:

During implementation there were sixteen supervision missions, most with an operations officer or disaster
management officer and a disbursement or finance officer. Procurement specialists joined missions, especially at
the beginning of the project period and also after 2001. In three cases missions were by individual experts, twice
by financial specialists and once by a civil engineer to examine problems with school retrofitting. There was an
annual review in December 2000, when a range of implementation issues was discussed. Supervision reports were
well prepared and included detailed checklists for tracking the progress of each component. These checklists,
which were updated by each mission, provided a good basis to monitor progress and to assess the final results.




                                                         - 10 -

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

Especially because of the thoroughness of the supervision efforts and support by the Bank team during
implementation, overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

The Government was actively involved with the identification of the project components. However, given the tight
time schedule, few details of the components were worked out before appraisal. The preparation of engineering and
tender documents was left for the implementation period to be managed by the PCU. Delays in their preparation
thus turned out to be especially problematic for the timely implementation of the physical prevention and
mitigation works and the hiring of consultants. Borrower preparation is rated unsatisfactory.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

The Government was slow to appoint staff to the PCU. The Project Coordinator who was appointed by
Government had other duties. Because of long delays and understaffing in the PCU, most of the works were still in
the stage of design, environmental assessment and initial tendering phase until at least the middle of 2001.
However, because of Government efforts at the end of the project period substantially improved the pace of
institutional development and implementation, Government implementation performance is rated satisfactory.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

The PCU was very slow to begin operations which led to delays, negative ratings for implementation performance
and extensions of the project (see Section 5.3). Its performance was unsatisfactory at the start of the project.
However, by the end of project performance improved and most of the components were implemented.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

Because early problems in mobilizing institutional support and implementation agencies were largely overcome by
the end of the project, overall borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned


Lessons Relevant to the St. Lucia ERDMP

    l     The project could have been planned more deliberately as a standard investment loan, especially since
          there was no emergency at the time in St. Lucia. This would have enabled better preparation of
          procurement and institutional arrangements before appraisal.

    l     In a project with several implementing agencies, procurement planning must be done from the beginning.
          This is especially so where knowledge of the Bank's procurement processes varies among agencies. In
          addition, it would have been preferable to have drawings, specifications and terms of reference for the first
          year of implementation prepared before appraisal. Modum operandi between the PCU and the
          implementing agencies should be written in the operational manual.

    l     Gabion works for slope stabilization and riverbank protection proved to be an effective, easy and
          labor-intensive way to implement mitigation works.




                                                        - 11 -

Lessons Relevant to all the ERDMP Projects

    l   It would have been preferable to process the various loan/credit for the different OECS countries as
        separate projects part of a broader program, but not integrated into one horizontal APL. In the Bank
        system, APL phases each correspond to one project (i.e. with one P0 number) which does not allow for a
        segregation of reporting and accounting on individual sub-projects. The task team had important problem
        at the beginning of the program to obtain differentiated P0 number for each country.

    l   Reconstruction components often require careful assessment and long term effort that generally extends
        beyond the normal three year implementation period for Bank-assisted emergency operations. Therefore,
        priority in this type of projects should be given to prevention, immediate measures to reactivate economic
        activity and careful assessment of longer-term reconstruction priorities and designs. If major works are
        included in an emergency project, as was the case in this project, there should be an explicit provision at
        the design stage for a review of project scope after designs have been prepared. In this particular case, it
        would have been more practical to separate the actual emergency operation, which would have included
        quick disbursing components and technical assistance, and have the actual reconstruction works financed
        by a standard investment loan in a later phase of the APL.

    l   The performance of the PCUs was slow to develop in most cases. Ad hoc implementation arrangements
        through Project Coordination Units (PCUs) need to be carefully considered. In projects lacking a critical
        mass of work it is difficult for governments to allocate enough of their scarce qualified manpower to these
        units.

    l   TORs for consulting engineers need to specify government budget constraints to avoid over-designed
        infrastructure that will be unaffordable to implement. The Bank needs to consider requiring performance
        guarantees of consultants and applying penalties for late submissions.

Additional Annex 8. Borrower's Project Completion Report

Executive Summary

The Government of Saint Lucia secured a loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) in the amount of US$3.04 million and a credit from the International Development Association (IDA) in
the amount of US$3 million equivalent, towards the cost of the Saint Lucia Emergency Recovery & Disaster
Management Project. This Project became effective in July 1998 and should have been completed in January 2002.
However, two extensions were granted, the first for eighteen months and the other for three months, to ensure the
successful completion of Project activities.

Insufficient preparatory work was undertaken which delayed project implementation, for example the PAD and
Loan Agreements did not correspond, adequate staffing was not identified at the outset of the project, the project
implementation was not prepared before effectiveness, and training and institutional capacity building which is
integral for effective project implementation and management was not included as a component of the project. In
addition, the Project was referred to as "Emergency Recovery" and this was not the case as with normal emergency
types projects as disasters referred to had occurred long before the project design. The Project was a normal
infrastructural one.

Despite this, there was significant achievement upon completion of the project. The original objectives of the
project were met. All of the equipment and the supplies were acquired and delivered to the various agencies, as
well as, all of the civil works of varying degrees of complexity were completed. Although the Institutional Capacity
Component was not completed the preparatory work has been done to ensure that this component can be
undertaken in the near future.

Of major concern is the extent of borrowing by the Government of Saint Lucia (GOSL) therefore adequate
maintenance and security must be provided for the newly acquired facilities, infrastructure, equipment and
resources that have been provided to ensure future utilization. The GOSL must ensure that resources, both human
and financial, are available to sustain the facilities well into the future. The possibility insurance must also be
considered to ensure that the objective and benefits of the project are achieved.

The GOSL must express gratitude to the World Bank involved in supervision (Becq, Guinard, Solo, Liauataud,
Ghesquiere, Agwu, Daoud, Malfere) for the dedicated support and assistance given to the PCU throughout the
implementation of this multifaceted project. Overall the World Bank's performance in this regard was highly
satisfactory.

Finally, the GOSL must ensure that projects are well prepared both from the Borrower's end and the World Bank
for successful implementation. For effectiveness of loans the system should avoid replicating existing structures but
rather measures should be effected to strengthen the existing capabilities and structures, for example the creation of
the National Hazard Mitigation Council when an advisory body, the National Emergency Management Advisory
Council (NEMAC). In addition Project implementation manuals and operation manuals feedback from all agencies
should be prepared before implementation for effective and efficient implementation of projects.

Quality At Entry

Disaster Management was identified as an area requiring urgent attention as Saint Lucia was frequently affected by
natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, tropical storms, landslides, earthquakes and storm surges. Every year
the Government of Saint Lucia, as well as the governments of the other OECS countries, makes efforts to prepare
for the hurricane season from June to November, the period when these islands are most likely to be hit by such
natural disasters.

Very often, economic activity has been interrupted as major destructions were caused to physical infrastructure,
social activities strained, as residents suffered severe losses of personal property. Many times the replacement of
cost of key physical infrastructure (bridges) cannot be met from the Central Government funds. Therefore,
residents are forced to leave in these unbearable situations which sometimes cause loss of life, property, the
inability of children to attend schools when the rivers are high and even more the continuity of economic activity,
in most instance farming, is disrupted for long periods.

At the start of the project the Government of Saint Lucia made a complete assessment of the country's needs with
the assistance of NEMO and several major Government Agencies. External consultants were also recruited to work
along with the Agencies in carrying out this need assessment. Preliminary estimates were also provided for some of
the mitigation works and equipment to be procured and training to be undertaken. An assessment of the emergency
shelter requirements was also undertaken and the areas requiring urgent attention were identified. Moreover, areas
requiring technical assistance and physical strengthening, for example, the National Emergency Management
Office (NEMO), the National Meteorological Service and as well as hazard mapping and vulnerability assessment
were prioritized as requiring urgent attention.

Having regard to such preparatory work, the framework for determining the key project components were clearly
established and agreed with the World Bank. However, in most instances the activities for the project components
were not precise. The activities lacked details and the cost estimates did not reflect adequately the cost for
providing consultant services, acquisition of goods or civil works related to installations. Further, the project

design did not make provision for training and institutional capacity building which is integral for effective project
implementation and management.

In addition, the institutional arrangements for project implementation were not clearly defined and some of the
Agencies were inadequately staffed. Thus, the Project Coordination Unit, which was established prior to
effectiveness of the project, was not satisfactorily structured to effectively manage / coordinate project activities, as
there was only one (1) full-time staff member who was primarily responsible for Financial Management. Further,
the time frame established for implementation / delivery of project activities was unrealistic as the major Terms of
Reference and the bidding documents for substantial services and works to be procured had not been prepared. It
was imperative for the Project Coordination Unit to be staffed with expertise in procurement to lend support to the
other implementing agencies.

Achievement Of Objectives

There was significant achievement upon completion of the project. The original objective of the project was met.
All of the equipment and the supplies were acquired and delivered to the various agencies, as well as, all of the
civil works of varying degrees of complexity were completed ranging from the retrofitting of schools, installation
of gabion baskets, Hewanorra Flood Protection Works. A number of training programs were also completed for key
personnel involved with disaster management committees.

Although the Institutional Capacity Component was not completed the preparatory work has been done to ensure
that this component can be undertaken in the near future. For example, the necessary training has been delivered.
The Consultant, Emergency Planning and Mitigation Advisor, to NEMO prepared a draft National Mitigation
Plan. However, this Plan needs to be updated / revised to incorporate the Hazard Maps and the Vulnerability
Analysis. Also, a database of the Government's Public Buildings has been collated to be included in the
consultancy for the Insurance.

Overall the GOSL provided support and commitment to the efficient implementation of the project and ensured
that the appropriate structures were instituted so that the resources provided under the project can be used
efficiently and effectively. Some of the systems implemented will guarantee the maintenance of some of the Project
components, for example the formation and maintenance of National Emergency Advisory Council.

Institutional Development Impact

The project was poorly designed and prepared hastily. Provision was not made for efficient implementation of the
project. The Project was dubbed as an "Emergency Recovery" and was not the case as with emergency types
projects as disasters referred to had occurred long before the project design. The Project was a normal
infrastructural one.

At the initial stages of the Project it was agreed that certain technical public officers from the implementing
agencies would assist with the project implementation and preparation of the required Terms of Reference, Bill of
Quantities and drawings. The original Project design made provision for the employment of a Project Accountant
to deal with disbursements.

At the inception project implementation was slow as the Project Accountant was not familiar with the procurement
guidelines and financial regulations of the Government of Saint Lucia. In addition, the requisite terms of reference
and tender documents had not prepared to ensure effective implementation. The Project Implementation Manual
was not prepared until July 2003 which hindered project implementation. Further, an Operational document was
not prepared to inform and guide agencies on implementation until May 2000.

Further, it was absolutely impossible for a single person to coordinate such a multifaceted Project, whose
components and activities were not clearly articulated despite the support of the staff of the Development
Cooperation and Program Planning Unit (DCPP). The PAD made provision for the appointment of a Project
Coordinator, appointed by the Ministry. To this end, the Ministry of Finance and Planning appointed the Deputy


                                                          - 25 -

Director of DCPP to serve as a Project Coordinator who reported on Project activity and delivery on a ministerial
level. Therefore, there was no full time Project Coordinator assigned to the Project at the start.

Added to this, there was constant turnover of staff within the Technical Unit of the Ministry of Communications,
Works, Transport & Public Utilities, the agency responsible for implementation of approximately US$5.5 million
value of Civil Works.

The Public Officers from the implementing agencies were charged with responsibilities of preparing technical
specifications, list of requirements, supervising and monitoring of project implementation (works and
consultancies) in addition to their regular duties at the various Ministries.

In an effort to show its commitment to project delivery the GOSL agreed to the recruitment of a full time Deputy
Project Coordinator charged with the responsibility of procurement and providing support to the implementing
agencies and an Administrative Assistant who would provide administrative support to the Unit. Therefore, by
May 2000 the Project Coordination Unit had three (3) persons responsible for the Project Coordination and to
accelerate implementation. Despite the increase in staff number the anticipated dedicated capacity required for
efficient implementation of the Project was lacking. This was flagged in several Aide Memoires signed by the
Government of Saint Lucia with the World Bank.

All of the foregoing created much set back and delay in Project implementation, to extent that after fifteen (15)
months of effectiveness very little progress had been made on the Project. The World Bank undertook a mid-term
review of the Project in December 2000 in an effort to identify reasons for delay in implementation. This was
followed by a detailed review of other World Bank financed projects. This meeting was chaired by the Country
Director of the World Bank. The Minister of Finance as well as other Government officials attended the review.
The various problems regarding implementation were raised. Nonetheless, the World Bank had no choice but to
rate the project implementation as unsatisfactory. Despite, the GOSL assured the World Bank that given time the
Project would rise to satisfactory status.

To demonstrate its commitment to the World Bank GOSL ensured that capable and dedicated persons were
involved in coordinating the activities of the Project. In November 2001 the Deputy Project Coordinator was
relieved of his duties. In addition, the GOSL supported the recommendations of the World Bank by allowing the
project Accountant to be trained in Procurement and Selection of Consultants in January 2001. Further, substantive
changes were made to the Project Coordination Unit.

With this added training the capacity within the Project Coordination Unit increased. Since the Project Accountant
had extensive training and experience in Government of Saint Lucia accounting, World Bank disbursement
procedures and Financial Management she was able to provide on the job training to the Administrative Assistant
who assisted with some of the Financial Management matters while the Project Accountant, with the assistance of
the Project Coordinator, assisted in coordinating project activities, preparation of bidding documents, request for
proposals and Terms of Reference. Based on the dedicated capacity within the Project Coordination Unit the
Project's implementation finally became satisfactory.

The PC, DCPP, also had extensive experience in project management and preparation. Also some of the staff
members of the DCPP also provided institutional support in the coordination of the Project components. The
Project Accountant who had previously led a senior position in the Government of Saint Lucia and was familiar
with general management principles and was able to learn quickly several aspects project management from the
Project Coordinator in order to effectively manage and coordinate the project activities.

A drawback for the PCU was its inability to analyze and review independently technical reports, BOQs and cost
estimates submitted by the implementing agencies. Although, the responsibility for supervision and monitoring of
contracts lies with the implementing agencies, there was a need for the Project Coordination Unit to have the
capacity to review the reports and ensure compliance of the works with the signed contracts. The number of
variations realized especially on small works may have been avoided if the PCU had the relevant civil engineering
expertise, even on a needs be basis. The Project Coordination Unit relied on the implementing Agencies for all


                                                          - 26 -

aspects of the works. Despite, the Tasks Team Leaders (Becq, Guinard, Malfere, Ghesquiere and Liautaud) all
possessed civil engineering background and provided support to the Project Coordination Unit.

The Administrative Assistant was also trained in procurement. With this training the staff worked along with the
implementing Agencies with all procurement issues from advertising, tender preparation, to evaluation and
contract award. Despite the unfortunate setbacks during the first fifteen months of implementation the Project
Coordination Unit of two (2) full time staff, the Project Coordinator and the continuous support and assistance
from the World Bank Staff was able to bring the project to significant progress by January 2002 the Project
Accountant became the Deputy Project Coordinator while the Administrative Assistant became the Project
Assistant-Contracts to assist in evaluating, and monitoring of contracts and procurement.

As a result of the progress achieved by that time the Project was able to achieve satisfactory status, as a pre
condition to obtaining a much needed eighteen months extension to allow for the completion of critical works,
studies and training. The World Bank also granted no objection to the temporary employment of two (2) persons in
June 2002 to provide much needed Administrative support.

By then the Project had been restructured to undertake works and services that could have been realistically
completed by the revised closing date and to allow for additional works and studies to be undertaken. The first
extension was from January 31, 2002 to June 30, 2003 which was further extended to October 31, 2003.

With the build up in capacity of the Project Coordination Unit and to maximize on the existing synergies within
the Project Coordination Unit the World Bank agreed for the existing Project Coordination Unit to coordinate the
Emergency Recovery Project that became effective in July 2002. To compliment the Project Coordination Unit the
World Bank agreed to the recruitment of a Financial Management Assistant, an Accounts Clerk, and a Secretary
/Typist to strengthen internal controls within the Project Coordination Unit and also to provide administrative
support.

Overall, the staff of the Project Coordination Unit have gained much needed experience and are better equipped
and informed in the coordination and management of the Projects. The staffs have also been exposed to training in
Microsoft Project, Access, project management issues and disbursements. The newly appointed Project Coordinator
received training in Procurement.

Major Factors Affecting Implementation Outcome

Factors Generally Subject to Government Control - By the time the Project was ready for implementation several
project components earmarked for funding had charged drastically. For example works at certain schools identified
for retrofitting had already been done or in some instances had deteriorated to a far greater extent than the cost
estimate submitted at appraisal. Also, the cost of implementing mitigation measures had also escalated. Therefore
Government of Saint Lucia was unable to provide the required co-financing.

The fast tracking of Project preparation led to poor project design. Activities cost were underestimated and all of
the incidental and associated relevant costs were not tied to the Project Activities. For example, some studies could
not have been undertaken without adequate training or assessment.

Foreign, Individual Consultants were recruited to strengthen the capacity of NEMO. However local personnel were
not recruited to fill key positions at NEMO for e.g. Deputy Director NEMO for sustainability and institutional
strengthening. Although an appointment was made for the position of Training Officer, the individual was housed
at the Office of the Prime Minister. The Government of Saint Lucia needs to be more committed in providing
adequate full time staff for NEMO to ensure institutional memory and capacity.

The inherent delay in the project implementation caused by the initial arrangement for the Project Coordination
Unit would have been avoided if the PAD was clearly written. Arrangements should have been made for the
temporary recruitment of key personnel within the implementing agencies that lacked the required expertise.
Project activities should have clearly defined and every resource required for effective implementation should have
been assessed.

Moreover, implementing agencies were not sufficiently made aware of their role in project implementation. This
created unnecessary pressure for the Project Coordination Unit, which in this end not only had to coordinate, but
also assisted in the implementation of some of the components. A clear and precise Operational Memorandum
would have assisted.

Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control - Six (6) implementation agencies were responsible
for various components/activities under the project (MOE, MOPD, MOH, MOF, NEMO, MCW-Technical and
Meteorological Departments).

The Technical Services Division of the Ministry of Communication, Works, Transport & Public Utilities was
responsible for the major civil works while the National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) was responsible
Emergency Preparedness and Response Component. The Meteorological Department was responsible for the early
warning systems which involved the replacement of meteorological equipment, as well as the Ham Weather Radio
Network and the associated technical assistance and training. The Agencies, listed above, were supposed to ensure
that all activities under the respective components were implemented in their entirety with high standards of
efficiency and effectiveness.

Despite the non-preparation of an Operational Memorandum regular meetings were held by the PCU with the
Implementing Agencies to ensure that the objectives were met to the fullest. It was evident that much collaboration,
consultation and cooperation was required from the different agencies if the programs were to be completed
successfully.

The Physical Planning Unit was responsible for the following for the Hazard Mapping, Vulnerability Analysis.
There was significant delay in getting this component off the ground as it was felt it was the responsibility of the
NEMO. In the third year of implementation it was agreed that a Technical Working Group be formed, comprising
of NEMO, Physical Planning Section and MCW to draft the Terms of Reference for this consultancy. The
Caribbean Development Bank is currently considering funding a similar project on a regional basis. Therefore, the
training received by the Physical Planning Section in GIS is an asset and will be useful for the successful
implementation of this activity.

A significant milestone for the Physical Planning Section was the revision of the Building Codes and Guidelines.
Due to budgetary constraints the Building Codes have not been promulgated but is being used as a guide for the
Building Officers of the Physical Section. In addition, the Code and Guidelines have been mass circulated.

Sustainability

Rationale for Sustainability Rating - The Public is concerned of the Government's borrowing from external
agencies therefore a major concern is the maintenance and security of newly acquired facilities, infrastructure,
equipment and resources that have been provided to Government under the program. A major challenge for
Government will be the provision of resources, both human and financial to maintain and sustain the facilities well
into the future. The insurance of these physical infrastructure and highly specialized equipment must be
considered. Only by so doing will the objective and benefits of the project be achieved.

Transition Arrangement to Regular Operations - The various agencies are responsible for the management and
maintenance of resources provided under the program. In most cases such resources (physical) have already been
delivered to the respective agencies, where they have been put into regular operations.

Bank And Borrower Performance

Bank
Lending:
Having identified the project as an emergency type, the process of providing the required funding was expedited by
the Bank to encourage early and urgent implementation. Although the lending was fast tracked the Project was not
"an emergency" one consequently, the level of implementation could not be accelerated with a poorly design
Project. Thus, the bank performance may be noted as satisfactorily in that regard as the description given to the
project allowed for quick approval of this project.

Supervision:
Given the limited technical expertise of the Project Coordination Unit despite its solid experience in World Bank
financial management procedures, the Bank staff (Becq, Solo, Guinard, Ghesquiere) was always willing and
available to provide the necessary assistance and guidance to the PCU on project related matters. The Bank
performed highly satisfactorily in that regard.

Overall Bank Performance
Overall, the Bank was ever willing to accommodate the GOSL on project related matters, and worked
conscientiously with the GOSL to ensure that available savings were optimised without comprising World Bank
guidelines and procedures.The Bank rated highly satisfactorily in that regard.

Borrower
Preparation:
As implementation progressed, it became evident that the project had been hastily prepared. This led significant
delays in the implementation. This may have resulted from the need of the GOSL's to ensure cheap lending along
with its other regional counterparts. Nonetheless, this must be rated as unsatisfactory.

Government Implementation Performance:
There was significant delay in implementation, after effectiveness for almost eighteen months which resulted in the
project being rated unsatisfactorily. However, implementation accelerated after restructuring and provision of
training to the PCU. This along with the re-identification of project activities (done by Bernard Becq) enabled the
complete implementation of most project activities. Thus, this could be rated as highly satisfactory.

Implementing Agency:
The implementation agencies were enthusiastic and eager to have their respective components executed
successfully despite all of the set backs. Although, roles were not clearly articulated in terms of project
implementation the level of cooperation, consultation and collaboration enabled satisfactory performance in this
regard.

Overall Borrower Performance:
Given all the shortcomings and tremendous success derived at the end of Project implementation overall
performance may be related as satisfactory.

Lessons Learned

1. Where funding for disaster management and emergency related projects are required, the World Bank has
    proven to be one of the best sources in light of the quick disbursement mechanism.

2. In responding quickly to the immediate concerns of a disaster project, governments should not neglect the
    opportunity to build capacity for a longer-term disaster management capacity.

3. After an emergency has passed, reconstruction works, particularly those involving large capital investments
   and operation and maintenance requirements, should be carefully appraised. They should be subject to similar
   technical, economical, financial and institutional analysis as would be other similar investments.

4. When implementing similar projects, Government should avoid shifting assigning responsibilities for project
   implementation to employees who cannot devote the required time to the project. Moreover, clear agreement
   on responsibilities of implementing agencies for project implementation at inception would both facilitate the
   likelihood for follow-up and sustainability after the project is completed.

5. Prevention measures can have a substantial impact on the reduction of social and economic losses.

6. Government should demonstrate commitment to projects to ensure that project objectives are achieved. Project
   Management requires a team of fully committed staff with the relevant qualification and experience, and with
   opportunities for appropriate training.

7. Involvement of the community in the decisions of project identification and management significantly helps
   ensuring the successful implementation of such project.
