1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. Honduras’ growth and poverty reduction efforts have been
hindered by natural disasters, especially hurricanes and tropical storms and associated
events such as flooding and landslides. 1 The national economy had been performing
relatively well – GDP growth in 1997 had reached 4.9 percent, and was projected for
1998 and 1999 at 5.0 to 6.0 percent – when, in October 1998, Hurricane Mitch struck the
country. Mitch, considered the worst natural disaster experienced by Honduras in recent
times, was an exceptional event. It remained stationed for several days over the national
territory, bringing high winds, rains and floods that resulted in over 5,700 dead and 8,000
reported missing, nearly half a million displaced persons, agricultural losses of 70 to 80
percent of production, and damage amounting to nearly 40 percent of GDP.
Environmental degradation, rapid population growth, inadequate infrastructure, and high
poverty levels made the country particularly vulnerable to Mitch’s effects.

2.      Government Strategy. Hurricane Mitch showed the need to strengthen the
country’s disaster risk management (DRM) capacity. 2 At the same time, Mitch
highlighted the important role in DRM of local governments and communities, which
proved pivotal in responding rapidly to the catastrophe. Accordingly, the Government of
Honduras’ (GoH) request to the Consultative Group of International Donors – established
after Mitch to coordinate recovery assistance – emphasized support for local disaster
mitigation and prevention, in addition to emergency management, monitoring for early
warning, risk and vulnerability mapping, flood mitigation works, and long term
watershed management.

3.      Bank Strategy. Responding to Government priorities, the Natural Disaster
Mitigation Project (PMDN) was a pioneering element in the three-pronged strategy
developed by the Bank to help Honduras recover from Hurricane Mitch while dealing
with its disaster vulnerability. The strategy included:

(a) emergency financing, macroeconomic assistance and debt relief, provided through
    the quick disbursing Hurricane Emergency Project (P064083, US$200 million),
    which financed much-needed imports; the Bank-administered Central America
    Emergency Trust Fund (CAETF) established to support Honduras and other affected

  Between 1965 and 1995, for instance, seven hurricanes and tropical storms impacted Honduras, including Hurricane
Fifí in 1974, a major national disaster that caused 8,000 deaths.

  Disaster risk is a function of the characteristics and frequency of hazards experienced in a specific location, the nature
of the elements at risk, and their inherent degree of vulnerability or resilience. Disaster Risk Management represents a
comprehensive approach including preparedness and response, prevention and mitigation. In this context, (a)
preparedness is defined as the knowledge and capacities developed to effectively anticipate, respond to and recover
from the impacts of a hazard event; (b) prevention would be the avoidance of adverse impacts of hazards and related
disasters; and (c) mitigation would be the lessening or limitation of the adverse impacts of hazards and related disasters.

    countries cover multilateral debt service payments; and inclusion of Honduras in the
    Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative.
(b) Short to medium-term rehabilitation of damaged social and economic infrastructure,
    through restructuring of the Bank's portfolio and processing of supplemental
    financing totaling US$110 million.
(c) Longer-term disaster risk management. The Bank and GoH were preparing a new
    Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) when Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras. Taking
    into account the disaster’s impact, the CAS was reformulated and presented to the
    Board in December 1999.3 While the initial objectives were considered relevant, the
    CAS also emphasized DRM strengthening and listed the Project as the main
    instrument to start supporting this effort.

4.      At appraisal, the Bank had substantial experience in financing post-disaster
recovery operations, some of which included disaster risk reduction activities. Although
investing in mitigation and prevention was not yet central to development policy and
strategy, the Bank and other agencies were starting to recognize its importance. The Bank
had established a central Disaster Management Facility and in early 2000 launched a
major global consortium (ProVention) towards this end. In this context, the heightened
awareness brought about by Mitch provided an opportunity for the Bank to support for
the first time efforts focusing exclusively on DRM, including the Project and the
Nicaragua Natural Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project (P064916, US$16.05 million;
effective 2001-2009).

5.      When an additional financing (AF) credit for the Project was appraised in 2007, it
reflected the further mainstreaming of DRM issues – to which the Project itself had
already contributed substantially – into the Bank’s agenda, and also crucially into
Honduras’ Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The AF was consistent with the FY2007-
2010 CAS, which included a specific pillar on environmental protection and risk
management and an annex on disaster risks and DRM needs. 4 In the Bank’s Latin
America and Caribbean Region, the DRM portfolio had grown over the years and
included, for instance, operations in several eastern Caribbean countries, Mexico and
Colombia, and had become more comprehensive by including risk insurance.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.     The Project was originally designed as a technical assistance operation (TAL) for
DRM. Its PDO, according to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), was to improve the
capacity to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters at the municipal level.5 To achieve
this PDO, the Project would promote DRM in highly vulnerable municipalities while
ensuring adequate capacity in relevant central agencies expected to assist these
municipalities in such effort. Expected outcomes included increased DRM capacity and

5
  The PDO is stated slightly differently in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) as “to improve the capacity of
Eligible Municipalities to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters.?


                                                       2
coordination from the central to the local levels, and through improved forecasting
capacity and disaster risk knowledge, and better dissemination of information and early
warnings, the consolidation of a culture of prevention in Honduras. At the municipal
level, it was expected that “preventive? planning would be institutionalized and that
preparedness and response capacity would increase.

7.       Accordingly, the Project’s original key performance indicators were:
          At least 60 Municipalities have participated in vulnerability reduction
            programs (including production of vulnerability maps, and prioritization of
            mitigation measures)
          Prevention and mitigation themes mainstreamed into national primary
            education curriculum
          Through simulation of hydro-meteorological emergencies, speed of
            emergency response among population in target municipalities increases by
            75% and mistakes decrease by 50%
          National Flood Forecasting System functioning adequately
          National building code revised to include seismic and wind hazards

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

8.      A Project restructuring, approved by the Bank’s Board in June 2004, expanded
the PDO to include improvement of the national capacity of the country to reduce its
vulnerability to natural disasters at the municipal level.6 The revision of the PDO aimed
to strengthen the sustainability of Project outcomes by balancing local capacity building
with the institutionalization of DRM at the national level. To strengthen sustainability
further, support to the process to design the national DRM system and its legal
framework was added to the Project.

9.       The restructuring also expanded the Project’s original scope beyond technical
assistance to include financing of small structural and non-structural mitigation works
(e.g., retaining walls, storm drainage systems, and reforestation.) This change responded
to a Government request made at appraisal for the Bank to consider within two years of
Project implementation financing of mitigation works through either the Project or a
follow-on operation, in case that funds from other sources could not be found. Moreover,
many municipalities were facing a critical situation since due to the lingering effects of
Hurricane Mitch normal rains were causing damaging floods and landslides.

10.    The revised PDO was reiterated with the 2007 AF, but key performance
indicators were updated. Specifically, as described in Annex 3 of the AF Project Paper,
two indicators were revised, a new one was added, and one was eliminated:
        At least 81 municipalities have participated in vulnerability reduction
           programs (including production of vulnerability maps, and prioritization of
           mitigation measures), and further, at least 60 have introduced “preventive?

to natural disasters at the municipal level.?

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.      The Project’s direct beneficiaries include:

(a) Local, mainly poor communities from participating municipalities, which would
    benefit from training and equipment for emergency preparedness and response,
    knowledge on local risks, emergency and risk mitigation plans, and mitigation
    investments.
(b) Participating municipalities, which would receive support for disaster preparedness
    and response, risk and vulnerability mapping, preparation of preventive land use
    plans, identification and prioritization of mitigation measures, and feasibility studies
    and design of mitigation works; and after the 2004 restructuring, financing of selected
    mitigation works.
(c) National agencies dealing with disaster risk management including the National
    Disaster Emergency Preparedness and Response Agency (COPECO) and the Ministry
    of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA), which would benefit from
    technical assistance, equipment, and training.
(d) Group for Assistance to Foreign Aid (GAAEX), established after Mitch under the
    Ministry of Finance (SEFIN), which would benefit from fiduciary capacity building.

12.     More indirectly, the Project was expected to benefit the population of the
participating municipalities, and to some extent of the country, through the establishment
of the national communications and early warning system, and the overall strengthening
and institutionalization of DRM.

1.5 Original Components

13.      The Project had four original components:

A. Monitoring, Forecasting, Early Warning and GIS-based Information Management
   (US$ 4.84 million or 40.3% of total project cost). This component would assist
   SERNA to develop capacity for hydrological, meteorological and geophysical
   monitoring, as well as for forecasting floods and landslide hazards. Main activities
   included the design and implementation of an improved National Flood Forecasting


7
  This indicator was eliminated since the Government had partnered with the National College of Engineers to carry out
the revision of the code on their own.


                                                          4
   and Decision Support System, a study of the changes in fluvial geomorphology
   caused by Hurricane Mitch, establishment of community-based flood early warning
   systems, development of database management and GIS, and preparation of maps.

B. Strengthening of National Capacity to Support Emergency Response at Municipal
   Level (US$ 2.14 million or 17.8% of total project cost). Under this component, the
   Project would strengthen the emergency preparedness and response capacity of
   participating municipalities and COPECO so that it could assist these municipalities
   effectively. Main activities included the identification of equipment needed for local
   emergency response, design of a National Plan for Disaster Awareness and
   implementation of a municipal disaster awareness campaign, training in disaster risk
   management, design and implementation of an emergency assistance management
   information system, and review of a draft building code and improvement of capacity
   to monitor and mitigate seismic risk.

C. Building Capacity in Disaster Mitigation at the Local Government Level (US$ 4.00
   million or 33.3% of total project cost). This component was the core program for the
   selected municipalities. It was to be implemented by the Association of Honduran
   Municipalities (AMHON) and included key activities such as development of a local
   vulnerability management database, disaster risk and vulnerability analyses,
   “preventive? planning, and feasibility and engineering studies and final design of
   mitigation works.

D. Project Management (US$ 1.02 million or 8.5% of total project cost). This
   component would strengthen GAAEX to fulfill its role as the Project's fiduciary unit.

1.6 Revised Components

14.    While the four components were maintained throughout Project implementation,
the 2004 restructuring and 2007 AF introduced the following changes to each of them:

A. Monitoring, Forecasting, Early Warning and GIS based Information Management
   (US$ 0.72 million under the AF, for a total of $5.56 million or 26.5% of total project
   costs). After the 2004 Project restructuring, the original study on the changes of
   fluvial geomorphology caused by Hurricane Mitch was replaced by support to
   drought management. The Government considered the latter a priority, while experts
   confirmed that a study of this nature was not longer relevant, especially since
   localized analyses had been carried out with other donors’ support. Under the 2007
   AF, the development of database management and GIS was replaced by specific
   support to updating disaster risk information in a more comprehensive national
   system (SINIT).

B. Strengthening of National Capacity to Support Emergency Response at the Municipal
   Level (US$ 0.81 million under the AF, for a total of $2.95 million or 14.2% of total
   project costs). As a result of the 2004 restructuring, activities related to seismic risk
   were dropped, and support to the design and implementation of the national system



                                             5
    for disaster risk management was added. Complementing original training and
    awareness raising activities, the AF introduced the identification and acquisition of
    the equipment needed for the establishment of a national emergency communications
    system and for emergency response by municipalities and volunteer groups.8

C. Building Capacity in Disaster Mitigation at the Municipal Level (US$ 6.57 million
   under the AF, for a total of US$10.57 million or 50.3% of total project costs). The
   Project restructuring incorporated the financing of small mitigation works
   (subprojects) in participating municipalities. This change was further emphasized in
   2007 by allocating over 50 percent of the AF credit funds to mitigation works.

D. Project Management (US$ 0.90 million under the AF, for a total of US$1.92 million
   or 9.0% of total project costs). The AF included project management costs for
   COPECO as the new implementing agency (see below).

1.7 Other significant changes

15.     2004 Project Restructuring. After the Mid-Term Review (MTR), the Bank and
the Government agreed on the need to make several critical changes to the Project. In
addition to the expansion of the PDO, introduction of the financing of mitigation works,
and adjustments to components, project implementation was centralized and the Credit
closing date extended by 18 months. This restructuring required approval by the Bank’s
Board because of the proposed changes to the PDO and outcome indicators, and the
change of the Project’s environmental category (from C to B) which resulted in the
triggering of two safeguards policies, Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and Cultural
Property (then OPN 11.03).

16.     2007 Additional Financing. With the additional financing of SDR 5.9 million
approved by the Bank in June 2007, total credit funds more than doubled to SDR 14
million (US$19.8 million equivalent). Originally, the Bank was financing 94 percent of
total project costs. Under the AF Credit, the Bank agreed to finance 100 percent of
eligible expenditures in line with the new Country Financing Parameters. Implementation
arrangements were also modified and project implementation extended three years. The
environmental category B of the Project remained unchanged, but an additional safeguard
policy (OP4.10 – Indigenous Peoples) was triggered.

17.     Implementation arrangements. During the 11 years of Project life,
implementation arrangements experienced three significant changes reflecting the
evolution of the country’s institutional framework for DRM, Government priorities, and
efforts to strengthen implementation arrangements:

(a) Project implementation was initially decentralized, with each component under the
    purview of a different agency (SERNA, COPECO and AMHON). A high level Inter-

 It was originally expected that the equipment would be financed by other donors, but the needs proved larger than
available funds.


                                                        6
    Agency Coordinating Group (GIC) was established to facilitate project
    implementation and the evolution of DRM policy and strategy. A Technical
    Coordination Unit (TCU) integrated by project managers and key technical team
    members of each agency was responsible for promoting the Project among
    municipalities and coordinating day-to-day technical and operational aspects.
    Procurement and financial management was assigned to GAAEX.
(b) Project restructuring in 2004 formally centralized implementation to improve
    management effectiveness and to reflect the Government’s decision to establish a
    multi-project coordination unit that could promote synergies across three related,
    cross-sectoral Bank-financed operations.9 The Ministry of Interior (SGJ) was made
    the Project’s implementing agency to reflect its new leadership role for DRM in the
    country.10
(c) With the approval of the AF Credit in 2007, COPECO became the Project’s
    implementing agency. This change reflected the Government’s decision to
    institutionalize Project activities within COPECO in order to consolidate further the
    country’s DRM system. The TCU was integrated into COPECO’s organizational
    structure. GAAEX was transferred to COPECO and remained as fiduciary unit to the
    end of the Project.

18.     Inclusion of Tegucigalpa. Originally, the Project excluded Tegucigalpa,
Honduras’ highly vulnerable capital city, from the list of eligible municipalities.
Tegucigalpa had large financing needs that would have made it difficult to allocate
adequate resources to other municipalities, and other donors were expected to address
these needs. The funds did not materialize, and in 2004, thanks to a US$1.95 million
grant from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF), assistance to Tegucigalpa was
included under the Project.11 This support, coupled with the decision to have the TCU
and GAAEX implementing the grant, allowed to apply Project methodologies in a large
urban setting and to enhance Project impact.

19.     Reallocation of Credit Proceeds. Two reallocations were approved under the
original Credit. First, as part of the 2004 restructuring, a reallocation of SDR 750,000 was
done to establish a new category (subprojects) to allow for the financing of mitigation
works. These funds were taken mostly from the Unallocated Category. A second, minor
reallocation of SDR 53,700 (from Goods to Consultant Services) was approved by the
Country Director in June 2005.

20.     Extension of Closing Dates. The Project ended in December 2010 after three
closing date extensions of the original credit and one exceptional extension of the AF
credit. The original credit closing date was extended with the 2004 restructuring from

  In addition to the Project, this PCU oversaw the Forest and Rural Productivity Project (PBPR, P064914, 2004-2010)
and the Land Administration Program (PATH, P055991, 2004-2010).
10
   The Government that took office in January 2006 dismantled the multi-project PCU. Since the implementing agency
(SGJ) and basic technical (under a centralized TCU) and fiduciary functions (under GAAEX) were maintained, a
formal restructuring was not deemed necessary.
11
   See “Community Disaster Management Project? (TF52879, effective 2004-2008). With the JSDF grant, Tegucigalpa
was formally added to the list of municipalities included in the Project’s Operations Manual.

April 2005 to January 2007 to allow for the completion of activities (as detailed later, the
Project experienced delays during its initial years); and in December 2006 and March
2007 to April and September 2007 to allow for the preparation of the additional financing
and an orderly closing of the original credit, respectively. With the approval of the AF
Credit, the project implementation period was extended to September 2010. In August
2010 an extension to December 2010 was approved on an exceptional basis by the
Regional Vice-President to give the Project an opportunity to recover from the effects of
the political crisis experienced by Honduras during the second half of 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

21.     Soundness of Background Analysis. Project design was based on a thorough
analysis. During project preparation, there was a growing body of knowledge and lessons
learned on disaster risk management within and outside the Bank. Moreover, starting
soon after Hurricane Mitch, the Bank and specialized agencies assisted Honduras in
carrying out studies of the social, economic and environmental consequences of the
disaster and underlying factors contributing to the country’s vulnerability. Project design,
advanced with funding from a Bank-executed Japanese Policy and Human Resources
Development (PHRD) grant,12 also benefited from specific institutional, economic and
gender analyses, and early drafting of local risk assessment methods. These studies
provided a solid basis to define the PDO and components, and particularly to help decide
on the studies, training and assistance to be provided. Importantly, an assessment was
carried out to develop the list of eligible municipalities.13 The design of the AF took
advantage of information and studies generated earlier on in the Project, and the latest
DRM knowledge. On the other hand, there were initial shortcomings in the institutional
analysis, which overestimated the capacity of some of the implementing agencies; and
after Project restructuring and especially the AF, the economic analysis fell short
regarding the mitigation works.

22.      Assessment of Project Design. The original Project Development Objective
(PDO) focused mainly on an outcome (increased capacity for disaster vulnerability
reduction in selected municipalities) that seemed achievable in a five year period. The
objective was clear and important for the country as indicated by the Government to the
donors and in the CAS prepared right after Hurricane Mitch. The Project was prepared
following an intensive consultation process with national and local stakeholders and in
coordination with donors. The MTR showed the need to expand the PDO to ensure
further the sustainability of Project activities by focusing simultaneously on
institutionalizing DRM capacity at the national level while reducing local disaster
vulnerability.


12
  TF025969 (Total amount disbursed of US$393,000).
13
  Through a rigorous methodology, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) helped to establish
vulnerability indices of the country’s municipalities using GIS analysis based on a wide range of environmental,
demographic, social and infrastructure indicators.


                                                       8
23.     The strategic choices underlying the original Project design reflect lessons
learned and ground reality. The first and more fundamental choice was to focus on
disaster risk reduction instead of post-disaster reconstruction, and mainstreaming this into
a regular technical assistance operation. On this basis, project design emphasized: (a)
support to local capacity development taking into account the Bank’s competitive
advantage and other donors’ plans to assist central DRM agencies; (b) assistance to a
selected number of vulnerable municipalities, especially those that Hurricane Mitch had
left most at risk rather than assuming a general program (while also excluding the two
largest cities); and (c) reliance on existing agencies in a post-disaster situation rather than
creating new ones under the Project.

24.      To manage safeguard risks, an additional strategic choice was made when adding
the financing of mitigation works under the 2004 Project restructuring by limiting the
eligibility of these works to those which would not cause physical or economic
resettlement (as defined in the Bank’s involuntary resettlement safeguard policy, OP
4.12). A negative list was included in the legal amendment to minimize the possibility of
resettlement as well as adverse environmental impacts. Given the substantial need for a
wide variety of mitigation investments, it may be concluded that the menu of eligible
works remained relevant for Project design. Moreover, given its experience and
performance at the time, collaboration of the Honduran Fund for Social Investment
(FHIS) was added to the project to ensure adequate construction of the mitigation works
and environmental safeguard compliance.

25.      Project components were clearly formulated and conducive to PDO achievement.
Project design was flexible, including almost US$1.0 million dollars equivalent in
unallocated funds to respond effectively to the highly dynamic Post-Mitch situation and
implementation lessons. This allowed for relatively quick adjustments to the components
after the PDO was revised as circumstances changed. The set of natural hazards initially
considered – floods and landslides – was also broadened to include droughts and forest
fires as they emerged as critical issues in certain municipalities.

26.     Risk Assessment. Overall Project risk was assessed as Moderate at appraisal.
This rating, in retrospect, seems to have underestimated the challenges of the project
related to the critical Post-Mitch situation, institutional weaknesses, and the innovative
nature of the Project. Most of the risks identified in the matrix materialized at some point
during Project implementation. One of these risks – the possibility of coordination
problems between implementing agencies under a decentralized arrangement – and rated
as Moderate, turned real early on. The mitigation measure included in the Project design
of establishing a high level Inter-institutional Coordination Group proved ineffective,
although an effective solution was identified (see below). Another risk that was difficult
to mitigate and that affected especially the capacity building activities was the turnover of
staff in some of the implementing agencies and municipalities due to government
changes after elections.

2.2 Implementation



                                              9
27.    Implementation was satisfactory for most of the Project’s life, underpinned by
strong Government commitment. In addition, several factors helped implementation
positively:

28.     Continuous engagement of local officials and communities. Project activities at
the local level were advanced through close consultation and participation, including
almost yearly workshops with mayors and officials from participating municipalities. The
Project’s methodology for local risk and vulnerability analysis and prioritization of
mitigation measures helped to bring together specialized technical expertise and local
knowledge, while building beneficiaries’ commitment and ownership of results.

29.     Addition of financing of mitigation works. This decision, starting in 2004, not only
enhanced Project impact, but facilitated implementation by providing additional
incentives to local governments and communities to participate more actively in the
Project.

30.    Establishment of strong fiduciary and TCU teams. Over the years, the
development of GAAEX as a strong fiduciary unit and of the TCU as a key technical arm
helped project implementation. At times, the marked separation of the fiduciary and
technical functions caused friction, especially when Project leadership was weak.
Nevertheless, performance of the fiduciary and technical teams remained strong
throughout implementation, helped by continuity of staff and capacity building.

31.     Provision of additional international expertise through grant funding. Project
implementation benefited from the provision of specialized technical assistance financed
by (a) two Bank-executed trust funds from the Bank-Netherlands Water Partnership
Program (BNWPP) totaling over US$1.11 million, and (b) two Country-executed PHRD
grants from the Government of Japan totaling US$821,000. 14 Additional technical
expertise included issues related to, inter alia, watershed management, flood risk analysis
and management, environmental planning for disaster risk reduction, and the design of
the DRM national system.

32.     Nevertheless, several factors – some outside the control of government and
implementing agencies but some within their control – affected implementation. As
a result, the Project experienced delays that required an extension of the original closing
date by 18 months and of the AF by three months.

33.     The factors outside of Government or implementing agencies control include:

34.     Initially, the Project was slowed down by delayed credit effectiveness and the
start of the election cycle. Weaknesses in Project readiness made it difficult for the
Government to meet several of the effectiveness conditions of the original Credit (in


14
  The PHRD grants were TF26865 (US$313,193, 2001-2005) and TF55127 (US$508,529, 2005-2009); the BNWPP
grants were TF050479 (US$469,557, 2002-2006) and TF051001 (US$644,092, 2002-2006).


                                                 10
addition to the fact that in Honduras a credit needs to go to Congress twice, first for
approval of its signing and then for ratification). 15 In the end, eight months passed
between Bank’s approval in May 2000 and declaration of effectiveness in February 2001.
It would prove difficult by then to accelerate Project activities since 2001 was an election
year, and several agencies were facing difficulties in finalizing terms of reference and
technical specifications for key activities.

35.     The political crisis in the country in the second half of 2009 slowed down
activities and disbursement pace in the last year of the Project. The Bank paused
disbursements and implementation of all projects for almost six months and missions
could only be restarted after the elections of November 2009. Most of the time lost was
recovered thanks to COPECO’s pro-activity and the Bank’s agreement to allow for the
direct implementation of the validation of the remaining risk and vulnerability analyses.

36.     Evolution of the legal and institutional framework for DRM affected at times the
relationship between co-implementing agencies. It took most of the Project
implementation period for the final approval of the law creating the National System for
Risk Management (2009 SINAGER Law). The role of key agencies under the Project
evolved over the years, which at times resulted in turf battles. Over time these roles were
clarified and COPECO’s mandate – initially envisaged merely as emergency response –
expanded to include prevention and mitigation.

37.     Several disasters hindered Project implementation, including Hurricane Stan in
2005 and Tropical Storm Agatha in 2010. These disasters, albeit unfortunate, helped to
corroborate the country’s progress in disaster preparedness and response and
effectiveness of mitigation efforts.

38.    Falling exchange value of SDRs made it difficult to plan final activities. During
the last year of the project, the Credit’s equivalent amount in dollars fell down
substantially and several activities were cancelled, including purchasing of additional
equipment for local emergency committees. When the SDR value recovered there was
not enough time to start procurement processes, and about five percent of the AF credit
funds were cancelled.

39.   The factors within Government or implementing agencies control that affected
implementation include:

40.    Weak leadership under the original decentralized arrangements and unmet
operational demands led, three years into implementation, to the major crisis
experienced by the Project. As indicated in the Mid-Term Review conducted in June
2003, the Project was facing problems of poorly prepared technical teams, exacerbated by
weaknesses in project management. The main weaknesses included: (i) lack of


15
  Average for declaration of effectiveness in Honduras was then about five months. Following operational practice at
the time, effectiveness conditions included, in addition to the signing of agreements by the implementing agencies,
establishment of the financial management system, staffing of the TCU, and completion of the Operational Manual.


                                                        11
coordination and collaboration among implementing agencies as the Project Coordination
Committee had been left without leadership since the change of government and
withdrawal of SEFIN from its originally active role; and (ii) inadequate project
management, whose effectiveness had been further constrained by turf battles between
several agencies.

41.     At the same time, implementation demands of the Project were not being
adequately met. The MTR noted the lack of progress on the agreements reached in the
December 2002 mission. Lack of leadership had led to insufficient information
dissemination of the project among participating municipalities and beneficiaries, and to
lack of knowledge on the Project or its procedures among new technical team members.

42.     The MTR concluded that Project implementation progress was unsatisfactory. As
a result of accumulated problems, only 30 percent of Project funds had actually been
spent although 60 percent of the original implementation period had elapsed. Considering
this delay, completing Project activities by the original credit closing date looked
unfeasible. To get the Project back on track, the MTR recommended a set of measures to
strengthen Project management, revitalize the technical teams and adjust Project
activities. These measures were reflected in the 2004 Project restructuring already
detailed in previous sections. The restructuring was successful as evidenced by the
acceleration of Project activities, progress on project indicators, and disbursements in
2005 and subsequent years.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

43.      M&E design. The original Project results matrix (detailed in Annex 1 of the
PAD) has shortcomings, especially if assessed on the basis of current M&E practice.
PDO outcome indicators tend to focus on participation by municipalities in major project
activities or are too generally defined. Specific definitions and methodological precision
are lacking in the Operational Manual. It was certainly challenging to identify more
suitable outcome indicators given the innovative nature of Project design and the critical
Post-Mitch situation still prevalent during preparation. Establishment of baselines, in
particular, could have been costly and time consuming. Nonetheless, development of a
practical methodology and baseline survey to measure some of the key economic,
environmental, social, and gender impacts identified in the PAD should have been
attempted, more so at the time of Project restructuring and especially for the additional
financing.

44.     M&E implementation and utilization. Despite methodological limitations, an
M&E system was implemented and progress reports sent to the Bank as required.
Periodic monitoring of project progress was effectively used to adjust activities, budget
and procurement plans. Measurement of two outcome indicators, however, was not as
adequate: (a) improvement in hydro-meteorological emergency response capacity at the
community level, which required comparing emergency response before and after
participation in controlled simulation exercises. A simulation exercise was carried out,
but although effective for training it was not useful to measure this outcome; and (b)
establishment of an adequate national flood forecasting and early warning system, since


                                           12
reporting was based mainly on the progress on equipment installed and publication of
information, while timeliness and accuracy of the information was not assessed overtime.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

45.    Safeguard Compliance. The original Project focused on technical assistance and
was correspondingly given an Environmental Category C. With the 2004 restructuring,
which added small mitigation works, the Project was re-categorized from C to B and two
safeguards were triggered: environmental assessment (OP4.01) and cultural property
(OPN 11.03, currently OP 4.11). Under the AF, the Indigenous Peoples safeguard policy
(OP 4.10) was also triggered. An environmental analysis and an Indigenous Peoples
Planning Framework (IPPF) were accordingly prepared by the Government.

46.     Environmental Safeguards. The Project did not have any negative environmental
impacts, as corroborated by field visits carried out in 2010. The Project strengthened
environmental management through local preventive planning and non-structural
mitigation works, and assistance to SERNA and municipal environmental units (UMAs).
The measures specified in the Project’s Environmental Analysis (EA) were generally
taken into account. These included, among others, a “negative list? of ineligible activities
and the procedures to be followed in the event that any “chance finds? of archeologically
or culturally significant resources were encountered during construction.

47.     Environmental safeguard compliance had several shortcomings: (a) not all the
measures indentified in the EA were integrated into the preparation and execution cycle
of the mitigation works; (b) supervision of these works by the implementing agency and
the municipalities did not always focus on environmental aspects; and (c) 25 mitigation
works were started when the process to obtain the written clearance from FHIS
confirming that the work was environmentally sound (as stipulated in the EA and
Financing Agreement) was still underway.16 COPECO took this decision to avoid further
implementation delays in the aftermath of the political crisis, since FHIS had lost its
mandate and capacity to assist in obtaining the environmental clearances while SERNA
faced a substantial backlog of environmental reviews and approvals (which was affecting
other externally-funded projects). This situation was satisfactorily resolved and all
mitigation works had their environmental clearances and/or licenses before the end of the
Project. Moreover, no negative impacts resulted from the decision, and mitigation works
– which were of a small scale – have had positive environmental impacts.

48.    Social Safeguards. A social safeguard mission in 2010 found that indigenous and
Afro-Honduran peoples benefited from the Project, although not all the guidelines
outlined in the IPPF were applied. According to the documentation reviewed, the
information provided by Project and municipal officials, and the communities


16
  FHIS had been selected because its environmental procedures, through its Environmental Management Unit (UGA),
followed acceptable guidelines as set out in the EA and those issued by SERNA. In addition, there was a Memorandum
of Understanding signed between FHIS and SERNA that allowed FHIS to issue environmental clearances for small
works and to work with SERNA to obtain any necessary licenses for other type of works.


                                                       13
interviewed, indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples were appropriately consulted and,
consequently, Project activities considered their social organization and culture.
Compliance with OP 4.10 was facilitated by the participatory methodologies for risk and
vulnerability analysis and decision making developed by the Project and the importance
given to social inclusion by TCU staff. The IPPF guidelines stated that prior to
implementing a mitigation work where the IPPF applied (i.e. where there were
indigenous communities), COPECO was to carry out a social assessment and prepare and
submit for Bank’s no objection an indigenous peoples plan (IPP) and subsequently
implement such plan. However, the IPPF guidelines seemed to have been over-
dimensioned, and in the end no specific IPPs were prepared, considering that most
mitigation works were of a minor and localized nature and that the Project included a
variety of consultation mechanisms and participatory methodologies. There is evidence
that at least eight mitigation works benefited directly indigenous communities, four
benefited urban neighborhoods with indigenous communities, and that indigenous
communities were generally satisfied with the project’s consultation and decision making
process.

49.     Fiduciary Compliance. The Project stands out with ratings for both financial
management and procurement consistently satisfactory despite systemic fiduciary issues
across the country portfolio.17 No major fiduciary issues requiring Government or Bank
attention emerged throughout the Project implementation period, as corroborated by audit
reports and procurement post-reviews. Satisfactory performance was helped by
strengthening and maintaining the same fiduciary unit (GAAEX) for the Project despite
changes in implementation arrangements; and by the relative autonomy of GAAEX and
the continuity and commitment of its team. Fiduciary capacity also contributed to the
approval of additional grant funding (such as JSDF and PHRDs) for the Project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

50.    The Project established a solid basis for DRM in Honduras. Focus on disaster risk
reduction will continue through regional initiatives and specific country efforts financed
by other agencies and potentially the Bank. At the regional level, Honduras will continue
to benefit from Bank-supported initiatives such as the development of the Central
American Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA) platform and the strengthening of the
Central American Coordination Center for Natural Disaster Prevention (CEPREDENAC).

51.     New operations have been started or are under consideration applying many of the
Project results, and more concretely proven risk and vulnerability methodologies and
participatory planning processes, and designs of prioritized mitigation works.18 A specific
example is the IDB-financed Disaster Risk Prevention and Mitigation Project (US$19




17
   The Project was the only one that did not fall under an investigation carried out by the Integrity Vice- Presidency
(INT) of the Bank-financed operations managed by the inter-sectoral PCU mentioned earlier.
18
   The Project supported the design of 155 mitigation works, of which 96 could be used under similar operations in
future.


                                                         14
million) being implemented by COPECO, which is part of a US$74 million conditional
credit line to consolidate disaster management in Honduras.19

52.     The specific Operation and maintenance (O&M) arrangements for key
investments under the Project are: (a) the 59 structural mitigation works completed under
the Project have been transferred to local authorities. Through a Participation Agreement
each municipality accepted responsibility for the mitigation work, including provision of
a local supervisor during construction and final acceptance of the work at completion; (b)
maintenance of the stations and equipment installed as part of the hydro-meteorological
network will be SERNA’s responsibility, and calibration of the equipment, which must
be done after extreme events, will be the responsibility of an Expert Committee including
COPECO and the National Meteorological Service (as per the new Water Law); and (c)
O&M of the community-based flood early warning systems will be the responsibility of
COPECO in close partnership with local municipalities and communities through the
local emergency committees, based on sustainability plans.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

53.     The revised Project Development Objective (PDO) remains highly relevant and
is consistent with the current Bank strategy and national development plan. The country
is highly vulnerable to disasters. Between 1980 and 2010, over 15,000 people were killed
and over 4 million were affected by disasters, while economic damage amounted to
US$4.5 billion.20 While progress has been achieved, disaster risk reduction challenges
have intensified. Climate change is arguably causing a significant increase in hurricane
risks in the Caribbean. Moreover, Honduras will also likely experience a warming and
drying trend, and have both more frequent heat waves and droughts and more intense
rains. The FY2007-2010 CAS and the FY11 Interim Strategy Note acknowledge these
issues and reiterate the importance of investing in risk reduction.21 Similarly, the recently
prepared National Vision 2010-2038 and National Plan 2010-2022 include disaster risk
management as a key objective within the framework of environmental management and
climate change mitigation and adaptation.

54.     Project design is consistent with the PDO and relevant to ongoing and planned
efforts to face the challenge of disaster risk reduction. Project design was flexible,
allowing for adjustments to reflect emerging good practices regarding institutional
strengthening and engagement of local governments and communities, as well as
inclusion of financing of mitigation works and drought management when it became
clear that these were important issues.

55.     Project implementation supported the evolution of the legal and institutional
framework for DRM in Honduras. Implementation arrangements remained relevant
through changes introduced through the 2004 restructuring and the 2007 AF, and at the
end contributed to the institutionalization of Project results and consolidation of
COPECO as the country’s leading disaster management agency. Implementation also
allowed for the development of approaches and methodologies that were mainstreamed in
other Bank-financed operations in Honduras, such as the Forest and Rural Productivity
Project (PBPR, P064914, 2004-2010); or built upon in operations in other countries such
as the Colombia Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Program (P082429, Phase I approved
in 2005).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

56.     The original PDO focused on improving capacity for reducing local disaster
vulnerability. With the 2004 restructuring, the PDO was expanded to specify more clearly
two complementary outcomes: (a) improving national capacity for disaster risk
management, and (b) reducing local disaster vulnerability. Rather than a major change,
this decision reflects a stronger emphasis on the need to develop capacities at the local
and central levels simultaneously.

Improving National Capacity for Disaster Risk Management (Achieved)

57.     Stronger institutional capacity and coordination, better forecasting accuracy and
timeliness, increased information and knowledge, and better preparedness resulting from
the Project have all contributed to improving national DRM capacity. More
fundamentally, these results have facilitated the shift towards a culture of prevention in
the country, as corroborated by interviews and field visits in 2010 across a sample of
participating municipalities.22

58.     Improved institutional capacity and coordination. The Project helped to
consolidate the country’s legal and institutional framework for DRM. It supported the
preparation and consultation process that led to the approval of the 2009 SINAGER Law
that formally established the national system for risk management. The Law’s approval is
the culmination of a concerted effort whose building blocks include, inter alia, the 2003
Territorial Planning Law – which the Project helped to promote in selected municipalities
– and the 2005 adoption of the recommendations of the strategic objectives and priority
actions of the 2005-2015 Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA).23 The national system
was officially activated through the National Emergency Response Center (COEN)
during Tropical Storm Agatha in May 2010 with positive results. Institutionalization of
DRM capacity is evidenced by COPECO’s improved performance and its expanded
mandate beyond emergency response, and by the stronger risk monitoring capacity of
SERNA.

59.     Improved forecasting accuracy and timeliness has resulted from the integrated
national monitoring, forecasting and decision support system developed by the Project.
Presently, thanks to the improved early warning system, vulnerable populations,
businesses and rural producers within four of the main watershed systems of the country
(Ulúa, Chamelecón, Choluteca and Aguán) can be timely and reliably informed of hydro-
meteorological events. Effectiveness of the system, which has been demonstrated during
recent events such as Tropical Depression 16 and Tropical Storm Agatha, is supported by
technological and scientific improvements, better collaboration across key agencies, and
better defined protocols for data sharing and dissemination of warning messages. Flood
forecasting capacity has been expanded through community-based early warning systems
in five additional smaller watersheds. Furthermore, initial efforts to monitor selected
areas susceptible to landslides and of drought conditions in the southwest have increased
early warning capacity while bringing benefits to additional communities.

60.    Improved information and knowledge. The Project-sponsored national campaign
led by COPECO – centered on the notion of “to prevent is to live? (prevenir es vivir) –
did not only help improve the agency’s image but also the understanding of risk and
vulnerability among the public. Although the impact of mainstreaming prevention into
the primary education curriculum was not formally evaluated, there is field evidence that
teachers in public schools, including in Tegucigalpa, have been using the guides and
other materials prepared under the Project. In addition, over 3,500 sheets of geospatial
information produced through the Project had been provided to the Project Coordination
Unit (PCU) of the Bank-financed Land Administration Program (PATH). The latter will
continue developing the National Information Territorial System (SINIT) while taking
into consideration disaster risk information in its cadastral activities. Finally, in
coordination with PATH and PBPR, a wireless network was established for
Tegucigalpa’s metropolitan area that facilitated inter-connection of key DMR agencies
and data transmission.

61.     Improved preparedness and response. The improvements described above,
combined with the training and technical assistance provided through the Project at the
local level, have led to better emergency preparedness and response. Emergency response
can currently be activated effectively from the central level (through the COEN) to the
emergency committees (CODEMs) in most of the 298 municipalities of Honduras and
many local committees (CODELs) within each municipality. Although difficult to
evaluate since it is not possible to compare disasters of different magnitude and effects,
an initial analysis shows that capacity to evacuate and to shelter affected population has
improved. Willingness to evacuate, at the same time, reflects increased disaster risk
awareness among the population. These results have likely contributed to saving lives in
recent disasters.

Reducing Local Disaster Vulnerability (Achieved)

62.    Before Project restructuring in 2004, PDO achievement – focused mainly on this
outcome – was limited and seemed unlikely within the original closing date. According to
the MTR, after three years of implementation, key Project results, such as completion of



                                           17
risk and vulnerability analyses and mitigation action plans, were evident in 15 of the 60
participating municipalities. On the other hand, although several major studies were
underway, key terms of reference and technical specifications had not been finalized, and
some training activities were delayed.

63.     After overcoming initial challenges, there is evidence that the Project helped to
reduce disaster vulnerability at the local level through improved understanding of disaster
risk and vulnerability, institutionalization of “preventive planning,? better emergency
preparedness and response, and identification of mitigation priorities, including the
design and implementation of selected works. These results were achieved through the
development and implementation of a participatory methodology to identify with local
authorities and communities main vulnerability problems and to prioritize actions to plan
for prevention / mitigation activities.

64.     The above methodology included completion of risk and vulnerability analyses,
municipal risk management plans (PMGRs), municipal territorial development plans
(PMOTs), and identification and prioritization of mitigation measures that have benefited
the population of 81 municipalities (about a third of all municipalities of Honduras).
These municipalities include an estimated population in 2010 of approximately 5 million
people or close to 60 percent of total population.24 This methodology was adapted to a
large urban setting with the JSDF grant linked to the Project, benefiting communities in
marginal neighborhoods in Tegucigalpa.25 (See Map at the end of this report).

65.     Improved disaster risk and vulnerability knowledge. Through their participation in
the completion of the risk and vulnerability analyses, local officials and communities
gained substantial knowledge of their main DRM challenges and options. At the end of
the Project, the PMGRs based on these analyses were under implementation in 61
participating municipalities. Specific drought management plans were also under
implementation in 8 additional municipalities. A relatively simple GIS-based information
package (known as integrated system for municipal risk management or SIGRM) has
been prepared for each participating municipality, which could be used for the
implementation of new projects and future updating.

66.     Institutionalization of preventive planning. The PMOTs developed under the
Project are being applied in most of the participating municipalities, including land use
guidelines that take into account disaster risk. Further, PMOT guidelines have
increasingly been taken into account in the decisions in these municipalities related to the
location of private and public investments. This was the case, for instance, in Choluteca
in 2008 regarding the location of new maquilas in the southern part of the municipality,
which are critical for the economic future of the area; in Trinidad regarding the location




24
  According to the 2001 National Census, the population in the participating municipalities was 2,640,372.
25
  In January 2011, in an event to mark the tenth anniversary of JSDF, the grant for Tegucigalpa was recognized as a
good practice along with 20 more out of over 370 ones financed by JSDF since its inception.




                                                       18
of a new health center, middle-school and a housing development; and Santa Rosa de
Copan regarding a new housing development.

67.    Better emergency preparedness and response. All participating municipalities
were integrated into the national emergency response network through the CODEMs and
CODELs established by the Project. Overall, it is estimated that close to 10,000 people
were trained on DRM at the local level. The impact of the training and equipment
provided to emergency committees has been made evident by the effective response
given in some of the target municipalities and communities during recent events. Some of
the mitigation works such as improved drainage systems and small bridges financed
under the Project have also helped to improve evacuation routes.

68.     Identification and implementation of mitigation priorities. Participating
municipalities have identified and prioritized their mitigation needs. While the Project
could not address all of these needs, it started the process by financing, across
participating municipalities, (a) the design of 155 structural mitigation works and the
construction of 59 of these works; and (b) the design of 40 non-structural mitigation
works, some of which have been implemented by the municipalities themselves. With the
portfolio of priority non-structural and structural mitigation measures provided by the
Project, participating municipalities have been motivated to seek – and some have
actually obtained – additional funds for this type of investments from sources such as the
Poverty Reduction Strategy and FHIS. As corroborated during supervision missions, for
the most part mitigation works have shown their effectiveness when tested by disaster
events.26

69.     Based on the eight drought mitigation plans approved by the respective Municipal
Councils, the Project helped implement innovative measures such as improved stoves to
reduce deforestation and water harvesting, as well as economic activities for women to
help diversify the income sources of vulnerable families. These municipalities also
enhanced Project impact by obtaining support from NGOs to implement additional
activities.

3.3 Efficiency

70.     Although Project efficiency cannot be fully ascertained due to lack of a specific
ex-ante analysis, there are indications of positive economic efficiency with respect to
mitigation investments. Some initial indication of the Project benefits related to
mitigation works can be deduced from the per capita investment by direct beneficiary,
which was about US$48.8127 – relatively low in light of the potential savings in loss of
life and property. As detailed in Annex 3, an independent ex-post economic analysis was


26
   One extreme case occurred in the municipality of Ajuterique, where although the mitigation work (river bank
protection) was damaged by the flood caused by Tropical Depression 16 in 2008, it likely helped to protect the lives of
close to 3,000 people. The mitigation work has since been rebuilt by the municipality with support from the central
government.
27
   Total number of direct beneficiaries is estimated at 129,178, and total direct investment in mitigation works is
estimated at US$6,305,571.99 including cost of feasibility studies, designs, and construction and supervision of works.


                                                         19
conducted to evaluate the economic efficiency of a sample of 21 structural mitigation
works, or 35 percent of the total financed under the Project.28 This economic analysis
provides indications of positive economic efficiency derived from these investments,
considering that the net present value (NPV) estimated for the sample of works is
US$13,064,522.65 and the average internal rate of return (IRR) is 50.68 percent. The
economic benefit stream was calculated through the avoided damage cost method
assessed as the cost of direct damage likely to be caused by the disaster event that the
mitigation work would help avoid within its area of influence.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

71.     As detailed above, Project design and objectives remain highly relevant, most of
PDO indicators were achieved, resulting in stronger DRM capacity from the local to the
national level and reduction in local vulnerability. Despite data and methodological
limitations, there are indications of positive economic efficiency. Following OPCS
guidelines, given that the PDO was restructured, the overall outcome was assessed
considering separate ratings for the original and revised objective, weighting each rating
in proportion to the share of actual credit funds disbursed before and after the approval of
the revision. The Project was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory against the original PDO
(weighted value of 3 x 0.22= 0.66) and rated Satisfactory against the revised project
objective (weighted value of 5 x 0.78 = 3.90). 29 Thus, the weighted average score is 4.56
(0.66 + 3.90), which would represent a final rating of Satisfactory with rounding.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

72.     Damage and loss assessments indicate that disasters tend to affect the poor
disproportionately due to their social and physical vulnerability.30 Consequently, post-
disaster recovery time and costs for the poor also tend to be relatively higher than for the
better-off. In this respect, although not expressly considered in the PDO, the Project had
an impact by helping to increase the resilience of poor communities in highly vulnerable
municipalities thus providing the difficult-to-estimate benefit of avoiding increased
poverty levels after disasters. The Project also helped to strengthen the social capital of
these communities through the establishment of emergency committees and participatory
processes for risk and vulnerability analysis and preventive planning. This social capital
is reflected in mutual support systems that can help communities not only in responding
to future disasters, but also in engaging in risk mitigation. More broadly, Project

   When the Project was restructured, close to 22 percent of the total amount of IDA financing (including the original
and AF credits) had been disbursed.

   Hurricane Mitch, for instance, caused average losses of 80 percent of assets to households in the lowest income
quintile, compared with average losses of 3 percent to households in the highest income quintile.

implementation facilitated the recognition by municipal governments and central
agencies of poor communities and their organizations as viable partners for DRM.

73.     The gender approach mainstreamed into Project design seemed to have facilitated
women’s participation and access to information. According to interviews in selected
communities, female beneficiaries were generally satisfied with their engagement in
project activities. This is an important result since women tend to have more limited
literacy levels and time availability to participate in meetings due to socially and
culturally assigned gender roles.31 The Project also worked with men to promote a gender
approach that attempted to balance their assumed role as “protectors? – which has often
resulted in higher mortality among males as was the case during Hurricane Mitch – and
the building of community wide support systems more inclusive of women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

74.     The Project contributed to the institutionalization of a DRM system in the country.
Key agencies such as COPECO and SERNA, as well as participating municipalities, have
been strengthened and are working in a more coordinated manner. COPECO’s
organizational structure has been decentralized through seven regional offices which the
Project helped to strengthen, complemented at the central level with a new Directorate for
Prevention. In addition to the improved flood forecasting network, SERNA’s institutional
capacity has been increased through training, flood risk assessments and hydrologic
simulation modeling. At the same time, participating municipalities have been given
better tools and capacities to deal with local DRM issues in partnership with local
communities.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

75.     The Project was a vehicle for several innovations which have become common
practice in DRM efforts, notably (a) a methodology for risk and vulnerability analysis
and preventive planning that dynamically integrates complex technical and scientific
expertise with community knowledge through an educational and awareness raising
process for all participants; and (b) a bottom up approach that balances municipal and
local communities’ roles and capacities with central coordination and support.

76.     As a result of the Project support to municipalities, several additional positive
outcomes have also been identified, including: increased demand for mitigation
investments; better understanding of the importance of territorial planning, particularly
with reference to the challenge of controlling growth in high risk areas; increased interest
in, and in some municipalities use of geospatial information for fiscal cadastres that are
likely to help increase municipal revenue. These outcomes have been enhanced by the



31
   In Honduras, migration of males to the US and other countries, which accelerated in the Post-Mitch period, has
resulted in an evolving re-negotiation of gender roles providing an additional opportunity to implement a gender equity
approach in the Project.

complementary efforts of the Bank-financed PATH in 11 of the municipalities that
participated in the Project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

77.    A beneficiary survey was conducted as part of the final socio-economic
assessment of the Project (see Annex 5 for details). In general, the survey indicates that
beneficiaries are satisfied with their experience in the project, and a majority of them
(94% of respondents) consider that it helped to reduce disaster vulnerability in their
municipality. Respondents were aware of many of the project results. For instance,
almost 70% knew of the early warning system and over 98% that emergency committees
have been organized and trained in their municipality. Beneficiaries also have a positive
view of the impact of mitigation works, and were aware that maintenance was being
provided to these works. However, they have concerns with the level of maintenance.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

78.    The Government has demonstrated its commitment to DRM policy and programs
and overall sustainability is likely given strong local ownership of Project investments
and demands from a more engaged and educated population. Integration of DRM issues
into municipal planning processes and increased awareness of the consequences of
climate change will also contribute to continuity of the efforts started under the Project.
Development outcome, however, faces several internal risks:

(a) Sustaining capacity of COPECO whose budget remains small compared with its
    expanded mandate for mitigation and prevention. 32 The plan to integrate permanently
    TCU and GAAEX staff into the agency did not materialize due, in part, to budget
    constraints. Nevertheless, several TCU members have been hired under the IDB-
    financed operation which will ensure continuity of approach and technical capacity.
    Prevention and mitigation challenges are substantial thus requiring external resources,
    but the Government is considering options to establish a DRM fund.
(b) Sustaining technical capacities at the local level, which is challenged by staff
    turnover after government changes. In any case, training and updating of information
    will be required to maintain relevance of DRM local programs. Through the Project,
    local authorities have understood the strategic relevance of recruiting and maintaining
    qualified technical staff. The GIS-based application produced by the Project can be
    shared with new authorities in a cost efficient way, while at the central level the effort
    continues (through, for example, the consolidation of SINIT) to maintain relevant
    geo-spatial information.
(c) Ensuring O&M of key investments, including mitigation works, the hydro-
    meteorological network and the community-based early warning systems.
    Specifically: (i) O&M of mitigation works bode well based on evidence from the first


32
  Due to fiscal constraints, COPECO’s budget has remained flat for the past three fiscal years – totaling US$1.6
million in 2011, and US$1.4 in 2009 and 2010.


                                                      22
   batch of works (completed in 2006). Having local authorities and communities fully
   engaged in identifying, prioritizing, and supervising mitigation works ensured
   materials and construction quality and beneficiaries’ satisfaction. Moreover, most
   works are small, with low budget maintenance demands. These factors, along with
   community awareness of the importance of the works to help prevent loss of life and
   property should help promote adequate O&M. (ii) SERNA will assume the
   maintenance of the hydro-meteorological network. Calibration of the equipment, as
   per the new Water Law, will be the responsibility of an Expert Committee. SERNA,
   however, has not always managed to allocate sufficient human and financial
   resources for this task or for the required training in the past. (iii) The community-
   based flood early warning systems were developed with vulnerable and poor
   communities. Keeping these systems active will require renewal of basic equipment
   and continuous engagement by COPECO.

79.     There are also several external risks related to the country’s growing disaster
vulnerability and the magnitude of DRM challenges. Although close attention was given
to the design of the hydro-meteorological system, it is not possible to guarantee that it
will not be damaged by a major catastrophic event. The impacts of the Project’s
mitigation investments could be overwhelmed by environmental degradation and the
substantial and increasing number of population living in high risk locations. If
adequately enforced, preventive planning will contribute to mitigate these issues in the
future. In particular, voluntary relocation to safer places and minimizing resettlement of
freed up high risk locations represent a major social and economic challenge.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

80.     This rating is based on the close collaboration evidenced between Bank and
Borrower during Project preparation, the relevance of the Project to both the Government
and the Bank, flexibility of Project design and inclusion of innovative elements that
enhanced Project impact, and reasonable targets in a context of institutional evolution and
experimentation. The Project design reflected a pioneering effort at the time and
responded adequately to client needs. Given the difficult post-Mitch situation and the
complex institutional disaster management setting that existed in the country, risk
assessment and institutional analysis understandably had some shortcomings. Although
the latter may have affected the initial implementation period, it did not affect Project
outcomes in the long run.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory




                                            23
81.    The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) rated initial supervision as satisfactory. The
ICR rating recognizes that in general supervision missions were timely and solution
oriented, that there was a Mid-term Review that resulted in effective decisions and
agreements (through a major Project restructuring), and that critical issues affecting
Project implementation were adequately handled, including by, among other things,
bringing in additional international expertise with trust fund resources. Procurement and
financial management were also well supervised. Although supervision of safeguard
issues was relatively weaker, the Bank conducted compliance assessments and no
negative social or environmental impacts were identified as a result of Project activities.
Mitigation works were of a small scale and reflected the requirements of the agreed
negative list. Supervision missions should have, however, followed up closer on the
economic analysis and evaluation arrangements (especially after the AF) given the
Project’s innovative nature.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

82.    The rating reflects the satisfactory performance of the Bank in ensuring quality at
entry and supervision. The important and not very common factor of having the same
core project team throughout most of the Project’s life likely contributed to this overall
performance.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

83.     Government performance is rated satisfactory considering its sustained
commitment to PDO achievement, including especially the concerted effort to
consolidate the legal and institutional framework for DRM in the country while
strengthening key agencies and local governments. Given the innovative and inter-
sectoral nature of the Project, coordination issues were bound to arise. Nevertheless, the
priority given to the Project by successive Governments, which consistently provided an
enabling environment for Project implementation, facilitated resolution to critical
constraints. Although the Project experienced at times delays due to government changes
after elections, for the most part staff in the TCU and GAAEX remained the same
throughout implementation. Local governments also performed satisfactorily despite
changes in administration.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

84.      The overall satisfactory rating considers the different performance levels of the
various agencies that were responsible for the Project. In the initial stage (up to Project
restructuring, covering about one third of total Project life), the implementing agencies –
COPECO, SERNA and AMHON – did not perform as expected in part due to complex
institutional arrangements that led to a lack of Project leadership and slow decision


                                            24
making. In the intermediate phase of the Project (up to the approval of the AF in 2007),
SGJ became the sole implementing agency but the Project was integrated into a multi-
project PCU. SGJ performed moderately satisfactory since, especially after the large PCU
was dismantled, it did not always provide adequate follow up to project issues. Under the
AF, the Project was transferred to COPECO, which performed highly satisfactorily.
COPECO demonstrated commitment to the Project, ensured continuity of TCU and
GAAEX staff, integrated TCU staff within its organizational structure, and provided
close attention to critical implementation issues. For instance, during the political crisis in
2009 COPECO proactively advanced key bidding processes and had many of the
contracts for mitigation works ready for signature when the Bank re-started its activities
in the country. A shortcoming after Project restructuring was the limited attention paid to
specific safeguard requirements, although no social or environmental negative impacts
due to the Project have been observed, and TCU staff demonstrated their commitment to
social inclusion and environmental sustainability.

(b) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

85.     Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory considering that both government
and implementing agencies’ performances are rated satisfactory. There were
shortcomings in implementing agencies’ performance in the initial period of the Project,
but these were overcome and the Project objective was achieved.

6. Lessons Learned

86.      Crises provide opportunities to promote change, even if the environment for
coordination and implementation is challenging. In the case of the Project (and the
similar effort in Nicaragua), although unfortunate, the Post-Mitch situation focused
attention of the Government and population in the country’s disaster venerability and
DRM weaknesses. In a crisis environment, however, it is critical to ensure that
implementation arrangements are simple, with clear roles and responsibilities that
facilitate leadership and decision making.

87.     Investing in disaster risk management pays off in the long term, especially if
coupled with flexibility and responsiveness to country needs and conditions. The
Project represents an excellent example of the importance of investing in DRM. During
the Project’s life, responsiveness and flexibility allowed to modify project design and
implementation arrangements to reflect the evolving legal and institutional framework,
and enhance project impact. The Project has already had visible impacts that have likely
helped to reduce loss of life and property, particularly among the poor.

88.     Small scale DRM interventions across multiple localities can have a
substantial country-level impact provided these are developed within a strategic
framework and adequately balanced with capacity building at the central level. The
original decision to cover a selected number of municipalities, while avoiding the two
largest Honduran cities, helped the Project achieve a broad yet visible impact. A key



                                              25
factor was the framing of these interventions within a comprehensive, even if evolving
DRM framework. Also important to Project results was striking a balance in the DRM
system between the need to centralize certain activities and resources in key agencies and
to decentralize others to municipalities and local communities.

89.    DRM capacity strengthening at local and community levels contributes to
ownership and sustainability of results. Often in the past, local governments and
communities were not included in the decisions and processes that affected their lives,
which made ensuring O&M of investments and sustainability of technical capacity one of
the main constrains of DRM projects. The Project is a good example of the benefits of
engaging these actors actively throughout the whole cycle of activities. Moreover, the
Project also shows the importance of investing in people rather than just technology.
Overall, through a local participatory approach, the Project has left a more educated and
engaged public which is more likely to demand attention to DRM issues despite
government changes and staff turnover.

90.     Development of monitoring and evaluation systems and sound economic
analysis for DRM Projects is critical not only to measure results but also to draw
well-grounded lessons. Although the importance of prevention and mitigation is broadly
recognized today, there is still a need to have good evaluations of DRM efforts to ensure
their prioritization in a development context of budget constraints and competing
priorities. Evaluation is even more critical in projects such as the one assessed in this ICR
that include innovative approaches and financing for mitigation. Having specific
indicators on women’s and indigenous peoples’ participation and inclusion, and on their
access to and understanding of training and information, will benefit project evaluation.
Identification of good practices will strengthen results of future efforts, while economic
analysis of mitigation investments will help show the “business-sense? of such
investments.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

91.     The Borrower, through COPECO, concurred with the draft ICR and did not raise
any substantial issues with respect to its findings, ratings or lessons learned. 33 The
Borrower noted the general alignment of the draft ICR with its own evaluation, and
reiterated its appreciation of Bank support for DRM and of the Project’s benefits.

(*) Note on Component D

The increase in Component D reflects changes agreed following the 2003 Mid-Term Review
when implementation arrangements were centralized and the Ministry of Interior (SGJ) was made
the implementing agency. The costs of capacity building to SGJ, including equipment, as well as
of the re-centralized Technical Coordination Unit (TCU) were accounted under Component D
under the original credit (Cr. 33610). As a result, the total cost for Component D under Cr. 33610
was US$3.62 million (including US$1.0 million from government counterpart funding) compared
to US$1.02 million estimated at appraisal. Under the Additional Financing Credit (Cr. 33611),
when COPECO became the implementing agency, final cost estimate for Component D was
US$0.96 million (including US$0.07 million from government counterpart funding), which is
similar to the AF appraisal estimate.

Component A assisted the country (especially the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment or SERNA, and the Disaster Emergency Preparedness and Response
Agency or COPECO) to develop capacity for hydrological, meteorological and
geophysical monitoring, as well as for forecasting floods and landslide hazards. Specific
activities and outputs included:

(1) Design and improvement of a fully integrated national flood forecasting and decision
support system (DSS). Based on a thorough diagnostic of needs, the country’s hydro-
meteorological network was improved with the installation of 33 new telemetric stations
with real time monitoring capacity and satellite communication,34 establishment of one
central station capturing information from the telemetric stations, calibration of
equipment, and development of forecasting models. Training for data analysis and
operation and maintenance was provided to technical staff of SERNA and other agencies.
At the end of the Project, 60 stations were operating effectively throughout major
watershed systems (Aguán, Ulúa, Chamalecón and Choluteca), and the country has an
improved National Forecasting Center. The system, moreover, is operating in an
integrated manner incorporating all key agencies dealing with hydro-meteorological


34
     These 33 stations are located throughout 27 municipalities and along 19 rivers.

monitoring and forecasting. Seven early warning systems for landslides were also
designed.

(2) Improvement of national capacity to manage information relating to droughts.
Drought early warning systems were designed for 25 municipalities. Although this output
exceeded the planned target of 18, none of the systems was fully implemented at the end
of the Project.

(3) Supporting and updating disaster risk information in the National Territorial
Information System (SINIT). The Project produced over 3,500 thematic sheets of
geospatial information which have been transferred to the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) of the Bank-financed Land Administration Program or PATH, under which the
development of SINIT will be continued.35 In coordination with two other Bank-financed
operations (PATH and the Forest and Rural Productivity Project), the Project also
established a wireless network for Tegucigalpa’s metropolitan area that facilitated
interconnectivity of key agencies and data transmission.

(4) Establishment of community-based flood early-warning systems. Complementing the
main hydro-meteorological network, community-based early warning systems benefiting
the populations of seven municipalities were established in five small river basins
(Papaloteca, Guaymas-Guaymón, Choloma, Machigua and Cabañas-Copán). These
systems are based on simple technological and cost-effective solutions. In addition to the
completion of flood early warning procedures and emergency plans, the communities
responsible for these systems were trained and equipped to ensure the effective operation
of the systems. The radio equipment also helps for health emergencies, especially in
isolated communities. Each community coordinates with the municipal emergency
committee (CODEM) where the main communication center was established.

(5) Production of base maps. Aerial photography for over 9,000 square kilometers was
acquired, and orto-photo maps produced for 23 municipalities for which no images were
available. In addition, the Project supported the preparation of the forest cover map for
the country in 2004.

 Under Component B, the Project aimed to strengthen the emergency response capacity of
 participating municipalities as well as the capacity of COPECO to support municipalities
 at the time of a disaster and to help them prepare better for future disasters. The specific
 activities and outputs included:

 (1) Identification and acquisition of equipment needed for emergency response at the
 local level. Two major studies were completed, including a diagnostic of the equipment
 needed by local governments and volunteer groups for immediate life-saving search,
 rescue, and protection of people affected by disaster events; and an analysis of the
 requirement for a national and municipal emergency communications system. Not all the
 minor equipment and tools for the municipal emergency committees (CODEMs) could be
 acquired. During the last year of the project, the credit’s equivalent amount in dollars fell
 down substantially and several activities were cancelled including purchasing of this
 equipment.

 (2) Design, updating and implementation of municipal emergency plans. A total of 81
 municipal emergency plans (PEMs) were prepared in a participatory manner with support
 from the Project. These plans provide the framework for the activities of the municipal
 and local emergency committees established in the participating municipalities (see
 below).

 (3) Design of a National Plan for Disaster Awareness. A National Plan was prepared,
 including design of radio and TV spots, posters and other media. In addition, a proposal
 was developed to introduce disaster risk management themes into the national curricula
 of primary education levels. Impact of this proposal was not formally evaluated, although
 surveys indicate some use of the materials in fourth, fifth and sixth grades in natural
 sciences and social studies.

 (4) Municipal disaster awareness campaign. Following the national plan, this activity
 entailed the implementation of disaster awareness programs in 61 municipalities, which
 helped to promote a culture of prevention in the country. As part of this effort, the Project
 partnered also with the municipal emergency committee of the central district (where the
 capital city is located), which helped to bring the campaign to highly vulnerable urban
 and peri-urban neighborhoods. In addition, as part of the promotion of environmental


                                                   31
 education, tree nurseries were established in selected schools and communities, which
 were used for reforestation programs; and 8 campaigns for cleaning of drainages and
 open areas carried out.

 (5) Municipal capacity building in emergency response. As part of capacity building at
 the local level, CODEMs were trained and equipped in 95 municipalities (81 in
 municipalities originally participating in the project and 14 within the area of influence of
 COPECO’s new regional offices). In these municipalities, 375 local emergency
 committees (CODELs) were organized. Considering that each committee includes an
 average of 13 people, the Project actively engaged over 1,200 people through the
 CODEMs and over 4,800 people through the CODELs.36 In addition, with JSDF funding,
 communities in 100 vulnerable neighborhoods in Tegucigalpa were also trained in
 disaster emergency response.

 (6) Capacity building to COPECO. This agency was strengthened through training and
 technical assistance including provision of technical advisors when the new regional
 offices were established. COPECO also benefited from the construction of a central
 warehouse for emergency stocks and acquisition of search and rescue equipment and
 specialized equipment for forest fires; and from the design and implementation of an
 emergency assistance management information system to track emergency requirements
 of municipalities and the contributions of international and national donors.

 (7) Support for the design and implementation of a national system for disaster risk
 management. The Project supported the technical assistance and consultation process to
 consolidate the national system for disaster risk management (SINAGER). A draft Law
 was prepared at the end of this process, and the Law was approved in 2009. The system
 has been activated during recent disaster events with positive results.

Component C aimed to develop disaster mitigation capacity in the participating
municipalities and help reduce their vulnerability. The main activities, linked and
implemented through a comprehensive municipal vulnerability reduction program, and
outputs included:

(1) Development of a local disaster risk management data base. A relatively simple GIS-
based Information System for Local Risk Management (SIGMR) was developed for 81
municipalities, which can be integrated into territorial development plans. For each
municipality, the database contains 70 thematic layers grouped in several modules such
as administration, bio-physical characteristics, social system, economic system, territorial
planning and risk and vulnerability to, depending on the case, floods, landslides, forest
fires and/or droughts. Moreover, as part of capacity building to transfer the SIGMR to the
local levels, more than 300 training workshops on GIS and database management were
delivered to national and municipal technical staff.

(2) Development of disaster risk analysis and preventive planning for participating
municipalities. Through a new participatory methodology, the Project helped 81 of the
most vulnerable municipalities in the country to develop risk management plans
(PMGRs) including risk analysis and vulnerability mapping and identification of
mitigation measures. The PMGRs were discussed in open town hall meetings (cabildos
abiertos) and approved by the relevant municipal authorities. At the end of the Project, 61
of these plans were under implementation. Building on these outputs, these 81
municipalities prepared and approved municipal territorial development plans (PMOTs).
The process undertaken involved more than 400 consultation workshops with local
officials and communities across all participating municipalities.

(4) Carrying out feasibility and engineering studies and final design of mitigation works.
Under the Project, 155 feasibility and engineering designs of mitigation works were
carried out for 61 municipalities, which provided the country with a substantial portfolio
of prioritized designs.

(5) Implementation of mitigation measures (sub-projects). The Project financed the
construction of 59 structural mitigation works across 58 municipalities. These mitigation
investments benefited over 500,000 people, including close to 130,000 directly protected
(according to the 2001 Census). This total, it should be noted, does not include the 35
small mitigation works implemented in vulnerable neighborhoods in Tegucigalpa with
JSDF funding. The Project also supported the implementation of measures for forest fire
prevention that benefited 5 vulnerable communities, including construction of 284
kilometers of trenches.

(6) Implementation of drought mitigation measures. This type of measures was
implemented in 8 municipalities on the basis of an equal number of drought management
plans. The plans, covering an area of 29,282.54 hectares, were piloted in the association
of municipalities (mancomunidad) known as Mambocaure in the department of
Choluteca. The plans, which were approved by the respective local authorities, generally



                                            33
benefited 1,200 families per micro-watershed. Among other achievements,
implementation of the plans resulted in the establishment of 7 micro-enterprises that
generated 790 jobs, reforestation of 635 hectares of land, the piloting of improved stoves
to combat deforestation, and the construction of eight micro-projects for water harvesting
built from recycled plastic bottles.

(7) Capacity building to the Association of Municipality of Honduras (AMHON). During
the early phase of the Project, AMHON was responsible for Component C and received
technical assistance and basic equipment. This organization also benefitted from the
municipal database completed under the project, access to the metropolitan wireless
system and participation in the consolidation process of SINAGER.

Component D - Project Management

Appraisal Estimate:           US$1.92 million
Actual/Latest Estimate:       US$4.58 million

Component D supported the strengthening of GAAEX, a financial management unit
originally within the Ministry of Finance (SEFIN), and at the end of the Project under
COPECO; as well as the Technical Coordination Unit, which was integrated into
COPECO’s organizational structure after the approval of the additional financing credit.
Main outputs under this component include the annual independent audits, M&E reports,
programming and procurement and contracting planning, among others. This component
also included support to the Ministry of Interior (SGJ), when it was the Project
implementation agency between 2004 and 2007.




                                           34
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Although Project efficiency cannot be fully ascertained due to lack of a specific ex-ante
analysis, there are indications of positive economic efficiency with respect to mitigation
investments. One of the major challenges of promoting disaster prevention and mitigation
is to demonstrate that its potential benefits in terms of saved lives and property far
exceeds its costs. Cost estimation of disaster risk reduction activities is relatively
straightforward, whereas the estimation of benefits is complicated by their probabilistic
nature. In the end, the actual level of benefits will be realized depending on the degree of
severity of the disaster event occurring over the life of the investment.

Consistent with the technical assistance focus of the original project design, two
complementary macro-economic analyses were completed at appraisal. While these
analyses usefully demonstrated the importance of disaster risk reduction at the national
level, they could not be replicated for Project evaluation. The first analysis37 looked at the
consequences of failing to account for natural catastrophes in macroeconomic planning.
The second analysis38 focused on the effects of Hurricane Mitch (an extraordinary, single
event) and the mitigation benefits of a single option: land use restrictions to eliminate or
control growth in flood prone areas.

Under the Project, economic efficiency was to be promoted in part by the requirement
that the final decision to finance a prioritized mitigation work should be based on a
calculation of costs as a function of the number of persons directly benefited by the
specific work. Further, the original credit, after the 2004 Project restructuring, had a cap
per mitigation work of US$75,000, which was eliminated under the AF credit (the
average for the whole project was US$89,508.55). Some initial indication of the Project
benefits related to mitigation works can be deduced from the per capita investment by
direct beneficiary, which was about US$48.8139 – relatively low in light of the potential
savings in loss of life and property.

As detailed below, an independent ex-post economic analysis was conducted to evaluate
the efficiency of a sample of 21 structural mitigation works, or 35% of the total financed
under the Project.40 This economic analysis provides indications of positive economic
efficiency derived from these investments, considering that the net present value (NPV)
estimated for the sample of works is US$13,064,522.65 and the average internal rate of
return (IRR) is 50.68%.

   Total number of direct beneficiaries is estimated at 129,178, and total direct investment in mitigation
works is estimated at US$6,305,571.99 including cost of feasibility studies, designs and construction and
supervision of works.

Cost benefit analysis from other mitigation efforts helps to put the efficiency of Project
investments in perspective. A CBA carried out on a statistical sample of approximately
5,500 mitigation grants from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
for earthquake, flood, and wind hazards indicates that the overall benefit-cost ratio for
these grants was about 4 to 1. The ratio, however, varied from 1.5 for earthquake
mitigation to 5.1 for flood mitigation (which corresponds to most of the mitigation
investments financed under the Project). 41 Other analyses focusing on flood and drought
hazards in South Asia show that return rates of mitigation investments are particularly
robust for lower-cost, local interventions that reduce risks associated with high frequency
but low magnitude events, such as the ones commonly faced by the participating
municipalities in Honduras.42

Economic Analysis of Mitigation Investments

Methodology. A cost-benefit analysis was undertaken for a sample of 21 structural
mitigation works, representing 35% of the 59 works financed under the Project. To
ensure the representativeness of the sample, the following criteria were applied: location;
total cost; total number of beneficiaries; economic activity of municipality / area of
influence; and additional benefits expected, such as improvement to access to markets
and social services. The list of mitigation works sampled for the analysis is shown in
Table 1.

The Project generally financed small riverbank protection works, raised bridges, raised
drainage canal-bridges (caja-puentes), drainage canals, and simple drainage systems, all
of which are represented in the sample. Efficiency of mitigation investments was, to
some extent, promoted by the Project’s requirement that the final decision to finance a
prioritized mitigation work should be based on a calculation of costs as a function of the
number of persons directly benefited by the specific work. Under the original credit there
was a cap per mitigation work of US$75,000, while under the AF this cap was eliminated.
Municipalities could also decide to co-finance a mitigation work that exceeded available
funds under the project.

As with other similar projects,43 the economic benefit stream was calculated through the
avoided damage cost method assessed as the cost of direct damage likely to be caused by
the disaster event that the mitigation work would help avoid within its area of influence.
The avoided cost (or impact of each work) would correspond to probabilistic estimates
according to previous events (particularly floods). Both economic benefits and costs are
estimated according to the type of work and the expectations related to each type. Data
were collected from the technical files of each mitigation work (including final direct
costs); and through a survey and field work carried out in the relevant municipalities.

 Estimation of Costs. The total investment of each work was estimated taking into
 consideration: (a) the cost of the risk and vulnerability analysis and identification and
 prioritization process required to decide on the specific work (resulting in Municipal Risk

(b) cost of feasibility study and design of the mitigation work; (c) cost of implementation,
including supervision and actual construction; and (d) cost of maintenance. Data on the
investments costs were collected from the files for each selected mitigation work and
estimated maintenance costs reported by local authorities. In the case of municipalities
that did not provided maintenance costs, projections were assumed based on data from
similar works and municipalities.45 Table 2 details the number of beneficiaries and cost
per sampled mitigation work.

Estimation of Economic Benefits

The flow of economic benefits from mitigation investments was estimated as the avoided
damage cost calculated in probabilistic terms based on historical data. The benefits
considered included, depending on the case: (i) reduction of property damage (including
physical structure and basic goods, furniture and equipment); (ii) reduction of



44
   It is noted that the PMGRs and PMOTs had broader benefits in the municipality and its population
beyond helping to decide on the mitigation investments.
45
   This was the case for: (i) Lepaera, Gracias y Atima, for which maintenance estimates from San Luis were
used; (ii) La Jigua, for which estimates from El Triunfo were used; and for (iii) Nueva Arcadia and San
Antonio, for which estimates from Morazán were used.


                                                     38
interruption in service provision, such as water and transport; (iii) less interruption of
economic activity; and (iv) temporary generation of jobs during construction.

There are other benefits, which due to data or methodological constraints could not be
included in the analysis, such as: reduction in losses to agricultural production; avoided
loss of human lives; decrease in number of affected people; reduction in outmigration;
and improvements in environmental conditions and land management. Some of these
benefits were, nevertheless, assessed qualitatively through a survey conducted in the 21
municipalities (see Annex 5).

Summary of the Analysis

The avoided damage to property was estimated considering the total number of housing
units under the area of influence of the mitigation work using as a basis the PMGRs, the
works’ technical studies and/or available cadastral information. For each case, the
analysis applied COPECO’s estimates for restoring of furniture, equipment and other
valuable belongings per housing unit (US$635.00) and rebuilding of the housing unit
(US$4,234.00). Only one case of avoided damage of public property in Pimienta was
identified, but this could not be estimated.

The avoided damage related to service provision was quantified for the case of the
riverbank protection in the municipality of Santa Rosa de Copán, which protected the
water pumping station no. 1 of the water system for the city. The benefits estimated in
this case correspond to the cost of rebuilding the pumping station and losses avoided
since service continuity is ensured.

To estimate the benefits of reduced losses in economic activities, the average of days per
year that access to markets had historically been interrupted was considered for places
where bridges, drainage canal-bridges and drainage-canals were built. The average days
of interrupted access was multiplied by the number of beneficiaries that were part of the
economically active population. Finally, this result was multiplied by the national
minimum daily rural wage.

The estimates of benefits and costs were projected to 25 years, which is the return period
applied to the design of the mitigation works. These figures were adjusted considering a
yearly inflation rate of 10% for restoration of furniture, equipment and other goods within
each household, 15% for construction and maintenance costs. Further, population trends
were adjusted according to projected growth rates in each municipality, and wages by
10% yearly adjustments.

Discussion of Results

As Table 3 shows, all mitigation works assessed show a positive NPV and IRR relatively
high. These results reflect, moreover, only a partial accounting of expected benefits.
NPV for the 21 works sampled is estimated at $13,064,522.65, while IRRs range from
12.56% to 112.18%, with an average of 50.68%.

The largest IRR (112.18%) was estimated for the mitigation work in Ajuterique, which
was damaged by Tropical Storm No. 16. In this case, the investment already showed their
effectiveness in saving lives and reducing the number of affected population. The local
government rapidly rebuilt the work and has since closely followed up on its maintenance.

The second IRR value (85.11%) and largest NPV (US$1,776,766.57) was estimated for
the mitigation work in San Antonio. This work combined the protection of a community
with better access (and improved evacuation route). The third IRR value (75.43%)
corresponds to the mitigation work in Choloma, which protected 500 houses.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
 
As part of the final socio-economic assessment of the Project, a survey of beneficiaries
was conducted in a sample of 22 municipalities, which represents over 25 percent of the
total of 81 participating municipalities. 46 In 21 of these municipalities the Project
financed mitigation works and in one a drought mitigation plan was implemented.

A. Methodology

Design and testing of questionnaire. The survey instrument was aligned with the Project
objective and expected results. It was tested in the municipality of Santa Lucia before its
application across the sample. The questionnaire aimed to gauge the attitudes and
perception of the population and direct beneficiaries with respect to emergency response
capacity, levels of project participation and ownership of results.

Sample design.A non-probabilistic sample of an average of 10 surveys per municipality
was planned with key informants in the community, mayors, vice-mayors, council
members, and technical staff. This effort resulted in a total of 220 respondents.

 Access to services and facilities. With regard to access to services and facilities,
 respondents consider that access to schools and health centers (over 80%) and to
 emergency shelters (over 68%) has improved. Over 68% of respondents also agree that
 evacuations routes have improved, along with prevention of landslides and floods (almost
 90%). Fewer people, however, consider that drought (10.5%) and forest fire (37.3%)
 management has improved.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY47

Project Context, Implementation, Objectives and Design

After Hurricane Mitch swept Honduras, the Government of Honduras (GoH) identified
natural disaster mitigation and prevention as a priority for the country – with the
understanding that moving from reacting to the consequences of disasters to preventing
their causes and mitigating their effects was essential – and expressed its request for
support formally to the International Donor Consultative Group which met in Stockholm,
Sweden, in May 1999.

In May 2000, the World Bank approved Credit No. IDA-3361-HO for the amount of
SDR 8.1 million (US$10.8 million equivalent); and on August 29, 2000, the Government
of Honduras started the Natural Disaster Mitigation Project (PMDN) supported by this
credit.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) during the initial phase was to strengthen
municipal capacity to reduce natural disaster risks and vulnerability through the
implementation of specific programs aimed at the institutional strengthening of the
following agencies: (a) the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA),
(b) the National Disaster Emergency Preparedness and Response Agency (COPECO),
and (c) the Association of Honduran Municipalities (AMHON); and especially the
strengthening of 60 municipalities throughout the country, selected according to a
rigorous prioritization process.

After seven years of execution, and following substantial changes in the coordination and
management areas in 2004, the initial Credit was successfully completed on September
30, 2007. This phase was thus closed with the understanding that its Development
Objective had been almost fully achieved, with the successful accomplishment of the
physical targets established in the context of the Project’s three operational components.
Budget execution reached 112.31 percent.

In light of these results, IDA and the GoH, which showed a clear interest in the Project’s
institutionalization, signed a new legal agreement for Credit No. 3361-1-HO (of August 9,
2007) whereby Additional Financing (AF) was provided for US$9.0 million equivalent to
ensure the continuity of PMDN’s activities. The AF was implemented during a total
period of 39 months, and concluded in December 2010. For the AF phase, the GoH
decided to appoint COPECO as the new implementing agency.

The emphasis of the PDO was changed from local / municipal capacity building to
national capacity building, while the components and cross-cutting pillars remained

unchanged; finally, some changes were introduced to the subcomponents. In addition, the
key impact indicators and key output indicators defined during phase one were modified,
considering that some of the processes for the achievement of these indicators had been
cancelled, as was the case, e.g., of the issues regarding the building code and river
geomorphology, and, instead, new activities were programmed for implementation in the
AF phase of the PMDN. This made it necessary to change the indicators to be assessed at
the completion of the project to determine the implementation status and the degree to
which the targets had been met. The level of budget execution under the AF reached
94.39 percent against the planned target.

Outcomes, Effects and Impacts

Prior to discussing the outcomes, effects and impacts of the Project’s components, we
should first note the results achieved in relation to the five main indicators of the
Project Development Objective (strengthening national capacity for natural disaster risk
and vulnerability reduction):

(a) In 81 Honduran municipalities, studies were conducted to survey hazards, risks and
    vulnerability, thus complying with 100% of the indicator during the Project’s initial
    phase. In connection with the application of land use and emergency plans in the
    context of municipal development plans, 53 municipalities have implemented them so
    far, which translates into 87% completion. Given that community participation
    proved decisive in the development of the process from a population perspective,
    multiplying effects were created with respect to knowledge of the municipality’s
    current situation, thus raising awareness and encouraging the establishment of a risk
    management culture among the population.

(b) Awareness has been raised among students of the fourth, fifth and sixth grades with
    regard to risk management as part of the natural sciences and social studies curricula,
    and according to the materials prepare by PMDN under COPECO’s supervision.
    Thus, children as a population segment were included in the strategy to develop a
    culture of prevention.

(c) Although no specific analyses and measurements were performed in this regard, with
    the establishment of municipal emergency committees (CODEMs) and local
    emergency committees (CODELs) in the municipalities within the PMDN’s area of
    influence, a substantial improvement was observed in the indicators measuring
    emergency response times, in response to the warning systems established by
    COPECO (which issues systematic warnings in case of emergency).

(d) Four community-based early warning systems were re-established during the AF
    phase of the project, in addition to one which had already established earlier and was
    in operation. This activity generated a series of impacts on the beneficiary population,
    for instance, (i) improvements in safety perception and knowledge of the emergency
    actions to be taken in case of adverse events; and (ii) where radio systems are
    operational, the population now has a power source for electric lighting and the radio

    system, which has also been useful as a means of communication in case of personal
    emergencies, specifically in the event of health problems. At the institutional level,
    there are improved communication channels between the CODEMs, the rescue
    organizations, the emergency response agencies and the population.

(e) The National Territorial Information System (SINIT), started under the PMDN, is
    currently in operation under the Bank-financed Honduras Land Administration
    Program (PATH). The PMDN generated a great volume of information which is
    currently freely available to the population which may require such data nationwide.
Outcomes, Effects and Impacts by Component:
Component A – Monitoring, Forecasting, Early Warning and GIS-based Information
Management:

   Provision of an operational decision-making support system (DSS) for all the
    agencies involved in flood monitoring and warning in Honduras; this enabled the
    implementation of a national emergency management system and a flood warning
    system which, in turn, facilitated the preparation of an inventory, analysis and
    diagnosis of the hydrological models to be used in implementing the DSS in the
    country’s main basins.
   Expansion of the hydro-meteorological network coverage with 33 new telemetric
    stations, with capacity to provide real-time rainfall and level readings, bringing the
    total of station managed by the General Directorate of Hydrological Resources
    (DGRH) under SERNA to 60. All these stations were calibrated and their flood
    warning thresholds were estimated under PMDN, using satellite communications
    through GOES 8, thus enabling coverage over scarcely monitored or unmonitored
    areas, such as the Aguán and Patuca River basin, and strengthening monitoring
    capacities in the Ulúa, Chamelecón and Choluteca river basins.
   Establishment of real-time record collection from remote hydrometric stations,
    enabling the timely development of flow forecast models through the installation of
    an earth station at the National Forecasting Center (CNP). With the installation of
    these new stations at key sites of the main basins, data started being collected every
    15 minutes, on a 24/7 basis throughout the year. In due course and once the series of
    records is more extensive, this data collection will lead to the improved calibration of
    flow-to-flow and rainfall-to-flow models to manage the issuance of early flood
    warnings. In some of the country’s main basins, such as the Ulúa, Chamelecón,
    Aguán and Choluteca basins, early warning systems are already in place based on the
    stations' records.
   COPECO and DGRH technical specialists were trained in the use of the XConect
    program, and will manage the database generated based on the stations’ reports, with
    appropriate training provided to staff involved in hydro-meteorological forecasts.
   Institutional strengthening of SERNA, with the creation of an internet website and the
    supply of IT equipment.



                                            52
   Design of landslide early warning systems in 7 municipalities, (Ajuterique, La
    Libertad, Lepaera, San Francisco del Valle, San Manuel Colohete, San Marcos de
    Ocotepeque and Belén Gualcho).
   Design of drought early warning systems for 25 municipalities; and reduction of
    drought effects in 8 municipalities of the country’s southern region, involving
    communities which are part of the mancomunidad (association of municipalities) of
    Mambocaure, through the implementation of drought management plans.
   Strengthening emergency response work by COPECO, with the publication of risk
    and hazard thematic maps.
   Improvement in the protection afforded to the residents of 7 municipalities through
    the design and implementation of 5 community-based early warning systems, which
    are based on community participation in monitoring, communication, forecasting and
    evaluation. Design of the Community-based Early Warning System Sustainability
    Plan, which provides for the current operability of these systems and will enable their
    replication in other basins in the country.
   Availability of the basic inputs required to initiate new risk and vulnerability analyses
    and preventive planning processes in 20 municipalities in the country.
Based on the effects generated by the component, the main impacts may be established
from a quantitative and qualitative perspective considering the social context. It should be
noted that it is difficult to determine which impact indicators (both quantifiable and
verifiable) were derived from the project’s direct actions, without performing a more
specific study to that end. However, the most relevant and easily identifiable impacts are
described below, according to the data, technical reports and outcomes presented in this
report. These impacts would include: (a) improved capacity for systematic teamwork of
the institutions involved in the Hydro-meteorological Forecasting system; (b) improved
quality of life of the population in the small towns and villages which benefited from the
implementation of drought response and mitigation plans; and (c) enhanced perception of
safety among the residents of the 7 municipalities which are the beneficiaries of the
community-based early warning systems, in the sense that they will be timely warned of
any emergency situation to which they might be exposed.

Component B – Strengthening of National Capacity to Support Emergency Response at
the Municipal Level:
 Strengthening of COPECO by providing search and rescue and forest firefighting
    equipment to address emergencies at the national level, and the development and
    implementation of a modern emergency management system, providing major IT
    equipment and connectivity services.
   Strengthening of    COPECO Regional agencies with technical staff hired by the
    PMDN.
   Establishment / re-establishment of CODEMs in 95 municipalities and establishment
    of 375 CODELs



                                             53
   Training municipal technical staff and civilian population to provide the first response
    in case of an adverse event.
   Integration of natural risk management concepts in the curricula of public schools.
   Generation of 2 preventive planning instruments: Municipal Risk Management Plan
    (PMGR) and Municipal Territorial Development Plan (PMOT) by developing and
    implementing the Land Use Planning and Characterization methodology. These plans
    were approved in town-hall sessions by the relevant municipal governments during
    the subsequent institutionalization model of Local Risk Management, established in
    81 municipalities.
   Design of the National Disaster Awareness Plan, which included radio and television
    spots and the distribution of posters, brochures and other visual media.
   Training of municipal technical specialists in local risk management, divided into
    four stages.
   Design of the SINAGER Participative Technical Process Systematization Plan and
    the corresponding draft regulations.
   IT equipment provided to the UNAH’s Risk Management Master’s Degree Program.
Considering the above, this component’s main impacts would include: (a) 5 COPECO
Regional agencies equipped with new rescue and firefighting equipment; (b) enhanced
awareness among fourth, fifth and sixth grade students regarding risk management, as
part of the natural sciences and social studies classes; and (c) municipal governments
have PMGR and PMOT plans readily available for application.

Component C – Building Capacity in Disaster Mitigation at the Municipal Level:

   Strengthening of the administrative management of 81 municipalities, based on the
    availability of a complete mapping information database covering their respective
    municipal areas.
   Municipal strengthening through (i) the availability of PMGR and PMOT instruments
    in 81 municipalities, which were duly approved by the municipal councils; (ii) the
    completion of 155 designs for structural mitigation works in 61 municipalities; and
    (iii) 58 municipalities benefited from mitigation works.
   Drought mitigation measures implemented in 8 municipalities belonging to the
    mancomunidad of Mambocaure.
Considering the above, this component’s main impacts would include: (a) although not
formally assessed, there are some indication and reports from local authorities which
suggest that municipal revenues have improved thanks to the cadastre information
provided by PMDN; (b) development of a sense of confidence and commitment in the
local authorities, due to the availability of land use plans and municipal emergency plans
applicable to their municipalities; (c) development of municipal commitment to obtain


                                            54
financing sources for the construction of the additional designs received through the
project; (d) generation of a sense of confidence in the population benefitting from
structural works for vulnerability reduction; (e) incorporation of some degree of
technology in many of the municipalities which had no knowledge of such resources,
improving their land administration and territorial planning. In this respect, the Project
collected graphic and numerical data for decision-making within a risk management
framework in 81 municipalities through the integrated system for municipal risk
management (SIGMR); and (f) through the preventive planning and participatory risk
assessment processes, the Project helped to convince municipal authorities of the risks
present in their territory and learn about adequate ways to reduce them. Since these
processes have involved strong community participation, the population is also aware of
their own territorial reality and is empowered to propose and monitor structural and non-
structural projects.

Findings and Lessons Learned

The organizational structure of a project such as PMDN should be simple and have clear
lines of accountability for smooth implementation. The Project’s original organizational
structure had three management and decision-making levels, namely: Political-
Institutional (Inter-Agency Coordination Group, GIC), Operational Management (UTC-
GAAEX and three technical-financial coordination units in SERNA, COPECO and
AMHON), and other operational entities (the Institutional Technical Group or GIT and
Technical Advisory Group, GAT). This structure failed to establish the degree of
coordination required to guide and channel the Project’s efforts towards the achievement
of outputs and outcomes.

Establishing a culture of prevention requires dedicated efforts and resources. The PMDN
selected a simple strategy combining an analytical process for hazard, vulnerability and
risk identification, the socialization and formalization of preventive planning and the
development of specific mitigation measures. This has proven to be an optimal way of
maintaining the interest of stakeholders and strategic partners, which leads to changing
their perception, behavior and capacity to manage the impact of adverse events.

The effective coordination of the Project with other related projects or instances in
connection with risk management issues is deemed strategic and necessary to attain the
Project’s outcomes. The reforms introduced in the Project’s organization promoted the
PMDN’s coordination and integration with other national initiatives (such as the Bank-
financed PATH and PBPR) which were working on complementary aspects including
land administration, land use planning and sustainable natural resource management.

The evolving policy and institutional framework facilitated Project implementation. Since
2002, Honduras had begun evolving towards land use planning and management;
therefore, at the time of the 2004 Project restructuring, the country had already made
considerable strides which were strongly linked to the Project’s objective and targets.
Community participation in risk analysis and preventive planning processes is central to
the generation of commitment, acceptance and ownership of the outputs and outcomes by



                                           55
the population. The methodology used in the development of the territorial planning and
characterization process enabled and promoted community participation as a
fundamental basis for the preparation of the mapping baseline and the analysis of disaster
events. The Project’s successful result was helped by the fact that the outputs generated
in the various processes have a high technical quality and contain valuable information to
be used in local risk management by the municipalities within the PMDN’s area of
influence.

To the extent possible, it is advisable to develop consulting processes jointly with local
organizations. These organizations have a better knowledge of the geography of the area,
the population’s mindset, contacts with the local authorities, and good grasp of the needs
of the population, and in most cases, they show a remarkable sense of commitment
toward the most vulnerable and poor. Under the Project, there were good experiences
with local organizations in the execution of specific consulting work, particularly those
which included social development aspects.

The experience with the individual consultants for the preparation of engineering designs
was not as positive; on this basis, some kind of penalties should be established to
sanction unjustified delays in the delivery of designs. The first 63 designs of structural
works were contracted to individual consultants based on a list supplied by the Ministry
of Public Works, Transportation and Housing (SOPTRAVI). This process was
excessively long and lasted approximately two years, since most of the consultants would
submit low quality work or which was not technically compliant with the terms of
reference, which led to much longer times for review, evaluation and corrections than
initially expected. It should be noted that, reflecting Bank procurement guidelines, no
penalty had been established in the contracts for consultant delays. As a result, the design
of the following 40 structural works was contracted to consulting firms. This process was
quicker and produced work of an excellent quality within 5 months.

In contrast, the process for the construction of 15 structural works was executed by
individual contractors selected from lists obtained from the Honduran Fund for Social
Investment (FHIS) database and by engineers proposed by the municipal governments
and PMDN with a well known capacity and responsibility in the performance of this kind
of work. The experience in this case was excellent as the works were timely and properly
completed. Additionally, the supervision was conducted by an engineer hired by each
beneficiary municipality, which efficiently cooperated in the day-to-day follow up of the
projects.
