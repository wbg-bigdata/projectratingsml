MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TIHE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE ExEcuTIvE DIREcTORS ON A
PROPOSED AGRICULTURAL REFORM IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT PROJECT
To THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
1.     I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendations on a proposed loan
to the Russian Federation for an amount equivalent to US$240 million to finance the implementation of
the Government's ongoing and future agricultural reform program by creating and strengthening
infrastructure and institutional capacity for a nationwide market information system, fanner information
and advisory services and enabling policy environment for private sector participation and by supporting
"pilot" investments by participating private enterprises dealing with agricultural marketing and modem
seed industry. The Agricultural Reform Implementation Support (ARIS) Loan would be at the Bank's
stand; rd variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years, including a five-year grace period.
A. SEUrOR BACKGROUND
2.     The agricultural sector plays a vital role in Russia's economy. First, the agro-industrial complex
is large and accounts for about 25 percent of the net material product, employment and investment.
Second, Russia is endowed with an extensive natural resource base with large agricultural potental, but
at present these resources are not being used efficiently. Third, agriculture absorbs a large share of
budgetary and hard currency resources, and any improvements in sector performance could have a large
mnpact on containing the budget deficit and improving the balance of payments. Fourth, consumers
allocate as much as 50 percent of their annual income to meet food requirements. Finally, agriculture
is an important sector to facilitate transition to a market economy and development of private enterpri- a.
Despite the sector's potential for higher efficiency and growth, the overall agricultural production. I.
distribution remain inefficient. Agricultural production is declining, yields are low, physical losses ase
high, output and input distribution systems are inefficient, prices are distorted, profitability is low and
subsidies still remain high.
3.     The prospects for agricultural production are largely dependent on the Government's ability to
enhance economic incentives, promote competition, reduce its intervention and implement agricultural
reforms. The government decrees and agricultural policies pursued since January 1992 indicate
significant reduction in Federal Go-vernment intervention at all stages of agricultural production,
distribution, marketing and pricing. However, there exists a wide variation in policies and reform
initiatives being pursued by different oblast governments.
4.     The Bank's strategy is to help put in place the fundamental building blocks, which are essential
to the development of a market oriented agricultural economy. While this transition will necessarily take
place over a number of years, there is an immediate need to develop human resources and institutional
capacity in agriculture which are vital for the efficient functioning of a market economy and the
implementation of agricultural reforms. The Bank's lending strategy thus focuses on financing key
investments in the private sector as demonstrations for wider replication, on developing the critical
infrastructure and institutions needed to support farm restructuring, land privatization, development of
markets, enhancement of knowledge through creation of market and fanmer information systems,
reduction in distortions and reform of agro-industrial enterprises.

B. PROJECr OJECnVES
5.     The main objectives of the project are: (a) to create and strengthen the most critical agricultural
support services to accelerate the implementation of on-going and future agricultural reforms; (b) to build
analytical and institutional capacity to identify, appraise and implement agricultural and agro-business
projects by the private sector on the basis of economic criteria; and (c) to demonstrate the role that the
private sector can plav in promoting efficiency in the agro-industrial sector. The support services would
focus on: (i) the creation of an enabling policy environment for private sector participation in seed and
market development; (ii) establishment of a nationwide market information system; and (iii) establishment
of farmer information and advisory services. The role of the private sector would be demonstrated by
selective "pilot" investments in seed and market enterprises. The provision of critical support services,
the development of analytical capacity and demonstration of the commercial viability of participating
enterprises are expected to lay the foundation for an efficient agricultural sector based on private
ownership and market principles.
C. PROJECT DESCRIPON
6.     The proposed project consists of three main components. These are: (a) market infrastructure
development; (b) farmer information and advisory services; and (c) seed industry development.
7.     Market infrastructure development consists of the creation of a market information system (MIS),
pilot investments in market infrastructure and institutional development. The MIS will be a nation-wide
system to collect, process and disseminate information on about 50 agricultural commodities and inputs.
The pilot investments will consist of establishing and upgrading market enterprises (fruit and vegetable
bases, mini-wholesale markets and vegetable storage facilities). These facilities will be owned and
operated by participating private enterprises. Training and technical assistance will be provided to MOAF
and local governments to enhance their catalytic role in market development.
8.     Farmer informuation and advisory services (FLAS) consists of information development,
information dissemination and institutional development. It is designed to meet the increasing demand
for critical information by newly emerging private farms, restructured state and collective farms and agro-
business enterprises. The underlying concept is an approach oriented to r-qer needs which is multi-source,
multi-user, multi-disciplinary and multi-media. FIAS will provide . mely and relevant agronomic,
technical, legal, business, management and environmmntal information in agriculturally important areas.
9.     Seed industry development consists of the establishment of commercially viable hybrid corn and
sunflower seed production and processing units owned and operated by private enterprises located in
selected southern oblasts, krays and republics having a comparative advantage in seed production for
these crops. These investments are intended to demonstrate how a commercial seed industry could be
organized in a market environment. It will also support the establishment of a national policy and
institutional framework which is consistent with accepted international norms.
10.    In addition, Project Development Unit (PDU) has been established within the MOAF to
coordinate the overall implementation of the ARIS project and to develop analytical capacity to prepare
future agricultural projects for financing by international financial institutions.
11.    Total project cost is estimated to be US$325 million, of which 74 percent is expected to be in
foreign exchange. The respective shares of the project components in total project cost are 33 percent
for market infrastructure development, 20 percent for farmer information and advisory services, 45
percent for seed industry development and 2 percent for PDU. The proposed Bank loan of US$240



- 3 -
million would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the project. It was agreed during
negotiations to include a provision for retroactive financing up to US$1.0 million to cover expenditures
beginning on June 1, 1994. The Federal Government and the participating private enterprises would
finance all local costs, including any payments of import duties and taxes. About 60 percent of Bank
funds would be on-lent in US dollars, through commercial banks on an agency basis, to the participating
private seed and marketing enterprises as sub-loans with maximum maturity period of 10 years, including
2 years grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate plus a margin of 2.5 percent. Any surplus
reflows (the difference between borrower's repayment obligations and sub-borrowers' repayments) will
be used on a revolving basis, and on similar terms and conditions, to finance similar private sub-projects
acceptable to the Bank. The Government would bear the.default risk and the cross-currency risk; and
the sub-borrowers would bear the foreign exchange risk between the US dollar and the ruble. Summary
of project cost estimates ano the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
is given in Schedule C.
D. PoJEcr IMPLnENTATION
12.    The MOAP will be responsible for implementing the ARIS project. The PDU will coordinate
all the day-to-day work related to ARIS implementation, budgeting, procurement, disbursement, audit,
reporting, monitoring, evaluation and appraisal of all the private sector sub-projects.  Actual
imnplementation of projecz components and sub-components will be the responsibility of component
implementation units located within the departments and agencies of MOAF and in local government
agencies. MOAF will work with the departments of agriculture at the oblast and rayon levels to
implement different project components. The sub-loans to the pilot seed and marketing enterprises would
be made in accordance with the terms spelled out in para. 11 above. The sub-projects would be appraised
by the PDU and would be subject to review and clearance by the Bank. However, at least the first three
sub-projects, for each of the seed and marketing enterprises, would be appraised by the Bank. The ARIS
project will be implemented only in those regions which have agreed with the. MOAF to participate in
the project. The implementation capacity of the MOAF would be strengthened through appropriate
training and technical assistance in procurement, accounting and project management.
E. PROJECr SUSTrANABUrTY
13.    The sustainability of the project depends on: (a) availability of counterpart funds; (b) trained
staff; and (c) commitment of the Government to continue project activities. The project is designed to
assist in removing resource and skill constraints, thereby making it possible to sustain the project after
five years. The participating private enterprises as "pilot" sub-projects would account for about 60
percent of the loan proceeds. The feasibility studies of selected enterprises indicate that the enterprises
would be commercially viable and will be able to sustain their operations.
14.    The remaining 40 percent of loan proceeds would finance much needed public sector activities
to develop and disseminate information to private farmers, restructured farms and agro-business
enterprises and institutional support to private seed industry. The project would introduce the concept
of "fee for service" for selected activities. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the following
cost recovery principles for services provided by the public sector: (i) establishment of a fee schedule for
selected services in 1995; (ii) introduction of fee for service and other appropriate cost recovery measures
in 1996; and (iii) establishment, operation and use of a "fund" in the MOAF from resources collected
through fees or oher cost recovery measures in 1996. The Bank will work with the Government during
implementation to design a cost recovery strategy to sustain the project.

F. LESSONs FROM PREvIous BANK EXPERIENCE
15.    The Bank has extensive experience in implementing diverse agricultural projects -- including
market development, agricultural extension and seed industry. The proposed ARIS project is the first
Bank project which deals with agricultural marketing, farmer information and advisory services and seed
industry in the FSU. Given serious legal, institutional, political and economic problems faced by Russia,
the proposed project may encounter problems. However, the design of the ARIS project has incorporated
the relevant lessons to improve its chances for satisfactory performance.
16.    Agricultural marketing projects supported the role of prices, market organization and
infrastructure development but relied heavily on government parastatals. However, direct or indirect
control on marketing margins, poor management, inadequate project preparation and implementation
problems contributed to poor performance. The experience with agricultural extension projects indicates
that: (i) such projects should strengthen generation, use and exchange of information; (Ji) a participatory
approach leads to successful project design; (iii) increased emphasis should be on multi-media approach
for dissemination; and (iv) while the public sector will continue to play an important role in agricultural
extension, there is a need to encourage the role of private sector. Finally, Bank experience with seed
projects in other countries has been primarily in the public sector. Many Bank projects have operated
below their capacity. This has been due to lack of appropriate national seed policy and serious
implementation problems. The establishment of government model seed farms has not been successful
due to lack of appropriate incentives and trained personnel.
G. RATIONALE FOR BANK PARTICIPATION
17.    The Bank's involvement n the agricultural sector is essential to continue the dialogue with the
Government which was initiated through the major Bank report entitled Food and Agricultural Policy
Reforms in the Former USSR: An Agenda for the Transition, which was financed by the Bank's Technical
Cooperation Program and was published in 1992. The Bank's support for this project would: (a) help
develop key institutions necessary to implement agricultural reform; (b) accelerate the development of
private farming; (c) finance critical investments to develop market infrastructure and modem seed
industry; and (d) contribute to the prospects for continuing policy reform.
18.    The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Rursia was discussed with the Executive
Directors on May 19, 1994. At that time, the Bank recommended an Intermediate Case lending program
on the order of $1.0 - 1.5 billion annually (not including quick-disbursing adjustment lending), which
would include a set of core projects that would not require major sectoral policy conditionality. The
ARIS project and the companion Land Reform Implementation Support (LARIS) Project are included in
the set of core projects. The objectives of the CAS include: (i) support for the development of a market-
oriented economy based on private sector initiatives; (ii) encouragement of the redirection of public sector
involvement in the economy toward the establishment of open and competitive markets and the provision
of physical, social, legal and institutional infrastructure not normally provided through the private sector;
and (iii) establishment of the Bank as a trusted and reliable development partner. The proposed ARIS
Project meets all three objectives. The private sector would be involved in the operation of key
agricultural marketing infrastructure and the development of a modem seed industry. The public sector
would focus on the development of market information system and the provision of farmer information
and advisory services to support the evolution of markets and growth of private fanning. The Bank's
support for programs aimed at the development of private farming has encouraged the MOAF in
promoting sound policies in this sector. The proposed project is therefore fully consistent with the Bank's
CAS for Russia. The status of Bank Group operations is given in Schedule D.

H. ACIIONS AGREED
19.    The Government has informed the Bank of (a) Government's policy on liberalization of prices
and elimination of subsidies and administrative controls on marketing of seeds (hybrid corn and
sunflower), fruits and vegetables; and (b) Government's commitment to maintain these policies.
20.    The following agreements were reached during negotiations: (i) agreement on cost recovery
principles; (ii) agreement on the terms and conditions for sub-loans to participating private enterprises;
(iii) agreement on the process for preparation, appraisal, approval and financing of sub-projects; (iv)
agreement on the use of any surplus reflows on a revolving basis for financing simila sub-projects; (v)
agreement on the composition of the Project Coordination Committee for the PDU and its role in
approving project sub-loans; (vi) agreement on the organization, staffing, functions and financing of PDU
and the component implementation units; (vii) agreement on the provision of periodic reports on project
progress, accounts for the project, auditing requirements and financial statements; (viii) agreement on
selection procedures for procurement agents; (ix) agreemtnt on selection procedures for commercial banks
to manage the Special Account and/or to serve as agency banks; (x) agreement on adequate legal and
administrative framework for making sub-loans to private enterprises; (xi) agreement on guidelines for
oblast participation in the project; and (xii) agreement on the position for retroactive financing up to
US$1.0 million.
21.    The following are the conditions of loan effectiveness: (i) appointment of key staff of the PDU
(project management specialist, accountant, procurement specialist and technical specialists); (ii)
establishment of component implementation units within the departments and agencies of MOAF and in
at least two participating regions for sub-components dealing with private seed and marketing enterprises
and appointment of their directors; and (iii) establishment of the Project Account with an iritial deposit
of at least US$1.0 million equivalent in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank.
I. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPE$T
22.    The project is expected to have a positivc impact on the environment. The move toward private
farming promoted by this project is expected to foster more prudent use of land and other natural
resources. In addition, public awareness of agricultural environmental issues will be created through
appropriately designed environmental information collection and dissemination, technical assistance and
training programs. Anv environmental concerns related to new investment sub-projects for the
development of "pilot" seed and marketing enterprises will be addressed during implementation of sub-
projects by following the Bank's and the country's environmental requirements and guidelines. The
feasibility studies for seed and marketing enterprises will include an obligatory environmental review, the
adequacy of which will be verified by the PDU. The Bank review of typical feasibility studies will
ensure the adequacy of environmental analysis and suggest improvements as necessary. The PDU will
be given the responsibility of ensuring that recommendations made in environmental analyses are
implemented. The project has a "B" environmental assessment category.
J. PROGRAM OBETVE CATEGORIES
23.    The ARIS Project supports (i) private sector development through the creation of market
information system and farmer information system and advisory services and the development of private
marketing and seed enterprises; (ii) improved public sector management by developing the institutional
capacity of the MOAF; and (iii) development of a policy, legal and institutional framework for
accelerating the implementation of agricultural reforms.

K. PRojEcT BENEmS
24.    The project is expected to have substantifl eirect and indirect financial and economic benefits
for individual enterprises, farmers, consumers and the nation. The project's potential benefits include
enhanced economic incentives, increased agricultural production (particularly corn and sunflower seeds),
farm income, rural employment, and foreign exchange savings. The project would support accelerating
the pace of reforms which would lead to an efficient agricultural sector based on private ownership and
market principles.  The development or a market information system and alternative agricultural
marketing channels will increas- competition, reduce physical losses, provide higher quality food at
competitive prices and have favorable impact on prices and marketing services received by farmers and
hence farm income. The development and dissemination of appropriate and timely information and
advisory services to private farmers, newly restructured farms and agro-business enterprises will enable
them to make informed business decisions, improve agricultural productivity and actively participate in
the process of agricultural reform. The establishment of a modern seed industry would increase the
availability of quality seed which, in turn, would result in higher crop yields and foreign exchange
savings from reduction in seed imports and would lay the foundation for a modern seed industry in the
private sector. The project would train a large number of Russian experts to advise farmers and develop
analytical capacity to prepare and implement future agricultural projects.
L. PRojECr RimK
25.    The main risk is that the project may face delays in implementation. Factors that could cause
problems in project implementation include: the current unstable macroeconomic environment and its
possible further deterioration, lack of political consensus on agricultural reforms, delay in government
decision-making and lack of counterpart funds and trained personnel with experience in implementing
World Bank projects. The maintenance of free markets for the sale of seeds is critical for the commercial
viability of participating private seed enterprises. As long as these prices are not controlled, domestic
seed prices should adjust with changes in international prices and the exchange rate, which should enable
private investors to obtain an attractive return on their investment. The review and appraisal of at least
the first three sub-projects for each of the seed and marketing enterprises by the Bank are expected to
reduce potential implementation risks. The project has introduced necessary measures in the form of legal
covenants, training and technical assistance, and has allocated necessary resources to minimize these risks.
The establishment of a strong PDU, with appropriate support for procurement, disbursement, accounting,
project management and technical aspects, is also expected to mitigate some of the potential project risks.
The project would be intensively supervised (including a project launch workshop, annual reviews and
a comprehensive mid-term review) so that appropriate and timely actions are taken to avoid and overcome
implementation problems.
M. RECOMMENDATION
26.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the loan.
