 SYNOPSIS
  Croatia aims to crown 15 years of impressive economic and social progress by joining the European
  Union, but to do so, it will need to bolster its economic competitiveness, ensuring Croatians enjoy
  sustainable improvements in their quality of life. The International Bank for Reconstruction and
  Development (IBRD) is helping the government invest in important trade infrastructure and research and
  development initiatives and cut red tape, such as the time it takes to register property, and support a wide
  range of social projects, ranging from more energy-efficient schools to the removal of land mines.
