APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Fifth National Development Plan (1969-1972) emphasizes the
need to modernize and improve the country's infrastructure to support the
rapid developments in industry and agriculture. This includes the modern-
ization and expansion of education and training facilities. In particular,
the country requires increased numbers of skilled workers as industry and
exports become more diversified.
ii.       Vocational education and related teacher training have not, in
the past, followed labor market needs nor received systematic attention,
resulting in a shortage of qualified technical personnel at lower and
middle levels and of qualified instructors.
iii.      The strategy therefore is to match training facilities to man-
power requirements and improve vocational education at all levels as
well as the teaching of science and industrial subjects in secondary
schools.
iv.       The project would assist the expansion and improvement of voca-
tional education for industry at the senior secondary and junior college
levels; the training of secondary school and junior college teachers of
science, industrial arts and vocational subjects; and educational planning.
A Bank loan of US$9.0 million equivalent is recommended.
v.        The proposed project would assist the expansion of 16 senior sec-
ondary vocational schools and a Junior college of technology and provide
one new such college; the expansion of the Industrial Education Department
and the relocation and expansion of the College of Science at the National
Taiwan Normal University. Technical assistance for project implementation,
curriculum development, educational planning and for preparation of a sec-
ond project is also included.
vi.       The project would add 14,000 training places at skilled worker
level, 2,700 at technician level and 2,100 teacher training places.
There would be a sufficient number of qualified students for entry to
the educational institutions included in the project; there are good
prospects of employment for those who complete the courses. The number
of qualified teachers available now and as a result of the proposed
project would be sufficient to staff these institutions.



- ii -
vii.      The project would require:  (a) increased utilization of voca-
tional education facilities; (b) improved inspection of vocational educa-
tion; (c) measures for further training of vocational school teachers; and
(d) the development of educational planning within the Ministry of Education.
viii.     The preparatory studies to be assisted under the project would be
for fishery training and instructional television, possible components of a
second project.
ix.       Accommodation schedules have been revised in conformity with
acceptable standards. Furniture and equipment costs are appropriate and
economical. A project unit within the Ministry of Education, responsible
for implementation, would be assisted by consultant architects who would
undertake design and supervision of the construction work.
x.        The proposed project is estimated to cost US$15.0 million equiv-
alent and to require about 3-1/2 years for completion. Contracts would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. The project
is not likely to attract foreign bidders for construction work. Assuming
that local contractors would carry out construction but that all equipment
would be imported, the foreign exchange costs would be about US$9.0 mil-
lion or 60% of project cost. The Government should be able to meet its
share of the capital cost of the project and to finance the related recurrent
expenditures.
xi.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$9.0 million equiva-
lent for a term of 25 years including a grace period of 10 years.



APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN CHINA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A Bank economic mission visited China in 1968 and emphasized the
need for increased investment in education. A Unesco project identifica-
tion mission in January, 1969, was followed by a Unesco project preparation
mission in May, 1969. In August, 1969, the Government of China applied for
a Bank loan to assist the development of vocational education and instruct-
ional television (ITV).
1.02      An appraisal mission comprising Messrs. K. Bahr (economist),
G.F.F. Gayle (agricultural education), D.H. Lewis (architect), S.Z. Sung
(technical education) and S. Futagami, consultant (educational television)
visited China in September-October, 1969. It found that two project items,
educational television and fishery education, were insufficiently prepared
for appraisal. The project was further modified to adapt it more closely
to the needs of industry as well as to proper teaching standards. Equip-
ment lists were revised, construction items were reduced and technical
assistance was increased, primarily for curriculum development.
1.03      The amended project comprises:
(i) the expansion of 16 senior secondary vocational industrial
schools;
(ii) 1 new junior college of technology and the expansion of
another;
(iii) expansion of the Industrial Education Department of the
National Taiwan Normal University;
(iv) relocation and expansion of the Science College of the
National Taiwan Normal University; and
(*)  technical assistance for project implementation, curriculum
development, educational planning and preparatory studies
for a second project.
The total estimated project cost is US$15.0 million with a foreign exchange
component of US$9.0 million.
Social and Economic Background
1.04      The island of Taiwan covers approximately 14,000 square miles
(36,000 km2). Two-thirds are mountainous and largely unproductive and
arable farning is restricted to about 25% of the land.



1.05      Estimated total population in mid-1969 was 14 million.  About
41% is below 15 years of age; some 55% live in urban areas. Total employ-
ment is about 4.8 million. Underemployment occurs in agriculture and in
some services.
1.06      Real GNP grew at 8.6% annually on the average during the period
1953-1968, 9.9% in 1967 and 10.3% in 1968. This fast growth, mainly due
to investments and exports, was accompanied by changes in the structure
of the economy. Industrialization is proceeding rapidly. In terms of
employment, agriculture is the largest sector, with 50% of total employ-
ment, followed by services with 22%, and industry in the third place with
16.5% (Annex 1). However, the growth in industrial employment was the
fastest with 122% between 1956 and 1968. In terms of net domestic product,
agriculture has shrunk from 31% to 23% between 1956 and 1968, whereas
industry has increased from 22% to almost 30%, now occupying first place,
before services (26.5% in 1968) and agriculture. This trend oof rapid indus-
trialization is expected to continue. At present, however, the shortage
of technically skilled manpower is impeding faster economic growth.
1.07      There has been no appreciable increase in cultivated land during
the past decade and foreseen increases are small because of land scarcity.
Intensive agriculture, as well as the growing fishery production, will
therefore increase the need for qualified labor.
II. THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
2.01      China's educational system is well advanced.  98% of the primary
school age group and 60% of the secondary school age population are enroll-
ed. Literacy is as high as 90%. However, the rapid growth of the educa-
tion sector has not been related to the specific needs for qualified man-
power in the various sectors of the economy. In particular, vocational
education and training for industry, agriculture and fishery have not
received adequate attention.
Structure and Organization
2.02      The educational system comprises 6 years primary, 6 years secon-
dary and 4 years higher education (Annex 2). The secondiry level has
a junior and a senior cycle, each of 3 years. In 1968, free but not compulsory
universal education was extended from 6 to 9 years (grades 7 - 9). Juiior
vocational schools are being phased out and industrial arts introduced
into junior high schools. In 1968-69, total enrollment had approached
3.5 million, representing about 25% of the country's population (Annexes
3, 4 and 5). Annex 6 shows the number of teachers employed.
Administration
2.03      Policy, administrative and financial responsibilities are
spread over three levels, national, provincial and counties (Annex 7).



- 3 -
This separation has led to difficulties in the formulation of consistent
national education measures and the efficiency of their implemenation.
The Minister of Education is responsible for national policy and supervises
all universities, colleges and junior colleges. The structure of the Minis-
try (Annex 8) is generally functional but the lack of a planning unit has
retarded systematic development of education. Changes have been made on an
ad hoc basis, only loosely related to the needs of the economy.
2.04      At the intermediate level, the Provincial Department of Education
and the Taipei Municipal Bureau of Education execute national policy, are
responsible for senior high schools and senior vocational schools (grades
10 - 12) and the inspection of all intermediate level institutions. The
County Bureaux of Education are responsible for primary and junior high
schools. The Provincial Department of Education also maintains two univer-
sities, two colleges, and 16 junior colleges.
2.05      The vocational education inspectorates of the Ministry of Educa-
tion, the Provincial Department of Education and the Taipei Municipal Bu-
reau of Education, are understaffed quantitatively and qualitatively. Im-
provement is needed for efficient supervision, syllabi development and
operation. Assurances regarding the development and implementation of a
program to expand and strengthen these inspectorates were given by the Govern-
ment during negotiations.
2.06      Supplementary education programs for out-of-school youths and
adult education courses are offered as part of the public educational
system. School broadcasting and educational television are used to a
small extent.
Primary Education
2.07      There were 2,244 primary schools in 1968-69 with a total enroll-
ment of 2.4 million representing 98Z of the age group. All primary school
teachers are qualified.
Secondary Education
2.08      Junior high schools (grades 7 - 9) follow a common general
course. Senior high schools (grades 10 - 12) are academic or vocational.
In 1968-69, 803 secondary schools had a total enrollment of 920,000 (44%
of the age group). About 70% of the teachers were qualified.
Junior Colleges
2.09      Junior colleges, including institutes of technology, have a
5-year course, for grades 10 - 14. Recently, 2-year and 3-year post-
secondary courses have been introduced for senior vocational school
graduates. In 1968-69 total enrollment in the 63 junior colleges amounted
to 76,700 (63,160 in grades 10 - 12 and 13,540 at post-secondary level).
Almost all of the 3,560 teachers were qualified.



-4-
Higher Education
2.10      Eight universities, of which 4 are national, 2 provincial and 2
private, and 14 colleges, provide higher education. Total enrollment in
1968-69 was 83,500; in engineering departments of universities and colleges
enrollment was 13,600.
Teacher Training
2.11      Primary school teachers were formerly either graduates of second-
ary normal schools or secondary general schools with some in-service train-
ing. In future, they will come from 2-year post-secondary training. Most
secondary school teachers are graduates of universities but only those who
have attended full or part-time courses at the National Taiwan Normal
University have received pedagogical training. There is a serious shortage
of teachers of science, vocational subjects and industrial arts.
Private Education
2.12      Private education plays an important role.  In 1968-69 about 11%
of junior secondary pupils were enrolled in private institutions, with 32%
at senior secondary level and 52% at university level. A recent ministerial
decision reauires private education to concentrate in future on senior
secondary schools, junior colleges and universities. All private schools
have to be registered; supervision by the Ministry and coordination with
the public school system are poor.
Technical Education
2.13      Senior vocational schools (Grades 10 - 12) give instruction
in agricultural, commercial, industrial and maritime subjects, nursing
and midwifery and home economics.  Approximately 80% of the graduates
from these schools are employed in fields related to their education.
Total enrollment in 1968-69 was 114,700 (compared to 152,900 in academic
senior high schools).  Government policy is to reach a ratio of 6 to 4
vocational school enrollment compared with academic schools. The
industrial streams will grow significantly; agricultural streams will
decrease.
2.14      Technician training is given in junior colleges.  Two provincial
and 12 private junior colleges offer industrial courses; enrollment was
13,270 in 1968-69. About 80% of the graduates are industrially employed.
2.15      Technically trained graduates have no difficulty in finding
employment but the link between private industry and public educational
institutions is weak. Instructors in general lack the practical experience
essential for laboratory and workshop instruction. Assurances that practi-
cal training for these teachers would be organized by the Ministry of Educa-
tion, in close cooperation with industry were obtained from the Government
during negotiations. Laboratory and workshop equipment is generally poor
with the exception of a few schools formerly assisted by USAID.



-5-
Agricultural Education
2.16      Agricultural education is offered by senior vocational schools
(grades 10 - 12), junior colleges and universities. The schools have
many unfilled places and only about 30% of the graduates take up agricul-
tural employment. The demand for places at, and for graduates from, junior
colleges of agriculture is growing, reflecting increasing complexity of
agricultural production techniques. Consequently, the emphasis is moving
from agricultural vocational schools, many of which are being closed, to
the junior colleges. Assistance to the latter may be included in the pro-
posals for a later Bank project.
III. COST AND FINANCING OF EDUCATION
Financing of Education
3.01      The National Government finances most of public higher education
institutions, the Provincial Government all public senior general schools
and vocational education institutions including many junior colleges, and
the County and Local Governments the primary and junior secondary schools.
3.02      The Constitution sets minimum educational expenditure levels
at 15% of the national government budget, 25% of the provincial budget (includ-
ing the Taipei Municipal budget) and 35% of the county budgets. Transfer
of funds from one government level to another does not take place. In July,
1968, a County education tax was introduced to permit the extension of free
education by 3 years.
3.03      Public primary and junior secondary education are free. All other
public educational institutions charge nominal tuition fees which cover not
more than 2% of recurrent expenditures. Vocational schools may obtain in-
come from production units related to workshop training but this does not
exceed 10% of their recurrent expenditure.
3.04      Private education does not receive financial assistance except
that investment loans are available through the Education Reconstruction
Fund, a revolving fund established by the government in 1960.
Total Educational Expenditure
3.05      Public expenditures on education (Annexes 9 and 10) have increased
as a percentage of total expenditures at all levels of government from 10.4
to about 16.5 and as a percentage of GNP, from 2.1 to about 3.2 during 1960/
61 to 1968/69. If private sector expenditures are also taken into account,
the share of total educational expenditure in GNP has increased from 2.4%
in 1960/61 to 3.8% in 1968/69. These expenditure levels compare favourably
with those of countries with comparable per capita incomes, e.g., 3% in the
Philippines, and 3.9% in Korea.
3.06      The distribution of the financial burden of public education has
changed considerably since 1964 showing a marked tendency towards increasing
the role of the provincial government.  In 1968/69 about 46% of total public



education expenditures were financed through the county and local budgets,
compared to 60% in 1964/65. The share of the provincial government (in-
cluding Taipei Municipal Government) had risen considerably from 26% to 37%
during the same period; whereas that of the national government increased
only slightly from 14% to 17%.
Capital Expenditure
3.07      Capital expenditure can only be estimated since educational ex-
penditure accounting practices have not so far distinguished between capital
and recurrent items. A sample survey suggests (Annex 11) that, with 15% to
19% annually during the decade 1958/59 to 1968/69, the share of capital ex-
penditure in total public education expenditure has been moderate.
3.08      Private sector expenditures have played an increasingly important
part in the educational development of the country. Details of capital
expenditures for private education, however, are not known. Judging from
the increasing share of private education in total enrollments (Annex 4),
they must have been substantial.
Recurrent Expenditure
3.09      As mentioned above, it is difficult to separate recurrent from
capital expenditures. Between 1965/66 and 1966/67, the only fiscal years
with relatively detailed information on public recurrent educational ex-
penditures, the allocation of recurrent expenditures between levels of
education remained largely unchanged i.e., 41% for primary education, 32%
for secondary education, 13% for higher education, 10% for other types of
education and 4% for administration. These figures indicate a reasonable
balance of expenditure between the various levels.
3.10      The distribution of public recurrent expenditure between salaries
and other expenditure items is shown below:
1965/66               1966/67
Salaries     Other   Salaries       Other
Primary Education                       94%          6%       90%         10%
Secondary Education                     73%         27%       74%         26%
Higher Education                        47%         53%       43%         57%
Administration and other Education   100%            0%      100%          0%
Total Public Recurrent Expenditures   82%           18%       80%         20%
This recurrent expenditure pattern, as well as the distribution of total
public education expenditure between capital and recurrent items, compares
well with the patterns prevailing in other countries with school enrollment
ratios as high as in China.



- 7 -
3.11      Unit costs per student/year in primary education are about NT$746
(about US$19); those for high school are almost three times higher and those
for vocational school are five times higher, with an average of NT$3,814
(US$95). Unit costs for university and normal schools reached, respectively,
NT$11,683 (US$292) and NT$8,474 (US$211) in 1967/68. These unit costs com-
pare favourably with costs in other countries. 1/
Foreign Aid
3.12      No significant foreign aid has been granted to education since
the phasing out of U.S. aid in 1965. U.S. "project" aid to education,
however, had been relatively small (1961-65, US$9.16 million, equivalent
to 2.4% of total U.S. project aid to China). UNDP is at present assisting
China with pilot centers for technical training. Other U.N. agencies
(Unesco, FAO, World Food Program, ILO) are granting technical assistance
and some financial aid.
Future Expenditure
3.13      In the Fifth Four-Year Plan (1969-1972), allocations to education
from all government budgets are shown without separating recurrent from
capital expenditures. Total public expenditure on education is estimated
to reach about $180 million in 1971 and $240 million in 1974/75 (Annex 12).
The latter is estimated to be about 20% of total government revenue as com-
pared to 16.5% in 1968/69. Assuming that private education will continue
and barring any extended slowdown of economic growth, financing of the
expected increases should not prove to be overly burdensome for the govern-
ment.
3.14      By reason of the narrowing base of the population pyramid (due,
in part, to the public family planning program) and to already high enroll-
ment rates, school construction and related public educational investment
are likely not to exceed 20% of total public education expenditure, includ-
ing capital expenditure related to the proposed project during this decade.
IV. THE NEED FtOR THE PROJECT
4.01      The Fifth National Development Plan (1969-1972) emphasizes the
need to expand and diversify the country's export industries to strengthen
their competitive position. Attainment of these objectives requires an
increase in skilled manpower and improvement of the education and skill
levels of the working population. Appropriate development of the education
and training sector is therefore of great importance and Government policy
is now being guided by labor market needs. The strategy is to provide a
broad educational basis through a nine-year general education program and
to follow this by education and training in vocational, technical and science
subjects for the development of specific skills.
1/   Comparable figures for primary, secondary and higher education are $17,
$32 and $360 in Korea and $43, $83 and $360 in Malaysia.

4.02      Fundamental changes in the country's employment profile are fore-
seen for the decade 1967-1977. In relative terms, employment in manufac-
turing will rise considerably as agricultural employment falls. The demand
for higher skill levels and for skilled workers (Annex 13) will increase
as export markets require more sophisticated products.
4.03      Total civilian employment is expected to rise by 1.124 million
persons during 1967-1974 (Annex 14). In addition, about 0.58 million workers
will have to be replaced, leading to a total of about 1.7 million persons
employed for the first time, or an average increase of about 243,000
annually. The goals for new entrants into civilian employment are sunmarized
in Column 1 of the following table:

No estimates are available beyond 1974 but, in view of the trends described
in paras. 4.01 and 4.02 above, the figures are indicative of manpower
demand over a longer period.



- 9 -
4.04      According to the estimates summarized above, shortages of qualified
personnel are likely to occur and accumulate in industrial and fishery train-
ing at upper secondary and junior college levels. A surplus will develop in
agricultural education at secondary level but the number of agricultural
graduates from junior colleges will remain below the demand.
4.05      The proposed project is designed to reduce manpower shortages in
those training sectors which are most important to economic development,
with the exception of fishery training (para. 4.07 below), as shown in
the following table:

vocational subject teachers         20              70               200
4.06      Even after project implementation the annual supply in the above
mentioned categories will remain below the average annual present needs
and is likely to be even further below the accumulated and growing manpower
needs anticipated for the mid-seventies. Further efforts will be needed
in the near future but a larger project, aimed at meeting demands in a
shorter period, is inadvisable due to the shortage of instructional staff
and the limitations on growth of funds for capital expenditures.
4.07      Fishery personnel with secondary vocational education are in short
supply (para. 4.03). In view of the increasingly important role of the
fishing sector in food production for domestic and export markets, the need
for more skilled fishery manpower is urgent. However, the present structure,
organization and content of fishery vocational education are in need of re-
form. Expert assistance is required to prepare such reform measures and to
develop a detailed investment program for fishery training before financial
assistance can be considered (para. 1.02). The proposed project therefore
includes the cost of technical assistance to develop a program and prepare
a project for fishery education and training.
4.08      Teacher Training.  In order to implement the policy of extending
free education to grade 9, with the concurrent need for more science and
industrial arts teachers, and to provide the vocational subject teachers
to develop technical education, teacher training in these fields must be
both expanded and improved. The present annual outputs of the Industrial
Education Department and the College of Science of the Normal University
(NTNU) are 40 in industrial arts, 20 in vocational subjects and 300 in



- 10 -
science, whereas the total need by 1974 will be 1,100, 1,000 and 6,700,
respectively (Annex 15). An increase in the facilities of the National
Taiwan Normal University is therefore of high priority.
4.09      Educational Planning.  If education is to develop and expand in
close relation with economic growth, the need for education planning is
paramount. The introduction of systematic educational planning, however,
is hampered by a serious lack of expertise. The Ministry of Education has
a unit with a small staff, ostensibly responsible for planning, but it lacks
knowledge and experience that, initially, can only come from foreign experts.
The proposed project therefore provides for technical assistance to help
the Government establish proper educational planning. Assurances that the
educational planning unit in the linistry of Education would be given appro-
priate responsibility and status were given by the Government during negotia-
tions.
The Qualitative Need
4.10      As stated above (para. 4.01), Government policy is to raise the
levels of craft and technician training. Upgrading of skill training re-
quires improved teaching and facillties. Many teachers in the vocational-
industrial schools lack adequate industrial experience, the principal cause
being the difference between vocational instructors' salaries and those of
engineers and craftsmen in the private sector. Programs for in-service
training for present staff are therefore to be developed by the Ministry
of Education, preferably in collaboration with private industry. These
should include some in-plant training, to raise the technical standards
of instructors and the skills of their students (see para. 2.15 above).
4.11      A second need arises from the shortage of equipment at many of
the vocational industrial schools and junior colleges. Under the project,
18 of these would receive the equipment required to raise the level of
practical instruction to a point where the students can proceed directly
to industrial employment with the minimum need for additional on-the-job
training.
4.12      Instructional television (ITV), already operating on a small
scale, should play a much greater role in the Government's endeavors to
upgrade the education of the population and, in particular, to improve
skills in specific occupations for various branches of the economy. ITV
could do this in a manner which can be easily adapted to changing labor
market needs. However, present staff lack the necessary experience to
develop an expansion program which would serve these purposes. The proposed
project therefore contains technical assistance to work out a development
program and prepare a project for ITV, including aspects of network design
and program production, financing and the integration of television
instruction into school curricula.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Technical Features
5.01      The proposed project would expand and modernize vocational edu-
cation at the upper secondary and junior college levels and facilities for
the training of teachers in science, industrial arts and vocational subjects.
It would also provide expert assistance for educational planning.



- 11 -
5.02      The project consists of:
(a) the construction, furniture and equipment for,
(i) the expansion of 16 senior secondary vocational schools;
(ii) one new junior college of technology and the expansion of
another;
(iii) the expansion of the National Taiwan Normal University
Department of Industrial Education;
(iv) the re-location and expansion of the National Taiwan Normal
University College of Science; and
(b) technical assistance for project implementation, curriculum
development, educational planning and preparatory studies for
a second project.
5.03      The project would provide 18,780 additional places as follows:

Junior Colleges of Technology                    770     3,450         2,680
NTNU Department of Industrial Education          310        740          430
NTNU College of Science                        1,270     2,960         1,690
TOTAL              12,370    31,150        18,780
Vocational Industrial Schools
5.04      Of the 16 schools under this heading, eight are vocational industrial
schools in which additional places will be created. The other eight are to
be converted from vocational-agricultural schools to vocational agricultural-
industrial schools with the additional places required for industrial courses
partly obtained by a reduction of the agricultural streams.
5.05      The project would increase the capacity of all industrial streams
in the country by almost 45% from 32,000 to 46,000. The estimated annual
output after completion of the project is 10,000 graduates who, it is antici-
pated, will be easily absorbed by the labor market (para. 4.05), mostly
at the craftsman level.
Junior Colleges of Technology
5.06      Of the two junior colleges of technology in the proposed project,
one is the existing provincial junior college at Kaohsiung which requires



- 12 -
expansion; the other is a new college within Taipei City under the Municipal
Government. Total enrollment in these two colleges, which are the only public
institutions out of 14 junior colleges of technology, will increase by
almost 350% from 774 to 3450 in 1974/75, to augment the capacity in all
junior colleges of technology by 18% to 15,700. After completion of the
project in 1974 the output of technicians from the two colleges will be
1,160, raising the total number oZ graduates at this level to about 4,000
per year, which is still below the anticipated need of more than 5,000 tech-
nicians (para. 4.05).
5.07      Curricula as a whole are acceptable.  Syllabi, textbooks and
the didactic approach, however, do not conform to technician training but
are closer to an abridged engineer's course. Technical assistance is need-
ed for re-orienting the courses and the teachers.
National Taiwan Normal University 'NTNU)
5.08      The NTNU operates under the Ministry of Education.  Present en-
rollment is 5,000 full-time students and 2,300 part-time students in three
colleges (Arts, Science and Education) and three research institutes
(Annex 16).
5.09      Industrial Arts teacher's courses are offered by the Department of
Industrial Education, a section of the College of Education. Present en-
rollment is 208 students with an output of 40 graduates per year. The pro-
ject would allow an increase in enrollment to 370 students with an annual
output of about 70 graduates. This would be sufficient to meet annual
replacement needs for industrial arts teachers at junior and senior high
schools (Annex 15). However, a number of graduates enter industrial
employment since some employers prefer NTNU industrial arts graduates to
those from engineering faculties. On the other hand, engineering graduates
become teachers but they should have re-training courses in teaching which
would be included in the college program.
5.10      Courses for instructors in vocational subjects are also offered
by the Department of Industrial Education. In 1967/68 there were about
32,000 pupils attending such courses at senior secondary level, rising to
46,000 by 1974/75. Enrollment in Junior colleges of technology will also
increase during the same period, possibly by 5,000 students (of which 2,700
would be a result of the proposed project). Additional teachers required
up to 1973 are therefore estimated at 200 annually. After the new pupil
enrollment targets have been reached, replacement requirements alone will
necessitate an annual supply of about 70 teachers. The project would increase
the output from the Normal University (NTNU) of teachers for vocational
subjects from 20 to about 70 in 1974/75 by additional buildings and modern
equipment to provide an increase in enrollment from 105 to 370.
5.11      Out of the 35,000 teachers employed in secondary schools in 1968/69
less than 10,000 were graduates of the NTNU, the remainder coming from other
universities and lacking teacher training. This applies particularly to
the science teachers and, consequently, the quality of science teaching is
sub-standard whereas the country needs a science-oriented labor force for



- 13 -
its industrialization program. The re-location of the Science College on
a new and more suitable site and the provision of additional equipment will
permit needed expansion and modernization.
5.12      The College of Science has departments of biology, chemistry, math-
ematics and physics all offering B. Sc. degree courses. Present enrollment
is 1,267 students. An increase to 2,960 by 1974 is planned. In addition
to these fulltime students, about 3,000 students from other colleges of the
NTNU take part-time science courses. The annual output of the Science
College would grow from 300 to about 680 graduates after completion of the
project thus helping to meet the demand for science teachers arising from
the extension of free education from 6 to 9 years.
Technical Assistance
5.13      Vocational education is deficient in modern teaching methods and
the proper use and adequate utilization of engineering equipment, instruct-
ion aids and teaching spaces. Government assurances regarding full utiliza-
tion of physical facilities were obtained during negotiations. Curricula need
updating and rationalizing in the industrial schools. The project therefore
includes 4 1/2 man-years of technical assistance for specialists in indus-
trial education and the use of audio-visual aids, and 2 man-years of fellow-
ships. The technical assistance experts recruited under these provisions
would be attached to the project unit. The Ministry of Education does not
possess sufficient experience in project coordination and execution, tasks
which are further complicated by the compartmentalized and rigid administra-
tive structure of the Chinese educational system (para. 2.03). It is there-
fore proposed to provide the equivalent of 5 man-years of technical assistance
for education and architectural specialists to assist the project unit. In
addition, it will be essential for the Ministry of Education to establish
a planning unit (see para 2.02). There is virtually no educational planning
experience available in the country and the equivalent of 3 man-years of tech-
nical assistance is provided to help alleviate this serious bottleneck. The
need to provide fishery vocational education (para 4.07) and instructional
television (para 4.13) have been referred to above. Essential preliminary
steps to financial assistance for these two items are preparatory studies, to
be carried out by teams of 2 or 3 experts in each case who would develop pro-
posals to the appraisal stage. Financial provision for these teams has been
included in the project. In total, 15 man-years of technical assistance
and 24 man-months of fellowships are required (Annex 17).
B.   Cost of the Proj_ct
5.14      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at NT 600
million or US$15.0 million. The project cost breakdown by component items,
given in Annex 19, is summarized below:

5.16      Accommodation schedules for each school and college have been
revised to acceptable standards for the combination of courses offered.
With two exceptions, the proposed project consists of expansions of
existing institutions, and the available facilities at each of these
have been re-evaluated with allowance for planned changes and for
additions envisaged in the period before the project could be imple-
mented.
5.17      The estimated unit area costs applied to construction require-
ments are based on an examination of school building costs in Taiwan in
recent years, with adjustments for regional differences in costs. These
unit area costs, which average about US$43 per m2 for vocational schools
and junior colleges and about US$60 per m2 for the College of Science
at the National Taiwan Normal University, are reasonable for the type of
facilities required. Cost per m2 in recent Bank Group assisted school con-
struction in Thailand was $55; the expected figure in Korea will be $75.
5.18      The National Taiwan Normal University already possesses a site
for the re-location of its College of Science. The Municipal Government



- 16 -
of Taipei will provide a site for the Junior College of Technology pro-
posed for Taipei without cost to the project but the site has still to be
selected. Available land at the schools for which expansions are proposed
is sufficient. In those cases (generally in urban areas) where land is
restricted, it should be adequate for multi-storey extensions.
5.19      Reasonable cost estimates for furniture and equipment have been
established, by course for equipment and by room for furniture. It has
been assumed that some of the more sophisticated furniture items and all
equipment items would be supplied from abroad. A local currency allowance
of 4% has been included in equipment estimates to cover local transportation
and handling charges.
5.20      Only two project items, the Science College of the Normal Uni-
versity and the Taipei Municipal College of Technology, comprise entirely
new facilities. The only boarding facilities would be those proposed for
the existing Junior College. No staff housing is included in the project.
Estimated costs per student place and per boarding place, excluding pro-
fessional fees and contingencies are considered reasonable, being as follows:

5.21      The unit costs given above are not readily comparable with similar
institutions in other Bank-Group financed education projects due to dif-
ferences in levels and length of courses, teaching standards and local build-
ing costs. Given these limitations, reference might be made in respect of
the junior college cost per place given in the table to $888 per place for a
secondary technical school in Korea; and with respect of the $878 per place
for university level teacher training to $871 in Guatemala and $1374 in Trini-
dad for teacher training institutes. The unit cost of $350 per boarding
place compares with an estimated $520 per place in Malaysia.
5.22      The increase in annual recurrent costs created by the project
(approximately 15% of total recurrent education expenditure in 1975) and the
country's share of the capital costs (para. 3.13) should not prove difficult
for government financing.

C. Execution of the Project
5.23      The proposed project would be implemented in 3-1/2 years but
construction and the procurement of furniture and equipment should be
completed in 2-1/2 years (Annex 19).
Administration
5.24      A project unit within the Ministry of Education would be res-
ponsible for the financial and administrative control of the project and
its proper execution including, (a) the completion of curriculum develop-
ment and the preparation of related specifications for buildings and equip-
ment, (b) the engagement, briefing and guidance of the standard-setting
architectural consultant and of executive architects, (c) the preparation
of master lists of furniture and equipment, (d) the organization of inter-
national competitive bidding for construction and for the procurement of
furniture and equipment, and the subsequent evaluation of bids, (e) the
supervision of construction and procurement processes, (f) effective co-
ordination with other interested organizations including the Council for
International Economic Cooperation and Development (C.I.E.C.D.) the Govern-
ment's Planning Agency, the Ministry of Finance, the Provincial Department
of Education, and the Municipal Bureau of Education, and (g) liaison with
the Bank.
5.25      The Project Unit would be headed by a Project Director, who would
be assisted by a full-time executive secretary, both of whom would be
acceptable to the Bank. Because of the present lack of local persons familiar
with current educational planning developments and techniques, the unit
would be strengthened by an educational advisor and a project architect,
engaged under technical assistance, and acceptable to the Bank. Their
appointment is a condition of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. Amongst
other duties, the educational advisor would assist in coordinating the
activities of the educational specialists provided under technical assistance
(para 5.13) and advise on equipment procurement. The project architect,
with experience of contemporary developments in the field of vocational
school planning, would inter alia assist a local architectural firm to
establish space, construction and costing standards. The design of individual
project schools to these standards, the preparation of construction drawings
and documents, and the supervision of their construction would be carried
out either by the same firm and/or other suitably located and experienced
local architectural firms, acceptable to the Bank. The project unit would
also include an accountant and adequate supporting staff. With the excep-
tion of the appointment of the technical assistance experts in curriculum
development and educational planning (para. 5.13), the establishment of
the project unit is a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
Construction
5.26      Construction contracts would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding by pre-qualified contractors. Bids would be
invited in packages of a size to encourage such bidding. It is expected,



- 18 -
however, that all civil works contracts will go to local firms because
Taiwan has a highly competitive construction industry. Its capacity is suf-
ficient to absorb the construction requirements of the proposed project
whose value is unlikely to exceed US$3 million in any single year. Sites
are available for all project schools except the Taipei Junior College of
Technology, acquisition of the site for which is a condition of effective-
ness of the loan.
Procurement of Furniture and Equipment
5.27      Contracts for the supply of furniture and equipment would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Bulk purchas-
ing would be encouraged. Local furniture and equipment manufacturers who
qualify to compete for the bids would be allowed a preferential margin
equivalent to 15% of the c.i.f. landed cost of competing imports or the
existing rate of customs duty applicable, whichever is the lower. It has
been assumed that foreign suppliers would win contracts for some of the
furniture items and for all equipment items.
Maintenance
5.28      Few existing schools show a satisfactory standard of maintenance.
The financial allocation and the organization for this purpose are insuf-
ficient. The Government has given assurances that adequate provision
will be made to ensure proper maintenance of the project schools.
Disbursement
5.29      The proposed loan of US$9.0 million would cover estimated foreign
exchange costs only and would finance 60% of the total estimated project
costs. It would be disbursed to meet:
(a) 100% of the direct identifiable c.i.f. costs of imported
equipment and furniture;
(b) foreign exchange costs of technical assistance;
(c) 20% of construction costs, excluding professional fees,
and 50% of locally manufactured furniture and equipment,
which is the equivalent of the estimated foreign ex-
change component.
Savings in any category would be available for cancellation. In the event
that expenditures would exceed the present total estimated cost of US$15.0
million, such excess would be met by the Government of China.
5.30      The loan would be centrally administered by the Ministry of Edu-
cation through the Project Unit. The Ministry would enter contractual
arrangements with the other levels of government (Provincial, and Taipei
Municipality) in order to ensure the availability of local counterpart
funds for the project. These arrangements are a condition of effective-
ness for the loan.

VI.  SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) the vocational education inspectorate and the educa-
tional planning unit in the Ministry of Education
would be strengthened and improved (paras. 2.05 and
4.09);
(b) practical training would be provided for vocational
school teachers in cooperation with industry (para. 2.15);
(c) the utilization factor of physical facilities in the
project schools would be increased (para. 5.13); and
(d) a local architectural firm, acceptable to the Bank would
be retained to co-operate with the Project Architect
and under his direction establish the space, construction
and costing standards applicable to all project schools
and colleges (para. 5.25).
6.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the loan are the establishment of
the Project Unit and the appointment of its staff (para. 5.25), the acquisi-
tion of a suitable site for the Taipei Institute of Technology (para. 5.26)
and arrangements to administer centrally the project and to ensure counter-
part funds (para. 5.30).
6.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$9.0 million for a term of 25 years including a 10-year grace period.
