PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA - LONG TERM CREDIT BANK PROJECT
(LOANS 1461-KO, 1635-KO AND 1932-KO)
PREFACE
This is the third project completion report (PCR) on the Korea Long-
Term Credit Bank (formerly, the Korea Development Finance Corporation). It
covers the period 1980-84 and focuses on subprojects financed under Loans
1461-KO, 1635-KO and 1932-KO; final disbursements under these loans were made
on February 13, 1981, March 11, 1983 and July 31, 1985. This PCR was prepared
by the Bank's East Asia and Pacific Regional Office, based on an initial draft
prepared and additional information furnished by KLB.
In accordance with the revised project performarca reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments. Comments received from KLB have
been taken into account in finalizing the report and are reproduced as Attach-
ment A to the PCR.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA - LONG TERM CREDIT BANK PROJECT
(LOANS 1461-KO, 1635-KO AND 1932-KO)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        This is the third project completion report (PCR) on the Korea Long
Term Credit Bank, or KLB (formerly the Korea Development Finance Company, or
KDFC). The second PCR covered KDFC's operations through 1979, reviewing Bank
Loans 735-1O, 905-KO and 1145-KO.  While this review focusses on developments
and achievements experienced during the implementation of Bank Loans 1461-RO,
1635-KO and 1932-KO, the emphasis is on KLB's operations during the five-year
period 1980-84.
2.        The period 1980-84 was extremely difficult for the Korean economy.
Serious inflationary pressures encountered in the late seventies carried over
into 1980 and 1981. This situation was compounded by the second oil price
shock of 1979 and the subsequent world recession. Capacity utilization in the
manufacturing sector fell from 88% in 1978 to 73% in 1980. No significant
improvements were achieved in 1981 and 1982, al.hough the situation did
improve in 1983 and 1984, helped by export demand in the electronic, machinery
and transport sectors. The setbacks experienced by Korea during the late
seventies led the Government to modify its interventionist approach to
industrial development. During the period 1980-84 it initiated a policy to
decentralize decision making in the real sector, and reduced government
intervention in finance so that market prices would be able to play a greater
role in resource mobilization and allocation (paras. 2.03-2.11).
3.        The main objective of Loans 1461-KO, 1635-KO and 1932-KO was a
continuation and expansion of the foreign exchange resource transfer and
institution-building efforts addressed under the five previous Bank loans to
KDFC. In addition, Loan 1932-KO (and Loan 1933-KO to KDB) was intended to
serve as a vehicle for discussing with Government comprehensive reform of the
Korean financial sector. Under these three Bank loans, 220 subloans (totaling
$258.5 million) were financed (paras. 4.01-4.03), which generated a total
investment of almost $1.0 billion equivalent (para. 4.05) and over 12,000 new
jobs (para. 4.09). These subloans had a broad sectoral and geographical
distribution, with 85% having a maturity of more than nine years (paras. 4.04-
4.05). The financial and economic performance of both subborrowers and
subprojects utilizing Bank loan proceeds is satisfactory, although somewhat
below projections made at the time of the respective subproject approvals;
this performance, however, was more a reflection of Korea's economic environ-
ment than of deficiencies in KLB's appraisal and supervision procedures
(paras. 4.07-4.10).
4.        During implementation of Bank Loans 1461-KO, 1635-KO, 1932-KO, KDFC
was successfully transformed into a long-term credit bank under the LTCB Act
of 1979 (para. 5.01). As a long-term credit bank, KLB greatly expanded:



- vi -
lending and investment operations increased from W 66,0 billion in 1979 to
W 340.4 billion in 1984 (para. 6.01), while total assets grew from
W 209.2 billion to W 1.13 trillion over the same period (para. 6.06). With
the authority to mobilize domestic currency resources, domestic currency
lending has become an increasingly important part of KLB's total lending
program.  During the period 1980-84, it accounted for 53.6X of total term-
lending operations compared to only 51 in 1979 (para. 6.02). KLB relies
primarily on term-debentures (of one to five years maturity) for its domestic
currency resource base -- 771 as of December 31, 1984 (para. 5.13). However,
domestic currency has not been mobilized at the expense of foreign currency
mobilization efforts. KLB has achieved some success in increasing the propor-
tion of its foreign borrowings from commercial sources and in reducing its
dependence on official funds: 451 of the $655.0 million borrowed during the
period 1980-84 represented commercial borrowings. While this proportion of
commercial to official foreign resources is below appraisal expectations,
IBRD's continued participation in KLB contributes to its excellent credit
standing in the international money market (para. 5.14). Although its annual
lending and investment operations, as well as its asset base, increased
several-fold between 1979 and 1984, KLB experienced a decline in profitabi-
lity. Return on average total assets declined from 3.5% in 1980 to 0.9% in
1983 and 1984. Its return on average equity between 1980 and 1983 fell from
28.21 to 11%, improving slightly in 1984 to 11.9% (in real terms, return on
average equity improved from approximately 3.0% in 1980 to 8.0% and 7.0Z in
1983 and 1984, respectively) (paras. 6.08-6.09). A significant factor contri-
buting to the fall in profitabiLity was the declining (including negative)
spreads on loans made with debenture resources resulting from a combination of
government regulations on interest rates and competition from other financial
intermediaries (paras. 5.13 and 6.08). This situation illustrated KLB's
vulnerability to conditions beyond its control and highlighted KLB's excessive
dependence (and resulting consequences) on a single savings instrument to
cover its domestic resource requirements.
5.        Between 1967 and 1979, as described in the two previous PCRs, KDFC
achieved a commendable developmental record (para. 1.02). Since 1980, this
record has been enhanced.  KLB continues to be a significant provider of term-
financing (of both domestic and foreign currency) for private industrial deve-
lopment (para. 5.01). It maintains a strong commitment to small and medium
enterprises (paras. 5.07-5.08). In addition, KLB remains the major share-
holder in the Korea Development Leasing Corporation and the Korea Investment
and Finance Corporation, both of which provide a range of services availahle
to Korea industries (paras. 5.16-5.20). Finally, Loan 1932-KO (and Loan
1933-KO) served as the first step in an ongoing dialogue with the Korean
Government in support of its financial secto: reform which continued under
SAL I and II and the First and Second Industrial Finance Projects
(paras. 7.01-7.02).
6.        The main conclusions emerging from the Bank's experience with KLB
during the period under review are:
(i)   Overall, KLB has been and remains a well-organized, well-managed
and sound financial institutions even in a period of consider-
able economic difficulty. The Bank's continued participation in



- vii -
the financing of KLB helped to promote and sustain KLB's very
good credit standing in the international capital market. On a
macro-level, KLB represen:s a well-established conduit through
which Bank resources can be productively channeled into the
Korean economy, at the same time providing the basis for an
ongoing dialogue on financial and industrial sector policy
between she Bank and the Government.
(ii)   KLB is directly and profoundly affected by changes in its
environment, over which it has little, if any, control. The
challenge facing KL8, especially since 1981, has been, and
remains, to compete in an increasingly liberalized financial
system. The conversion of KDFC in 1980 into a long-term credit
bank, strongly supported by the Bank, represented a positive
step, enabling KLB to adapt to the growing maturity of the
Korean industrial sector and to a more competitive foreign
currency relending market (which, essentially, had been KDFC's
main business activity) in the country. However, as other
financial institutions are being deregulated under the Govern-
ment's financial sector reform, further diversification of KLB's
activities may have been appropriate. KLB is currently depen-
dent on a single type of savings instrument (term debentures) to
meet its domestic resource requirements; moreover, the LTCB Act
imposes a number of restrictions on KLB's credit operations
which prevent it from diversifying and expanding services to
clients. These constraints (in particular, those limiting
working capital lending and deposit-taking activities) reduce
KLB's flexibility and competitiveness vis-a-vis other financial
institutions in a liberalized financial system. Thus, while
Government and the Bank were concentrating Lheir attention and
actions on the broader issues of financial reform, the concern
and needs of any particular financial intermediary (in this
instance, KLB) may not have been duly addressed and adequately
resolved. In future, more effort may be required to balance
sectoral and specific institutional considerations.
(iii)   At the time of appraising Loans 1461-KO, 1635-KO and 1932-KO,
emphasis was placed on the mobilization of commercial foreign
currency resources and a reduction in official foreign currency
borrowings. While progress in this direction has been achieved,
KLB fell short of the levels originally targetted. However, as
long as the earnings margins provided by loans made with offi-
cial foreign currency borrowings are higher than those permit-
ted/realized from commercial foreign currency and domestic
currency resources (which has been the case during the period
under review), there is little incentive (and a real disincen-
tive) to reduce the amount (or level) of such borrowings.11
Again, where institutional and sectoral objectives come into
conflict, Bank expectations and objectives may require
corresponding modifications and/or revisions to reflect existing
realities.
1/   KLB notes that, beginning in 1985, however, interest rates on
commercial foreign exchange resources have become verv compe-
titive with those on IBRD funds. As a result, the minimum 2>a
spread required on IBRD funds has made them uncompetitive witl
other ccmmercial resources. (Attachment A)

KOREA LONC TERM CREDIT BANK (LOANS 1461-KO, 1635-KO and 1932-KO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This project completion report (PCR) reviews Loans 1461-KO, 1635-KO
and 1932-KO (the sixth, seventh and eighth loan, respectively) made b- the
Bank to the Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC). Established in 1967
under the commercial code as a privately-owned development finance institution
to provide term-financing for private industrial development, in June 1980 it
became the Korea Long Term Credit Bank 'KLB) under the Long-Term Credit Bank
(LTCB) Act of 1979. To date, KLB has received eleven Bank loans amounting to
$667.4 million, incuding $258.5 million under these three loans. Basic data
on Loans 1461-KO, 1635-KO and 1932-KO is summarized below:
(a) Loan 1461-KO, amounting to US$70 million, was approved by the Board
on June 14, 1977, signed on June 30, 1977, and became effective on
September 15, 1977. The interest rate was 8.22 per annum and the
free limit was $2.5 million with no aggregate free limit. KDFC's
maximum contractual long-term debt to equity ratio was raised from
7:1 to 10:1. The final date for subproject submission was Decem-
ber 31, 1979. Except for one subloan, the ioan was fully committed
by that date. The loan was fully disbursed, with the final dis-
bursement made on February 13, 1981, ten months before the Closing
Date of December 31, 1981.
(b)  Loan 1635-KO, amounting to US$100 million, was approved by the Board
on December 5, 1978, signed on December 7, 1978, and became effec-
tive on February 6, 1979. The interest rate was 7.35% per annum.
The free limit was raised to US$4.0 million with no aggregate free
limit. KDFC's contractual long-term debt to equity limit was main-
tained at 10:1 as under the previous Bank Loan. The terminal date
for subproject submission was extended by six months to December 31,
1981. The loan was fully disbursed, with the final disbursement
made on March 11, 1983, almost four months before the Closing Date
of June 30, 1983.
(c)  Loan 1932-KO, amounting to US$90 million, was approved by the Board
on December 23, 1980, signed on January 14, 1981, and became effec-
tive on March 19, 1981. The interest rate was 9.25% per annum. The
free limit was again raised, to US$5.0 million with no aggregate
free limit. However, a ceiling of $10.0 million was imposed on
individual subloans. KLB's long-term debt to equity limit was
maintained at 10:1. The final date for subproject submission was
extended from June 30, 1983, to September 30, 1984. With a Closing
Date of June 30, 1985, an uncommitted and undisbursed balance of



- 2 -
$1,492,996.18 under the loan was cancelled ($1.49 million on July 1,
1985, and $2,996.18 on August 1, 1985).
1.02      Evaluation of Previous Bank Loans.  Two Project Performance Audit
Reports have been prepared by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) on previous Bank loans to KDFCt (i) No. Sec M75-683 dated September 23,
1975, covering the second Bank loan (622-KO) on the basis of a PCR dated April
24, 1975; and (ii) No. Sec M81-446 dated May 26, 1981, covering the third,
fourth and fifth Bank loans (735-KO, 905-KO and 1145-KO, respectively) on the
basis of a PCR dated August 18, 1980. The principal conclusions were that
KDFC's management and staff were competent and its standards of operations
high. Loan objectives were met successfully from the institutional and devel-
opmental points of view, while KDFC's operational and financial performance
had been more than satisfactory.
II. ENVIRONMENT
2.01      The Industrial Sector.  Three features characterize Korea's indus-
trial development since 1960: rapid growth, export orientation and successful
diversification, and debt dependence. At 15%, Korea's manufacturing sector
growth rate ranked among the highest in the world between 1960 and 1983.
Korea's dynamic growth has been led by exports, especially by manufactured
exports. In 1962, Korea's total commodity exports were US$55 million, while
in 1983 they reached US$24.4 billion with manufactured exports accounting for
over 93%. The structure of manufactured exports has changed substantially,
from one based largely on light industrial goods (e.g., textiles and wood
products) to a range of products including machinery, basic metals, and
chemical products. For example, the share of machinery in total exports
increased from 9% in 1970 to 32% in 1983 while that of wood products declined
from 11% to 0.3%.
2.02      Industrial growth and diversification have been financed largely by
debt. Korean corporations are highly leveraged. The average debt-to-equity
ratio among manufacturing enterprises is high by international standards.
Korea's external debt rose from $22 million in 1960 to over $43 billion in
1984, making it the fourth largest borrower among developing countries.
2.03      Korea's remarkable industrial development during the 19609 was asso-
ciated with a generally dirigiste approach within which the Government main-
tained comprehensive export incentives, an extensive system of guided, con-
cessional credit, and substantial investment in human and physical infrastruc-
ture. This approach was also considered appropriate for the nes;t stage of
industrial development, and beginning about 1974 the Government promoted a
shift from light and simple industries to heavy and sophisticated industries
(e.g., shipbuilding and chemicals) on the assumption that this anticipated the
country's changing competitive advantage.
2.04      The interventionist approach did not meet with as much success after
1974, due partly to its inherent weaknesses and partly to the second oil shock
in 1979 and the subsequent world recession. The economy encountered serious



infla jonary pressures in the late 1970s, which continued into 1980 and
1981._   The promotion of heavy and chemical industries contributed to an
increase in debt and excess capacity as Korea sought to maintain investment
rates in priority sectors despite sharply higher oil prices and interest
rates, and lower sales. Capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector fell
from 88% in 1978 to 73% in 1980, with no significant improvement in 1981 and
1982. Light industries had difficulty obtaining funds and their development
fell below planned targets; their products slipped in export competitive-
ness. Between mid-1979 and 1981, GNP was stagnant and real per capita income
adjusted for terms of trade declined by about 10%. 1983 and 1984 saw a return
to positive growth rates, helped by the export demand in the electronics,
machinery and transport sectors. Real GNP increased by 9.5% in 1983 and 7.6%
in 1984.
2.05      These circumstances caused the Government to begin to question the
policy of choosing sectors to develop and of promoting them through large
infusions of cheap credit. The Government recognized that the economy is too
large and complex to be efficiently guided by direct controls. Consequently,
direct intervention is being gradually reduced in favor of direction from
incentives and market signals.
2.06      This change was reflected in the Fifth Five Year Plan (1982-86) and
in agreements made with the World Bank under the structural adjustment loans
of 1981 and 1983 and the Industrial Finance Projects of 1983 and 1985.
Broadly speaking, Government is now committed to policies of industrial, trade
and financial liberalization.
2.07      The Financial Sector.  The Korean financial system has grown
rapidly. Average consolidated assets of the system increased from W 9.6 tril-
lion in 1975 to W 102.6 trillion in 1984. With this growth have come changes
in structure. Financial development during the 1970s included the rapid
growth of non-bank institutions and the emergence and spread of new types of
financial instruments.
2.08      The financial sector in Korea consists of three tiers or systems
differentiated largely by degree of government regulation: a heavily regula-
ted primary system composed of the Bank of Korea (BOK), commercial and
specialized banks that collect deposits and make loans, and development banks;
a less regulated secondary system of insurance, investment, finance and
securities companies; and an unregulated tertiary system of informal lenders
and agents known as the curb market. However, the asset structure of the
regulated financial system changed between 1975 and 1984. (Similar data are
not available for the curb market.) The secondary system has grown rapidly
and has an asset market share equal to 27% (as compared with only 10% less
than a decade ago), while the market share of the BOK has slipped from 23% to
12% and that of commercial banks from 37% to 30Z. This realignment in struc-
ture occurred because of the ability of most second tier institutions to raise
2/   Based on the GNP deflator:  1978 = 21.9%; 1979 = 21.2%; 1980 = 25.6%;
1981 = 15.9%; 1982 = 7.1%; 1983 = 2.9%; and 1984 = 4.0%.

deposits and lend at interest rates higher than those permitted banking insti-
tutions, and also because of the growing demand for financial services more
flexible than those traditionally provided by commercial banks. Recognizing
that this difference in regulatory treatment may penalize commercial banks,
Covernment has moved recently towards greater parity of treatment.
2.09      The rapid development of the Korean economy was accompanied by
highly interventionist government policies. Strict government control over
resource allocation by the financial system was a major tool in development
strategy. Controls included restrictions on the establishment of new finan-
cial institutions, Covernment ownership stakes in the banking sector and of
development banks (excluding KLB), detailed regulation of bank management and
staffing decisions, determination of interest rates, and selective credit
controls. While industrial growth was reliant on the private sector, invest-
ment priorities were determined by the Government. The Covernment committed
resources to fund priority investments, including financing on preferential
terms channelled through development banks and deposit money banks.
2.10      Subsidization of lending rates in proportion to investment priority
was widespread, created substantial price distortions and, to the extent that
some lending rates were fixed below deposit rates, eroded the profitability of
financial intermediaries. Narrow average margins between deposit and lending
rates made intermediaries dependent on subsidies channelled primarily through
the central bank. The two main programs of selective and subsidized lending
in the 1970s were the Bank of Korea's rediscount ng facility for short-term
export credit, and the National Investment Fund (11IF) for long-term equipment
financing. Interest subsidies attached to most programs not funded by the BOK
were removed with the interest rate reform of June 1982. These programs,
which were concentrated in the industrial sector, then accounted for about 20%
of total private sector domestic credit outstanding. Controls have also
covered resources mobilized independently by financial institutions, which
have been directed to specific subsectors such as small industries and
machinery manufacturing on terms and conditions specified by Government. In
aggregate, the Government controlled approximately 50% to 60% of total banking
resources.
2.11      The disadvantages of the dirigiste approach became apparent when the
economy came under stress, largely from external economic developments (paras.
2.04-2.05). In response, the approach was modified. The policy of the
Government is now to decentralize economic decision making in the real sector
and to reduce government intervention in finance so that market forces are
able to play a greater role in resource mobilization and allocation. The
Government is phasing the reform, which began in 1981, so that changes in
interest rates and policies do not have a destabilizing effect on the corpo-
rate sector, which is still heavily indebted, and on the commercial banks,



which have had low profits and 3yeak portfolio performance emanating, in part,
from past government policies.3
III. LOAN OBJECTIVES
3.01      The main objective of Loans 1461-KO and 1635-XO was a continuation
and expansion of the foreign exchange resource transfer and institution
building effort3, including enhancement of KDFC's developmental role,
addressed under previous Bank loans to KDFC. At the time Loan 1635-KO was
appraised, KDFC (in collaboration with the Bank and IFC) initiated a
re-examination of its role as a financial institution in Korea's rapidly
developing industrial economy with the view of gradually transforming KDFC
from an institution concentrating largely cn relending borrowed foreign
exchange, into a more diversified, multi-purpose financial institution capable
of (i) providing clients with a full spectrum of financial and advisory
services, (ii) promoting enterprises as well as financing them, and
(iii) acting flexibly to meet the changing requirements of the economy
(para. 5.01). The obje,ives under Loan 1932-KO, however, took on a much
broader sectoral context. In addition to assisting KDFC in the initial phase
of its conversion (June 1980) into a larger, multipurpose financial institu-
tion, the loan (along with Loan 1933-KO to the Korean Development Bank - KDB)
was intended to promote the framework for a continuing dialogue with the
Government on reforming the financial system of Korea (paras. 7.01-7.02). As
a basis for this dialogue, the Covernment agreed to conduct a series of
studies on specific financial issues. These issues related to export
financing, the future role of comnercial banks, and liberalization of the
capital market. An additional objective of Loan 1932-KO was to help reduce
the high indebtedness of Korean industries (para. 2.02): KLB was required to
make its financial assistance conditional upon adequate equity contributions
by project sponsors and to assist in strengthening the financial structure of
its borrowers - Bank funds were made available only to enterprises which had a
debt to equity ratio (including proposed subloans) not in excess of 5:1.
3.02      KLB's performance in utilizing Loans 1461-KO, 1635-KO and 1932-KO is
discussed in Chapter IV. KLB's institutional and operational development
during the peciod 1980-84 is reviewed in Chapters V and VI. Chapter VII dis-
cusses the broader sectoral developments promoted under Loan 1932-KO.
3/   Five main issues comprise the core of the Government's financial reform
program: (a) decontrol of interest rates, (b) reduction of directed
credit, (c) commercial bank liberalization and supervision, (d) control
of corporate indebtedness, and (e) equity market development. Progress

IV.  UrILIZATION OF LOANS 1461-KO, 1635-KO AND 1932-KO
Resource Transfer
4.01      Rate of Utilization.  Total funds disbursed under loans 1461-KO,
1635-KO and 1932-KO amounted to $258.5 million. Annex 2 compares actual and
estimated disbursements for the three loans. It was estimated that funds
under Loans 1461-KO and 1635-KO would be disbursed very quickly, within
twenty-seven months of loan effectiveness; actual disbursements within that
time period were 96.3% and 93.3% of loan proceeds, respectively. Both loans
were fully disbursed almost eleven and four months prior to their respective
closing dates stipulated in the Loan Agreements. Disbursements under Loan
1932-KO proceeded at a relatively slower pace, reflecting the general economic
slowdown in the early 1980a (para. 2.04). While 86% of loan proceeds were
disbursed within the three-year disbursement period (after loan effectiveness)
originally estimated for the project, $1.5 million of the loan was eventually
cancelled due to several partial subloan cancellations near the Closing Date
of June 30, 1985.
4.02      Ful Allocation.  Under the three loans, KLB financed a total of 220
subprojects W' (Annexes 3a-c), most of which were undertaken by medium and
large firms. Sixteen of these were "A" subloans (above the free limit of $2.5
million under Loan 1461-KO, $4.0 million under Loan 1635-KO and $5.0 million
under Loan 1932-KO) totaling $72.1 million, representing almost 28% of total
Bank loan proceeds - only slightly below the $84.5 million (or 32.5%)
estimated at appraisal. Individual subloan size ranged from $47069 to
$7.0 million, the average being slightly less than $1.2 million.-   In dollar
terms, the average subloan size remained rather constant under the three
loans:  $1.21 million under 1461-KO, $1.06 under 1635-KO -  and $1.30 under
1932-KO. This, however, is partially explained by the fact that other offi-
cial and commercial foreign exchange sources were being increasingly used by
KDFC/KLB in financing subprojects (para. 4.06). For example; only three of
the 58 subloans under Loan 1461-KO were supplemented with additional foreign
currency funds (of $7.5 million). Under Loan 1635-KO, this had inLreased to
14 of 94 subloans (for $32.9 million), and under 1932-KO, it was 28 of
68 subloans (for $43.3 million).
4/   Excluding five subloans which represented additional financing for the
same subproject under a previously approved subloan and one subloan which
was essentially a transfer of assets from one borrower to another, the
total number of distinct and separate subprojects was actually 214.
5/   $1.14 million, excluding the $10.0 million specifically allocated to the
Korea Development Leasing Corporation (KDLC) under Loan 1635-KO.
6/   $0.98 million, excluding the $10.0 million specifically allocated to
KDLC.



- 7 -
4.03      220 subloans (representing 214 subprojects) were disbursed to
174 enterprises under the three Bank loans: 137 enterprises had one subloan
each, 30 had two subloans each, five had three subloans each, and two enter-
prises accounted for four subloans each; average borrowings per subborrower
was $1.49 million. Excluding KDLC, the largest single borrower accounted for
$8.4 million, or 3.25% of total loan proceeds of $258.5 million. This
aggregate figure was well within the maximum subloan amount of $10.0 million
permitted under Loan 1932-K0.
Srojet  Characteristi
4.04      The characteristics of subloans financed under the three Bank loans
are sumarized in Annex 6. As described below, KLB has been successful in
maintaining sectoral and geographical diversification with respect to both its
IBRD and overall lending programs (also see para. 6.05). Sixty-seven percent
of Bank-funded subloans (by amount, in Won) represented expansion activities
compared to 76S (iluding working capital lending) for KLB's overall lending
program since 1967_ (refer Annex 19). A greater percentage of Bank loan
proceeds were comprised of subloans of W1.0 billion or more (75.4% versus
52.8%), while these subloans also had longer maturities - 84.91 (versus 33.4%)
had terms extending beyond nine years, explained by the fact that 331 of KLB's
overall lending is compared of working capital loans having maturities of one-
to-five years. Bank loans proceeds showed a somewhat broader geographical
distribution: 16% (versus 29.6x) went to the Seoul area, while 26.61 (versus
36.1%) went to the Kyunggi and Kyungsang Provinces. The manufacturing sector
accounted for 63.2% of subproject financing (versus 68.7%). Excepting
transportation services, which accounted for 19.3% of the loan (versus 11.6%)
proceeds, diversification was broad with only one other subsector (chemicals,
rubber, plastics, petroleum and coal, with 32.5%) accounting for more than 10%
of Bank loan proceeds.
4.05      Total costs of subprojects under Loans 1461-K0, 1635-!0 and 1932-K0
were W153.2 billion (approximately US$316 million %quivalent),8 W192.1
billion (approximately US$335 million equiy8lent),_ and W 236.5 billion
(approximately US$316 million equivalent),2- respectively (Annexes 4a-c).
Under all three Bank loans, actual total project costs were within 4% of esti-
mated costs at the time of appraising the respective subprojects. Of the
7/   It should be noted that 86% of KLB's total lending operations since 1968
have been undertaken during the period 1979-84.
8/   Based on an average exchange rate of W 485.0 = US$1.00 for the period
1978-79 during which 77% of all subprojects were completed.
9/    Based on an average exchange rate of W 573.6 = US$1.00 for the period
1979-80 during which 75% of all subprojects were completed.

five subprojects not yet completed as of December 31, 1984).



- 8 -
211 subprojects financed, excluding the three to KDLC, only eight experienced
cost overruns of 10 or more (ranging from 12X to 36X). Two factors contri-
bute significantly to this small variance between actuals and estimates,
(1) KLB's appraisal estimates are generally based on contracted and/or
confirmed price quotations, and (2) most subprojects were completed within
twelve months of being appraised. The fact that project details (especially
costs and implementation schedules) as given in KLB's appraisal reports
generally reflect firm and finalized arrangements also explains in large part
the timely completion of subprojects: only fifteen subprojects (or 72)
experienced delays of six months or more (ranging from 7 to 25 months). As
seen in Annex 5, changes and delays in procurement of equipment accounted for
eleven of these slippages, while construction difficulties were the cause in
three cases.
4.06      Under Loan 1461-K0, 26.82 of total subproject costs were financed
with KLB funds.  Under Loans 1635-K0 and 1932-K0, this percentage increased
considerably, to 41.22 and 47.42, respectively. The proportion of total sub-
project costs financed with IBRD loan proceeds, however, remained relatively
constant (22.22 under Loan 1461-K0, 28.32 under Loan 1635-K0 and 21.62 under
Loan 1932-K0), with commercial and other official foreign currency funds play-
ing an increasingly important role in KLB's lending program (para. 5.14).
KLB's domestic currency resources (used primarily to finance enterprises'
working capital requirements not reflected in Bank-funded proposals) accounted
for only a small part of these total subproject costs - 1.8% under Loan 1461-
KOR increasing to 3.9X under Loan 1635-K0, and then dropping slightly to 3.5X
under Loan 1932-K0.
Operational and Economic Performancell/
4.07      Operational Performance of Subborrowers.  The financial performance
of subborrowers utilizing Loans 1461-K0, 1635-K0 and 1932-K0 is presented in
Annexes 7a-c, while operational performance of the subprojects themselves is
given in Annexes 8a-c. In aggregate, under all three Bank loans, actual total
sales for subborrowers, in both the first and second year of full (subproject)
operation, exceeded estimated total sales (at the time of appraisal). Aggre-
gate actual profits, on the other hand, were (with one exception - the first
year of full operation under Loan 1932-K0) only a fraction of appraisal esti-
mates.  For Loans 1461-K0 and 1635-K0, the best profit performance was
achieved in the second year under Loan 1635-K0 with actual profits amounting
to only 23.92 cf estimates, while in the second year under Loan 1461-K0, a net
loss of W 0.2 billion was actually incurred against an estimated profit of
W 66.4 billion. However, these results appear to reflect Korea's national
economic environment during the period 1978-84 in which subprojects under the
three Bank loans were implemented. During the four-year period 1978-81,
inflation increased at an average annual rate of 21X. Under Loan 1461-K0, 772
11/  Subborrower and subproject data is monitored and compiled by KLB
(paras. 5.09-5.10). Much of the subproject data is based on information
and data provided by the subborrowers, and in most instances, actual
figures reflect "best estimates."



- 9 -
of subprojects financed were completed in 1978 and 1979, while under Loan
1635-KO, 752 were completed in 1979 and 1980. Since the time lapse between
project appraisal and the second year of full operation (an average of
approximately three-to-four years), actual sales, quoted in current prices and
reflecting inflation, are generally much higher than original estimates which
were projected on the basis of constant prices at the time of appraisal.
Profits, meanwhile, were much lower, reflecting not only lower profit margins
which can be attributed to increasing debt. financing and increasing market
(especially export) competitivenese (para. 2.04), but also the general decline
in capacity utilization experienced by borrowers during this period. The
situation improved somewhat under Loan 1932-KO: 502 of subprojects financed
were completed in 1981 and 1982, and came into operation at a time when the
inflation rate dropped considerably - 7.12 in 1982, 2.9Z in 1983 and 4.02 in
1984 - and Korea began to recover from the recession of 1980-82. In terms of
net earnings as a percentage of average net worth, almost half of the
subborrowers under the three Bank loans showed an improvement in their second
year of full (subproject) operation; however, less than 402 of the enterprises
showed returns of 102 or more, suggesting the difficulty faced by Korean
industries in mobilizing financial resources through equity infusions (other
investment opporcunities provided higher and guaranteed returns) and the
increasing dependency of Korean corporations on debt-financing in order to
expand and diversify (para. 2.02). As of December 31, 1984, none of the
subprojects financed under the three Bank loans was in arrears (Annex lOa-c),
although seven of the 220 subloans had been rescheduled and one was prepaid.
4.08      ODerational Performance of Subprojects.  Annexes 8a-c give
operational details of the subprojects financed with Bank loan proceeds.
First and second year (incremental) sales directly attributed to these subpro-
jects amounted to W 2.2 billion compared to W 2.1 billion estimated at the
time of subproject appraisal. Actual subproject sales under Loan 1461-KO
exceeded appraisal estimates by 242 (where actual capacity utilization equaled
or exceeded appraisal projections in 76% of the cases). Under Loan 1635-KO,
actual sales fell short of appraisal estimates by 102 (and actual capacity
utilization equaled or exceeded appraisal estimates in 532 of the cases).
Sales under Loan 1932-KO had mixed results: actual first year sales were 5%
below estimates (and in 58% of the cases, capacity utilization equaled or
exceeded appraisal estimates) while second year sales exceeded estimates by
10% (and capacity utilization equaled or exceeded original projections in 67%
of the cases). In terms of aggregate sales, subprojects financed under Loan
1932-KO had a much higher export orientation compared to Loans 1461-KO and
1635-K0: over 50% of total sales compared to about 20Z. In terms of the
subprojects themselves, 47% of the subprojects financed under Loans 1461-KO
and 1635-KO resulted in incremental production of which at least a portion was
exported; under Loan 1932-KO, 62% of the subprojects financed resulted in
direct export sales.

4.09      -Eonomi  Benefits.  A total of 11,531 new jobs  re created by the
207 subproject '"  financed unAer the three Bank loans a- about 10% less
than estimated at the time of subproject appraisal. The average investment
cost per job is high - ranging from approximately $106,000 under Loan 1461-KO
to $68,000 under Loan 1635-KO to $85,000 under Loan 1932-KO, reflecting the
disproportionate but nonetheless very capital intensive nature and high cost
of a few subprojects. For example, the average investment cost per job for
three subprojects under Loan 1461-KO, representing 55% of total subproject
costs, was almost $390,000. Corresponding figures for four subprojects under
Loan 1635-KO, accounting for 33% of total subproject costs, and for four
subprojects under Loan 1932-K0, accounting for 13% of total subprject costs,
were approximately $225,000 and $390,000, respectively. Despite the
relatively high overall average figures, 91 subprojects (or 44%) financed
under these three Bank loans had an average investment cost per job of less
than $25,000.
4.10      Ex-post FRRs and ERRs were calculated for a sample of ten
subprojects. With only one exception, ex-post returns were below appraisal
estimates. Ex-post FRRs ranged from 10.2% to 22.5% with a median of 13%
(compared to an ex ante range of 13% to 45%, and a median of 24%), while ex-
post ERRs were generally higher, ranging from 10.4% to 37.8%, with a median of
20% (compared to an ex ante range of 11% to 50%, and a median of 26%). Rather
than reflecting on the standard of appraisal efforts by KLB, however, the sub-
project performance mirrors, to a great degree, the effects of the second oil
shock experienced by Korea in 1979 and subsequent (and lingering) world reces-
sion (para. 2.04). Higher oil prices, resulting in higher operating costs and
narrower profit margins, compounded by increasing export competitiveness, had
a negative impact on the financial and economic viability of both ongoing and
new industrial activities undertaken in Korea during the late seventies and
early eighties.
V. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Institutional Aspects
5.01      KDFC was established in 1967 under the Korean commercial code as a
privately owned development finance institution to provide term financing
(almost exclusively foreign currency) for private industrial enterprises. It
was sponsored by the Federation of Korean Industries with the active support
of the World Bank Group as a joint venture between domestic and foreign inves-
tors, including the IFC and foreign commercial banks. However, KDFC's charter
did not provide for the mobilization of domestic currency resources (except
12/  Excluding the five subprojects under Loan 1932-KO not yet completed as of
December 31, 1984 (para. 4.02).

KDLC under Loan 1635-KO (para. 5.19).

for equity resources), a situation which KDFC management later felt seriously
affected growth prospects. In 1977, KDFC instituted an internal study of
alternative strategies aimed at better tailoring its financial services to the
requirements of the industrial sector. Demand for domestic currency financing
was expected to increase more rapidly as Korea became less dependent on
foreign savings and the domestic machinery industry developed. In addition,
the market for foreign currency lending was becoming extremely competitive
with an increasing number of foreign bank branches operating in Korea and the
more mature industrial firms increasingly able to mobilize overseas funding
directly.   The Bank and IFC assisted KDFC in this study which was finalized
in mid-1978. As a result of this study, the Government enacted the Long Term
Credit Bank (LTCB) Act of 1979, and in June 1980, KDFC became KLB - the first
(and, to date, only) institution to operate under the new law with authority
to issue long-term domestic currency debentures and to accept deposits from
its corporate borrowers. The act also permitted KLB to undertake foreign
exchange trarsactions such as opening letters of credit, and to enter the
securities business through underwriting, selling and guaranteeing invest-
ments. Over the period 1980-84, KLB achieved an impressive record of opera-
tional growth (paras. 6.01 and 6.06). Despite this growth, though, KLB is
still a relatively small institution with total assets of W1.l trillion as of
December 31, 1984, representing approximately 1% of the total assets of the
Korean financial system (compared to 0.5%, as of December 31, 1979). However,
KLB remains an important source of long-term credit for industry: as of year-
end 1983, KLB held 6.6% of equipment loans outstanding to the manufacturing
sector.
5.02      Capitalization and Ownership.  Between December 31, 1979, and
December 31, 1984, KLB's paid-in share capital increased from t: 10.0 billion
to W 50.0 billion. This W 40.0 billion increase was comprised of a 50% stock
dividend (amounting to W 5.0 billion) announced in February 1980 and an addi-
tional W 35.0 billion subscribed by existing (W 13.4 billion) and new
(W 21.6 billion) shareholders before KDFC's official conversion into a long-
term credit bank on June 2, 1980. As shown in Annex 1, there have been two
major shifts in the ownership of KLB since 1979: (1) a decrease in foreign
shareholders - from 33.3% to 19.3%; and (2) an increase in shares held by
private Korean corporations - from 18.4% to 35.1%. However, KLB has main-
tained a reasonable degree of ownership diversification: as of December 31,
198., only three entities held 5% or more of KLB's total shares: Dong Bang
Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (with 9.9%); Ssang Yong Cement Ind. Co., Ltd. (with
5%); and IFC (with 5%). KLB remains an autonomous institution, not unduly
influenced by any individual or group of shareholders.
5.03      While KLB remains committed to strengthening its capital base
through raising its paid-in share capital, declining profitability during the
period 1980-84, with KLB shares trading at below par on the stock market,
precluded the issuing of any new shares; it is highly unlikely that any
increase will be achieved in the near future (para. 6.07-6.09). KLB's present
strategy, as stated in its "Development Strategy 1985-86" and supported by the
Bank, is to build up its reserves to a level approximating paid-in capital.
As of December 31, 1984, reserves amounted to W 32.7 billion, giving a ratio
of 60:40 compared to the targeted 50:50 relationship between paid-in capital
and reserves.



- 12 -
5.04      Orsanization, Management and Staffing.  KLB's organizational struc-
ture, as shown in Chart 1, has changed little since its conversion into a
long-term credit bank in 1980. KLB is a well-managed and well-organized
institution. Compared to KDFC's pre-conversion organizational structure, KLB
basically has three new departments, i.e., International Business, Securities,
and Bank Debentures, which were added to handle the additional operational
activities provided under the LTCB Act of 1979 (para. 5.01). KLB's lending
guidelines are established in its Statement of Investment and Operational
Policies while the direction and emphasis of its operations are stated in its
Development Strategy Statement (which is reviewed and revised periodically,
the current one being for the period 1985-86). Overall policies and opera-
tional guidelines are established L, the Board of Directors, presently
comprised of twenty members (compared to thirteen prior to the conversion),
while investment decisions are delegated to an Executive Committee (comprised
of the President, Chairman of the Board, Deputy President and three Managing
Directors).
5.05      Prior to the June 1980 conversion, KLB had one branch office - in
Busan. By the end of 1984, it had opened two new (full service) branch
offices (in Central Seoul and Daegu) and four subbranches (all located in
Seoul and which essentially promote the sale of KLB debentures). In 1982, KLB
established its first overseas representative office - in Hong Kong. Since
1983, KLB has opened two business promotion centers, one at its head office
and the other in its Central City Branch Office, for the purpose of cultivat-
ing new clients as well as promoting the sale of debentures. To reinforce its
role as a development bank, KLB has established an Investment Consulting
Office for small and medium enterprises to identify potential clients and
assist them in the areas of finance and management. It has also opened a
Consulting Center for International Investment to provide consulting services
for joint ventures and technology transfers between local and foreign
companies. In 1984, KLB completed two major research projects regarding
prospects for regional economic development on Cheju Island and in the Daegu
area. These studies were used by the Government in establishing long-range
development plans for these areas.
5.06      During the period 1980-84, KLB's staff doubled:  from 163 (96 of
whom were professionals) to 343 (196 of whom were professionals), as shown in
Annex 12. The quality of KDFC's professional staff remains excellent at all
levels. To complement the high quality of its human resources, KLB has also
intensified efforts to enhance operational efficiency through computerization
of activities. In 1983 it installed a main computer system and a personal
computer system for office use. It has implemented an on-line process for
debenture sale and redemption operations, and for lending operations. Plans
are also underway to computerize KLB's entire management information system.
5.07      Promotion of Small and Medium Enterprises.  In line with government
priorities, KDFCiKLB has actively promcted small and medium enterprises



- 13 -
(SHE)41' through direct loans, and indirectly, through collaboration with some
of the Regional Commercial Banks (RCB). Between 1975 and until its June 1980
conversion, KDFC collaborated with four of Korea's ten RCBs. Under this
scheme, KDFC fiLanced the foreign currency requirements of small industrial
projects identified and appraised by the RCBs according to KDFC guidelines.
The RCBs financed domestic currency requirements and assumed project super-
vision responsibilities.  Under Loans 1461-KO and 1635-K0, it was expected
that up to $7.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively, of loan proceeds
would be utilized under the RCB scheme. However, only $5.3 million was used
to finance 22 subprojects, giving an average subloan size of $276,000,
significantly less than the $1.2 million and $1.1 million averages for all
subprojects fir.anced under Loans 1461-KO and 1635-K0, respectively
(par&. 4.02).
5.08      With the establishment of full-service branch offices in Busan
(1979) and Daegu (1982), KLB has played an even more substantial role in SME
lending. During the period 1980-84, KLB exceeded the targeted level of at
least 20% of total incremental financing to SMEs as designated in its
Development Strategies. As shown in Annex 18, financial assistance (i.e.,
loans, debentures and equity investments) to SMEs, as a percentage of total
number of approvals, increased from 33.7X in 1980 to over 502 in 1984; by
amount (in Won), SME assistance never fell below 22.6% of total approvals
(compared to 16.5% in both 1978 and 1979).
5.09      Project Appraisal and Supervision.  Until 1978, project appraisal
and supervision were carried out by separate units. Since then, these func-
tions have been combined but divided into two departments, specializing along
industry lines: Projects Department I is responsible for chemical and heavy
industry investments; Projects Department II is responsible for light indus-
try. As was noted in the Bank Staff Appraisal Reports (SAR) for Loans
1461-(0, 1635-KO and 1932-KO, the procedures and quality of KDFC's appraisal
work continue to be of a high standard. Appraisal covers management, techni-
cal, financial, marketing and economic aspects. The FRR is calculated for new
and expansion projects involving total financing in excess of US$1.0 million
equivalent, while the ERR is calculated for those having foreign exchange
financing in excess of USS1.0 million equivalent. A technical suboffice
(under Projects Department I) reviews the technical aspects of proposed pro-
jects and follows up on project implementation. Project supervision consists
primarily of monitoring disbursements, confirming project completion (includ-
ing on-site inspection) and reviewing financial reports which are periodically
14/ Until August 1983, included firms with total assets not exceeding W500
million or employing not more than 300 full-time employees, or not more
than 500 employees in the case of firms engaged in activities described
in Attachment I to Presidental Decree No. 9370 (such labor-intensive
industries as automobile parts, electronics and other machinery parts,
etc.) issued with respect to the Small and Medium Industries Promotion
Act of Korea. Under Presidential Decree No. 11220, medium is defiaed as
from 6 to 700 employees, depending upon the industry, with total .3sets
not to exceed won 4 to 6 billion, depending upon the industry.

(generally, annually audited reports/statements) provided by the subborrow-
ere. More intensive supervision, including visits to the project site, is
undertaken only when these financial reports or repayment difficulties indi-
cate problems.
5.10      KLB's appraisal and supervision procedures, as already noted in the
previous PCR, are systematic, thorough and satisfactory. It should also be
mentioned that during the period 1980-84, KLB has made much progress in compu-
terizing its appraisal and supervision records. Data such as individual
subborrower's sales trends and other operating results, for example, are
stored and analyzed through use of the computer.
5.11      Procurement and Disbursement Procedures.  KLB's procurement
procedures conform to government guidelines and Bank requirements, generally
following (a) limited competitive bidding, with at least three competitive
quotations provided by potential suppliers, or (b) the proprietary method,
where compatability with existing equipment dictates a specific supplier.
KLB's procurement procedures effectively encourage competition, and
competition among prospective suppliers is keen in the well-developed Korean
market. KLB's disbursements are authorized in acccrdance with progress in
project implementation and against proper documentation.

5.12      Since 1980, KLB has been very successful in mobilizing both foreign
and domestic currency resources, although there has been a significant change
in the composition of resources mobilized. As of December 31, 1979, KDFC had
mobilized total resources of W 295.5 billion, of which 92.1% were foreign
currency funds and only 7.9% were domestic currency resources; as of
December 31, 1984, total resources mobilized by KLB amounted to W 1,584.4 bil-
lion, of which 64.5% were foreign currency funds and 35.5% were domestic
currency resources (Annex 21).
5.13      Domestic Currency Resource Mobilization.  Prior to its conversion
into a long-term credit bank, KLB's domestic currency resource base was very
small (W 21.7 billion in 1979), comprised entirely of a government loan and
equity. Today, KLB relies primarily on the issuance of debentures (discount,
coupon and compound) for its domestic currency requirements: as of
December 31, 1984, debentures accounted for 77.4% of its domestic currency
resource base. Equity and corporate deposits accounted for an additional
14.7% and 5.2%, respectively. Total debentures issued (net proceeds) during
the period 1980-84 amounted to W 568.9 billion (Annex 13) with annual
issuances growing at average rate of 47%, vastly exceeding the W 220.0 billion
projected at the time of appraising the eighth Bank loan (Loan 1932-KO) to
KDFC. Maturities ranged from one to five years, with 61.5% being of three-
year maturity. During the third quarter of 1982, KLB had difficulty issuing
new debentures due to the relatively low yield imposed by the Government on
new issues compared to secondary market rates, and to a strong preference of
savers for hort-term instruments in anticipation of an increase in interest
rates. While the issue of variable rate debentures, introduced in late 1982,
was designed to alleviate the latter constraint, these problems highlighted



- 15 -
KLB's dependence on a single type of domestic currency savings instrument to
cover its domestic requirements.
5.14      Foreign Currency Resource Mobilization.  Until its first syndicated
commercial borrowing in 1976 with IFC's assistance, KLB was entirely dependent
on official sources, primarily IBRD and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), for
foreign currency funds. Since then, KLB has successfully mobilized
$414.8 million from commercial sources, while official borrowings amounted to
$620.0 million (Annex 14). While the percentage of KLB's foreign commercial
borrowings to total annual foreign currency borrowings has fluctuated from
year-to-year (ranging from a low of 22.2% in 1977 to 100.0% in 1980 and 1984),
the composite percentage for the eight-year period 1976-1984 is 40.1%; for the
five-year period 1980-84, this increases to 45.0%. Thus, KLB has been suc-
cessful in reducing its dependence on official foreign funds, although levels
targeted at the time of appraising Loan 1932-KO were somewhat higher -- 48%
for the period 1980-82, increasing to 66% in 1983-84. At the same time, the
Bank's continued participation in KLB has helped to promote and sustain KLB's
very good credit credit standing in the international capital market. In
addition, a maturity of twelve-to-sixteen years for IBRD (as well as ADB)
funds is substantially above the seven-to-ten years provided by foreign com-
mercial funds; KLB continues to use official borrowings to fund its longer
maturity equipment loans. Finally, to partially explain the less-than-pro-
jected reliance on foreign commercial borrowings, there is a financial incen-
tive which actually encourages KLB to increase, rather than decrease, its for-
eign official borrowings: KLB's onlending rates for foreign official borrow-
ings are fixed at 2.0% above borrowing costs, thus providing a larger earning
margin than its foreign1o qmmercial resources which are limited by law to a
maximum spread of 1.0x.
5.15      Lending Rates.  KDFC/KLB's onlending rates for proceeds under the
sixth, seventh and eighth Bank loans were as follows: for Loan 1461-KO, 2.0-
2.4% above the fixed borrowing cost of 8.2%; for Loan 1635-KO, 2.0% above the
fixed borrowing cost of 7.35%; and for Loan 1932-KO, 2.0% above the fixed
borrowing cost of 9.25%. These spreads compare to the maximum on foreign
commercial borrowings, as authorized by the Government, of 1.1%. As shown in
Annex 14, KLB's foreign commercial loans denominated in dollars were on-lent
on a floating rate basis, at LIBOR plus, and Yen-denominated loans carried a
floating rate based on the Japanese prime lending rate plus. During the
period 1979-84, as summarized in Annex 16, rates on domestic currency loans
ranged from a high of 26.8-28.5% in 1980 to a low of 14.5-15.8% in 1985; rates
on foreign currency loans ranged from a high of 9.4-20.8% in 1980 to a low of
9.1-12.6% in 1984. While the differential in nominal interest rates appears
to favor foreign currency loans, borrowers bear the exchange risk on all
foreign currency borrowings. As such, the cost of this exchange risk has been
substantial over the period 1979-84, with the Won depreciating against the US
15/ KLB notes that the less than anticipated level of commercial foreign
currency borrowings can also be attributed to the larger market demand
for official funds compared to commercial funds during the period under
review (Attachment A).

dollar at an average annual rate of 101, from W 485/$l to W 829.5/$1. KLB has
calculated the effective cost (in Won) to borrowers of funds under Loa R/ 1461-
KO and 1635-KO at 17.41 and 13.41, respectively (Annexes lla and l1b),
Although higher than nominal rates by approximately seven and four percent,
respectively, the cost of Bank funds was comparable to interest rates charged
on both comercial foreign currency resources and domestic currency resources
during the period.
KLB's Development Role
5.16      In addition to its institutional commitment as a development bank,
KLS has played a major role in the establishment of two specialized institu-
tions to increase the range of services available to Korean industries.
5.17      The Korea Investment and Finance Corporation (KIFC).  KIFC was
established in 1971. It deals in short-term credit instruments of all kinds
and issues its own short-term instruments. It also underwrites and distri-
butes corporate securities and treasury bills. KLB is the major shareholder,
holding 28.81 (or W 5.76 billion) of KIFC's shares. Between December 31,
1980, and December 31, 1984, KIFC's operations have grown steadily, with total
assets increasing from W 121.2 billion to W 375.8 billion.
5.18      Korea Development Leasing Corporation (KDLC).  KDFC/KLB promoted and
is the largest shareholder (W 1.24 billion, or 31% of total paid-in capital),
of KDLC, which was sponsored jointly with the Orient Leasing Company (OLC) of
J'apan and IFC. Established in 1975, KDLC met a growing demand by Korean
enterprises, particularly small- and medium-sized firms which could not afford
outright purchases of equipment. KDLC engages in directly financed leasing,
the guarantee of leases, and the subleasing of industrial and business
equipment, machinery and plant facilities. Special emphasis has been placed
on the development of the domestic machinery industry by expanding the leasing
of domestically-produced equipment. Under the fifth Bank loan to KDFC (Loan
1145-KO, approved July 15, 1975), $5.0 million was made available to KDLC as a
subloan.
5.19      Under the seventh Bank loan (Loan 1635-KO), KDFC was authorized to
lend another $10.0 million to KDLC. The purpose of these funds were two-
fold: to assist KDLC in mobilizing foreign exchange resources and to assist
small- and medium-sized enterprises in undertaking essentially labor-intensive
subprojects. Details regarding the utilization of these funds are summarized
in Annex 9. Disbursements amounted to $9.997 million, financing 42 subproj-
ects at an average subproject cost of $240,000; however, six (or 14.31) of the
42 subprojects accounted for almost 421 of total subloan proceeds. 607 new
jobs were generated at an investment cost per job of approximately $16,400.
While 56.6% of subloan proceeds (16 subprojects) went to enterprise which were
16/ These effective interest rates represent the average annual borrowing
cost to KLB subborrowers over a period starting with the first disburse-
ment (assuming that the outstanding balance of the loans was repaid at
end-1984).



- 17 -
not classified as small or medium (i.e., employing 300 or more persons, or
having assets greater than W 500 million), there were no stipulation in the
Loan Agreement prohibiting this; all subprojects were authorized by the
Bank. Because repayments to KLB under the two KDLC subloans are on the basis
of fixed amortization schedules agreed at the time of subloan approval, KDLC
has been able to utilize payments received from lessees in excess of KDLC's
repayment obligations to KLB as a revolving fund. KDLC estimates that, to
date, funds totaling approximately $1.1 million have been effectively
"recycled" to finance an additional nine subprojects.
5.20      Since 1979, KDLC has grown substantially and has become very
successful in its own resource mobilization efforts. Between December 31,
1979, and December 31, 1984, total assets grew at an average annual rate of
almost 40Z - from W 47.7 billion to W 252.1 billion. During this period, KDLC
was one of three leasing companies and six merchant banks comprising Korea's
leasing industry, and has accounted for 28.4Z of Korea's total leasing market
(in terms of contract amount) during the period January 1, 1980 - December 31,
1983.
VI.  OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Operational Performance
6.01      Overall Operations.  KLB's projected and actual lending and invest-
ment operations for the period 1979-84 are presented in Annexes 15 and 17.
Except for 1982, at the height of the economic recession suffered by Korea
(para. 2.04), actual operational performance, in terms of annual Won appro-
vals, exceeded projections made at the time Loans 1461-KO, 1635-KO and 1932-KO
were appraised. (However, adjusting for the depreciation of the Won between
1979 and 1984, from 485 to 829.5 per US dollar, actual annual approvals
expressed in US dollars equivalent have been below Loan 1932-KO appraisal
estimates - by 30% in 1982, 17% in 1983 and 22% in 1984.) In 1979, approvals
totaled W 66.0 billion (US$136.0 million equivalent); in 1984, total approvals
amounted to W 340.4 billion (US$410.3 million equivalent). Annual approvals
(in Won) increased at an average rate of almost 39% during the period 1980-84,
with greatest growth experienced during the first two years following KDFC's
conversion into a long-term credit bank - 158Z in 1980 and 52% in 1981, clear-
ly reflecting the immediate impact of KLB's domestic resource mobilization
efforts and its ability to expand domestic currency investment activities.
Average growth for the three-year period 1982-84 registered a more moderate
9.52, although in 1982 operations suffered a severe drop (of almost 33%) from
the level achieved in 1981.
6.02      Lending.  Term loans continue to constitute the bulk of KLB's annual
lending and investment operations. As a percentage of total annual Won appro-
vals, however, they declined from 96.5% .n 1979 to 75.2% in 1984, illustrating
KLB's continuing efforts to diversify. Domestic currency loans have become an
increasingly important part of KLB's lending operations - in 1979 they repre-
sented 5% of total loan approvals; in 1984, that percentage had reached
48.6%. During the period 1980-84, domestic currency loans accounted for 53.6%
of KLB's total term-lending operations.



- 18 -
6.03      Investments.  Equity investments, on the other handt, have accounted
for e much smaller and declining proportion of total operations (from 2.32 in
1979 to less than 0.1Z in 1984), while purchases of bonds and convertible
debentures have increased steadily over the period 1980-84 (from 1.2X in 1979
to 24.91 in 1984). While equity investments were considerably below appraisal
estimates, this trend reflected the higher (and guaranteed) returns received
on loans, bonds and convertible debentures in comparison to unguaranteed and
generally lower returns offered by equity investments.
6.04      Cuarantees.  During the period 1980-84 there was a considerable
expansion of KLB's guarantee operations. Term-guarantees outstanding (payment
guarantees) increased from W 0.2 billion as of December 31, 1979, to
W 19.0 billion as of December 31, 1984, most of which were in domestic
currency - 92.6X of those outstanding as of December 31, 1984. During this
period, total contingent liabilities outstanding (including lines of credit
issued and outstanding) increased almost four-fold, from W 16.0 billion to
W 58.0 billion.
6.05      Loan Characteristics.  A detailed summary of the characteristics of
term loans approved by KLB are provided in Annex 19. While there have been
significant changes in the composition of KLB's term-lending operations since
1980 in terms of currency, purpose, maturity, and geographical distribution,
sectoral distribution and loan size have remained relatively stable. Manufac-
turing continued to account for the largest share of loans - 69.51 (by
approval amount, in Won) during the period 1980-84, slightly above the 65.1Z
for the period 1968-79. Diversification has also been maintained, with any
one subsector rarely accounting for more than 201 of annual loan approvals.
The most notable changes in sectoral distribution over the five year period
compared to the previous twelve years were: (a) the share of food and
beverage lending more than doubled - from 4.3X to 10.5%; (b) the share of
marine transportation dropped from 15.1% to 10.8X; and (c) the share of
fishing dropped from 4.81 to 2.41. KLB's clientele remain concentrated in the
medium to large industries: 53.61 of all financing approved during 1980-84
consisted of loans of W 1.0 billion or more, with average loan size being
W 1.58 billion (compared to corresponding figures for 1968-79 of 49.7% and
W 1.02 billion). Average loan size for the 2,226 loans approved during 1980-
84 was W 474 million compared to an average loan size of W 397 million for the
624 loans approved 1968-79. The maturity structure of KLB loans has
shortened, reflecting the growing importance of debentures in KLB's resource
mobilization efforts against which domestic currency loans are matched and
which have much shorter maturities than foreign currency resources: 56.81 of
all funds approved since 1980 had maturities of 1 to 5 years, compared to 8.11
for the period 1968-79. Foreign currency loans, however, continued to have
much longer maturities: since 1980, 57.41 of these loans had maturities of
nine years or more (compared to 63.71 for the period 1968-79). Before 1980,
981 of KDFC's term-lending was for capital investment - 70% for expansion and
rehabilitation projects with another 28.11 for new projects; only 2.01 was for
working capital requirements. Since 1980, there has been a significant change
in the nature of activities funded by KLB, with 41% of funds approved going
for working capital, and only 40X and 19X for expansion/rehabilitation and new
projects, respectively. This large increase in working capital financing
reflects, in large part, the tight liquidity situation and the corporate



- 19 -
sector's efforts to utilize existing production capacity idied by the
recession. (84.6% of total convertible bond and debenture purchases approved
during this period were also for working capital requirements - Annex 20.)
During the period 1980-84 there has been an increasing concentration of KLB
lending in the Seoul area: 32.6% of total loan approvals compared to 16.5%
for the period 1968-79. 18.8% of all lending went to Kyunggi-do Province,
with another 9.3% going to Kyungsangbuk-do Province (compared to 18.3% and
10.9Z, respectively, during 1968-79). Lending for deep-sea fishing and marine
transportation (not classified by region), as a percentage of total approvals,
declined significantly during the same period: 13.2% compared to 21.1% during
1968-79.
Financial Performance
6.06      Financial Position.  KLB's projected and actual balance sheets for
the period 1979-84 are presented in Annex 22. As a long-term credit bank, KLB
achieved significant growth in total assets of 40% per annum for the five-year
period 1980-84, slightly exceeding the 35Z growth projected at the time Loan
1932-KO was appraised. Total assets as of December 31, 1984, stood at W 1.13
trillion (US$1.4 billion equivalent), compared to W 209.2 bilLion (US$431 mil-
lion equivalent) as of December 31, 1979. Since 1980, KLB's domestic resource
mobilization efforts have significantly changed the composition of its princi-
pal assets (par IO6.02) and liabilities (paras. 5.12-5.14). Its domestic cur-
rency portfolio- _ /increased from W 15.2 billion (7.3% of total assets) as of
December 31, 1979, to W 428.3 billion (38.0% of total assets) as of
December 31, 1984. Foreign currency borrowings, 99.0% of KLB's long-term lia-
bilities in 1979, declined to 53.7% as of December 31, 1984. Bank funds as a
proportion of total foreign currency debt continues to decrease, reflecting
the satisfactory progress being made by KLB in diversifying its foreign cur-
rency resources (para. 5.14): from 59.6% in 1979 to 38.7% in 1984.
6.07      KLB's net worth stood at W 82.7 billion (US$99.7 million equivalent)
as of December 31, 1984, a four-fold increase over the end-1979 level. While
paid-in capital was increased by W 40.0 billion in 1980 (comprised of a 50%
stock dividend of W 5.0 billion and W 35.0 billion raised from existing and
new shareholders), from W 10.0 billion to W 50.0 billion, KLB's original
expectations to increase its paid-in capital by W 15.0 billion in 1983 did not
materialize. This was due primarily to a depressed stock market and the
decline in KLB's profitability starting in 1980 in the wake of successive
lending reductions (para. 6.08). It was further constrained by Government
stock market regulations that until recently have limited new issues by per-
mitting flotation only at par value. However, KLB has been successful in
increasing its reserves and retained earnings from 28.7% of paid-in capital as
of December 31, 1980, to 65.4% as of December 31, 1984. At the same time, KLB
has also declared (and paid) annual dividends, ranging from 20% of par value
in 1980 to 16.5% in 1981 to 8% in 1982 and 1983, to 10% in 1984. KLB has
remained within the long-term debt to equity ratio of 10:1 covenanted under
Loan 1932 (and increased to 12:1 under Loan 2309-KO which was approved on
17/ Term-loans, debentures purchased and equity investments.



- 20 -
June 8, 1983), and has experienced no difficulty in servicing its debt obliga-
tions (Annex 24).
6.08      Profitability.  KLB's projected and actual income statements for the
period 1979-84 are presented in Annex 23. Except for 1980 and 1981, net
income (in absolute Won terms, as a percentage of average total assets and as
a percentage of average net worth) has been below appraisal estimates. After
a severe decline in effective interest spreads from 3.3% in 1980 to 0.27% in
1982, KLB showed improvement in 1983 and 1984 with spreads improving to 0.64%
and 1.06%, respectively. The decline was largely attributable to KLB's loans
made with debenture resources, resulting in negative spreads: while lending
rates on these loans fell by 10.2 percentage points (from 34.0% to 23.9%)
between June 1980 and June 1982, the weignted average cost of its debentures
declined by only 6.3 percentage points (from 30.5% to 24.3%). At year-end
1982, three- and five-year debentures issued by KLB in 1980 were outstanding
at a cost of 27% to 30%, while new debentures were being issued at a cost of
11.98% to 14.62%. In the meantime, KLB's lending rate had been lowered, not
only for new loans but also for existing balances outstanding. (This reduc-
tion in lending rates on existing balanace outstanding was required to
maintain KLB's competitiveness (in order to avoid its loans being refinanced
with less costly resources from other lenders) following the Government's
decision in June 1982 to reduce interest rate ceilings.) As a consequence,
KLB's weighted average effective spread on loans funded with debentures
declined from 3.52% in June 1980 to 2.08% in June 1981 to -0.37% in June
1982. As the earlier and more expensive debenture issues were redeemed and
interest rates stabilized, the weighted average effectivL spread on loans
funded with debentures improved from 0.17% in June 1983 to 1.03% in December
1984.
6.09      The recent improvement in interest spreads on debenture-funded
loans, along with KLB's successful efforts in controlling administrative and
general expenses (in botht Won terms and as a percentage of average total
assets, approximately 30% below Loan 1932-KO appraisal estimates for 1983 and
1984), have had a positive impact on KLB's financial performance: 1984 net
earnings of W 9.5 billion reversed a two-year decline in absolute Won income,
while 1984's return on average equity of 11.9% reversed a four-year decline
(from 28.2% in 1980 to 11.0% in 1983). In real terms, however, adjusting for
inflation, return on average equity improved, from approximately 3.0X in 1980
to 8.0% and 7.0% in 1983 and 1984, respectively.
6.10      Portfolio Quality.  The quality of KLB's loan portfolio remains
excellent as indicated by its collection performance (Annex 25) and arrears
position (Annex 26). Annual collection of amounts due never fell below 98%
during the period 1980-84, reflecting KLB's sound project selection and super-
vision processes as well as the high level of discipline exercised by Korean
borrowers. As of December 31, 1984, KLB's loan portfolio consisted of 2,049
loans totalling W 903.0 billion: 45 loans, or 2.2% of the total, were in
arrears. Total arrears of principal and interest amounted to W 4.0 billion,
or 0.4% of the outstanding portfolio. Provisions for possible losses of
W 10.1 billion, equal to 1.1% of the outstanding portfolio, are considered
adequate.



- 21 -
6.11      Audit.  KLB's accounts for 1980-84 have been audited by the Samil
Accounting Corporation, which is associated with Coopers and Lybrand
(International). The accounts have always been certified without qualifica-
tion and the reports have met the Bank's requirements. Since 1983, audit
reports have contained an explicit confirmation by the auditors that
provisions for losses were adequate.
VII. SECTORAL DEVELOPMENTS
7.01      The primary objectives of Bank Loans 1461-KO and 1635-KO (as well as
the five previous loans) to KDFC were (a) transfer of foreign exchange to
strengthen industrial investment; (b) improvement in the institutional effici-
ency of financial intermediaries; and (c) support of the industrial investment
priorities of the Government viz. export promotion, regional development,
employment generation and skill development. Loan 1932-KO, however, took on
additional scope. Along with Loan 1933-KO to KDB (which was appraised at the
same time), the Bank's lending operations to these two institutions were used
as a vehicle for consultation with the Korean Government on general1&nancial
sector issues. The inefficiencies identified in the Bank's review -' of the
industrial and financial sectors transcended individual financial institu-
tions. While DFC lending had been effI icient and had helped reach lending
objectives, the changed circumstances facing the economy and the expanding
demands placed on financial intermediaries suggested that the Bank's involve-
ment in financial issues needed to be broadened from the narrow project focus
of the past. It was felt that Bank lending for industry should be tailored to
accommodate these broader sectoral objectives and be more responsive to the
needs of a rapidly maturing industrial sector which operates in an increas-
ingly competitive international environment. While the format of industrial
lending would retain the DFC lending approach, these operations would be used
as a springboard for reaching other important objectives beyond resource
transfer and institution-building. Simultaneously replenishing the long-term
foreign exchange resources of KDB and KDFC, the Bank invited the Government to
negotiate both loans at the same time as a vehicle for discussing further the
financial sector policy recommendations. A common understanding was reached
at negotiations regarding Korea's strategy for improving efficiency in the
financial sector. As a first step, a package of specific policy measures and
supplementary studies to be implemented by the Government and KDB over an
appropriate time frame was agreed upon, which provided a linkage between
financial sector issues and the proposed KDB and KDFC operations. The pro-
posed projects supported the first stage of a comprehensive reform of the
financial sector. At negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
on a "Statement of Korea's Financial Sector Policy Improvements" expressing
the broad objectives of the financial sector reform and outlining a number of
policy measures to be implemented in an agreed time frame.
18/ "Current Developments and Policy Issues," dated May 20, 1980.



- 22 -
7.02      A detailed study of the National Investment Fund (NIF) was completed
and submitted to the Bank in December 1981. Other studies to be undertaken
included (a) export financing, (b) autonomy and future role of Korea's comer-
cial banks, and (c) a long-term plan for the liberalization of capital mar-
kets. In lieu of formal studies on these topics, the Bank later agreed to a
Government proposal that the MOF supply information on specific Bank concerns
(in the form of a questionnaire) regarding these subjects. This substitute
document "Questionnaire and Answers on Financial Sector Reforms" was presented
to the Bank in February 1982. This document, as well as the NIF Study, served
as the basis of financial sector reform dicussions between the Bank and the
Government which followed. Loans 1932-KO and 1933-KO were the beginning of
the Bank's ongoing dialogue with the Covernment on financial sector issues and
its commitment to liberalizing the financial system, and served as a prelude
to Structural Adjustments Loans I (approved on December 17, 1981) and II
(approved on November 8, 1983) and to the First and Second Industrial Finance
Loans (approved on June 9, 1983, and June 6, 1985, respectively).
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      During the implementation of Loans 1461-KO and 1932-KO, KDFC was
-UCC--fUi1y.  rssformed *n  a lnn&-term creditt bank under the LT'S Act of
1979. With its authority to mobilize domestic currency funds, KLB expanded
rapidly: total assets increased fivefold during the period 1980-84; annual
lending operations increased by 5.5 times. However, the implementation of
three Bank loans also occurred during a period of considerable difficulty for
the Korean eonomy. Serious inflationary pressures in the late 70s were
compounded by the second oil price shock of 1979 and the subsequent world
recession. The industrial sector experienced a large drop in capacity
utilization, higher oil prices and interest rates, and lower sales. A major
result of the'je developments was the Government's decision to modify its
highly (and previously successful) interventionist approach to industrial
growth and diversification. Government reforms to decentralize economic
decision making in the real sector and to reduce government intervention in
finance, so that market forces would be able to play a greater role in
resource mobilization and allocation, began in 1981 and continue to this day.
8.02      The effect of these national economic and financial sector develop-
ments have had a mixed impact on KLB's financial and operational performance
during the period in which Loans 1461-KO, 1635-KO and 1932-KO were implemen-
ted. Environmental conditions beyond KLB's control also affected the perfor-
mance of a large number of its borrowers who, in turn, showed only marginal
financial and economic benefits resulting from the subprojects financed under
the three Bank loans. Thus, considering the environment in which KLB operated
during this period, KLB's overall profitability performance was commendable
given the constraints under which a very capable management and competent
staff worked.
8.03      Three lessons emerge from KDFC/KLB's experience under Loans 1461-KO,
1635-KO and 1932-KO:



- 23 -
(i)   Overall, KLB has been and remains a well-organized, well-managed
and sound financial institutions even in a period of consider-
able economic difficulty. The Bank's continued participation in
the financing of KLB holped to promote and sustain KLB's very
good credit standing in the international capital market. On a
macro-level, KLB represents a well-established conduit through
which Bank resources can be productively channeled into the
Korear economy, at the same time providing the basis for an
ongoing dialogue on financial and industrial sector policy
between the Bank *nd the Government.
(ii)   KLB is directly and profoundly affected by changes in its
environment, over which it has little, if any, control. The
challenge facing KLB, especially since 1981, has been, and
remins, to compete in an increasingly liberalized financial
system. The conversion of KDFC in 1980 into a long-term credit
bank, strongly supported by the Bank, represented a positive
step, enabling KLB to adapt to the growing maturity of the
Korean industrial sector and to a more competitive foreign
currency relending market (which, essentially, had been KDFC's
main business activity) in the country. However, as other
financial institutions are being deregulated under the Govern-
ment's financial sector reform, further diversification of KLB's
activities may have been appropriate. KLB is currently depen-
dent on a single type of savings instrument (term debentures) to
meet its domestic resource requirements; moreover, the LTCB Act
imposes a number of restrictions on KLB's credit operations
which prevent it from diversifying and expanding services to
clients. These constraints (in particular, those limiting
working capital lending and deposit-taking activities) reduce
KLB's flexibility and competitiveness vis-a-vis other financial
institutions in a liberalized financial system. Thus, while
Government and the Bank were concentrating their attention and
actions on the broader issues of financial reform, the concern
and needs of any particular financial intermediary (in this
instance, KLB) may not have been duly addressed and adequately
resolved. In future, more effort may be required to balance
sectoral and specific institutional considerations.
(iii)   At the time of appraising Loans 1461-KO, 1635-KO and 1932-KO,
emphasis was placed on the mobilization of commercial foreign
currency resources and a reduction in official foreign currency
borrowings. While progress in this direction has been achieved,
KLB fell short of the levels originally targetted. However, as
long as the earnings margins provided by loans made with offi-
cial foreign currecny borrowings are higher than those permit-
ted/realized from commercial foreign currency and domestic
currency resources (which has been the case during the period
under review), there is little incentive (and a real disincen-
tive) to reduce the amount (or level) of such borrowings. 19/
Again, where institutional and sectoral objectives come into
conflict, Bank expectations and objectives may require corre-
sponding modifications and/or revisions to reflect existing
realities.
19/   KLB notes that, beginning in 1985, however, interest rates on
comercial foreign exchange resourc-s have become very compe-
titive with those on IBRD funds. As a result, the minimum 2%
spread required on IBRD funds has made them uncompetitive with
other commercial resources. (Attachment A)
