REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
ECONOMIC RECOVERY CREDIT (ERC)
Credit and Program Summary
Borrower:          Republic of Senegal
Amounts:           IDA Credit: SDR 18.2 million (US$25 million equivalent)
Terrns:            IDA Credit: Standard with 40-year maturity
Program
Description:       The African member countries of the Franc Zone decided to devalue their currency,
the CFA franc, effective January 12, 1994. By shoring up support for the measures
taken in the aftermath of the devaluation, the proposed operation is a crucial
element in helping to deepen the adjustment program that the Senegalese
Government has been pursuing since August 1993. The previous internal
adjustment programs of the 1980s were supported by four Structural Adjustment
Credits (SAL I-IV) as well as by the IMF Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF). The proposed credit would support the post-devaluation reform program
as outlined in the Government's Statement of Economic and Social Policies (Annex
IV), and, more particularly, the measures aiming at minimizing the negative social
impact of the devaluation in the short term. The Government's program has also
obtained the support of an IMF Stand-by arrangement.
The Senegalese Government has already taken a series of key macroeconomic and
structural measures to regain and consolidate competitiveness. The ERC is
desinged to support the implementation of these measures in 1994. The main
measures are: (i) devaluation of the CFA Franc from 50 CFAF to 100 CFAF/1
IT; (ii) increase in key producer prices (groundnuts, cotton); (iii) a substantial
program of social measures to attenuate the effects of the devaluation on the
vulnerable groups; (iv) prudent demand management policies to reduce absorption
by the public sector and limit wage increases; (v) reduction and simplification of
tariffs and domestic taxation; and (vi) protection of social sector expenditures.
Estimated
Disbursements:     Due to the urgent nature of the operation, the entire US$25 million would be
disbursed in a single tranche shortly after effectiveness.
There is no separate staff appraisal report.



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED ECONOMIC RECOVERY CREDIT
TO SENEGAL
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a
proposed Economic Recovery Credit to Senegal for the equivalent of SDR 18.2 million
(US$25 million equivalent) in support of a recovery operation designed to provide the
financial and teclnical support needed as a follow-up to the parity change of the CFA
franc. The Credit would be at .he standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years.
2.    A 12-month stand-by arrangement with the IMF, to be replaced by a three-year
arrangement under the enlarged enhanced structural adjustment facility, for the equivalent
of US$63.3 million will be considered by the IMF Board on March 2, 1994. A Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) is under preparation and will be presented to the Board with
the next adjustment operation. The last CAS was discussed at the Board on May 1, 1992.
The Sixth Policy Framework Paper (PFP) is expected to be ready at the beginning of
FY95.
PART I. THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRAM
A.   Recent Economic Developments
3.    Since the early 1980s, adjustment in Senegal has been supported by various World
Bank structural and sectoral loans, IMF stand-by, SAF, and ESAF arrangements, and by
other multilateral and bilateral creditors. Despite temporary setbacks and delays in the
implementation of some measures, the structural reforms undertaken have contributed to
reducing financial imbalances and ensuring progress toward liberalization of the economy.
However, as the lack of competitiveness of the economy became more acute and the terms
of trade deteriorated, the reform process suffered major setbacks, in particular with
respect to trade liberalization. As a result, the Senegalese economy is still facing
substantial financial and structural difficulties. Over the period 1986-92, real GDP growth
has remained low (3.1% p.a.) barely above the population growth rate (about 3.0% p.a.).
4.    In 1992 and 1993, the fiscal and balance of payments position deteriorated and
substantial domestic and external payments arrears accumulated. The stock of debt
increased considerably, and the net foreign assets position remained strongly negative.
The economy experienced a serious contraction in key sectors, notably fishing,
phosphates, groundnuts, and food processing. To halt this deterioration, the authorities
adopted several measures in August 1993 based on an internal adjustment strategy,
including a cut in public sector wages and an increase in both import duties and in the
plice of petroleum products. Although these measures contributed to reduce the
imbalances (the budget deficit, on a commitment basis and excluding grants, was
contained at 3.8% of GDP in 1993 and the current account deficit, excluding official



- 2 -
transfers, amounted to 9.7% of GDP), they could not restore the competitiveness of the
economy and growth prospects remained extremely poor.
5.    The economic conditions in the rest of the CFA zone were as difficult as those of
Senegal. Adverse external shocks affected all countries. The strengthening of the French
franc against the zone's trading partners and competitors made it increasingly difficult to
restore competitiveness by a deflationary policy alone. Investment and exports declined
precipitously; the distribution of income worsened as the burden of adjustment fell on rural
populations, often among the poorest Senegalese; macroeconomic balances deteriorated;
the financial sector was severely hit: capital flight, arrears to the public sector, weak
portfolio of enterprises which are still surviving; and smuggling from neighboring
countries became rampant. A major policy change was therefore called for.
B.    The Decision to Change the Parity of the CFAF
6.    The Government of Senegal, after close consultation with other member countries
of the CFA zone, decided to strengthen its adjustment strategy: Effective January 12,
1994, the fixed parity of the CPA franc was changed from 50 to 100 CFAF per FF. With
the realiginment of its currency, the Government of Senegal has adopted an adjustment
program for 1994-96. During that time, the program aims to: (i) achieve a rate of real
GDP growth of at least 5.5% starting in 1995; (ii) increase the investment-to-GDP ratio;
(iii) achieve primary surpluses in the Government's budget; (iv) sustain the improvement in
external competitiveness through structural and regulatory reforms and a return to a low
inflation after a transitional period; and (v) expand poverty alleviation measures and
intensify human resource development.
7.    This historic decision represented a major step to launch a broad development
agenda, aimed at accelerating growth in a region which had experienced a serious
economnic decline. The nominal devaluation of the CFA franc is part of a comprehensive
program designed to pursue and deepen poverty alleviation efforts.
8.    In a small low income country such as Senegal, export-led growth is the only
viable option for accelerated, sustained improvements in living standards and reduction in
poverty. While efficient import substitution can contribute to the growth process by
eventually leading to the creation of new export industries, it cannot be the engine of
growth. In fact, typically the rate of growth of exports sets a ceiling on the attainable rate
of GDP growth. Thus, it is expected that the parity change will contribute sig, ificantly to
the resumption of growth. In particular, a quick and strong response is expected from
fishing (aggregate sales were already higher in the first week following .le devaluation),
tourism (as foreign tour operators lowered their prices immediately), agriculture and food
processing, cement, chemnical industries, and small manufactures (e.g., clothing, shoes,
etc.).
9.    International experience suggests that devaluations in low-inflation countries can



- 3 -
effectively bring about real depreciations with only a temporary increase in the inflation
rate. The CFA zone's history of low in1'ation, which is largely due to the supra-nationality
of monetary policy -- a unique situation in the world -- ,confers an important advantage,
and the probability is high that the devaluation, backed by complementary policies, will
succeed in restoring competitiveness, while allowing the currency to resume its role as the
nominal anchor of macroeconomnic policy.
10.  In order to guarantee the success of the devaluation and to reach their
development objectives, the Government of Senegal is aware of the need to accompany
the change of parity with measures designed to: (i) pass through the benefits of the
devaluation to rural producers; (ii) reduce the absorption of the Government and limit
wage increases; (iii) address the political and social dimension and receive policy advice
and technical assistance to manage the process; and (iv) accelerate the structural reforms
necessary to support the supply response. The measures announced by the authorities in
the week following the change of parity and the reform agenda of the Government are
filly consistent with the above. Government's policies are summarized in the Statement of
Economic and Social Policies shown in Annex IV.
C.   Macroeconomic Objectives and Policies for 1994
11.   The main macroeconomic objectives for 1994 are to: achieve a real GDP growth
rate of 2.5%, increasing to 5.5% the following year; limit inflation to less than 40%, and to
8% the following year; contain the external current account deficit, excluding official
transfers, to 11% of GDP, reducing it to 8.5% the following year.
12.   Public finances. Strengthening the budgetary position through lasting measures is
one of the key components of the adjustment strategy adopted by Senegal. The deficit on
the Government's financial position, on a commitment basis and excluding grants, is
limited to CFAF 84.7 billion (3.6% of GDP) to be reduced to 2..1% of GDP the following
year. External payment arrears, estimated at CFAF 174.2 billion under the new parity,
will be eliminated by the end of 1994. Verified outstanding payment arrears, which at
end-December 1993 amounted to CFAF 45 billion, will be reduced by at least 32 billion by
end-1994 and should be totally eliminated the following year.
13.   Wage Policies. The wage bill will be limited to CFAF 149 billion in 1994. To
achieve this objective, the number of civil servants will be kept at its end-1993 level of
67,100 with no new recruitment on a net basis. Salaries have been raised to their August
1993 level and will be raised by a maximum of 10% after March 31, 1994. Salary arrears
will be identified and a timetable will be established for settlement. However, the cost of
doing so will be contained in the above-mentioned overall ceiling on the wage bill. Export
subsidies will be eliminated.
14.   Taxation. The realignment of the CFA franc is expected to give added impetus to
structural reforms the Government had been implementing in the past. With regard to



- 4 -
trade reform, the Government immediately adjusted tariffs and other taxes. The maximum
tariff rate has been reduced to 45% and the minimum rate set at 10%, in addition to a
stamp duty of 5%. All exemptions have been abolished with the exception of those related
to projects and diplomatic privileges. All restrictions on imports of certain goods will be
lifted during 1994 and replaced by a temporary import surcharge of 20%. This surcharge
will also apply to luxury items. As for the value-added tax (VAT), the existing five rates
(0, 7, 15, 20, and 30%) for non-petroleum products have been replaced by a system
comprising three rates (0, 10, and 20%); the list of exonerated goods will be kept to a
limited number of products (including basic goods and pharmaceutical products); and the
VAT tax base was enlarged to include the transportation of certain commodities (rice,
petroleum products, and cement). For petroleum products, the custom duty rates (0, 25,
ard 45%) have been replaced by two rates (25 and 35%), while the VAT rates (0, 7, 20,
and 34%) have been replaced by a single rate of 20%.
15.   Price policies. The Government will continue its price liberalization efforts and
will not introduce new price controls.
(a) Ir the agricultural sector, producer prices were increased immediately:
43% for groundnuts and 30% for cotton.
(b) The pi ces for petroleum products were modified so as to reflect
international prices under the new exchange rate. The aforementioned reduction in taxes
and the decrease of the stabilization levy allowed price increases to be limited to 20-30%,
thereby containing inflation and helping competitiveness by limiting the increase in
production costs. Prices of petroleum products will be adjusted in the future in line with
the mechanism put in place in 1991 to reflect fluctuations in world prices. The prices of
water, electricity, and telecommunications were initially increased by 22-30%. As needed,
firther price revisions will be made following the completion of more detailed studies of
the cost structure of the enterprises in these sectors. Particular attention will be given to
containing increases in costs.
(c) As regards essential goods, the price of rice was raised by 33%, that of
flour 30%, that of sugar 30%, and those of vegetable oil and groundnut oil by 25%, taking
into account social and political constraints and budgetary resources.
(d) For products under the system of "homologation" (including flour,
bread, tomato paste, cement, and pharmaceutical products), prices will be adjusted in
consultation with the enterprises concerned, taking into account the parity change,
reductions in certain taxes, as well as elimination of all subsidies. Prices of all other
products will be freely determined in the market.
16.   Monetary policy. The authorities will implement a prudent credit policy,
consistent with their balance of payment objectives. Between end-December 1993 and
end-December 1994, credit to the economy will increase by 24.4% only. In view of the



- 5 -
foregoing and of the objectives of improving net foreign assets, the money supply should
rise by 34.2% in 1994. Credit and financial intermediation policies will continue to benefit
from the reform of monetary policy instruments which has been undertaken by the Central
Bank of West African States (BCEAO). In particular, beginning October 1993 the
administrative controls were replaced by indirect policy instruments, consisting of the
pursuit of a more flexible interest rate pclicy, the introduction of mandatory reserve
requirements, and the expansion of the role of the money market. Pending the
stabilization of prices after the initial increase of the inflation rate, the discount rate of the
Central Bank has been raised from 10.5 to 14.5%.
17.   To ensure the return to a high and sustainable rate of economic growth, the
program foresees an increase in the investment-to-GDP ratio from 13.6% in 1993 to
18.4% in 1996 while focusing on improving its efficiency. In consultation with IDA, the
Government will adopt by end-June 1994 a revised three-year public investment program
covering the period 1994-96. For 1994, investment spending will reach CFAF 12 billion
and the priority will be given to productive sectors, human resources, and infrastructure
investments. Efforts will be pursued to improve on the follow-up of projects at the
implementation stage. Finally, the Government will take all the necessary measures to
ensure that their counterpa.t funds commitments are met.
D.    Structural Policies
18.   The structural measures of the Government's program aim at improving the
competitiveness of the private sector and diversifying production. The liberalization of
trade and prices, as well as the improvement of the regulatory framework, are essential.
19.   In the agriculture sector, the Government intends to implement a number of
measures designed to remove price controls and other restrictions on private sector
economic activity, and to further disengage the public sector from productive and
commercial activity. As a rule, the change in relative prices imp'ied by the parity change
should facilitate the accomplishment of these objectives, since for several commodities
maintaining the existing distortions is either no longer warranted (the devaluation
produces the necessary natural protection) or prohibitively expensive in the long term. In
the groundnut sector, producer prices will now vary each year in accordance with the
prices in the world market. The Government intends to privatize SONACOS; the
privatization arrangements for this company will be finalized by end-December 1994. For
the cotton sector, the Government will implement a flexible price policy linking prices to
world market prices and intends to proceed to the restructuring of SODEFITEX. The
Government is also committed to proceed with the restructuring of the CPSP with the
objective of achieving its withdrawal from the purchase and commercialization of broken
rice. The fishing sector has benefited iinrnediately from the parity change. The
Government intends to encourage private investment, intensify marketing efforts, and
improve the management of natural resources to prevent overfishing and ensure adequate
stocks in succeeding years. Other reforms envisaged by the Government include



- 6 -
improvements in land management practice and expanding the system of rural credit,
particularly through the promotion of participatory savings and credit associations as the
main retailers of rural credit.
20.   Industrial policy will continue to be centered on the promotion of exports and the
development of small and medium-size enterprises for import substitution through
improvements in the competitlveness and productivity of the industrial sector.
Accordingly the most important measures concern regulatory reforms and the elimination
of bottlenecks throttling the supply response. With respect to the reform of the labor
market, the Government will open discussions with the concerned partners to reach a
consensus that will permit before the end of 1994 the introduction into the labor
regulations of the flexibility which is necessary to encourage production and the creation
of employment. With respect to public enterprises other than SONACOS or
SODEFITEX, the Governmeiit intends to pursue the restructuring of SENELEC
(electricity) and SONEES (water). To reach this objective, the on-going study regarding
SONEES and a financial audit of SENELEC will both be completed by June 30, 1994.
Furthermnore, the cross-debts of the public sector will continue to be settled in accordance
with the previously-established timetable. The Government intends to consolidate the
progress already accomplished under the 1989 financial sector reform by accelerating the
recovery of non-performing assets and corresponding liabilities of all liquidated banks, and
taking further steps towards the rehabilitation of the banking system, notably that of the
Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole Senegalaise (CNCAS) through its recapitalization. A
program aimed at restructuring the insurance sector will also be introduced.
21.    Since the last quarter of 1993, the Government has taken steps to relaunch the
transport and infrastructure sector which had been experiencing serious difficulties due to
the inadequacy of local funds. The Governnent is committed to increasing the share of
road works carried out by private contractors from 35% to 75% by 1996. In order to do
so, it will be necessary to minimize payment delays by the administration for the works
executed. A further objective is the restructuring of SNCS (railways), PAD (port), and
AIR SENEGAL to reestablish their commercial viability and eliminate the need for
subsidies.
22.   In the education sector, primary education will continue to remain the priority.
The focus will be on expanding access to the rural areas and increasing the girls enrollment
ratio in the 20 departments where it is currently below the national average of 45%.
These goals will be reached by speeding up the program of construction of additional
classrooms. The Government will contain costs through a continued use of double-shift
and multi-grade teaching. The Government intends to implement the outcome of the
National Symposium on Higher Education which calls for the reduction in university costs
through the privatization of COUD (housing and food services) and the establishment of a
limit on the length of time students can be registered at the university.
23.   In the health sector, the Government has drawn up a medium-term plan that



- 7 -
outlines manpower planning goals including guidelines for the assignment of personnel to
health centers and health posts. In the area of fhiancing, the Government is committed to
increasing the percentage of health expenditures of the national budget to 7.5% by 1996.
Client and community contributions should constitute a growing share of financing. The
use of generic drugs should be accelerated as the result of the impact of the parity change
on the local currency cost of drugs.
24.   The Government adopted a population policy which is being financed by the Bank.
The Govermnent has decided to intensify the availability of family planning services to be
able to realize its objective of a contraceptive prevalence rate of 11% by 1996. Greater
use of public information will be required with particular linking of family planning
activities to target groups, including mother and child health and functional literacy
programs for women. In conformity with IDA policies, the Government is preparing a
National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) for CY94.
25.   Regional Integration. Together with the devaluation, a major step towards
regional economic integration was taken by the seven Heads of State of the UMOA in
Dakar with the signing of the Treaty transforming the UMOA into an economic and
monetary union (UEMOA). This improves the prospects for services and manufacturing
development in Senegal, as in the six other UEMOA countriest, by increasing the potential
for intra-regional trade in a market of nearly 60 million people and permitting economies
of scale. Moreover, the strengthening of the Union institutions and the proposed
mechanisms to ensure the convergence of fiscal policies and the harmonization of
economic and sectoral policies among the seven countries increase the likelihood for them
to maintain viable macroeconomic frameworks.
E.    Social Aspects
26.   The adjustment strategy adopted by the Government aims at increasing the
standard of living of the population and reducing poverty. The rise in producer prices of
agricultural commodities will lead to an increase in the income of the rural population. In
particular, the 43% increase in groundnut price will contribute significantly to increase
incomes of some of the poorest farmers. The general economic recovery, resulting from
the res.oration of competitiveness, is expected to create new employment opportunities
and benefit all social groups in the medium term. In the short term, however, the increase
in food prices will be visible before the supply response begins to increase incomes. To
limit the detrimental effects of the devaluation on the most vulnerable groups, the
Government has introduced accompanying measures with the objective of limiting the
price increases of certain products, improving the availability of social services in health
and education, and directly helping the most vulnerable segments of the population during
the transition period.
lBenin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger, and Togo.



-8 -
(a) Fiscal measures have been taken to limit to the maximum extent
feasible the price increases of products that mrake up a significant part of the consumption
basket of low-income households (oread, rice, vegetable oil, medicine).
(b) Budgetary appropriations for social expenditures, in particular in the
areas of prinrary education and basic health services, have been increased to take fully into
account the price increases of imports.
(c) A special program targeting the poorest social groups will be put in
place with the aid of non-governmental associations (NGOs) and certain donors.
(d) An amount of CFAF 15 billion is explicitly budgeted to cover the cost
of the social safety net measures. These include temporary subsidies for the consumer
price of rice in the amount of CFAF 8 billion; temporary subsidies in the consumer price of
wheat in the amount of CFAF 2 billion; health expenditures, including purchases of
essential drugs, of CFAF 2 billion: education expenditures to increase primary school
enrollment ratios of CFAF 2 billion; and other social outlays benefiting the most
vulnerable groups.
F.    Financing P equirements
27.   After taking into account commitments already made for project loans, the gross
external financing requirements for 1994 will amount to CFAF 297.7 billion (492.3
millions dollars). These requirements will be covered by exceptional financial assistance
from multilateral institutions and bilateral creditors, and debt relief operations. The
exceptional financing already identified for 1994 totals CFAF 139.7 billion distributed as
follows: CFAF 64 billion in loans from multilateral institutions; CFAF 13 billion in
transfers from the European Communities; CFAF 47 billion in official bilateral assistance;
and CFAF 15.7 billion in the form of debt reduction recently announced by France. The
residual gap will be covered by expected debt rescheduling. Total imports (f£o.b.) are
estimated at CFAF 619.3 billion for 1994 with a resulting trade balance deficit of CFAF
176.3 billion or 7.6% of GDP.
PART H. IDA'S STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS IN 1994
A.    Country Strategy and Priorities
28.   A full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is under preparation. The following
paragraphs outline the principles which will guide future Bank interventions and provide a
context for the present operation:
(a) Country's Potential: In the longer term, Senegal's development



- 9 -
potential will depend on three factors: (i) human resource development which is necessary
for the country to have a skilled and productive labor force; (ii) a sustained improvement
in the competitiveness of the economy through efforts to lower domestic production costs;
and (iii) an improved business environment conducive to private investment. Under these
conditions, Senegal could develop exports of light manufactures, high-valued agro-
industrial products, and services. This, in turn, would rekindle the growth needed for a
sustainable improvement in living standards.
(b) Ownership and Consensus Building, a Necessary Condition for
Success: It will be difficult for the Senegalese society to transform itself by changing the
nature of the relationship between the state and the private sector unless strong efforts are
made at strengthening the quality of our dialogue with the country at large (Government,
NGOs, trade unions, etc.). This would allow the Bank to be a facilitator of change by
acting as a catalyst promoting internal debates aimed at reaching consensus and generating
ownership of development programs.
(c) Two Sources of Growth:
(i) Supply Response from the Private Sector: In the long-term, the only sustainable
source of economic growth is through export promotion. Thus, a central focus of the
assistance program should be on the promotion of competitiveness through regulatory
reform to make the economy more responsive to opportunities and create the conditions
for rapid economic growth.
(ii) Supply Response from the Rural Sector: However, in .;.  short-term, the agriculture
sector is likely to remain the most important sector in terms of employment and it is there
that the supply response is expected at first. Thus, an essential component of our strategy
is to promote structural reforms which should lead to expanded production of traditional
export and food crops and, in the medium-term, of non-traditional and high value-added
crops.
(d) Four Necessary Actions to Sustain Success:
(i) Human Resource Development: Human resource development is the central focus of
our partnership with Senegal since the country will not be able to realize its development
potential without a skilled and productive labor force. In education, the emphasis is on
strengthening primary education, especially in rural areas, by restructuring expenditures
towards the primary level. Concerning higher education, the emphasis is on reducing
costs of student services and scholarships and using the savings to improve the quality of
education and research activities. In health, the emphasis is on strengthening primary care,
especially in rural areas, and on developing a coherent approach to the provision of low-
cost essential drugs.
(ii) Provision of Adequate Infrastructure: Regardless of structural reforms, the growth of



- 10-
exports will only be possible if the infrastructure bottlenecks are removed. Thus, crucial
Bank activities in the provision of adequate infrastructure services ai e an essential support
to the efforts which should be undertaken in the promotion of the private sector and the
agricultural sector.
(iii) Poputation Growth and the Status of Women: Faster growth will not contribute
significantly to poverty alleviation unless the Government is able to slow down rapid
population growth. Thus, a central focus of the Bank activities in Senegal will continue to
focus on population, including through improvement of the status of women. Particular
emphasis will be given to improving the quality and availability of adequate health and
family planning services and by addressing low female enrollment and literacy rates.
(iv) Dealing with the Environment: Demographic pressures will continue to have a
negative impact on the environment in the medium-term. Increased urban populations will
require better sanitation and environmental services. But even as the country becomes
more urban, agriculture will remain a key economic activity. Thus, another component of
our strategy is the improvement of the incentive structure to foster sound natural
resources management practices at both the individual and community levels.
29.   Until now, Senegal was in "core" mode since, in the absence of a depreciation of
the real exchange rate, the economic prospects were poor. As a result, Bank lending had
shifted from quick-disbursing financing to investment financing with an emphasis on
human resource development. During this transition period, the Bank continued
encouraging the dialogue with the country and promoting the role of the private sector. In
particular, the meeting of January 1992 between the Country Team and the Government
was the first opportunity to focus on long-term development issues. Since then, the
creation of an Options Group at the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Planning which
the Bank financed through the Institutional Development Fund (IDF) and the numerous
opportunities which were sought by the Country Team to promote dialogue with various
partners of the Senegalese society (NGOs, press, trade unions, etc.) have helped raise the
awareness of the need for reforms. The opportunity presented by the realignment of the
CFAF and the apparent commitment of the Government justify planning a commensurate
program of financial support for macro and sectoral adjustment operations as an important
component of our strategy for Senegal in the coming years. Nevertheless, we remain
cautious. In the past, the availability of quick-disbursing budgetary assistance also had the
undesirable effect of focusing government attention exclusively on the availability of these
funds, often to the detriment of longer-term development issues and encouraged the
addiction of the national budget to such financing. The strategy for addressing these
issues will be filly described in the upcoming Country Assistance Strategy.
B.    Follow-up Operations to the ERC in 1994
30.   The ERC represents an exceptional response to a historic decision. In particular,
its design and conditionality reflect two constraints: (i) the need to provide a timely first



- 11 -
response to the measures taken to accompany the devaluation; and (ii) the absence of any
other quick-disbursing instrument to do so. The ERC is, however, part of the response
planned by IDA to ensure the necessary conditions for a favorable supply response
following the devaluation. This response includes both quick-disbursing adjustment
operations to provide the necessary financing in support of strong reform efforts, and
investment operations aimed at employment creation. The first subsequent adjustment
operation will be a Competitiveness SECAL. This operation, which is expected to be
presented to the Board in June 1994, will aim to improve the climate for private sector
activities through improvements in the regulatory environment (in particular, greater
flexibility in the labor market), reduction in domestic costs, and improvements in the tax
system. The second adjustment operation is an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit
which is expected to be presented to the Board in late 1994. Liberalization of pricing
policy, marketing, and production, particularly in the rice subsector, will be among the
principal reforms. It is also expected that progress in implementing the Transport SECAL
will allow release of the third tranche. Finally, because Senegal continues to service IBRD
debt, Fifth Dimension resources will be allocated to Senegal.
31.  IDA also intends to accelerate the implementation of existing projects and provide
supplementary credits. A first step toward income creation is a planned supplement to
AGETIP which would effectively double the output of AGETIP over the next year with a
substantial impact on employment. The supplement would accelerate the provision of
basic urban services. The possibility of including an Emergency Social Window is under
consideration to finance sub-projects, especially in rural areas, presented by NGOs and
community organizations.
PART 1m. THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY CREDIT
A.   Financing and Management of the Program
32.   It is proposed that an Economic Recovery Credit in the equivalent of US$25
million be allocated to Senegal on IDA standard terms. The objectives of the credit are:
(i) to support the Government's reform program, outlined in the Governmlent's Statement
on Economic and Social Policies (Annex IV) dated February 23, 1994 and, more
particularly the measures aiming at minimizing the negative social impact of the
devaluation in the short-term; (ii) to provide the necessary financial assistance during the
transition period in which follow-up operations are being prepared; and (iii) to continue
the policy dialogue between the Government and IDA.
33.   Due to the urgent nature of the operation, it is proposed that the credit be
disbursed in one tranche. The Government's ability to consolidate the early gains from the
devaluation and respect its financial program requires that budgetary support be made
available rapidly. Thus, the full amount of the Economic Recovery Credit resources have
been programmed for disbursement by end-March 1994.



- 12 -
B.    Procurement and Disbursement
34.   Procurement procedures have been designed to permit rapid use of funds while
ensuring efficiency and accountability in the process. Simplified international competitive
bidding (ICB) would be required for eligible imports by public agencies and by the private
sector exceeding US$5 million. Procurement by public agencies for items costing below
the threshold will follow standard government practices found to be acceptable in the past.
Eligible imports below the threshold by private entities would be procured in accordance
with normal commercial practices, and wherever possible, quotations from eligible
suppliers from at least two countries would be sought. Single source purchasing would
be permitted for proprietary equipment or where compatibility with existing equipment
requires standardization. Contracts valued less than US$5,000 would not be eligible for
financing under this credit. Procurement documentation will be maintained for ex-post
review by the Bank. This documentation may consist of (i) a brief description of
procurement procedures; (ii) an evaluation summary giving number of bids received; (iii) a
comparative statement of prices received; (iv) dates of contract and payments; (v) a copy
of the contract; (vi) copy of invoice; and (vii) any other documentation required by
disDursements.
35.   The proceeds of the credit would be used to reimburse 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of eligible general imports. On an exceptional basis, to allow for timely
disbursements, no limitation is placed on petrol or food imports. Public and private sector
imports would be eligible, except for:
(a) Negative list;
(b) Imported Goods already financed under bilateral or multilateral credits.
36.   The Government will establish a special account at the Central Bank (BCEAO) to
facilitate disbursements. The authorized allocation on this account is CFAF 6 billion
(approximately US$10 million equivalent). This account would be replenished regularly
on the basis of fully documented reimbursement applications in excess of US$500,000 or
on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs) for expenditures below that amount.
The Borrower would indicate on the SOEs the nature and origin of the goods, as well as
the payment date, and would maintain all relevant supporting documentation (invoices,
evidence of shipment, customs declarations, evidence of payment) for review by Bank
supervision missions. Expenditures under the IDA credit would be in accordance with
normal IDA rules. The proposed date of eligilbility would be set in light of the
Government's adoption of an austerity program in August 1993. In order to permit timely
disbursements in the amount needed to keep the program on track, the total amount of the
credit would need to be eligible for use for retroactive financing. Given Senegal's
disbursement patterns, the selection of August 15, 1993 as the cut-off date for retroactive
financing would provide timely effective access to the credit proceeds. Exceptional



- 13 -
retroactive financing would thus meet an essential objective of the operation.
C.    Environmental Aspects
37.   The project would be consistent with IDA policy and would follow acceptable
IDA procedures. In conformity with IDA policies for adjustment operations, no
environmental rating has been assigned.
D.    Project Implementation
38.   The Ministry of Economy, Finance and Plan is the Government's organization
responsible for coordinating and implementing the proposed project. Bank staff will
coordinate with the IMIF to ensure adequate monitoring of key economic policies and
indicators. The Government will arrange for an audit report by an auditor acceptable to
IDA to be provided within four months after the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower.
39.   The policy measures to be taken under the proposed credit are detailed in the
Government's Statement of Economic and Social Policies (Annex IV). As conditions of
negotiations, the Government agreed to the following actions which have already been
taken:
a)       Realignment of the exchange rate, fixed at 100 CFAF for 1 FF effective
January 12, 1994;
b)       Increases in the producer prices of groundnut (43%) and cotton (30%);
C)       Allocation in the budget of CFAF 15 billion for social safety net measures,
including temporary subsidies to limit price increases of certain basic staples (rice,
wheat), purchase essential drugs, and increase social outlays particularly for the most
vulnerable groups;
d)          ncreases in other administered prices as specified in paragraph 10 of the
Government's Statement of Economic and Social Policies (see Annex IV);
e)       Increase in civil service salaries to return them to their August 1993 levels;
f)       Simplification of the tariff structure, with the maximum rate reduced to
45% and the minimum rate set at 10%, and the stamp tax fixed at 5%; abolition of all
exemptions except those related to projects and diplomatic privileges;
g)       Replacement of the system of VAT rates (0, 7, 15, 20, and 30%) for non-
petroleum products by a system comprising three rates (0, 10, and 20%); extension of
the VAT tax to include transportation of certain commodities (rice, petroleum
products, and cement); and



- 14-
h)       For petroleum products, replacement of the custom duty rates (0, 25, and
45%) by two rates of 25 and 35%, and replacement of the VAT rates (0, 7, 20, and
34%) by one rate of 20%.
E. Benefits and Risks
40.   Benefits. The proposed project would aid the Government in managing the
transition following the currency realignment, assisting it in maintaining macroeconomic
equilibria and meeting the immediate social needs of the post-adjustment period. Human
resource development efforts would be accelerated by increasing access to basic services
and by increasing opportunities for income creation in both rural and urban areas. For
Senegal, the devaluation's timing is very good for at least three reasons: (i) agricultural
commodities production decisions have not yet been made; (ii) following a period of good
rain, agricultural production is at a record high; and (iii) the conflict in Casamance (an
important region for tourism) has subsided.
41.   Risks. Short-term costs, particularly loss of employment and decrease in urban
standared of living, may put the Government in difficulty with opposition parties and
various interest groups such as students, labor unions, and civil servants. However,
important remedial measures (limiting the devaluation's passthrough to consumer prices of
essential goods and creation of a social fund) have been put in place to address these risks.
Furthermore, the devaluation, which came after a prolonged and painful recession and had
been recommended by opposition parties, has injected a sense of urgency into the debate
on economic reform and created a greater willingness to follow thorough with difficult
adjustment measures.
PART IV. RECOMMENDATION
42.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the International Development Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.

SENEGAL
GOVERNMENT'S STATEMENT OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICIES
1.    Following consultaticn with the Heads of State and of Government of the other member
countries of the CFA franc zone, the Government of Senegal has decided to embark on an overall
adjustment of its economy, reinforcing its policy of budgetary and monetary austerity through a
realignment of the CFAF exchange rate, which now stands, as of January 12, 1994, at CFAF 100
=FF 1.
2.    This decision to modify the parity of the CFA franc should make a significant contribution
toward revitalization of the economy and the alleviation of poverty. With all of the related
accompanying measures, this devaluation should make the economy more competitive and lay a
solid and sustainable foundation for growth. The Government aims to achieve an annual growth
rate of at least 51/2% and to create 20,000 new jobs a year.
3.    The success of the new adjustment program depends largely on the accompanying
measures introduced immediately following the change of parity. Over the medium term, the
Government will continue to deepen its policy of liberalization of the economy, to carry out the
necessary structural reforms to improve factor market operation, to implement public investment
programs geared to human resource development and support for the private sector, to eliminate
existing distortions in the economy, and to promote prudent and sustainable natural resource
management. The purpose of this letter is twofold: (i) to describe the accompanying measures to
be implemented by the Government in 1994, a crucial year for the success of monetary
adjustment; and (ii) to set out the broad lines of the Government's medium-term economic and
social policy. This policy provides the framework for cooperation between Senegal and the
World Bank.
1. Recent Economic Developments
4.    Since the early 1980s, Senegal has been implementing a number of economic and financial
adjustment programs supported by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other
donors. These reforms have helped reduce financial imbalances and enabled progress to be made
toward liberalization of the economy. In particular, they have led to real progress in the area of
public enterprise privatization (sale of shareholdings in 16 cases, sale of assets in 4, liquidation of
10 enterprises, privatization of the management of 4 others). The subsidization of agricultural
inputs has declined substantially. Within the framework of industrial policy, tariff reform has
made an initial contribution toward considerable liberalization of the economy. However, the
accompanying measures, representing the corollary to that reform, have not been taken, thus
placing in serious jeopardy the prospects for improving the sector's competitiveness.

5.    The World Bank's fourth structural adjustment program (SAL IV) encompassed major
reforms, particularly in the area of incentives to revitalize private investment (liberalization of the
labor market, simplification of business taxation systems), civil service reform (containment of the
wage bill, voluntary departure program) and restructuring of the parastatal sector (enterprise
rehabilitation, Government divestiture). The results of this program have been uneven. The
program of privatization and liquidation of enterprises in the parastatal sector was accelerated.
However, large-scale projects such as the privatization of SONACOS made no significant
progress. The implementation of certain structural measures was delayed, particularly the reform
of the labor code and the preparation of an action plan for the agricultural sector. Lastly, the
goals in terms of containment of the wage bill were unable to be attained because of the lack of
any accompanying measures aimed at limiting recruitment and because it became necessary to
close down the voluntary departure program for lack of financing. The structural adjustment
program was also supported by sectoral adjustment programs in the financial (banking reform)
and transport sectors. The reform of the banking sector progressed satisfactorily, but the
transport program ran into a number of difficulties in 1993 that are now in process of resolution.
The difficulties encountered in implementation of the program financed by SAL IV were largely
linked to aggravation of the crisis in the area of the public finances. The situation of the public
finances is briefly analyzed below.
6.    In 1992 the Government's financial operations experienced a deficit close to 4% of GDP,
while that same year the current account deficit reached 9.3% of GDP. The poor revenue
performance persisted during the second half of 1992, despite efforts made to improve collection.
On the expenditure side, substantial overruns occurred, particularly with respect to the wage bill,
reflecting a larger-than-anticipated wage drift, additional recruitments, and settlement of a number
of cases pending. Substantial domestic and external payment arrears were accumulated.
7.    Slippages in financial policy and in the implementation of certain structural measures in
1992 and during the first half of 1993, combined with a deterioration in the terms of trade, led to
a worsening of Senegal's financial and economic situation. The lack of competitiveness of the
economy continued to hold up the development of exports and of industry and the diversification
of production. In 1992, real GDP increased by only 1.9%, owing mainly to a drop in production
in the cereals, industrial and phosphate sectors. Exports did not increase, mainly because of the
fall in the prices and export volume of groundnut products. Moreover, although Senegal
succeeded in replacing the European market by other markets for its phosphates, export earnings
fell short of projections. In addition, fish exports continued to confront heavy foreign
competition.
8.    To arrest this downslide, the Government proceeded in late August 1993 to adopt a
package of domestic measures, including civil service pay cuts of 5% for wages of less than
CFAF 50,000 per month and 15% for the others, as well as an increase in import duties and in



Annex IV
Page 4 of 14
the prices of certain petroleum products. These measures permitted the budget deficit to be
contained at 3.8% of GDP in 1993 and the current account deficit at 9.7% of GDP. Although
these measures helped to reduce these deficits and the financing needs, they were not sufficient
to bring about an immediate return to financial viability, reestablish the competitiveness of the
economy, or ensure sustained economic growth. In view of this situation, the Government of
Senegal has decided to strengthen its adjustment strategy.
2. The Program for 1994
9.    The Government is aware of the need to accompany the change in parity of the CFA franc
by a coherent set of appropriate measures. Without these accompanying measures, the
devaluation will not have the expected results. These measures aim to ensure: (i) that the
positive effects of devaluation will not be eroded by inflationary fiscal policy; (ii) that the benefits
will be passed on, to the extent possible, to producers in the rural world, primarily to encourage
them to produce more; and (iii) that the negative impact of devaluation on the most vulnerable
groups will be minimized by the imposition of a ceiling on price increases for basic staples during
the transition period when production and distribution circuits are reorganized following the initial
shock to relative prices.
Pricing Policy
10.   To improve the resource allocation process, the Government will continue its price
liberalization efforts and will not introduce any new price controls or "homologation". For those
prices that continue to be administered (petroleum products, goods and services produced by
government monopolies -- water, electricity, telecommunications, transport -- and certain
agricultural products), the Government raised producer prices on January 18, 1994, increasing the
other administered prices on January 22, 1994.
(a)   The prices of petroleum products were revised so as to reflect current world prices
under the new exchange rate, taking account of the reduction in tax rates mentioned below
(paragraph 14) and of the decrease in the stabilization levy. These reductions made it possible to
limit sale price increases to 20-30% and thus to contain the impact of the devaluation on
production costs. The prices of petroleum products will subsequently need to be adjusted in line
with the mechanism already put in place to reflect fluctuations in world prices and protect tax
receipts.
(b)   The prices of water, electricity and telecommunications were initially increased by
22-30% to reflect rising costs. As needed, any further price adjustments will be made during the
second half of 1994, following the completion of more detailed studies of the structure of the
enterprises concerned. Particular efforts will be made to contain those costs and thus keep price
increases to a minimum.



Annex IV
Page 5 of 14
(c)   In the agriculture sector, producer prices were increased by 43% for groundnuts
and 30% for cotton. With respect to essential goods, the sugar price was initially raised by 30%,
that of flour by 30%, that of rice by 33%, and those of vegetable oil and groundnut oil by 23-
24%, taking account of social constraints and budgetary spreads. Should the export prices of
groundnut products and cotton, two of the country'n principal export lines, be lower than the
projected level at the time of the producer price increase, the fiscal impact would be offset by
additional revenue-generating or expenditure-reducing measures.
(d)   For products under the system of "homologation" (including flour, bread, tomato
paste, cement and pharmaceutical products), prices will be adjusted in consultation with the
enterprises concerned, taking account of the change in parity, reductions in import taxes and, if
appropriate, the elimination of subsidies. The prices of all other products will be freely
determined in the market.
Accompanying Social Measures
11.   In the short run, the change of parity will of necessity have negative effects on certain
segments of the population. To minimize that impact and to protect the most underprivileged
groups, the Government has introduced accompanying measures designed to minimize increases
in the prices of certain food staples, to improve the availability of social services in the areas of
health and education, and to provide direct assistance to certain particularly vulnerable groups
by facilitating the establishment of family- or community-oriented projects giving them access to
a permanent source of income.
(a)   Fiscal measures in particular have been introduced to minimize price increases for
sensitive products that make up a large part of the household consumption basket (bread, rice,
sugar, edible oils, kerosene, medicines and basic health care).
(b)   A special targeted program will be implemented, supported by the NGOs and
certain donors, to come to the aid of the poorest groups. In particular, a stock of medicines will
be built up to ensure their wider availability.
(c)   Budgetary appropriations for social expenditures, in particular as regards
education and basic health services, have been increased to fully reflect the higher cost of imports.
(d)   Henceforth, AGETIP will also target rural areas, and a one-stop window may be
opened. This will enable the NGOs and community associations to be associated with projects
financed within the framework of aid to the most disadvantaged population groups.
12.   More specifically, the sum of CFAF 15 billion has been included in the 1994 financial



Annex IV
Page 6 of 14
programming for a social safety net. Key components of this safety net are temporary consumer
price subsidies for rice (CFAF 8 billion), wheat (CFAF 2 billion), health expenditures, (CFAF 2
billion), education expenditures aimed at increasing primary school enrollments (CFAF 2 billion),
and financing for the other targeted actions.
Public Finances
13.   The Government has enacted specific measures to ensure that the overall deficit on its
financial operations, on a commitment basis and excluding grants, is limited to CFAF 84.7 billion
in 1994. External payments arrears, which, valued at the new exchange rate, total CFAF 147.2
billion, will be completely eliminated by end-1994. Verified domestic arrears, which totaled
CFAi 47 billion at end-December 1993, wi11 be reduced by at least CFAF 32 billion by end-1994
and completely eliminated over the course of the following year. The Government implemented a
number of measures related to revenue and expenditure that were reflected in a Loi definances
rectificative adopted in August 1993. To accelerate implementation of the budgetary measures
described below, the Government will enact decrees as authorized by the Loi d'habilitation
adopted by the National Assembly on January 20, 1994.
14.   The introduction oi a new exchange rate should result in a substantial increase in
Government revenue. However, in order to accelerate liberalization of the economy and to
contain the increase in prices and domestic costs, customs duties and indirect taxes have been
adjusted downward by Decrees 94-25 (customs stamp duty), 94-26 (customs tariff), and 94-27
(tax code) of February 15, 1994. Once the new tax system is implemented, total revenues should
amount to CFAF 365 billion in 1994. Pending introduction of a new harmonized customs tariff in
line with UEMOA standards, the tariff will henceforth range from a minimum of 10% to a
maximum of 45%, plus a 5% customs stamp duty. All exemptions are now abolished, except for
those linked to projects and to diplomatic privileges. Nontariff barriers to the import of certain
goods will be eliminated and replaced by a 20% temporary surcharge. A similar surcharge will be
applied to luxury items. Where the VAT is concerned, the present system of five rates (0%, 7%,
15%, 20% and 30%) charged on non-petroleum products is replaced by a three-rate system (0%,
10% and 20%). For petroleum products, customs duties (0%, 25%, 45%) are replaced by two
other rates of 25% and 35% (including the customs stamp duty) and the VAT rates (0%, 7%,
20%o' and 34%) are replaced by the normal rate of 20%. The lists of exempted goods and of those
subject to a reduced rate have been shortened to include only a limited number of items, including
basic commodities and pharmaceutical products. The VAT tax base has been expanded to include
the transport of certain goods (rice, hydrocarbons, cement).
15.   Total commitment-based expenditure will be held down to CFAF 449.7 billion in 1994,
and the wage bill will be kept to CFAF 149 billion. To that end, the number of civil servants will
be maintained at its end-December 1993 level (67,100) wilh no new recruitments on a net basis,
including the settlement of cases pending. Salaries will initially be raised to their pre-September



Annex IV
Page 7 of 14
1993 level, with a proposed increase of not more than 10% taking place after March 31, 1994.
Allowances and other variable components of the wage bill will remain unchanged.
16.   Between now and June 1994 the Government will adopt, in consultation with the World
Bank, a revised three-year public investment program for 1994-96. In the context of the program
for 1994, investment expenditures will be CFAF 112 billion and priority will be given to growth-
generating sectors, the social sectors and the upkeep of essential infrastructure. Efforts will be
continued to improve the programming of investments and strengthen the monitoring of project
execution. Finally, the Government will take the necessary steps to mobilize counterpart funds
and promote the resumption of development projects that have been halted.
Monetary Policy
17.   The monetary authorities will apply a prudent credit policy. Compared with the money
supply at the start of the period, credit to the economy will increase only by 24.4% between the
end of December 1993 and the end of December 1994; net domestic assets will therefore post an
increase of no more than 21.3%. Taking into account the objectives of improving net external
assets, the money supply should grow by 34.2% in 1994. The policy on credit and financial
intermediation will continue to benefit from the reform of monetary policy instruments undertaken
by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO). In particular, as of October 1993,
administrative credit controls have been replaced by indirect instruments, combining pursuit of a
flexible interest-rate policy, introduction of compulsory reserves and expansion of the role of the
money market. Pending a return to price stabilization after the initial rise in the inflation rate, the
central bank's discount rate was raised from 1I½O2% to 141/2% on January 18, 1994.
3. Medium-Term Objectives and Strategies
18.   The medium-term adjustment strategy adopted by the Government aims at a lasting
restoration of the macroeconomic equilibria and sustained economic growth. This strategy
focuses on strengthening of the structural reforms, especially rehabilitation of the agricultural
subsectors, improvement of incentives for the private sector, and rationalization of public
expenditure, and on the institution of coordinated policies to ensure protection of natural
resources and alleviate poverty.
Macroeconomic Objectives
19.   The macroeconomic objectives for 1994-96 are described below:
(a)   The Government aims at achieving a growth rate of at least 51/2% as of 1995, thus
enabling an increase of 2'2% per annum in per capita income. In 1994 real GDP growth is
expected to remain relatively weak (21/2%), due mainly to the burden of the negative trends of



AnnexXV
Page & of 14
recent years and the temporary falling-off in real domestic demand following the realignment of
the exchange rate. This trend should be reversed starting in 1995, thanks to reestablishment of
the competitiveness of the economy. The acceleration of growth would stem mainly from the
vigorous expansion expected in the export and import-substitution sectors after the chlange in
parity.
(b)   After the initial shock to prices, the authorities will seek, ultimately, a return to the
moderate rate of inflation prevailing before the change in parity. The adjusted parity will bring
about an increase in inflation, put at 39% for 1994, but this rate should drop to 8% in 1995 and
then subsequently return to its predevaluation level of 21/2% p.a. This would bring about an
improvement in the competitiveness of the economy of about 30% measured in terms of the
reduction in the r eal effective exchange rate expressed in foreign currency, and enable this
improvement to be maintained following the transition period.
(c)   The external current account deficit, excluding official transfers, of about 10% of
GDP in 1993 should be reduced to 81/2% in 1995, after a temporary increase in 1994. The change
of parity accompanied by the other measures described below would accordingly contribute to a
marked improvement in the external position. The growth in volume of exports during the period
1994-96 is estimated at an average of 8% per year. After a reduction in the first year due to the
price effect, the volume of imports should post a moderate increase (31/2% p.a.) in subsequent
years. The external position would also benefit in 1994-96 from a sizable volume of financing to
support the investment projects and structural reformns. On the basis of the commitments already
obtained regarding external financial assistance, the overall balance of payments position, before
rescheduling and before coverage of additional financing requirements, is expected to post a
deficit of CFAF 81.1 billion in 1994. Following rescheduling and coverage of said requirements,
net external assets should improve in 1994.
20.   To ensure reestablishment of high and sustained economic growth, the investment-to-GDP
ratio should increase from 13.6% in 1993 to 18.4% in 1996, while efforts will also be made to
improve investment efficiency. The surge in investments will have to be financed increasingly by
domestic savings, which should rise from 7.1% of GDP in 1993 to 14.3% in 1996. The
improvement in the budget position will contribute appreciably to this increase.
21.   Sustainable rehabilitation of the public finances accordingly remains an essential element of
the medium-term strategy. The objective is to bring the Government's financial operations into a
viable position, necessitating the generation of surpluses, excluding grants, in both the primary
and the overall balance. The budget deficit (excluding grants) should thus be reduced from 3.8%
of GDP in 1993 to 1.2% in 1996.

Sector Policies
Agricultural Policy
22.   The agriculture sector is the most important sector in terms of employment. However, its
productivity remains low. Since 1985 significant progress has been achieved as regards
liberalization of the sector. Nevertheless, the full benefit of this progress has not been felt, mainly
because of the steady erosion of the sector's international competitiveness and the rainfall deficits.
The change in parity will restore the sector's competiveness. The Government will concentrate on
consolidating this competitiveness, pursuing the removal of the obstacles that still remain and
fostering the growth and diversification of agricultural production.
As regards the groundnut subsector, producer prices have been set on the basis of world
prices and all producer subsidies have been eliminated. The Government also intends to privatize
SONACOS. The privatization arrangements will be finalized before the end of December 1994.
Regarding the cereals subsector, the Government will carry out the necessary reforms in
the eontext of an agricultural sector adjustment loan. These reforms will be formulated in
consultation with the World Bank and the other donors, and will focus particularly on the price-
setting system for imported rice, the management mechanism for imports of broken rice, and the
role of SAED in the production, marketing and transport of locally grown rice. In this context the
Government undertakes to embark on restructuring of CPSP with the aim of reducing its
operating costs by the end of 1994. The end purpose will be for CPSP to have no further
involvement in rice importation, purchasing and distribution other than in situations when normal
supply of the domestic market is interrupted. The Government will also ensure that SAED
transfers its rice purchasing and husking activities to the private sector.
As to the cotton subsector, the authorities will apply a flexible producer price policy based
on world prices and will pursue the restructuring of the Societe pour le Developpement des Fibres
Textiles (SODEFITEX) in order to improve its productivity. The Government's other objectives
in this subsector include extension of the rural credit system, application of the revised forestry
code, aned implementation of a community-based system of rangeland management and
environr iental protection, utilizing measures to combat deterioration of soils and forest resources.
In the fishery subsector, the Government will concentrate on stimulating private
investment, consolidating competitiveness and increasing industrial production, seeking to expand
its shares of external markets while also ensuring the protection and rational management of
fishery resources.
23.   The Government intends to seek the cooperation of the World Bank in defining the
modalities for its intervention in the sector so as to maximize the impact of the associated



Annex IV
Page 10 of 14
investments. In particular, to complement the financing of basic services (agricultural research,
rural infrastructure), efforts could be focused on the improvement of sector policies (Agricultural
Sector Adjustment Loan), implementation of the Left Bank Masterplan and promotion of the
private sector.
Industrial and Promotional Policy in the Private Sector
24.   The goals of the program's structural measures are to improve the competitiveness of the
sector, promote a denser industrial fabric and diversify production. In this context, trade and
price liberalization, together with improvements to the institutional framework, are seen as key
elements. The Government intends to take the necessary steps to stimulate and maintain the
responsiveness of the private sector. In particular, it is keen to have the support of the World
Bank and the other donors in order to remove the specific constraints inhibiting the development
of small and medium-size industries. In fact, the SME/SMIs have a vital role to play both in
expanding domestic production to replace imports and in generating employment. The strategy
for promoting the private sector has eight components: (1) priority for export development;
(2) strengthening of domestic competition and improvements in competitiveness; (3)
rationalization of direct and indirect taxation, including that of imported goods; (4) improvements
in the operation of the labor market; (5) alignment of factor prices with their economic production
costs; (6) revitalization and streamlining of the institutional machinery for private sector support;
(7) improvements in companies' access to credit; and (8) improvements in the legal and regulatory
framework.
To enable private sector production to respond, the Government will propose to the
World Bank, before March 31, 1994, a list of obstacles that could be rapidly removed. These
proposals, mainly built around implementation of the eight components listed above, could serve
as a basis for negotiating a private sector support project with the World Bank.
25.   As far as reform of the labor market is concerned, a revised labor code was submitted for
approval by the National Assembly in September 1991. This new code was designed to give
employers more latitude to hire on the basis of fixed-term contracts, abolish prior authorization
of layoffs, and authorize employer-employee wage negotiations at the company level. However,
because of the political and social context, the draft code has not yet come to a vote. The
Government is to hold discussions with the partners involved in an effort to reach a consensus
that would build into the labor legislation, before the end of 1994, the flexibility needed to
encourage production and job creation.
Financial Sector
26.   The World Bank, together with other donors, has financed the bank restructuring
program. At the national level, the plan of action has been satisfactorily implemented, except with



Annex IV
Page 11 of 14
respect to recovery of claims due to liquidated banks. The thrust of the Government's efforts will
be to promote improvements in the terms of financing of the economy. Special strategies will be
employed to improve SME/SMI access to credit. Continuing efforts will also be made to
rehabilitate the banking system, especially through the reform of the Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole (CNCAS), which is to be recapitalized during 1994. To encourage further the
mobilization and improved utilization of savings, the authorities are to lay the groundwork for the
creation of a financial market within the UMOA and will help in establishing savings and loan
banks. In addition, a program will be put in place to restructure the insurance sector and social
security institutions.
Tourism
27.   As far as tourism is concerned, the change in parity should have a highly positive impact.
The Government has already introduced a number of administrative reforms and tax concessions
that are highly advantageous to the sector: abolition of entry visas for subjects of certain
European countries traveling in groups, direct service to Casamance by jumbo jets departing from
Europe, and elimination of the ticket fee. The Government's medium-term goals are to
consolidate the competitiveness of Senegal as a destination, to expand tourism potential by
penetrating new markets (United States, Quebec) and to upgrade the quality of services through
training of hotel personnel. The Government also plans to do all it can to reduce the current high
degree of seasonality, in particular by diversifying tourist offerings.
State-Owned Enterprises
28.   Besides privatizing SONACOS and restructuring SODEFITEX, the Government will
pursue, with support from the World Bank, the restructuring of SENELEC and SONEES. The
ongoing study on the restructuring of SONEES will be completed before June 30, 1994 so that
specific recommendations can be submitted. The financial audit of SENELEC will be finished by
June 30, 1994. In tandem with the institutional audit of 1992, this audit will permit identification
of specific measures for lowering SENELEC's operating costs and improving its management.
The Government will strengthen its monitoring of the performance contracts with the other state-
owned enterprises undergoing restructuring. In addition, the cross debts of the public sector will
continue to be settled in accordance with the pre-agreed timetable.
Human Resources and Poverty Alleviation
29.   The basic objective of the adjustment program is to restore growth and to rely on private
enterprise to create jobs and enhance individual incomes. By improving the public finances, the
program will also enable the Government to expand its efforts to develop human resources.
However, allowances will have to be made for the particular problems created by the transition
period needed to allow behaviors and economic circuits to adjust. Aside from the social measures



Annex I
Page 12 of 14
described earlier, and to allow for a possible contraction of activity in some enterprises, special
measures will be adopted in 1994 to offer jobs in urban and rural areas under the aegis of
AGETIP. Activities undertaken in 1994 to assist the most disadvantaged population groups will
all be in the nature of pilot projects. Those projects that produce the most convincing and
sustainable results (good coverage of the target groups, delivery of services at competitive cost,
and creation of employment) will be expanded into larger-scale projects which could be submitted
to donors.
30.   In the education sector, priority will go to improving the quality of elementary education,
with emphasis on rural areas and the enrollment of girls. In this connection, the goals in 1994 will
be to speed up the school building program by accelerating the construction of classrooms (300
additional rooms over and above the current program of 700 classrooms), to recruit and train the
corresponding teachers, to expand access to textbooks, to ensure that pupils are provided with
basic school supplies and the schools with bench tables, and to implement a program to increase
to 45% the enrollment ratio for girls in the 20 departments that are below the national standard.
Given the resources available and the wage bill constraints, financing of the salaries of the
additional instructors will be on a contract basis.
At the intermediate and secondary levels, priority will be given to rehabilitating a number
of schools that are in a very dilapidated condition.
In the case of higher education, the Government will put into effect the decisions it took
following the recommendations of the National Symposium on Higher Education. The two key
measures, to be introduced at the start of the 1994-95 school year, are: (i) a reduction in the costs
of higher education thanks to the gradual privatization of cafeteria services, a reduction in the
funding of scholarships for study abroad and a more stringent approach to the award of
scholarships to students at the two universities in Senegal; and (ii) control of higher education
flows by restricting admissions to the number of places available and strict application of the rules
governing length of stay in the respective departments. The resulting savings will be allocated
preferentially to improving the quality of higher education by providing a consistent budget
endowment for teaching and research activities, and to improving the enrollment rate, as
described earlier.
31.   In the health sector, priority will continue to be given to implementing the recent health
strategy, the key elements of which consist in improved access to primary health care for both
urban and rural dwellers, expanded preventive medicine, and the use of essential and generic
drugs. This strategy is part of a broader effort to decentralize health planning and management to
benefit the regions and districts. The Government will similarly pursue its cost recovery policy
throughout the health care delivery system and continue to promote community participation in
the management of first-line health facilities. The steady increase in real terms in the share of
health in the state budget will be continued and should reach 71/2% by 1996. The allocation



Annex IV
Page 13 of 14
earmarked for operating the health districts will increase as planned by at least 10% a year.
In 1988, the Government adopted a Declaration of Population Policy and a program of
priority actions for the development of human resources. The national family planning program,
which is aimed at controlling fertility and lowering the population growth rate, remains one of the
pillars of this policy. The Government has decided to intensify the integration of family planning
services into the public health facilities and to encourage private sector participation in this area,
in order to broaden access to these services and position the country to meet the 1996 target of
11% for the proportion practLcing some form of contraception.
Transportation and Infrastructure
32.   In 1990, the Government adopted a General Policy Letter for the transport sector, in
which it sets out a medium-term strategy for the sector. This strategy is aimed at reforming and
modernizing the management of the sector and assigns priority to maintaining existing
infrastructure rather than investing in its expansion. It provides for the restructuring of the
sector's parastatals (SNCS, PAD, AIR SENEGAL) in order to enhance their performance and
eliminate their need for subsidies, and for the contracting of private companies to carry out
maintenance work, replacing the various authorities operating by force account. Enjoying broad
support from the lending community as part of the Transport Sector Adjustment Program
(TSAP), this policy got off to a very satisfactory start between 1990 and 1992. It subsequently
ran into difficulties, owing to the fact that the appropriations in the national budget for the
approved road maintenance program did not become available on a regular basis. However, since
the last quarter of 1993, the Government has made a sustained effort to reestablish the right
conditions for the TSAP to get back on track, in particular by taking specific steps to clear its
arrears and rehabilitate the financial and operational management of the enterprises in the sector.
The Government is thus demonstrating its desire to implement the sector policy it has defined. In
its view, functional and efficient transport infrastructure facilities and services are cornerstones of
an economic environment conducive to investment and production.
Natural Resource Management Policy
33.   In compliance with IDA's requirements, the Government has undertaken to prepare a
National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP). It is to speed up implementation of the revised
forestry code and is planning to install a community-based management system for rangelands and
environmental protection, with the aid of measures to combat degradation of soils and forest
resources. The population is growing much faster in the cities than in rural areas, and the
authorities are aware of the urgent need to find a solution to the problems of industrial waste.
The urban project and the labor-intensive public works projects will be useful in helping to
improve the urban environment.

Regional Integration
34.   During the Dakar meeting on January 10 and 11, 1994, the heads of state of the UMOA
signed the treaty transforming the Monetary Union into an Economic and Monetary Union. This
treaty provides for the establishment of mechanisms to facilitate the convergence of national
economic policies and to make them consistent with the Union's monetary policy, as well as
harmonizing the tax systems and foreign trade rules of the countries involved. These mechanisms
will combine with those already in effect, and together they will prove valuable in terms of
adherence to the tight fiscal and monetary policies needed if the adjustment program is to
succeed. The size of the UEMOA will also permit expansion of the region's econonic production
through the enlargement of its markets and economies of scale. This will favor the growth of
exports from the countries that belong to the Union. Finally, the UEMOA will lend added weight
to the countries in the subregion in their economic dealings with their partners.
