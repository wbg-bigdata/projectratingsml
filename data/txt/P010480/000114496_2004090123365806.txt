with the modifications thereto set forth below (the General
Conditions) constitute an integral part of this Agreement:
     (a)  The last sentence of Section 3.02 is deleted.
     (b)  The second sentence of Section 5.01 is modified to read:
          "Except as the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise
          agree, no withdrawals shall be made:  (a) on account
          of expenditures in the territories of any country

          territories; or (b) for the purpose of any payment
          to persons or entities, or for any import of goods,
