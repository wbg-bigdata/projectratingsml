INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDSNT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
SMALLHOLDER & PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recammendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of
US$7.8 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Smallholder and
Private Estate Tea Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         The latest Bank report on Indonesia, (Development Issues for
Indonesia, December 1, 1972: R73-6/1) contains a discussion of recent
economic developments, but addressed itself principally to longer-term
policy issues relevant to the Second Plan (1974h-78) now in preparation.
Country data are presented in Annex I.
3.         Indonesia's economic progress over the five years ending 1971
has been satisfactory. The rate of growth of GDP, averaging 5 percent per
year in 1965-70, reached 6-7 percent in 1971, but was probably lower in
1972 when food production, particularly rice, was severely affected by
drought. Rice imports to meet the shortages in 1972/73 are estimated at
1.2 million tons, up from 530,000 tons in the preceding year. Mainly as
a result of these shortages the cost of living indices escalated towards
the end of 1972 so that prices at the end of December were 26 percent higher
than a year earlier, interrupting the relative price stability achieved
and maintained since 1969. However, secondary price effects have so far
been limited. Rice prices declined in the first quarter of 1973 and the
general price level also fell slightly.
4.         In the industrial sector, there has been further substantial
growth in the production of textiles as well as of other consumer and
industrial goods. The rehabilitation and expansion of domestic enterprises,
backed by a continuing inflow of private investment and commitments of
official aid for several major industrial projects, suggests that the prospects
are good for further industrial growth from the present small base.
Infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion is underway, financed in large
measure by project aid, including IDA credits. Deficiencies in the transport,
power and telecommunications sectors, however, could become a constraint on
agricultural and industrial growth unless special efforts are made to accelerate
the implementation of ongoing and future projects.



5.         In the public sector, Governmfent revenues in, 1971/72 were 20
percent higher than in the previous year. A much larger increase, in the
order of 45 percent, will be realized in 1972/73. The largest item in this
increase would be taxes on expected higher earnings of foreign oil companies.
Other revenues could increase by up to 20 percent. The expected increase
in revenues of Rp 160 billion (US$387 million) after financing increases in
salaries and materi-l expenditure in the routine budget, would allow for a
doub'Ling (to Rp 135 billion or US$326 million) of the surplus available for
the development budget. Together with counterpart funds generated by program
alc (estimated at Rp 97 billion or US$234 million) this provided for a
rt:oiah development budget in 1972/73 of Rp 232 billion (US$560 million),
wnichwashg8 percent more than in 1971/72. In addition, project aid disbursements
in 1972/73 are estimated at Rp 62 billion (US$150 million).
6.         The balance of payments situation has improved steadily. Exports,
led by oil, have expanded at an unprecedented rate in recent years, but imports
have also risen rapidly. Recorded exports from Indonesia rose by over 30
percent in the last two years, and they increased even more in 1972/73, reaching
about Us$1,935 million, largely as a result of sharp increases in the volume
and value of oil and timber exports. Foreign exchange reserves increased
rapidly in 1972, from formerly very low levels, and reached a net level of
$285 million at the end of December 1972. Gross reserves then amounted to $489
million, equivalent to about three months of total imports at 1972/73 rates
and an increase of $345 million in the year. The changed situation resulted
partly from good export performance, partly from an inflow of capital attracted
by high Indonesian intereF'- rates but largely also from the utilization of
foreign loans contracted La 1972 by state enterprises, notably Pertamina , the
national oil company. The Government has since taken steps to ensure effective
control over the amounts and purposes of short and medium-term foreign borrowing,
which under the new IMF standby arrangements agreed on May 4 will be substantially
less in the coming year than the obligations incurred last year.
7.         The Government is now in the process of assessing Indonesia's past
performance and future economic potential as part of its preparations for the
Second Plan. This Plan will address more directly than was possible in the
rehabilitation phase the issues of employment, income cdist'riution an(d region.31
development. Although the ability of the Indonesian Government to formulate
and implement plans, programs and projects has improved, limited managerial
capacity presents a serious obstacle to more rapid growth. This problem,as well
as the continued need to improve the mobilization of domestic savings, will
also have to be considered in the formulation of the Plan.
8.         Banlc Group assistance to Indonesia is a part of the international
support being given in increasing amounts through the I(GI. Aid commitments
have risen from less tlan US$200 million equivalent in 1967 to over U$6oo
million for 1971/72. The proportion of project aid has steadily increased
over this period, but substantial program aid remains essential as support



-3-
fcr the balance of payments and - in spite of strong domestic revenue
efforts - as a source of additional funds for the development budget. For
1972/73, express or implied commitments made by IGGI members amounted to
some US$724 million equivalent, of which US$320 million was for program
aid, including US$110 million in food supplies. In December 1972, the
IGI accepted as reasonable and realistic, in terms of Indonesia's needs,
a request for $760 million in new aid cormmitments in 1973/74. Of the total,
$160 million was requested in food aid with the other $600 million for
project and non-food program aid. On May 7, IGGI member countries and agencies
announced intentions to provide non-food aid amounting to $720 million in
1973/74. Even after allowance for recent currency realignments, this
substantially exceeds the Indonesian request. Efforts will be made in addition
to ensure the timely availability of food aid in the required amounts.
9.         The soft average terms of foreign assistance in the 1GGI framework,
and the rescheduling of pre-1966 external debt obligations (under the 1970
Paris Club agreement with the Western countries and Japan and parallel
arrangements with several Eastern European countries) have kept Indonesia's
public debt service ratio relatively low, for 1973 estimated atll percent of
exports. The capacity to service external debt will, however, continue to
be limited by the size of investment income transfers arising from foreign
investment in oil, hard minerals, forestry and manufacturing which amounted
to 14 percent of exports in 1972 and will increase substantially through the
1970's. The maintenance of low official debt service ratios during the decade
will depend on the continued availability of concessional aid, restraints
on short and medium term foreign borrowing not directly related to export
growth, and the further substantial increases in exports which are now projected.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONEIA
10.        In order to accelerate the pace of economic development, Indonesia
will require substantial external support for rehabilitation and improvement
of infrastructure and expansion of production capabilities in agriculture,
minerals, forestry and manufacturing. It will also require continued strength-
ening of the institutions for the planning of development and the management
of the econony. Welfare and income distribution, including family planning,
as well as regional development and related patterns of employment and population
movements, also need to be given an important place in Indonesia's development
strategy.
II.        The work of both the Resident Staff in Indonesia and at Headquarters
and the lending activities of the Bank Group have been oriented towards these
development objectives. The focus of the Bank's economic work in providing
assistance to the Government in the current preparation of Indonesia's next
five-year plan is also along these lines.



- 4 -
12.         Consistent with Indonesia's low per capita income, large external
resource requirements, and limited debt servicing capacity, the Bank Group's
lending to Indonesia (aside from IFC investments) has been and will probably
continue for some time to be in the forn of IDA credits. In recognition of
the urgent need for institutional reforms, most IDA-financed projects have
been associated with major reorganizations of existing institutions or the
establishment of new ones, and most credits have included appropriate
provision for consultant services.
13.         Up to the end of April, 1973, Indonesia has received 26 IDA
credits amounting to US$34-1.5 million. Annex II contains a sumwary stataemitof IDJ
credits and IFC investments as of April 30, 1973 and notes on the execution
of on-going projects. The composition of this lending reflects the priorities
for rehabilitation and development established by the Government. Indonesia's
First Five Year Plan (1969-74) gives higiest priority to agriculture. The
Association has alreadr extended four credits to help rehabilitate and
develop plantations in the Government estates sector. Other credits for
agriculture include four to assist rehabilitation of irrigation systems and
one each for a fisheries project, a seeds multiplication program, beef cattle
development in the outer islands and smallholder rubber development in
Sumatra. In addition, the Association organized a consortium of lenders to
finance a major extension of t'he Pusri Fertilizer Plant.
14.         Other priority sectors to which credits have also been extended
include power, transportation, telecommunications, industry, education and
population. In addition, three technical assistance credits have been made
to finance preinvestment studies undertaken by the Government, which have
helped to establish investment priorities over a wide range of activities,
and provide other urgently needed technical assistance. Since April 30 credits
amounting to US$78.5 million for projects in power generation, primary
education and highways as well as an increase of US$5 million in Credit 193-IND
(Pusri Fertilizer Expansion) have been approved. Credits to finance an
industrial estate and sugar industry rehmbilitation are expec-ted to be
presented to the Executive Directors in the next several months. Projects
in irrigation, telecomnunications, and tourism are urider preparation.
i5.         The first IDA credit to Indcnesia was macle in September 1968, and
more than half of all credits have been made since July 1970, The program is
thus new, and the undisbursed portion of the credits is relatively large.
Virtually every credit has been associated with extensive institutional reforms
involving, inter alia, the creation of new project authorities, drafting of
new charters, and enactment of new Legislation, all of which have taken, in
most cases, much time. Several credits - including the first two for agricultural
estates projects - have experienced delays in disbursement because of management
problems.



16.         Both because of the limited absorption capacity of project agencies
and the need in the initial stages of lending to Indonesia to assist in a
number of sectors, IDA lending was spread over a relatively large number of
fairly small projects. Now that the program has substantially expanded, our
assistance will in general concentrate more heavily on consolidating what has
already been started, through a smaller number of larger loans to project entities
already familiar with Bank Group procedures. New initiatives will be limited to
a few projects which support the Association's overall lending strategy of
building up vital institutions of high economic and social priority. This
consolidation is expected to reduce the Government's needs to staff new or
substantially reorganized project agencies and to make more manageable the Bank
Group's responsibility for supervising projects in Indone3ia.

PART III - THE SMAILHOLDEP AND PRIVATE ESTATE
TEA SECTOR IN INDONESIA
17.        Java, the site of the proposed project, has 70 percent of Indonesia's
population and produces about 90 percent of Indonesia's tea output. Three-fourths
of the 80 million people on the island derive their income from agriculture.
Annual per capita GNP of the rural population is about uS$55 conpared with a
national average of US$77. Roughly, 500,000 people depend for their livelihood
ozn private sector tea production. Net per capita income of a typical tea small-
holding is only about US$35.
18.        Before 1939 Indonesia was the world's third largest exporter of tea
with annual exports of almost 75,000 tons. Annual production was about 90,000
tons, of which about 70,000 tons were produced by privately owned estates.
During the war, large areas of tea were uprooted and planted with food crops. Post
war disruption, subsequent neglect and shortages of funds and technical skills
led to a further decline in production. By 1970/71, total tea production had fallen
to about 54,000 tons and exports to 33,000 tons. Government estates are now being
rehabilitated with external support, including an IDA credit (259-IND, September
1971) of US$15 million. By contrast, the private tea sector is still in c-itical
need of rehabilitation.
19.        Smallholder tea production was initially developed with the help of
estates which provided plalting material, fertilizer, credit, technical assistance
and marketing facilities. Vital links between the two sectors were broken during
the war and post war years when the estates were unable to provide these services
to the smallholders. As a result both the number of smallholders and their pro-
duction of tea declined.  In 1970/71 there were about 39,000 registered smallholders
with 51,000 ha of tea in Java compared to about 75,000 ha before the war. The
average size of a smallholding is 1.8 ha, including 1.1 ha under tea. Paddy and
cassavaare the principal subsistence crops.
20.        There are about 11,000 ha under tea on 53 private estate& in West Java
and about 1,900 ha on six estates in Central Java. They produce about 4,700 tons
of tea, mostly for the domestic market. While these estates are operated by
privately owned corporate entities, their land is leased from Government for 30
years. The deterioration in tea husbandry is severe and there is a need for credit
for rehabilitation of fields, buildings, transport, and factories to inprove the
efficiency of these estates and enable them to prcvide technical assistance as
wiell as marketing and processing facilities to suirrounding smallholders.
21.        All processing facilities except for the factories of Government
estates are privately owned.and most need to be rehabilitated, Tea leaf from
Government estates is processed exclusively into black tea and sold primarily
for export. Many private estates have shifted theIr factory production to green
tea because it requires less --phisticated processing technicues and smaller



- 7 -
investment. Smallholders have also been forced in recent years to process a
large quantity of their leaf in small and crude green tea factories. While
green tea is preferred by some segments of the West Java population, it has
a limited market. The increase in future demand is expected to be mainly for
black tea.
22.        Failure to arrest the decline of the private tea industry would have
serious economic and social consequences for the tea growing regions. The range
of possible alternative cash crops is limited by climate and geography and
living standards would therefore very likely decline. In addition, an increasing
share of Government tea production, most of which is now exported, would have to
be diverted into the domestic market to meet the growth in demand. The Government
acknowledges the importance of improving private sector tea production and gives
it high priority. Major constraints are the lack of planning, shortage of credit,
antiquated processing facilities, ignorance of modern production methods among
tea growers, and,closely related to this, the absence of an effective extension
service. The proposed project is designed to help remove these constraints.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
General
23.        The proposed project was prepared by the Commonwealth Development
Corporation financed under the IDA credit for the Tea Estates project (No. 259-INV of
1971).An IDA mission composed of Messrs. Elz, Brown (IDA),Janzen , Lushington
and Moreithi (consultants) appraised the project in October/November 1972. The
credit was negotiated in Washington on April 24-27, 1973. The Government team
was led by Mr. Muluk Lubis, Director General of Estates. The proposed credit
would be the Association's second credit for the smallholder sector in Indonesia
following the North Sumatra Smallholder Development Credit (No. 358-IN))) which
was signed in February 1973.
The Project
24.        The project is designed to increase the productivity of the private
tea industry in West and Central Java, to enable it to help meet the domestic
demand for tea. This would be achieved by rehabilitating 6,500 ha of smallholder
and 1,200 ha of private estate tea; by replanting 3,500 ha of smallholder and
2,000 ha of private estate tea; and by constructing two new black tea factories
as well as by rehabilitating five existing privately owned tea factories. To
support this effort the credit program would be expanded and a specialized



- 8 -
extension service would be created to provide requiredc inputs and technical
assistance to tea growers. Tea nurseries would also be established to ensure
that high quality planting material would be available. In addition, training
facilities and programs would be developed to train both extension officers
and tea growers. Funds are also provided under the project for consultancy
services and for studies of ways and means   to improve the domestic marketing
system for tea, to diversify production in the project area and to strengthen
the long-term lending capability of the Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), the credit
channel f-or the proposed project. About 7,700 smallholders and 30 of the 59
existing private estates are expected to receive assistance under the project.
C-5        This is primarily a smallholder project. ciallholder field development
accounts for over three quarters of the project area. Moreover, the private
estates included in the project will provide supportirng services to smallholders
in surrounding areas. Investment in factories would result in essential
improvements in, and expansion of,the processing facilities available for the
smallholders. The principal features of the proposed credit and project are
sumnarized in Annex III.
Oranization and Management
26.        Project Management Unit: Tne project would be executed by a Project
Management Unit PMU    to be established in the Ministry of Agriculture. The
PMU, with headquarters at Bandung, would be headed by a project marager who
would be assisted by one chief advisor and three other internationally recruited
executive assistants who would fill the positions of Technical Development
Office',, Factory Consultant, and Accountirg Systems Specialist. PMU would operate
the nurseries; recruit, train and administer the field extension staff; arrange
for training of tea growers; and conduct tenders for fertilizer, pesticides,
training facilities, office equipment and vehicles. Overall policy guidance
for the PMU would be provided by a Project Management Board (PMB), consisting
of the Director General of Estates (Chairman) and senior representatives of the Minis-
tries of Finance and Interior,   RAPPEAS (Natbnal Planning Organization), BRI,
Director of Smallholder Estates, Estates Syndicate and other parties appointed
by the Minister of Agriculture on the basis of their background and ability to
contribute to the development of the orivate tea industry. PMU and PME1 would be
established, the Project 5anager, Chief Project Advisor, Technical Development
Officer and the Accounting Systemas Specialist would be appointed and the Project
Manager would have taken up his duties before the credit would be declared
effective. As recruitment and retention of qualified staff would be difficult
at present low levels of government salaries, the PMU staff would receive higher
annual compensation equivalent to that received by government estates staff
with similar experience and qualifications.



27.        Bank Rak-yat Indonesia: Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) is one of the
five state-owned banks in Indonesia. BRI's lending is mainly to agricultural
smallholders and small rural industry. Through a network of Village and Mobile
Units, BRI provides good coverage of rural West and Central Java, including
the project area; it is through these units that credit for the Bimas Rice
Intensification Program and its affiliated programs is being channelled. BRI
is the most suitable channel for credit to the smallholders under the project.
The IDA credit would provide for the services of an internationally recruited
financial advisor, who would assist BRI in improving its loan administration
and in establishing an effective project accounting system, and for training
of BRI's staff in the project area. BRI plans to establish a separate unit
for its country-wide medium and long-term lending operations. To assist BRI
in strengthening its overall capabilities in this field, funds for internationally
recruited consultants would also be provided in the proposed credit for a study
to recommend improvements in BRI's medium and long-term credit operations and
to help implement these recommendations. The study would be administered by
Bank Indonesia.
Field Develo ment Sub-loans
28.        Credit to smallholders in the form of supply certificates for
fertilizers, pesticides and planting material and cash credits for hired labor,
would be extended by BRI on the basis of input specifications prepared by PMU
extension officers and certification by them that the applicants' husbandry
practices are acceptable. BRI would check the creditworthiness of theapplicant
and his right to cultivate the land. Private estates would receive credit for
field rehabilitation upon approval of their development plan by the PMU and
satisfactory financial and managerial appraisal of the applicant by BRI. Only
domestic enterprises which hold undisputed title to the necessary land would
be allowed to participate. Credit for field development would be extended at
12 percent per annum with maximum repayment terms for private estates of 18
years including 8 years of grace and for snallholders of 15 years including
five years of grace. The terms are slightly more favorable for the private
estates because they have larger requirements for replanting and incremental
hired labor and therefore need more time to generate funds to cover their debt
service obligations.The PMU would report annually to the BRI on the agricultural
programs of smallholders and estates. Continued disbursement under sub-loans
would be contingent on satisfactory performance and on the timely payment of
interest by sub-borrowers.
Factory Sub-loans
29.        Factories to be rehabilitated are owned and managed by private
estate owners. The new factories would initially be owned by PTP XII and. PTP
XIII ,which are government-owned tea estates, but provision would be made for
future transfer of ownership to smallholders under arrangements to be made
in consultation with the Association. The factory owners would employ



- 10 -
consultants acceptable to the Association to design and supervise factory
rehabilitation and construction. Credit for factory rehabilitation would
bear 12 percent interest per annum and would be repayable over not more
than 15 years including five years of grace.
Proj5ect Costs and Financing
30.          Total project cost is estimated at about US$15.4 million eauivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$7.8 million to be financed by IDA.
Smallholder field development would account for 23 percent of project costs;
estate field development 13 percent; factory rehabilitation and construction 18
percent; the Project Mbnagement Unit, including training, extension, nurseries
and supporting consultancy services 16 percent, and technical assistance for BRI
3 percent. The two principal items in the foreign exchange component are
fertilizer and pesticides (US$2.4 million) and factory machinery (US$1.6 million).
31.          The proposed IDA credit of US$7.8 million would be extended to the
Government of Indonesia. About US$1.0 million of the credit would be made
available directly to the PMU to cover foreign exchange costs of project
consultants, the financial advisor, marketing and crop diversification studies,
overseas training, vehicles and office equipment for the PMU and training facilities.
About US$0.2 million would be used to finance the BRI study. The balance of the
credit (US$6.6 million) would be onlent to BRI at 4 percent per annum repayable
cver 20 years including 10 years of grace. BRI would lend these funds together
with its own contribution (about US$3.9 million), financed partly from its own
resources and partly from funds to be provided by Bank Indonesia, to sub-borrowers
at 12 percent per annum for field development and factories (paragraph 24). The
prcceeds of the IDA credit would cover about 63 percent of the subloans extended
by BRI to farmers; of the balance, about 8 percent would come from BRI's deposits
on which BRI pays 15 percent interest per annum, and the rest from Bank Indonesia
at lx percent interest per annum. The weighted average cost of BRI's funds
(borrowed from the Government, Bank Indonesia and BRI's own funds) thus is 6.2
percent,reducing to 5.8 percent the overall spread to BRI to cover its costs and
risks. Sub-borrowers participating in the project would contribute US$1.4 million
- or about 9 percent of total costs - towards field and factory development
costs. Contributions by private estates and for factory rehabilitation would be
irn cash,while smallholders' contributions would be in the form of incremental
family labor. The Goverruent would make available from its own resources US$2.3
million to meet the local costs of the PMU and technical assistance.
Procurement
32.         Machinery and equipment for the two new factories, fertilizers,
pesticides, and vehicles with a total estimated cost of US$3.5 million (excluding
contingencies) would be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA guidelines. A preference of 15 percent or the actual tariff,
whichever is less, would be granted to qualified local manufacturers. While PMU
would procure fertilizers and pesticides from abroad, it would make arrangements



- 11 -
satisfactory to the Association for the distribution of these goods to sub-
borrowers through local distributors with supply outlets in the project area;
these local distributors would be selected on the basis of local competitive
bidding. International competitive bidding would not be practical for the
procurement of machinery and equipment for factory rehabilitation (about
US$1.1 million) because compatibility with existing installations would be
essential. In addition each contract would be small and bulking impractical
because the five factories are separately owned, would be rehabilitated over
a three-year period, and would each require a different mix of machinery and
equipment items. For such machinery and equipment, at least three local
quotations would be solicited, except in cases where standardization requires
the specification of a particular make. Civil works for factories and training
facilities, teaching aids, and office equipment, totalling about US$0.9 million,
would be procured under local competitive bidding because individual contracts
would be small (less than Us$50,000). Foreign suppliers of most of these items
are well represented in Indonesia. All contracts expected to exceed US$50,000
would be subject to IDA approval prior to award.
Project Production and Marketing
33.         The project wouLd generate about 2,000 tons of new tea production
in 1980/81 and about 9,OO tons in 1985/86. Total private sector production
would nevertheless decline from about 21,100 tons in 1972/73 to about 19,800
tons in 1980/81 because the increase in project output would not be sufficient
to compensate for the decline in production in the rest of the sector. By
1985/86 total production from sznallhclders and private estates would have
increased to about 25,000 tons or by 4,000 tons over the present level of
production. The production generated by the project would have an annual
wholesale value of about US$7.2 million.
31.         Two-thirds of Indonesia's tea production is presently sold on the
world market, nearly all from Goverunent estates. According to a study by the
Bank's Comnmodities anc Export Projects Division which was circulated to the
Executive Directors,lythe international tea market in 1980 is likely to be
characterized by oversupply and lower than recent prices. In Indonesia, in
spite of a large domestic market potential, tea consumption has declined
during the 1960's because of supply shortages; per capita consumpticn in 1970
was well below the 1960 level and the consuaption levels of other tea
producing countries. The project would arrest the decline in private sector
tea production and would be sufficient to allow an increase in consurption
although per capita consunption would still remain well below the level of
1960. If total domestic ccnsurption expands at 5 percent per annum, the
rate experienced before 1960, Indonesian tea exports in 1985 would be

Project Benefits
135.       As a result of increased production and improvement in quality, the
average annual net income per ha from tea of about 7,700 participating
smallholders would increase by about US$200 at full development (from US$86
to US$287). Estates'net inccme from leaf production would increase by about
US$20,000 per year per 100 ha. The overall effect of the project on net farm
income would be annual increases of US$2.3 million to smallholders and US$0.8
million to estates.
36.        The financial rates of return on all proposed sub-projects are
adequate to ensure sub-borrower participation. Smallholder field development
and estate factory rehabilitation are particularly at-tractive, with internal
razes of return of 27 percent and 17 percent respectively. The economic rate
of return for the credit component of the project is 23 percent,and for total
project investment 15 percent.
37.        In addition to the direct financial benefi-ts to sub-borrowers,
and the generation of 5,000 new jobs for field and factory workers, the project
would help strengthen the Government's agricultural institutions. Staff
qualifications and operating procedures developed within the PMU would serve
as models for the improvement of extension services for other regions and crops.
Training facilities and programs under the project could also serve as examples
of the needs and possibilities relating to other sectors. Technical assistance
to BRI would improve the capacity of its Central and W4est Java field staff to
appraise and supervise tree-crop credits, and the management study could result
in substantial improvements in BRI's organization and operating procedures.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.           The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between BRI and
the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and the text
of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft Agreements conform to the normal
pattern for credits for smallholder agriculture projects.
39.           I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
ho.           I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

C.*        PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Cr. No. 127  Irrigation Rehabilitation; US$5 Million Credit of September 6,
196-'; Clo-s-ing LDate-: _iume_3.0. 1-9714-.-
This credit was for the purchase of earth moving equipment required
lor rehabilitatinw three irrigation systems in Java and for the construction of
a fourth in South Sumatra. While all equipment supplied under the project is
being well utilized and disbursements are within 98 percent of the appraisal
timetable, the actual cost of the rehabilitation will be considerably higher
than was estimated during appraisal, as a result of the unforeseen need to include
substantial drainage works under the project. This increase in project cost
is being financed by GOI. Project completion will be delayed by about two years
due to this additional required work, but the economic rate of return will
still be above 20 percent.
Cr. No. 135  Technical Assistnnce; US$2.0 Million Credit. of. December 27, 1968;
Closng_Dite: Jnuary 31, 1974.
The preinvestment studies financed by this credit are progressing
satisfactorily and the credit is nearly fully committed. In order to complete
disbursements for ongoing studies, we have recently agreed to postpone the closing
date for one year, to January 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 154  Kighways; US$28 Million Credit of Jurie 20 1969; Closi   Date:
December 31, 1973.-
This credit finances equipment for highway maintenance and a specific
highlway rehabilitation program. Initial delays in project execution arose from
the unfamiliarity of the Indonesian officials with Bank procurement procedures
and administrative inefficiencies in disbursement of local funds. The project
is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 155 Agrricultural Estates; US$16 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Closing Date: June 3
The project is about one year behind the original schedule due to
initial delays in appointing management advisors and visitirg inspectors, lack
of suitable planting material in the early stages of development and an unforeseen
sharp fall in rubber prices which seriously restricted the availability of self-
generated funds. Adequate supplies of good quality planting material are now
becoming available so that by the end of 1974 oil palm planting programs should
be on target. There has also been a recovery in rubber prices in recent months
and the availability of self-generated funds will be much less of a problem in
1973. While there have been improvements in plantation work leading to increased
production, weak and inexperienced rmanagement continues to be a problem and the
impact of foreign advisors has been mixed, Improvements are also needed in
budgetary procedures, financial and operational control and overall organization
1/ These notes are designed to inforn the Executive Directors regarding the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are

in the estates sector. Government has taken two steps to improve the situation.
First, in November 1971, it agreed to an IDA-prepared Aide-Memoire on PNP
management problems, including action timetable for implementation of specific
improvements by July 1972. As a result reporting and accounting procedures have
been improved, but management control is still deficient. Second, Government
commissioned a study by management consultants to determine a system for effective
supervision and control of Government-owned estates. The recommendations of the
report are now being reviewed by the Government and we expect to discuss a
timetable for implementation of reforms in the next several months.
Cr. No. 165 Electrij4ty Distribution: US$15 Million Credit of October 29, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 193  PUSRI Fertilizer Eansion: US$35 Million Credit of June 15, 1970
_(as_amended Mayj 13sClosinj_Pate: December 31, 1975;.
Implementation of this project began nearly a year later than
anticipated in the appraisal report because of the time required to meet all
the conditions of effectiveness, to select contractors on bid specifications
acceptable to all co-lenders, and to negotiate contracts satisfactory to all
parties. Since the conclusion of the contracts, Part I (construction of an
ammonia-uree fertilizer complex with an annual capacity of 380,000 metric tons
of urea) has progressed well and the contractors, spurred on by a penalty-bonus
arrangement, are now ahead of the new schedule. Part II (construction and
installation of a natural gas gathering system and a 65-mile transmission line
to the fertilizer complex for use as feedstock and fuel and to serve other
industrial users) has also suffered delays, but the construction contract has been
awarded and the system is now expected to be completed by February 19741, when
the fertilizer plant needs gas for plant testing.
Current estimstes of capital cost show an increase of about 25
percent over the appraisal report figures. Part I shows an increase of 17 percent,
due to currency revaluations and changes made necessary as detailed design
progressed and the true composition of the gas supply became known. Part II
has been enlarged to increase transmission of gas, in part to meet the increased
needs of the fertilizer complex but also to supply a greatly increased usage by
Pertamina for its refineries and by power plants. This has increased the cost
of Part II by about 78 percent, but has lowered the cost of gas to the fertilizer
complex since the system throughput has been increased by 104 percent.
Current estimates indicate that these factors will result in
increased foreign exchange costs of US$20.2 million equivalent, including contingencies
and a potential bonus for the general contractor if he completes the facilities
ahead of the agreed schedule. AID, OECF and IDA have agreed to contribute US$4.o
million, US$4.5 million and US$5.0 million respectively to help finance the foreign
exchange cost overrun. The Government will cover the balance required to complete
both parts of the project.

Despite the capital cost increase, the project has become more
remunerative. The economic rate of return has increased from 14 to 21 percent
and, because of recent market developments a faster build-up of sales and
higher market prices can be expected than assumed in the appraisal report.
Cr. YTo. 194  Agricultural Estates; US$17 Million Credit of June 15, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The comments are generally the same as those for Credit No. 155.
Cr. No. 195  Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US$18.5 Million Credit of June 15,
1970; Closing Date: November 30,-974.
This credit was for the rehabilitation of the Jatiluhur system in
West Java covering 186,000 ha. An autonomous agency Otorita Jatiluhur was
established to administer the project. After a slow start due to problems with
preparation of tender documents and difficulty in obtaining acceptable bids,
work is now proceeding and the project could still be completed on schedule
provided that good contractors win the last two contracts. There are no serious
cost overruns, but due to the above difficulties disbursements are presently
behind schedule.
Cr. No. 210 Telecommunications Expansion; US$12.8 Million Credit of July_13
1970; ClosingDate: June 30, 1974.
After a slow start due to procurement difficulties the project
is now progressing satisfactorily. Orders for all equipment, except the
tropospheric scatter system, have been placed. The management consultants
retained to study the telecommunications authority and recommend remedial
measures have completed their work and have also been retained to implement
the recommendations.
Cr. No. 211  Fisheries; US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970pClosing Date:
June 3   197
This project is part of an overall program to develop export-oriented
skipjack tuna fishing. It consists of construction and equipment of freezing
and cold storage facilities, the construction of a wharf in Aer Tembaga, the
purchase of 30 wooden vessels for pole and line fishing, and two refrigerated
carriers to transport frozen tuna to export markets. The project provides technical
assistance to support the program. Although operations of the project unit,
the State Fisheries Enterprise, have been inefficient, the recent appointment
by Government of new management acceptable to IDA is expected to improve the
situation, and overall prospects for successful implementation have improved,
particularly since there is an upward trend of world market prices for skipjack
tuna.

This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 219  Education; US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31,. 197.
Implementation of this project fell a year behind schedule due to
delays in the Government's evaluation of consultants and to uncertainties regarding
the liability of foreign contractors and consultants for Indonesian income tax.
A contract with consultants was signed in June 1972, and the project is now
progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 220 Irrigation Rehabilitation III; US$14.5 Million Credit of November 6,
170;- Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
This credit is for rehabilitation of three irrigation systems covering
200,000 ha, two in Java and one in South Sulawesi. Construction is presently behind
schedule due to initial difficulties in. recruiting expatriate staff, problems with
the preparation of contract documents aidover-extension of local contractors due to
the large volume of construction involved. Although some improvements in project
execution is expected, it is still estimated that the project's completion date
will be 2 to 3 years behind the appraisal report estimate. Overall project cost
estimates have increased by 15 percent and GOI has made arrangements to meet this
cost overrun. Despite the cost increase and the delay in implementation, the
economic rate of return for the project remains satisfactory.
Cr. No. 246  Seeds; US$7.5 Million Credit of May l4, 1971; Closing Date: September
30, 1977.-
This credit for the establishment of facilities for growing, processing
and distributing high yield varieties of rice and other seeds is behind schedule due
to delays in organizing management and the effective procurement. A Mbrch 1973
supervision mission reported that these constraints are being overcome, but due to
delays mentioned above and recent exchange rates adjustments, project costs are
likely to be considerably higher than appraisal report estimates. The effect of
this cost over-run is presently being evaluated.
Cr. No. 259 Tea; US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
This credit for the rehabilitation of two groups of Government owned
tea estates in West Java is progressing satisfactorily.

Financing Plan:
Total project cost is about US$15.4 million equivalent.
About US$7.8 million, or about 50 percent, would be
foreign exchange to be financed under the proposed IDA
credit. The Government would provide its share (US$
2.3 million) of project costs from budgetary resources.
Bank Rakyat Indonesia would provide US$3.9 million of
which about U4$3.1 million would be borrowed from Bank
Indonesia. US$1.4 million would be contributed by the
sub-borrowers,
Disbursement:            Disbursement would be spread over 8 years due to the
limited availability of VP planting material in the
early years of the project and the long gestation
period for investment for tea development.
Estimated Disbursements:

to be rehabilitated would be procured through
solicitation of at least three local quotations
while civil works, training facilities, PMT
office equipment and teaching aids would be
procured through local ccmpetitive bidding.
These procedures are appropriate because the
size of individual contracts would be small
and in some cases standardization would be
needed.
Consultants:                Suitably qualified and experienced executive assistants
and consultants would serve as Chief Advisor to the
Project Manager, Technical Development Officer, Factory
ConsultantL and Accounting Systems Specialist to the PMU.
