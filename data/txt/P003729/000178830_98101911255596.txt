SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Indonesian tea industry declined rapidly after World War II
particularly during the 1960's as a result of war disruptions, subsequent
neglect, and shortages of capital and technology. In 1960, 66,700 ha of
estates and 64,400 ha smallholdings produced about 83,000 tonq of tea. By
1970/71 only 56,000 ha of estate tea and 51,000 ha smallholder tea remained.
Production had fallen to about 59,000 tons despite a large potential
domestic market which could not be exploited because of shortages of supply
and deterioration of quality due to poor cultivation and processing practices.
Smallholders and private estates have suffered most from this decline.
Government estates are on the way to recovery as a result of Government
support and external financing, including an IDA credit (259-IND, September
1971) of US$15 million. By contrast, the private tea sector is still in
critical need of rehabilitation. The proposed project is designed to meet
this need.
ii.       Java, the site of the proposed project, encompasses 70% of
Indonesiats population and produces about 90% of Indonesia's tea output.
Three-fourths of the 80 million people on the island derive their income
from agriculture, and annual per capita GNP of the rural population is
about US$55 compared with a national average of US$77 at 1970 prices. Roughly
500,000 people including about 39,000 smallholder families depend for their
livelihood on private sector tea production. Net per capita income of a
typical smallholding with tea and other cash crops is about US$35.
iii.      Building on the success of Government tea estate rehabilitation,
partly financed by IDA credit 259-IND, the proposed project is designed to
reestablish the nucleus estate/smallholders relationship which worked
successfully before the decline of the industry, to help increase the
productivity of the private sector tea industry of West and Central Java
and, at the same time, strengthen the financial institutional framework
by actively involving the banking sector in tea rehabilitation.  About 7,700
smallholders and 30 estates are estimated to benefit from the project. The
project would be carried out over 8 years from 1973/74 through 1980/81.
Principal project components would be:
(a) credit through Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) to rehabilitate 10,000
ha of smallholder tea and 3,200 ha of estate tea, rehabilitate
5 black tea factories and construct 2 new black tea factories;
(b) training and expansion of a specialized tea extension service; and
(c)  establishment of a Project Management Unit (PMU) within the
Ministry of Agriculture to direct and administer the project.



- ii -
In addition, funds would be provided for overseas training, for staff
training in BRI, for a management study of BRI, for a market survey and
for diversification trials. Total project costs would be Rp 6.4 billion
(US$15.4 million), of which the proposed IDA Credit of US$7.8 million would
be about 50%, representing estimated foreign exchange requirements.
iv.       The project would be carried out by a Project Management Unit
PMU) within the Ministry of Agriculture. Since there is limited local
management and technical expertise to run the project, four internationally
recruited consultants would be employed by PMU during the initial years of
the project. Nevertheless, PMU would be headed by an Indonesian project
manager assisted by a chief project advisor. The other 3 consultants would
hold executive positions as technical development, accounting, and factory
consultants. Policy issues of PMU and budget approval would be referred to
a Project Management Board (PMB). BRI would be responsible for credit
distribution under the project for which it would receive US$6.5 of the
IDA credit, onlent by Bank Indonesia for a period of 20 years at 4% per
annum. Technical evaluation and supervision would be the responsibility of
the PMU, but financial appraisal, supervision, and bad debt risk would be
the responsibility of BRI. Coordination of these activities would be done
by PMU.
V.        The proposed prvJect would halt the rapid decline in private
sector tea production, and by 1985 would result in an increase of about
4,000 tons (20%) over present production levels. Assuming a 4% annual growth
in per capita domestic tea consumption, project production would not be
sufficient to maintain the present level of net export availability of
Indonesian tea. This rate of increase is about that achieved from 1939 to
1960 and Indonesian per capita consumption would still remain below the level
of other tea producing countries.
vi.       No viable alternative exists in West and Central Java for large
scale transfer of land use out of tea production. A small proportion of tea
land could be transferred to the production of other primary commodities
such as rubber or coffee. However, these alternative tree crops are less
labor intensive and, since they are dependent on the export market, face
market instability. Furthermore, such a crop shift would require major
investments in infrastructure and substantial income subsidies during the
long gestation period. Funds are provided for diversification trials to
study the possibilities of tea growers diversifying into alternative crops.
vii.      This is primarily a smallholder project.  Field development on
private estates accounts for only 24% of project area and is intended to
strengthen estates which will serve as nuclei for smallholder concentrations,
and to facilitate better utilization of the large land resources leased to
private estates. Factory investment would provide essential improvement
and expansfonn of the facilities available for smallholder leaf. At full
development the project would increase the net income from tea of the average
smal;ulder participating in the project from Rp 36,000 to Rp 117,000.
Total investment in field and factory rehabilitation indicates an economic
rate of return of 23%. Including the cost of the PMU, with its extension



- iii -
service, training facilities and technical assistance, the rate of return
on project investment would be 15% assuming a shadow rate of family labor
of Rp 60/day (70% of the going farm wage rate). Without shadow pricing the
rate of return would be 13%. The project would also result in significant
institutional improvements for the extension services, training facilities,
and BRI.
viii.     Procurement through international competitive bidding would
account for about 32% of project costs (US$3.5 million). Local competitive
bidding would be used for goods and services amounting to 20% (US$2.2 million)
of project costs, where the size of individual contracts is too small,
bulking of contracts is not possible, or compatibility with existing
installations is essential. Remaining project costs, consisting of operating
costs for PMU and nursery costs, would be unsuitable for competitive bidding.
ix.       IDA has extended 12 agricultural credits to Indonesia totalling
US$129.1 million. These credits comprise: four for the rehabilitation of
Government-owned estates, including 259-IND for tea estates; four for the
rehabilitation of irrigation systems; one for the multiplication of high-
yielding rice seed; one for fisheries development; one for livestock
development; and one for smallholder rubber and palm oil development.
X:.       With the assurances obtained from the Government the project is
suitable for an IDA Credit of US$7.8 million equivalent, comprising 50% of
total project costs.

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Smallbolders and private estates in West and Central Java produce
about 36% of Indonesia's tea crop, and the bulk of their production is sold
in the domestic market. Following many years of neglect, the productivity
of private sector tea gardens has declined drastically. Since 1960, tea
production from these sources has decreased by about 10% annually. The
Government of Indonesia has requested an IDA credit to finance a project
designed to improve the productivity of about 10,000 ha of smallholder tea
and 3,200 ha of private estate tea through rehabilitation and replanting,
and by improving and expanding black tea processing facilities.
1.02      Private sector tea production provides a livelihood for about half
a million people. Despite the importance of this sector, particularly for
Java, Government has not provided a significant degree of assistance for
many years, either in terms of technical advice or credit. The proposed
project is intended to reverse the trend in declining productivity by
providing technical advice, training, and financial assistance for the
purchase of inputs and equipment. This would be IDA's first rehabilitation
project for smallholder tea.
1.03      At the end of 1972 the Bank Group had committed US$44.5 million
for tea development in five countries: Indonesia, Kenya, Mauritius, Tanzania
and Uganda. With the exception of the Indonesian project these projects
were for the development of new tea land and aimed at supplying the inter-
national market.  By contrast, the project in Indonesia which is the subject
of this report would be for rehabilitation of smallholder tea and would aim
at slowing down the decline in private sector tea production. Not before
1983 would output from this sector exceed 1970/71 production. Thus,
production from the proposed project would enter the domestic market which,
in spite of its large potential, has not expanded in the past decade because
of supply shortages.
1.04      IDA has extended 12 agricultural credits to Indonesia totalling
US$129.1 million. These credits comprise: four for the rehabilitation of
Governulent-owned estates, including 259-IND for tea estates; four for the
rehabilitation of irrigation systems; and one each for: the multiplication
of high-yielding rice seed, fisheries development, livestock development,
smallholder rubber and palm oil development. Thus, the proposed project,
with its emphasis on smallholder development, reflects IDA's evolving agricul-
ture lending strategy in Indonesia moving from a focus on rehabilitation of
major irrigation systems and government estates to more diversified economic
and social objectives.

1.05      Due to unforeseen delays in project start-up and organizational
improvements (including recruitment of consultants), most projects are behind
schedule. Details on the performance of IDA-financed agriculture projects
are given in Annex 1.
1.00      The project was prepared for Government by the UK Commonwealth
Development Corporation and financed under Credit 259-IND. This appraisal
report is based on the findings of a mission which visited Indonesia in
Ltober/November 1972. The mission was composed of Messrs. Elz, Brown
(IDA), Janzen, Lushington and Moreithi (consultants).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Indonesia consists of five main islands and about 3,000 smaller
islands. The total population is about 120 million, increasing at an annual
rate of 2.3%. Over 90% of Indonesia's tea output is produced in West Java.
Java, the location of the proposed project, is the smallest of the five main
islands, having only 6.9% (130,000 km2) of the total land area. However,
about 70% of the population (80 million) inhabit this island, where the
population density is about 600 per km2, higher than in any other part of
Indonesia. Agriculture accounts for more than half of Java's income and
provides employment for about 75% of its labor force. Excluding Jakarta,
1970 per capita GNP is estimated at USS55 compared with a national average of
about US$77.
2.02      Tea is important for the densely populated area of Java.  The
private tea sector alone represents the main source of employment for about
500,000 people. It is one of the most labor intensive agricultural crops and
has the advantage that under the prevailing climatic conditions production
and income are spread fairly evenly over the year. Alternative agricultural
crops are limited because of geographic and climatic conditions, lack of
market stability and lower income potential. Although the export earning
capacity of tea declined since World War II, export income still amounted
to US$30 million in 1971. Further deterioration of the industry would
either divert tea from the export market to the domestic market thereby
reducing export earnings or lead to the substitution of tea by other drinks
wnich -nay have to be imported.
2.C       .n 1939, Indonesia was the third largest exporter of tea.  Since
then, tea area and yields have fallen drastically because of the war and
its aftermath and because of neglect and mismanagement (see Annexes 2 and
3).  Government, IDA and other foreign aid donors have recently provided
funds and zechnical assistance to government tea estates and this sector is
well on its way to recovery. The government acknowledges the importance of
priv.,-e sector tea production and accords high priority to its improvement.



- 3 -
However, very little of a practical nature has been done to initiate rehabili-
tation. Major constraints to development have been the lack of planning,
shortage of credit, antiquated processing facilities, ignorance of modern
production methods among tea growers, and closely related to this, the absence
of an effective extension service. The proposed project is designed to help
remove these constraints.
B. Indonesia's Tea Economy
2.04      Production.  Total production in 1939 amounted to nearly 90,000
tons of which 70,000 tons were produced by estates which at that time were
mainly in private ownership. During the Japanese occupation large areas of
estate tea were uprooted and planted to food crops. Post war confrontation
with the Dutch, nationalization of foreign property and subsequent lack of
funds and technical resources resulted in further declines in production. In
1970/71 only about 59,000 tons of tea were produced, on 52,000 ha of estates
and 51,000 ha of smallholdings. About 64% of Indonesia's tea production
in 1970 was grown by government-owned estates. Private estates produced
about 11% of total output and smallholders the balance of 25%.
2.05      Government estate tea leaf is processed exclusively into black
tea and is sold primarily for export. With the gradual deterioration of
processing facilities the production of many private estates has shifted
into green tea, although the majority of factories continue to produce an
inferior quality black tea. (The differences between black and green tea
manufacture are explained in Annex 3.) In recent years, smallholders have
been forced to process a large quantity of their own leaf in small, crude
green tea factories, of which there are now several hundred in West Java.
In total, about 30% of Indonesia's tea production is in the form of green
tea. While this product is preferred by some segments of the West Java
population, it has limited market growth potential. Major expansion of the
domestic market will occur with the promotion and distribution of good quality
black tea.
2.06      Tea Smallholders.  Smallholders account for 14,900 tons or 25%
of production (1971). Only about 1,200 tons of this is converted to black
tea. Smallholder tea was established prior to World War II when estates
provided planting material and fertilizer on credit, recovering payments
by deduction from the value of green leaf supplied to estate factories for
processing. The smallholders also profited by technical assistance supplied
by the estates. Vital links between the two sectors were lost during the
war and smallholders were cut off almost entirely from credit, technical
assistance, and buyers for their leaf. Cultivation practices deteriorated,
intercropping appeared and smallholders turned increasingly to green leaf
manufacture which could be done on a small scale and was less demanding of
leaf quality. In 1970/71 there were about 39,000 registered smallholders
with 51,000 ha of tea in Java compared with about 75,000 ha pre-war. How-
ever, only 26,500 ha, cultivated by 21,000 tea growers, with an average tea



-4-
bush density of 60% or more, can be classified as suitable for rehabilitation.
The average size of a smallholding in a representative area (Garut/Tasikmalaya)
is 1.8 ha with 1.1 ha of tea. Paddy and cassava are the principal subsis-
tence crops grown on the remaining area. Tea yields are low, varying from
210 kg/ha for tea bush stands below 40% to 480 kg/ha for average densities
of 602.  Full stands of replanted tea have a yield potential of at least
4,600 kg/ha.  Further details are in Annex 3.
2.07      Net annual farm incomes average about Rp 84,000 (US$202) per family
of 6.  This is totally inadequate to finance rehabilitation, considering the
degraded state of tea gardens and the long gestation period of this crop.
Replanting in most cases requires taking land out of production for 2 years
to eradicate root and other soil diseases prevalent in the project area,
before the normal 3 year planting and gestation period. Thus, any program
to improve smallholder tea production must combine technical support with
sufficient financial assistance to prevent declines in incomes during rehab-
ilitation.
2.08      Private Tea Estates.  There are about 11,000 ha in tea production
on 53 private estates in West Java and about 1,900 ha on 6 estates in
Central Java. They produce about 6,200 tons of which nearly 50% is green
tea (see Annex 3). While these estates are privately-owned corporate entities,
their lands are leased from Government for 30 years. Leases are renewable
for a further 25 years subject to verification that the estate is well
managed.
2.09      The deterioration in tea husbandry on many private estates is
severe. Resources are too limited for comprehensive recovery. There is a
need for credit for rehabilitation of fields, buildings, transport and
factories, to turn these estates into efficient units and enable them to
reestablish their close ties with surrounding smallholders. However, only
medium-term investment credit (5 years) is presently available to estates
at a minimum interest rate of 12%. These terms are not suitable for tea
rehabilitation investments.
2.10      Extension Service.  Provincial governors are responsible for the
administration of the smallholder extension service, but financial and
technical matters are directed by the Central Government through the Minis-
tries of Finance and Agriculture (Directorate of Estates). Annex 4 illus-
trates the organization of the Agricultural Services. The smallholder
field extension service employs 112 permanent staff in the 15 regencies
(Kabupatens) of West Java. In the six regencies where tea is grown, there
are 43 junior instructors with some training in tea culture. This number
provides only 1 instructor per 900 tea growers. This ratio and the training
of the staff are insufficient to provide adequate assistance to farmers on tea
cultivation and rehabilitatio1i.
2.11      Private estates come under the Inspectorate of Estates of the
Directorate of Estates in the Ministry of Agriculture.  Although the
Inspectorate of Estates is responsible for the provision of technical



-5-
advisory services, staff shortages have made this impossible and the major
activity of the Inspectorate has become the collection of statistics. There
are two private organizations whose aim is to assist private estates with
technical advice: the Estates Syndicate and the Indonesia Development Corpora-
tion. Both lack the staff and resources to provide adequate technical ex-
pertise.
C. Future Development
2.12      Failure to arrest the decline of the private sector tea industry
would have serious economic and social consequences for the tea growing
regions living standards will decline by neglecting tea rehabilitation; and
there is a danger that at least the smallholder sector would ceas- to play
an important role in the tea economy. Unless measures are taken to prevent it,
an increasing share of Government tea production, most of which is now exnorted,
would be diverted into the domestic market thereby reducing export earnings.
Alternatively, domestic consumption would be further reduced affecting parti-
cicularly the lower income groups since tea is the cheapest beverage available
in Indonesia. Government recognizes the need for such action and affords it
high priority. To date# however, it has been unable to take any action and
has turned to IDA for assistance for the proposed project. It should also
be noted that the production of alternative crops is limited by climatic and
geographic factors. Those crops that can presently be grown are less labor
intensive, face market restrictions and are economically less attractive than
tea. However, in view of the world tea market situation described in para
7.03 and the fact that large areas of tea are gradually going out of production
it is necessary to explore the possibilities to grow alternative crops on tea
land in West Java. The proposed project provides funds for diversification
trials.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
3.01      Location and Conditions.  The smallholder component and most of
the private estate component of the project would be in West Java within a
radius of about 100 km of Bandung, the West Java capital. The smallholder
field development would be concentrated in the three areas of the province
which have the highest density of smallholdings, namely Tasikmalaya/Garut,
Bandung/Purwakarta and Sukabumi/Cianjur (see map). Six private estates
which would be considered for rehabilitation are in Central Java within a
radius of 100 km from Jogjakarta, the capital. Climatic conditions in
these areas are very favorable for tea cultivation. Soils throughout the
areas are also suitable. Most of the crop is grown at altitudes below
700 meters, and there exists a ready domestic market for the resulting type
of low and medium grown tea. Ph values tend to be slightly high for tea,
averaging about 6.0, but these can be reduced by appropriate fertilizer
application.



- 6 -
3.02      Communications.  All main towns in the tea growing areas are
served by good rail links with Jakarta and the ports of Tandjong Priok and
Tjirebon. There is a reasonable network of roads and most are all-weather
surfaced. Surface conditions would, however, be greatly improved by regular
maintenance, and assurances were obtained from Government during nego-
tiations that satisfactory maintenance would be undertaken. A list of the
roads serving the tea region is in Annex 16.
j.03      Population and Labor.  The total population of the six main tea
growing regions - Sukabumi, Cianjur, Bandung, Purwakarta, Garut and
Tasikmalaya-is about 7.5 million and of this, some 5 million (66%) are
dependent on agricultural production. Project labor could be supplied from
the dense population of West Java. There may be some isolated areas where
temporary shortages would occur but these could be alleviated to a large
extent by the more efficient use of the existing labor force and the use of
agricultural chemicals to reduce the need for field maintenance labor.
3.04      Credit Facilities.  Smallholders do not have access to any insti-
tutional credit to finance their tea production. Short-term credit is often
extended by tea buyers or private money lenders, but interest rates are
high and the borrower is frequently obliged to commit his future leaf
production to the lender. Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), the designated bank
for smallholder credit, has to date allocated much of its limited resources
to the growing credit requirements of the Bimas Rice Intensification
Program, which is restricted to the production of paddy and its rotation
crops. Credit for the production of tea on private estates is available,
principally from Bank Bumi Daya. However, estates have only taken working
capital loans because the 5 years maximum term for investment credit is
prohibitive for rehabilitation in view of the deteriorated state of tea
gardens and the long gestation period of replanted tea. At present, state
banks, including BRI, do not extend long-term credit.
3.05      Land Tenure.  The Basic Agrarian Law of 1960 provides that all
smallholder land be state-controlled, although not state-owned. It requires
the registration of smallholdings and the issuance of titles thereto. In
some cases the lease entitlements of estates are not clear, because of
previous nationalization and later transfer to new owners. Assurances were
obtained from Government during negotiations that estates participation
in the project would be limited to those owned by Indonesian-based legal
entities, free of title disputes, and holding concessions which cover at least
the credit repayment period, or that would be extended to cover this period.
3.06      Processing.  Except for the factories of government estates, all
processing facilities are privately owned. Most are located on estates
and at one time were processing both estate and smallholder leaf. The
majority of factories are antiquated and in need of repair. In two areas
(Garut and Purwakarta) capacity is insufficient to cope with present pro-
duction. The proposed project provides for the construction of one new
factor? in each area.



IV.  THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project is designed to increase the productivity of the private
sector tea industry in West and Central Java, thereby enabling it to meet
the demand of an expanding domestic market. This would be achieved by the
provision of credit and technical assistance for the rehabilitation of small-
holder and private estate tea gardens and through the modernization and
expansion of black tea processing facilities. To support this effort, a
specialized extension service would be instituted to advise growers on modern
methods of tea cultivation; tea nurseries would be established to ensure the
availability of high quality planting material; and training facilities and
programs would be developed at tea research stations to train both extension
officers and tea growers. Growers would be free to sell leaf to both black
and green tea processors, but onlv black tea factories would be financed under
the project since the expected increases in the future demand will be con-
centrated on black tea. The size of the project is limited principally by
the availability of proven planting material and by the number and capacity
of staff to organize and administer the rehabilitation. In West Java, 3
project areas have been selected (see Map), and in Central Java, 6 estates
would be considered for project participation. Project output would be well
within domestic market requirements.
4.02      The project would be carried out over eight years, 1973/74 through
1980/81. Principal project components would be:
(a)  Provision of credit through BRI for:
(i)  rehabilitation of 10,000 ha smallholder tea
including 3,500 ha of replanting (involving about
7,700 smallholders);
(ii) rehabilitation of 3,200 ha private estates tea
including 2,000 ha of replanting or replacement
planting;
(iii) rehabilitation of 5 private estate black tea factories;
(iv) construction of 2 new black tea factories for small-
holder leaf.
(b)  Training and expansion of a specialized tea extension
service within the Ministry of Agriculture for all tea
growers in West and Central Java.
(c)  Establishment of a Project Management Unit (PMU) within
the Ministry of Agriculture to:



- 8 -
(i)  direct and administer the extension service;
(ii)  coordinate and conduct training of extension officers
and tea growers;
(iii)  operate nurseries;
(iv)  develop and supervise the technical aspects of the
smallholder and estates field rehabilitation program;
(v)  advise on and approve the construction and rehabilitation
of factories.
(d) Provision of funds for:
(i) a survey of the domestic tea market;
(ii)  overseas travel of PMU staff to study other tea
growing regions;
(iii) staff training to assist BRI in project execution;
(iv)  a management study of BRI; and
(v)  diversification trials to study the possibilities of
tea growers diversifying into alternative crops.
B. Detailed Features
4.03      Field Rehabilitation.  The field rehabilitation program would
consist of the improvement of existing bushes through the application of
fertilizers, pesticides, and better management, and the replanting of
suitable areas too run down for bush rehabilitation. Root disease is
widespread in the project area and its presence in most plots to be replanted
would require that the land be left fallow for 2 years after the old bushes
were uprooted. The PMU would select smallholders and private estates
for project participation in accordance with criteria presented in Annex 5.
Estates with unused lands suitable for tea cultivation could engage in
replacement planting whereby new areas would be planted while less suitable
areas were simultaneously phased out of production. Before being considered
for the project, estates would be required to present a rehabilitation program
to the PMU for approval. All field rehabilitation under the project would
be phased in accordance with the projected availability of proven planting
material and to permit the requisite build-up of the extension service.
Replanting and tea improvement would start in 1973/74 and be finished in
1978/79 in line with the following schedule:

Priority would be given to smallholders in the allocation of planting
naterial in the early stages of the project.  The density of bushes in the
replanted area would be 13,500/ha, the optimum density established by
research evidence. Further details of the proposed field rehabilitation
program are presented in Annex 6.
4.04      Factories.  Provision is made for the rehabilitation of 5 private
estate black tea factories in the project area to increase their capacity
to process their own and smallholder leaf, and to improve the quality of
tea output (see Annex 7). Rehabilitated factories would be owned and managed
by their present estate owners. During the selection of factories to par-
ticipate in the project, the PMU may identify specific managerial weaknesses.
In such cases it would be a condition of sub-loan approval that competent
factory management be recruited by the estate, either on a staff or consult-
ing basis. Although factories were tentatively selected by the appraisal
mission, the PMU would be responsible for final selection. Two new factories
would also be constructed in areas where there is insufficient processing
capacity. It is proposed that PT XII or XIII 1/ own and manage the factories.
However, provision would be made for smallholder cooperative ownership
of the two new factories at a later date through provision of funds for share
purchase from a cess. The price to be paid for green leaf supplied to all
project factories would be based on a formula which was discussed and agreed
upon during negotiations. Provision for all factories includes staff housing
and vehicles to implement a leaf collection service. To ensure full utiliza-
tion of existing and future factory capacity, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the Ministry of Industry, which grants licenses for new
factory construction, would operate on the advice of the PMU or its successor
regarding suitability of the location and size of all future tea factory
proposals for West and Central Java.

4.05      Training.  The training of both extension officers and tea growers
would be conducted at the Bogor Research Center and the new tea research
station to be established at Gambung (see Annex 8). Additional dormitories,
staff housing, classroom facilities, and teaching aids would be provided
under the project to accommodate this training program.
11.06     Extension Service.  The Ministry of Agriculture has insufficient
experienced staff to provide a satisfactory extension service for tea
growers. Under the project, the Ministry would recruit or second additional
staff to the PMU to provide about 125 full time tea extension officers. This
number would be sufficient to provide one officer for each 100 smallholders
within the project and one for each 500 outside the project. Assurances
to this effect were obtained during negotiations. PMU staff would also
provide technical assistance to estates. Sufficient vehicles and equipment
would be provided to enable PMU staff to serve farmers within and beyond
the project.
4.07      Organization.  The project would be carried out by a Project
Management Unit (PMU) to be established in the Ministry of Agriculture and
located in Bandung. The unit would enjoy adequate managerial autonomy and
financial flexibility and be headed by a manager responsible to a Project
Management Board (PMB) in Jakarta. The Chairman of the Board would be the
Director General of Estates in the Ministry of Agriculture. The Project
Manager would be assisted by an internationally recruited Chief Project
Advisor, and three other internationally recruited executive consultants
who would fill the positions of Accounting Systems Specialist, Technical
Development Officer and Factory Consultant. Details of the organization
and responsibilities of the PNU and the PMB are in Annex 9. Conditions of
effectiveness include: that the PMB, with members appointed, has been
established with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, that the PMU has
been established, and that the Project Manager has taken up his duties.
Appointments of the internationally recruited executive assistants would
be subject to IDA's approval and would also, with the exception of the Factory
Consultant, constitute a condition of effectiveness.
4.08      Nurseries.  Replanting and replacement planting under the project
would mainly be done with proven VP 1/ planting material. The VP material
presently available allows only modest replanting in the early stages of
the Droject. Some high-yielding seed material would therefore be used
(ffr not more than 150 ha) to prevent delays in the planting program. About
4 ha nursery plots would be established in 1973 to provide plants for 10 ha
of multiplication plots and 100 ha smallholder replanting in 1974. Nurseries
would be extended gradually to about 15 ha. The annual output of these
nurseries would be about 6 million usable plants by 1975/76.  To increase
annual plantings to 2,350 he for the last 2 years of the project, it is
recommended that selected tea growers be encouraged to establish a total of
about 45 ha of private nurseries. Assurances were obtained accordingly at
i!1 Vegetative propagation; rooted cuttings grown in polythene bags.

negotiations. Until 1976/77 part of the leaf cuttings for nurseries would
have to be supplied from outside the project. These supplies can be obtained
from the Research Institute for Estate Crops (RIEC) and PTP's XII and XIII.
In order not to delay the planting program, Government has already started
the establishment of nurseries, appointed nursery managers, and signed
contracts for the purchase of VP cuttings and seeds. As soon as the PMU is
established, it would assume the management of nurseries and multiplication
plots and would provide technical assistance to private nurseries. Annex 10
gives details of the nursery program.
4.09      Diversification Trials.  A large area of smallholder and private
estate tea outside the project has deteriorated too much to be suitable for
rehabilitation through better management and cultivation practices. Large
scale replanting would be the only means to turn these areas into economically
viable tea gardens. This is not contemplated in output projections in
Annex 3. In view of the world market situation for tea and the fact that
production expansion beyond that projected would likely enter the world market,
diversification out of tea should be considered. Presently few suitable
alternative crops are known. Funds are provided under the project for consul-
tant services and diversification trials at the Bogor research institute and
its outstations.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
5.01      Project costs from 1973/74 through 1980/81 are estimated to total
Rp 6.4 billion (US$15.4 million) of which about Rp 3.2 billion (US$7.8
million) or 50% of project costs would be foreign exchange. Project costs
are detailed in Annex 11, Tables 1 to 6 and summarized in the following table:

Costs are based on recent experience in Indonesia, particularly costs exper-
ienced under the Tea Estates Project (Credit No. 259-IND). Field develop-
ment costs have been calculated on the basis of 100% of land clearing costs
plus the cost incurred during the first 3 years for all replanted or planted
areas, and the incremental costs incurred during the first 3 years for re-
habil:tated areas.  A price contingency of 5% compounded annually has been
appliJe to all project costs except for the foreign exchange of factory
mac'..inery where a price contingency of 8% compounded has been applied.
This is in line with price increases experienced for the past 3 years. A



- 13 -
5% physical contingency has beaen included in all factory subprojects. No
physical contingency has been provided for field development, the PMU or
technical assistance. Investments by PMU and technical assistance expendi-
tures would be affected only by inflationary factors, while adjustment in
the area covered would be made to allow for under-estimation of physical
quantities in fleld development.
5.02      It is too early to trace the full effect of the recent (February 13)
US dollar devaluation on project foreign exchange costs. In terms of the US
dollar the value of the Indonesian rupiah did not change. However, imports
under the project would include factory equipment, vehicles and fertilizer
and at the time of appraisal most of these were being imported from the
UK, Holland, Japan and Germany. Except for the UK, currencies of the other
countries have appreciated in terms of the US dollar. Unless the import
supply structure changes, a rise in prices can be expected. To allow fully
for such eventuality, foreign exchange costs for the project have been
raised by 10%. (This margin has been added to price contingencies.) Small-
holder field development would account for 23% of project costs; estate
field development, 13%; factory rehabilitation and construction of new
factories 18%; the Project Management Unit, including training, extension
and nurseries, 16%; technical assistance, 3%; and contingency, 27%. The
two principal foreign exchange components are fertilizer and pesticides,
(US$2.4 million); and factory machinery, (US$1.5 million).
B. financing Arrangements
5.03      It is proposed that an IDA credit of Rp 3.2 billion (US$7.8 million
equal to 50% of project costs) be extended to the Government of Indonesia.
Government's direct contribution to project costs would be Rp 949 million
(US$2.3 million equal to 15% of project costs) to meet the local costs of
the PMU and technical assistance. Gross contribution by BRI would be Rp 1.6
billion (US$3.9 million equal to 26% of project costs). This gross BRI
contribution would consist of 20% deposit funds and 80% borrowing from Bank
Indonesia in accordance with the standard Investment Credlt Formula. Net
BRI contribution would therefore be Rp 327 million (US$788,800) or 5% of
project cost and total Government contribution would be Rp 2.3 billion
(US$5.4 million) or 35% of project costs. Sub-borrowers under the project
would contribute US$1.4 million or 9% of project costs. In summary the
project would be financed as follows:

5.04      IDA's share of costs incurred by the PMU, including the marketing
study, overseas training, project assistance in BRI and diversification
trials, would be allotted to the Ministry of Agriculture and funds would be
made available directly to the PMU. The balance of the IDA credit, for
field and factory development and the BRI Management Study, would be chan-
nelled through Bank Indonesia (The Central Bank). Funds for Field and
Factory Development would be onlent by Bank Indonesia to BRI. It is
a condition of Credit effectiveness that a Subsidiary Loan Agreement accepta-
ble to IDA had been executed between Government and BRI. Discussions during
negotiations indicated that the onlending rate to BRI would be 4% per annum.
These funds, together with BRI's contribution would be extended to sub-bor-
rowers at 12% in compliance with the present Government policy on agricul-
tural lending. Twenty-five percent of estate incremental labor costs, the
cost of the estate development plan and 15% of estate field equipment would
be borne by estates. Estates would also contribute 25% of the factory reha-
bilitation costs and the owners of the 2 new factories would contribute 35%
of the costs of these factories as equity. The remaining estate incremental
labor costs and all smallholder incremental hired labor costs would be
financed by credit at 12% interest from BRI.  Smallholder contribution to
the project would take the form of incremental family labor. The Government
would meet its share of project costs for PMU expenditures from budgetary
resources. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government
would ensure the timely availability of sufficient liquid funds to PMU for
the execution of its responsibilities under the project. Bank Indonesia
would contract for the management study of BRI, and the PMU for the marketing
study.
5.05      The projections shown in Annex 14 Table 2 indicate that revenue
earned by the PMU, from the sale of planting material would amount to about
Rp 275 million over the 8 year project period. While these revenues would
not accrue directly to the PHU, they would reduce the net contribution of
Government to Rp 674 million (US$1.6 million).
C. Procurement
5.06      Fertilizers, pesticides, machinery for new factories, and vehicles,
amounting to Rp 1.5 billion (11S$3.5 million), equal to 32% of project costs,
would be procured under international competitive bidding in accordance with
IDA Guidelines. International competitive bidding would not be practical
for the procurement of machinery and equipment for factory rehabilitation.
For this category, compatibility of the new goods with existing installations
would be essential. The five factories are separately owned, would be
rehabilitated over a three-year period, and would each require a different
mlx of machinery and equipment items, making each contract small and bulking
impracticable. For this category, amounting to about RD 469 million (US$1.1
million equal to 10% of project costs), prudent shopping would be acceptable,
including the solicitation of at least three local quotations, except in cases
where standardization requires the specification of a particular make. Civil
works for factories and training facilities, and office equipment and teaching



- 16 -
aids for the PMU, amounting to about Rp 359 million (US$0.9 million) equal to
3% of project costs, would be procured under local competitive bidding, since
the size of individual contracts would be too small to attract international
bidding, and bulking of contracts is not practicable. PMU would conduct
tendering for fertilizer and pesticides, and would review and approve tenders
or factory machinery and civil works, to be conducted by owners with the
sc <stance of their appointed consultants. For purposes of bid comparison,
ereference of 15% or the actual duty rate, whichever is less, would be afforded
co qualified domestic manufacturers. Estates would be individually responsible
or housing construction (US$200,000), under cost guidelines specified by
3BR!  and the PMU would make its own arrangements for land preparation and
civil works pertaining to the nurseries (US$.01 million).  The appointment
of consultant engineers for factory design and supervision, the Chief Project
Advisor and executive assistants for the PMU, the Financial Advisor for
BRI, and consultants for the market and diversification studies and the BRI
management study (US$.9 million), would be subject to IDA approval, and would
be made on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.
5.07      For the distribution of fertilizer and pesticides, the PMU would
conduct tendering among local distributors based on:
(a) delivery by the bidder to specified field locations
in accordanc:e with anticipated local requirements; and
kb) adequate field staff and depots of the bidder to ensure
effective administration of material sales and distri-
bution.
5.08      For all goods to be financed in whole or in part by IDA, assurances
were obtained that:
(a) draft tender documents for all contracts exceeding US$50,000
would be submitted to IDA for approval as would bid analysis
and selection before award; and
(b) for factory-related tenders, consultants would assist
in the preparation of tender documents and specifications,
(see Annex 7).
D. Disbursements
5.k" 9    Disbursement of the IDA credit would be as follows:



- 17 -
Category                       US$'000         %
I.   Fertilizer and Pesticides
and field equipment                 2,400         31
II.   Factory Equipment and Vehicles        1,600          21
III.   Factory and PMU Civil Works             295           4
IV.   PMU expenditure for office,

V.   Consultant's services and tech-
nical assistance                    1,160         15
VI.   Unallocated                           2,270          28
Total                 7,800         100
Estimated disbursements by category are detailed in Annex 12, Tables 1 and 2.
For fertilizer and pesticides, IDA would reimburse Bank Indonesia for 85% of
the cost (the foreign exchange component) of materials delivered to sub-bor-
rowers. For machinery, equipment and vehicles, reimbursement would be made
to BRI against c.i.f. documents (100%) or in the case of locally procured
goods, 95% of ex-factory cost or 83% of off-the-shelf cost. 35% of the cost
of completed civil works would be disbursed against acceptable documents,
and 100% of the foreign exchange costs of technical assistance would be dis-
bursed quarterly against invoice from the PMU, or from Bank Indonesia in the
case of the BRI management study. Any surplus funds would be used for addi-
tional credit to smallholders for field rehabilitation.
E. Accounts and Audit
5.10      Assurances were obtained from Government during negotiations
that separate accounts would be kept by the PMU, and that, within the limits
of government requirements, such accounts would be established in accordance
with the recommendations of the PMU Accounting Systems Advisor. Assurances
were also obtained that an independent auditor satisfactory to IDA would
be employed to audit the accounts, that the form of audit would be agreed
with IDA, and that such audited accounts would be made available to IDA
within 4 months of the close of each financial year.
5.11      BRI is also required to maintain separate project accounts.
These records would be established in accordance with the recommendations
of the Financial Advisor, and quarterly summaries would be forwarded to IDA
and the PMU. Both the accounts and the summary would show receipts from IDA
and other sources separately, and disbursements separately according to small-
holder and estate field development, estate factory development, and new
factory construction. BRI would require the maintenance of proper, separate



- 18 -
records by estate and factory sub-borrowers, to be audited by independent
auditors approved by BRI. BRI accounts are audited by an independent firm.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that audited annual state-
ments of BRI project accounts would be forwarded to IDA within 4 months of
the fiscal year end, together with the auditor's certification that disburse-
ments had been made in accordance with terms and conditions of the onlending
agreement.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Management Unit
6.01      Or anization.  A Project Management Unit (PMU) would be established
in the Ministry of Agriculture. Details of its organization, its responsibili-
ties, and staffing are in Annex 9. The Unit would be headquartered at Bandung,
and have 1 field office in each of the 3 project areas. The unit would enjoy
an adequate measure of managerial and financial autonomy and be headed by a
general manager responsible to a Project Management Board (PMB). The chairman
of the board would be the Director General of Estates, and he would report
directly to the Minister of Agriculture. The Director of Smallholder Estates
would be a member, as would one senior representative of each: the Estates
Syndicate, the National Planning Agency (Bappenas), the Ministries of Finance
and Interior, BRI and other parties appointed by the Minister of Agriculture on
the basis of their background and ability to contribute to the development
of the private sector tea industry. The PMB would be charged with a review
of PMU policy decisions ensuring that the interests of all affected parties
were considered in PMU decisions, and that duplication of efforts among insti-
tutions concerned with tea development was avoided. The PMB would be respon-
sible for submission of the PMU's budget to the Ministry of Agriculture.
Approval of the initial budget 1. a condition of effectiveness. To facili-
tate project implementation, and to coordinate field activities, Advisory
Committees would be established at the Kabupaten (regency) and Kecamatan
(county) levels. Their membership would include members of the smallholder
extension service as well as representatives of private estates organizations.
This system of committees is similar to that now used in the Bimas Rice In-
tensification Program and has been found to be an effective vehicle for local
administration.
6.02      Staff Salaries.  The present schedule of civil service salaries
would be inadequate to meet the living costs of staff of the PMU. Since
staff requirements for the PMU have been based on full-time employment in
the assigned activities, effective project implementation would be contingent
upon the provision of higher salaries than those now offered for similar
positions elsewhere in the Ministry of Agriculture. A salary scale similar
to that of Government estates staff with similar experience is proposed.
Assurance of higher salaries were obtained from Government at negotiations.



- 19 -
6.03      Extension Service.  The unique problems of tea cultivation, and
the great number of tea growers, dictate the need for a specialized cadre of
extension officers advising solely on tea production. The proposed extension
service is based on about 125 Junior Tea Officers each responsible for advising
approximately 100 project tea growers or 500 growers not participating in the
project. Direction and specialist advice would be provided by Senior and
Junior Tea Officers. The composition of the extension service is indicated
in Annex 9, Table 1. To increase the exposure of growers to good husbandry
practices, the extension service would promote the establishment of demonstra-
tion plots and farmers' groups which could serve as regular forums for the
dissemination of technical and marketing information.
6.04      Nurseries.  One PMU nursery would be established by the PMU in each
project area, each consisting of 5 ha of nursery plots and about 3-1/2 ha
of multiplication plots. Each nursery would have its own manager, but the
sale of planting material would be directed by the PMU in accordance with
the field rehabilitation program of the project. Private growers would
receive technical assistance from the PMU to establizh about 45 ha of nursery
plots in the last two years of the project.
6.05      Training_.  Training facilities at the Bogor Research Station (RIEC)
would be expanded and qualified staff engaged to provide the following program:
(a) 1 month training for Junior Tea Officers; (b) 1 month training for Senior
Tea Officers; (c) 2 week training for selected tea growers; (d) 1 week re-
fresher courses, annually, for Junior and Senior Tea Officers. Part of the
training program would also be carried out at Gambung after the establishment of
the research center. In addition, as part of technical assistance under the
project, 10 senior officers of the extension service would be sent abroad for
2 months of training and observation in other tea producing countries. Train-
ing for Mantris (Village Unit Managers) and Peniliks (County Inspectors) of
BRI would be conducted in Bandung under the direction of the Financial Ad-
visor, and at the Bogor Research Station, in cooperation with the PMUk
6.06      Consultants.  To assist the PMU in project execution, and to advise
and train counterpart staff, several experts would be internationally
recruited.
-    Chief Project Advisor, for 4 years;
-    Accounting Systems Specialist, for the first year
of the project;
-    Technical Development Specialist, for 4 years; and
-    Factory Consultant, for 3 years beginning in the second
year of the project.
A Financial Adviser would also be appointed to assist BRI in project execution,
and consultants would design and supervise factory construction and rehabili-
tation.



- 20 -
6.07      Project Performance.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the PMU would conduct an annual review of project performance, and
submit to IDA, within 4 months of the fiscal year end, a performance report
summarizing achievements during the period. Draft terms of reference appear
in Annex 9 Appendix 1.
B. Bank Rakyat Indonesia
6.08      Description.  Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) is one of the largest
of the 5 state-owned banks in Indonesia. Although more than 50% of its
business volume is ordinary commercial banking, BRI's credit is extended
principally to smallholders and small rural industry. Through a network
of Village Units and Mobile Units, BLU is able to provide good coverage of
rural West and Central Java, including the project area. It is through
these units that credit for the entire Bimas Rice Intensification Program
and its affiliated programs is being channelled. This arrangement has
proven effective for broad credit distribution, and only about 20% of
receivables under the present scheme are in arrears. There remains, however,
a need for better loan appraisal and supervision. Under the proposed tea
project, Mantris (Village Unit Managers) and Peniliks (County Inspectors)
would receive special training in the appraisal and supervision of tea
loans.
6.09      Credit Distribution to Smallholders.  Credit to smallholders would
be principally in the form of input supplies although there would be cash
credits to meet the cost of incremental hired labour. Application for a
project loan would include input specifications prepared by a Junior Tea
Officer, and his verification that the applicant demonstrates the good
husbandry practices required for project participation. Upon satisfactory
credit check by BRI and establishment of the applicant's right to cultivate
the specified plots, BRI would issue supply certificates to be surrendered
to the specified supplier. This system is similar to that presently used
under Bimas. Cash credits would be disbursed monthly in accordance with
the approved schedule of labor requirements provided by the tea officer at
the time of application. Borrowers' operations would be inspected regularly
by the extension service.  BRI would seek annual confirmation from the
extension service, in writing, of satisfactory performance by the borrower.
Details are in Annex 13. Any default of interest payment during the 5 year
grace period would result in BRI's withholding any further credit.
6.10      Credit Distribution to Estates.  Estates wishing to participate
in the project would submit a development plan to the PMU for approval.
Assistance in technical aspects would be provided by the PMU. After a satis-
factory plan had been worked out, application would be made to BRI, which
would then conduct a financial and managerial appraisal of the applicant.
Supply certificates would be issued for fertilizers and pesticides. Disburse-
ment for other inputs would be made by BRI against invoices and pay receipts
for authorized expenditures within the development plan. In the case of
factory rehabilitation, compliance with contract terms and conditions would
be a condition of payment. In respect of all field development loans, BRI
would seek semi-annual confirmation in writing from the PMU, that performance



- 21 -
of individual borrowers had been in accordance with borrower obligations
under the development plan and sub-loan agreement.
6.11      Credit for New Factories.  For new factory construction, BRI
would disburse against invoice for work conducted in accordance with contract
terms and conditions. Adequate arrangements for supervision and inspection
by appointed consultants would be a key element of construction and instal-
lation contracts, and factory owners would be expected to conduct the
majority of their operational banking with BRI for the duration of the
repayment period.
6.12      Technical Assistance.  BRI is the most suitable credit channel for
the proposed project. However, some technical assistance would be required
to ensure satisfactory project execution. Under the project, an internation-
ally recruited Financial Advisor would be appointed for a period of 18 months
to assist BRI in the implementation of an effective project accounting system
and to advise operating staff on the appraisal and supervision of project
sub-loans. BRI staff would also receive an orientation in tea cultivation
and marketing under the project's training program (para 6.05). In addition
to project assistance, there is a need for a comprehensive study of BRI's
medium- and long-term loan organization and management. The objective of
the proposed study would be to identify the most suitable means of
strengthening BRI's capacity to extend medium- and long-term credit in
rural areas and assistance in the implementation thereof.
VII.  YIELDS, PRODUCTION, MARKETTNG, PRICES MTD FTYTANCIAL RE8snTS
A. Yields and Production
7.01      Present yield and production data were established by the CDC
mission in its project identification report which included a survey of 540
smallholders in the main tea growing areas and of the 59 private estates in
West and Central Java.  Yield projections have been based on experience tn
the project area, particularly yields achieved by PT's XII and XIII which
are now in the process of rehabilitation. It was assumed that the production
potential of established smallholder and private estate tea would be 1,100
kg/ha and 1,200 kg/ha respectively with full stands and good management.
Hlowever, project estimates have been adjusted to reflect thle prevalence of
stand densities of less than 100%. Smallholder yields are projected to
increase to 730 kg/ha and estate yields to 900 kg/ha. For replanted or newly
planted VP material, yields were projected to increase to 1,600 kg/ha for
srallholders and 1,700 kg/ha for estates.
7.02      The production generated by the project would be about 2,000 tons
in 1980/81 and about 9,000 tons in 1985/86. Total production from small-
holders and private estates would decline from 21,100 tons in 1972/73 to



- 22 -
19,S00 tons in 1980/81 because the increase in project output would be
insufficient to compensate for the decline in production on the non-rehabi-
itated area.  Fror 1980/81 to 1985/86 total production from smallholders
and private estates would increase by 6,800 tons, resulting in a net
increase of 4,200 tons over present production.  Further details are in
Annex 3, Table 5, and Annex 6, Tables 3 and 4.
B. Marketing
7.03      Project tea would be sold in the domestic market.  In spite of a
larg,e demand potential, local consumption has declined during the 1960's because
of a supply shortage as indicated in Annex 3.  Present per capita consulmntion
is about 160 grarm/year compared with about 500 grams in 1960. The greatest
potential for expanded domestic consumption lies in the marketing of blac!
tea.  Green tea is preferred by some sections in the rural areas of West and
Central Java and accounts for about 70%, of total domestic tea consumption.
It has, however, limited growth potential and the major expansion in consume-
tion will be concentrated on black tea.
7 .04     Two-thirds of Indonesia tea production is presently sold on the
world niarket.  Nearly all of these exports are supplied by Covernment estates.
Accordinig to a study by the Bank's Commodities and Export Projections Division
which was circulated to the Board 1/ the international tea market in 1980 is
likely to be characterized by oversupply and wealcened prices from their recent
levels. These projected lower prices have been taken into account in the
financial and economic analyses (see para 7.08).  However,  -ecnnsc ^f tie
large potential domestic market, it is unlikely that projet:t teai would be
exported and' add to the excess supplies con the world market. 2,'
7.05      Ir order to develop the domestic market the distribution syster mlrn7
be iroroved and extended.  One immediate improvement would bo tne expansion
of the Jakarta auctions to include the purchase and sale of black- teas for
the domestic market. Other improvements of the distribution svstem cannot
he effected quickly, but early improvement is not imperative for the Project
since total private sector production would continue to decline in the
early years until gains from the project were sufficient to compensate for
the general decline of the sector. Funds would be provided under the proj-
ect for a study by consultants to suggest ways and means of improving the
marketing svstem.
7.06      At Dresent, the collection and processing of smallholder leaf is
fragmented and disorganized (see Annex 3). It is frequently tied to
1/   "TThe International Tea Market, Review and Outlook for Bank Lending
in 1973-74"; Sec. M72-655, December 20, 1972.
2/   With the project, the total increase of private sector tea production
in 1985/86 over 1971/72 output is 4,000 tons, compared with estimated
world exports in 1985 of about 900,000 tons.



- 23 -
high-cost credit arrangements, and price response to market changes under
these conditions is very limited. The rehabilitation of estate factories and
the construction of 2 new factories under the project would provide an oppor-
tunity to reestablish a more efficient, centralized flow of tea from pro-
ducers to processors. The project would permit a return to the processor-
producer relationship of the estates and nearby smallholders which has been
abandoned with the deterioration of estates since the 1950's.
7.07      The manufacture of green tea, particularly into scented tea,
should not be adversely affected by the project since increased production
would exceed the capacity of rehabilitated and new black tea processing
facilities. Competition among the various processors, which would be
enhanced by the project, could only act to the benefit of the growers.
C. Prices
7.08      The quality of leaf produced by smallholders is usually lower
than that supplied by private estates. Although comprehensive data are
not available the mission found that smallholder green leaf prices averaged
Rp 25/kg as against Rp 40/kg for good quality teas from private estates.
It should be possible through the project to raise leaf quality to at least
the present standards of better estates tea which implies that grower prices
should increase in real terms to about Rp 40/kg during the second part of
the 1970's. International tea prices are expected to decline (see Annex 3),
and some downward pressure can be expected. Consequently the financial and
economic analyses of the project are based on projected green leaf prices
increasing from Rp 25/kg in 1972 to Rp 35/kg in 1980. The latter price is
equivalent to a price of Rp 300/kg for made black tea.
7.09      Accurate price information for black tea sold on the domestic market
is not available, but prices for teas sold on that market are approximately
at the same level as export prices considering quality. Prices for export
black tea from Government estates ranged from Rp 280/kg to Rp 330/kg in 1972.
It may be assumed that tea from private estates after rehabilitation would
be comparable to the average quality of Government estates tea. These teas
have been increasing in price due to quality improvements inspite of falling
world market prices. This price development for Indonesian teas on inter-
national markets was predicted at appraisal of the Tea Estate Project (259-IND).
At that time export prices for estates tea were projected to increase from
Rp 280/kg in 1971 to Rp 330/kg in 1980/85 taking account of the decline in
w;orld market trends. Assuming that increases in prices after 1972 due to
quality improvemnent would be offset by price declines due to the international
market situation, it is reasonable to assume that a price of Rp 300/kg cor-
responding to Rp 35/kg green leaf should be obtainable for private estates.
An f.o.b. price of Rp 300/kg corresponds to a European market price of
US4 82/kg, which is still about US4 10/kg below the average price of tea at
London auction projected by the Bank's Commodity and Export Projection
Division for 1980.

D. Operating Results
7.10      Details of the financial analysis are in Annex 14.  Based on cost
and benefit comparison with and without the project, the rate of return on
investment for smallholders would be 27% over a 30-year period (Table 5).
Benefits are sufficient to repay the debt at 12% over 10 years after a
5-year grace period. The rate of return for estates field development would
be 12%' (Tables 6 and 7). Net income from the project would enable the bor-
rower to repay the loan at 12% over 10 years, after an 8-year grace period.
The longer grace period for estates reflects the higher proportion of re-
planting, and the complete dependence on hired labor. Both smallholders and
estates would pay interest during the grace period. The rate of return for
the rehabilitated factories was calculated at 17% over 25 years. The bor-
rower would be able to repay the loan of Rp 99 million (US$240,000) at 12%
over -0 years, after a 5-year grace period in which interest would be paid
(Table 8). Investment in a new tea factory would yield a 14% rate of
return. On the basis of 35% equity financing, the borrower would be able
to repay the loan at 12% over 10 years after a 5-year grace period during
which interest would be paid (Table 9).
7.11      Bank Rakvat Indonesia.  A statement of the sources and application
of funds for BRI's participation in the project is in Annex 14, Table 3.  In
addition to debt service, administration, and supervision expenses, provision
has been made for arrears and bad debts. 20% of all receivables have been
delayed by 2 years, and 2-1/4% of all receivable were written off as bad
debts. This bad debt figure is a weighted average of 4% for smallholders
and 1% for estates and factories. Including these delinquency provisions,
the project would generate sufficient funds for BRI to meet all obligations
including the cost and replacement of its own funds. The repayment period
for the credit onlent to BRI would be 20 years including a 10-year grace
period. Interest would be paid at the rate of 4% per annum.
7.12      Government of Indonesia.  The total direct contribution of Govern-
ment to the project would be Rp 949 million inclusive of contingencies
(para 5.03). Revenues from the sale of planting material would reduce the
net contribution to about Rp 674 million (US$1.6 million). Substantial addi-
tional revenue would be earned as interest on funds onlent to BRI (Annex 14,
Table 4) and from the cess of Rp 3/kg on additional processed leaf resulting
from the project.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The project would halt the rapid decline in private sector tea
production, and by 1985 would result in an increase of about 4,000 tons
over present production levels. Production would be consumed in the domestic
marksrt which has a large potential, particularly since tea is the cheapest
beverage available, and thus benefits particularly the lower income groups.
Moreover, the increase in production would facilitate an increase in per



- 25 -
capita consumption to only 290 grars, which is below that achieved in other
major tea producing countries.
8.02      At the projected price of Rp 300/kg for dried black tea, the
increase of 4,000 tons plus the production compensating for projected
declines without the project (6,000 tons) would have an annual wholesale
value of about Rp 3.0 billion (US$7.2 million). Considering the strong
demand on the domestic market it is likely that these 10,000 tons, which
would not be produced without the project, would be supplied from Govern-
ment estates production and correspondingly reduce exports. Thus the above
wholesale value would represent about the foreign exchange earnings that
would be lost without the project.
8.03      As a result of increased production and quality, about 7,700
smallholders participating in the project would realize an increase in
annual net income of Rp 81,000/ha at full development (from Rp 36,000 to
Rp 117,000). Expected declines without the project, would increase the
net benefit to Rp 97,000 per year. These estimates are based on prices
indicated in para 7.07 and take account of an increase in the real cost of
hired labor of Rp 25/day. By 1980, estates' net income from leaf production
would increase by Rp 9 million per year per 100 ha (Rp 11 million, adjusted
for expected yield declines). The overall effect of the project on net farm
income would be annual increases of Rp 970 million (US$2.3 million) to
smallholders, and Rp 335 million (US$807,000) to estates. The project would
create about 5,000 jobs for field and factory workers at full development.
8.04      The economic rate of return for the project is calculated at
15% on total investment excluding the BRI management study and diversifica-
tion trials. Details are In Annex 15. All costs and benefits under the
project have been assessed on an incremental basis over present and projected
values without the project. Major assumption include: (a) the production
and prices discussed in paras 7.02, 7.07 and 7.08; and (b) all expenses have
been costed at present or projected real market rates except family farm
labor, for which a shadow rate of Rp 60/day (rising to Rp 78/day) is used
as opposed to Rp 85/day rising to Rp 110/day paid for casual hired labor.
The shadow rate is based on the average daily rate on an annual basis that
casual labor would earn taking into account seasonal rate fluctuations and
unemployment. Without shadow pricing, the rate of return for the project
declines to 13%. A decline in prices by 10% would reduce the rate of return
to 12.5% and an increase in cost by 10% would result in a decline to 13.4%.
8.05      In addition to the direct financial benefits to subborrowers, the
project would contribute to the strengthening of the smallholder extension
service. Staff qualifications and operating procedures developed within the
PMU would serve as models for the improvement of extension services for other
regions and crops. Training facilities and programs under the project could
also serve as examples of the needs and possibilities relating to other
sectors. Technical assistance to BRI would improve the capacity of its
Central and West Java field staff to appraise and supervise tree-crops credit,
and the management study could result in substantial improvements in BRI's
organization and operating procedures.

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      The following principal assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions:
(a) estates participating in the project would be
limited to those owned by Indonesian-based legal
entities, free of title disputes and holding
concessions which cover at least the credit re-
payment period (para 3.05);
(b) the Ministry of Industry would operate on the advice
of the PMU in licensing new tea factory construction
for West and Central Java (para 4.04);
(c) an independent auditor satisfactory to IDA would be
employed to audit the projects accounts of both PMU and
BRI. The form of audit would be agreed with IDA and
audited accounts would be made available to IDA within
four months of the close of the financial year (paras 5.10
and 5.11);
(d) project staff would receive total annual emoluments
equivalent to those received by Government Estate staff
(para 6.02); and
(e) Government would engage or cause to be engaged consultants
acceptable to IDA on terms and conditions approved by IDA,
to assist factory sub-borrowers, PHU and BRI in project
execution (paras 5.08, 6.06 and 6.12, respectively) and
to conduct studies to be financed under the project
(paras 4.08 and 7.05).
9.02      Conditions of Credit effectiveness are that:
(a)  P1U and PMB have been established, the project manager
has taken up his duties, and appointments of the in-
ternationally-recruited consultants for PMU other than
the Factory Consultant have been made (para 4.07);
(b) a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, with terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA, has been executed between Government
and BRI (para 5.04); and
(c)  the fiscal year 1973/74 budget of the PlU has been
approved by Government (para 6.01).
9.03      The project is financially and economically sound and suitable
for an IDA credit of US$7.8 million.

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
IDA Credit to Indonesian Agriculture
A. Credits to the Estate Industry
Four IDA credits for rehabilitation and development of rubber, oil
palm, tea and other crops in the Government-owned estate sector have been approved
to date.  The first (Credit 155) in June 1969 was for US; 16.0 million to
assist two estate enterprises (PNP V and PNP VII) in North Sumatra.  The second
>19a) in June 1970 for US$ 17 million was for PNP IV and PNP VI, also in
North Sumatra. The third (259) in June 1971 for US$ 1 million was for PNP XII
and PNP XIII in 'West Java; and the fourth (319) in June 1972 for US$ 11 million
was for PNP X in South Sumatra. Further details of these Credits (dates of sign-
ing in parentheses  ) are in the following paragraDhs.
Credits 155 and 19h - Rubber and Oilpalm (Estates I and II)uSO 16 m1lJiJnlTTq$ 17 _.x;11;"r
(June 20, 1969; June 15, 1970)
2.        Credits 155 and 19L were for projects to rehabilitate four Govermment-
owned estate groups. Their problems are identical. They involve the planting
or replanting of nearly 40,000 ha of oilpalms and rubber; upkeep of some 29,000
ha of immature trees; fertilizers; agricultural vehicles and machinery; processing
plant; and technical assistance for research and management.
3.        The projects are about one year behind their original schedules due to
initial delays in appointing management advisors and visiting inspectors,
lack of suitable planting material in the early stages of development and an un-
foreseen sharp fall in rubber prices which seriously restricted the availability
on self-generated funds.  Adequate supplies of good quality planting material
are now becoming available so that by the end of 1974 oil palm planting pro-
grams should be on target.  There has also been a recovery in rubber prices in
recent months and the availability of self-generated funds will be much less of
a problem in 1973. While there have been improvements in plantation work leading
to increased production, wak and inexperienced management continues to be a
problem and the impact of foreign advisors has been mixed. Improvements are
also needed in budgetary procedures, financial and operational control and overall
organization in the estates sector. Government has taken two steps to improve
the situation.  First, in November 1971, it agreed to an IDA-prepared Aide-
Memoire on PNP management problems, including action timetable for implementa-
tion of specific improvements by July 1972. As a result reporting and accounting
procedures have been improved, but management control is still deficient.
Second, Government commissioned a study by management consultants to determine
a system for effective supervision and control of Government-owned estates. The
report is concluded, and a timetable to implement the recommendations is being
drawn up.

Credit 259 - Tea (Estates III), US $ 15 million
(June 30, 1971)
4.        Credit 259 was for the rehabilitation of two groups of Government-
owned tea estates in West Java. The project includes rehabilitation of 2,100 ha
of existing tea, planting of 2,300 ha of new tea and 1,100 ha of cinchona
(quinine) and reorganization and re-equipment of the estates' tea factories.
Technical assistance has been provided to strengthen management and introduce
up-to-date tea cultivation and processing methods. Tea research is being im-
proved. The project provided for a study of the depressed and inefficient
smallholder and private estate tea industries, aimed at finding ways to re-
habilitate them. This report appraises the project prepared by the study. Pro-
gress to date is satisfactory and relationships between management and con-
suJ tants are good.
Credit 319 - Rubber and Oilpalm and Crop Diversification (Estate IV), us s 11.0
(June /O, l977()
5.        This credit is for the rehabilitation and development of 8,600 ha
rubber and 9,400 ha oilpalm including factories of a group of Government-owned
estates in South Sumatra.  It also provides for the rehabilitation and
expansion of pumping facilities at the port of Pandjung. After a delay of
several months to allow additional time to appoint inspection services and
executive assistants, this credit became effective in January 1973.
B. Irrigation Credits
Credit 127 - First Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, Us$ 5 million
(Septemb_er 6, 1968)                     ---
6.        This credit was for the purchase of earth moving equipment required
for rehabilitating three irrigation systems in Java and for the construction of
a fourth in South Sumatra. While all equipment supplied under the project is
being well utilized and disbursements are within 98 percent of the appraisal
time-table, the actual cost of the rehabilitation will be considerably higher
than was estimated during appraisal, as a result of the unforeseen need to
include substantial drainage works under the project.  This increase in pro-
ject cost is being financed by GOI. Project completion will be delayed by
about two years due to this additional required work but the economic rate of
return will still be above 20 percent.
Credit 195 - Second Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, US$ 18.5 million
(June 15, 1970)
7.        This credit was for the rehabilitation of the Jatiluhur project in
West Java covering 186,000 ha.  An autonomous agency Otorita Jatiluhur was
established to administer the project. After a slow start due to problems with
preparation of tender documents and difficulty in obtaining acceptable bids,
work is now proceeding and the project could still be completed on schedule
provided that good contractors win the last two contracts. There are no serious
cost overruns, but due to the above difficulties disbursements are presently
behind schedule.
Credit 220 - Third Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, US$ 1h.5 million
(November 6, 1970)
8.        This credit is for rehabilitation of three irrigation systems covering
200,000 ha, two in Java and one in South Sulawesi.  Construction is presently



Annex 1
Page 3
behind schedule due to initial difficulties in recruiting expatriate staff,
problems with the preparation of contract documents and over extension of
local contractors due to the large volume of construction involved. Altholgh
some improvzrent in project execution are expected, it is still estimated
that the project's completion date will be 2 to 3 years behind the appraisal
report estinate. Overall project cost estimates have increased by 15 percent
and GOI has made arrangements to meet this cost overrun. Despite the cost
increase and the delay in implementation, the economic rate of return for
the project, estimated at 25% at appraisal, remains satisfactory.
Credit 289 - Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, US$ 12.5 million
(March 9, 1972)
9.        This credit is for rehabilitation and inprovement of irrigation
at Pekalen-Sampean covering 229,000 ha; an investigation of groundwater-re-
sources in East Java; and feasibility studies of two other irrigation
projects in Java. Consultants have been appointed and civil works contracts
are no-W being let.
C. Other Exlsting Agricultural Credits
Credit 211 - Fisheries Project, USt 3.5 million
(July 13, 1970)
10        This is for part of an overall program to develop export-oriented
skipjack tuna fishing.  It consists of construction and equipment of freez-
ing and cold storage facilities, the construction of a wharf in Aer Tembaga,
the purchase of 30 wooden vessels for pole and line fishing, and two refri-
gerated carriers to transport frozen tuna to export markets. The project
provides technical assistance to sv1pport the program. Although operations
of the project unit, the State Fisheries 3nterprise, have been inefficient,
the recent appointment by Government of ne.w management acceptable to IDA is
expected to improve the situation, and overall prospects for successful
implementation have improved, particularly since there is an upward trend df
world market prices for skipjack tuna.
Credit 246 - Seeds Project, US$ 7.5 million
(May 14, 1971)
11.       This credit for establishment of facilities for growing, processh-
ing and distributing high yield varieties of rice and other seeds is behind
schedule due to delays in organizing management and the effective procure-
ment. A March 1973 supervision mission reported that these constraints are
being overcome, but due to delays mentioned above and recent exchange rates
adjustments, project costs are likely to be considerably higher than apprai-
sal report estimates, and the project is in the process of reevaluation.
Credit 355 - Beef CaLtle Development, US.D 3.6 million
(January 31, 1973)
12        This credit for development of beef cattle production in the
outer islands is not yet effective awaiting the appointment of consultants
and completion of arrangements of leasing of land. Major delays in
effectiveness are not expected.



Annex 1

Credit 358 - North Sumatra Smallholder Development, US$ 5.0 million
(February 14h, 1973)
13.       This credit for the development of smallholder rubber production
in North Sumatra is not yet effective, awaiting the transfer of lands.

SJMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
Agriculture Practices and Processing
1.        Throughout most of the tea areas climate and soils are well suited
for tea production, and provided that good stands are established and husbandry
standards maintained, tea yields should be high. Below are some of the factors
that led to the deterioration in tea as well as proposals for improvement
which should be considered in the rehabilitation process.
Bush Density
2.        In tea gardens established prior to World War II, bushes are
spaced 1 m x 1.2 m apart with about 8,500 bushes per hectare.  In the
areas to be replanted under the nroject, bushes should be spaced 0.6 m x 1.2
m apart.  This would accomodate 13,500 bushes per hectare and result in a
complete tea cover with a continuous plucking table along rows (0.6 m
spacing). Traditional infilling with new plants is not desirable to increase
bush density although the transplanting of mature bushes has proven success-
ful in the volcanic soils of Java. Areas with less than an average 60% cover
of tea are not recommended for rehabilitation since they pose major
maintenance problems and do not offer sufficient yield potential.
Pruning and Bush Maintenance
3.        Growers often do not prune, or do not prune sufficiently to
maintain a low, flat plucking table. The number of plucking points remains
correspondingly small and annual yields are much lower than with proper
pruning despite the temporary loss of revenue when plants are forming new
pluckable leaf. In tea areas below 1,200 m elevation, the average
pruning cvcle should not be greater than 3 years. At elevations of 500 m
and below it may he desirable to cut the bush across at 18 months of
production (a liph prune). Although the plant is then out of production
for 4-6 weeks the resulting rapid formation of new pluckable leaf makes
this profitable.  Pruning should norma lv be done in August or early
September when recoverv would be speeded up by the coming wet season.
Crop production is at its lowest at this time and revenue losses are, there-
fore, minimized. Bush sanitation after pruning is essential. Frames must
be cleaned of moss and lichens before bud break, to encourage the growth of
new shoots.  Dead wood, knots and cross branches should also be removed and
a healthy frame left clean for new shooting.
Timber Cutting
4.        The current practice of cutting, down shade and other trees
leaving the fresh stump exposed provides an ideal vehicle for the introduction



ANNEX 2
Page 2
of root disease into the soil. Large, bare patches surrounding old
stumos are evidence of the disastrous effects on tea bushes. Although
individual gardens may be free of root disease, its occurrence is
frequent and widespread in all project areas. Timber cutting should be
preceded by ring-barking which kills the tree prior to stump exposure.
Windborne mycelia do not penetrate dead wood and their access to the soil
are thereby prevented.
Interplanting
5.        To augment declining revenue from the sale of tea leaf, and to
All increasing gaps in tea gardens, smallholders now interplant a variety
of cash and subsistence crops. The principal drawback to this practice is
the excessive shading of tea bushes caused by crops such as cassava, bananas,
rubber or waluh (a local vegetable grown on vines supnorted by bamboo frames).
Albizzia trees, grown for timber and firewood, not only cause excessive
shading, but shed large quantities of fine leaves on to tea bushes causing
leaf spotting and introducing excessive foreign material into the plucked
leaf.
Fertilizer and Pesticides
6.        As a cash input, chenical applications are the first to be reduced
in periods of austerity and some private sector tea has been without fer-
tilizer or pesticide treatment for 30 years, resulting in serious losses of
productivity. Soils in the project area tend to have a pH of 6 or more which
is too high for ontimum tea production. A reduction in pH values can be
achieved bx apnlication of ammonium sulphate as nitrogen fertilizer.  In
those rare cases when nitrogen fertilizer is applied, it is in the form of
urea and it is often used without other nutrients. The limited resources
spent on urea are, in many instances, wasted since the bush is unable to
respond in the absence of phosphate and potash. Potash deficiency is Dar-
ticularly widespread in the project area as evidenced by the absence of
leaves on the lower extrerities of bushes in many gardens.  Failure to apply
herbicides and pesticides has also had significant effects on productivity.
7.        Precise fertilizer recommendations can only be made after leaf
and soil analyses have been carried out. This is presently being done for
PT's XII and XI'I. Since these estates are scattered throughout the project
area, their analyses and recommendations would be useful in determining fer-
tilizer requirements for this project. For the project, it was estimated
that fertilizer application should be madle at 600 kg/ha for full stands of
tea. For lower densities, application would be reduced proportionately.
For replanted tea, fertilizer application are recommended to increase from
160 kg/ha in the first year of plucking, to 600 kg/ha in the 3rd year of
plucking.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
Field Maintenance
8.        Weeding should gradually be phased from manual labor to chemical
control. Increased labor needed for plucking would prevent the loss of
employment opportunities and weeds would be more effectively controlled. Bush
densities in replanted areas will be sufficient to achieve complete tea cover,
eliminating the need for continued weeding after bush maturity.
9.        Shade trees are not necessary for tea grown under Indonesian
conditions and they should be removed using the technique explained in
para 4.
10.       Root disease, which is usually detected by the appearance of
white fungi on the root systems of dead or dying bushes, should be treated
by uprooting the infested area. The area should then be trenched and
left fallow for two years before replanting. Infected plants should be
burned.
Plucking
11.       In efforts to increase revenue from tea in the short run,
growers frequently engage in coarse plucking taking 4-5 leaves and a
bud. The result is not only poor quality leaf, with excessive stock
and fiber content, but a rapid decline in bush growth since maintenance
leaves and secondary growing points have been removed. Plucking is presently
done once every 3-4 weeks rather than 3-4 times per month. New growth be-
comes too mature between pluckings and poor quality leaf is harvested. A
major change in plucking practices will be essential for effective
rehabilitation. In particular, table plucking must be introduced along
with more frequent and finer plucking (the Dicking of the recommended 2
leaves and a bud).

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
THE TEA ECONOMY OF INDONESIA
A. Background
General
1.        Before World War II the Indonesian tea industry was based on 138,000
ha of estate gardens and about 75,000 ha of smallholdings. About 90,000
tons of tea were produced in 1939. Practically all estate tea (70,000
tons), and part of smallholder production, was processed into black tea.
About 73,000 tons, valued at US$30 million, were exported making Indonesia
the world's third largest exporter of black tea. Around 16,500 tons were
consumed locally.
2.        During the Japanese occupation, tens of thousands of hectares
of estate tea were uprooted and planted to food crops. Subsequent nationali-
zation, neglect and continued conversion into subsistence crops caused a
further decrease in the tea area until, in 1970, only about 52,000 ha of estate
tea and 51,000 ha of smallholder tea remained. Total production had dropped
to about 54,000 tons. Of the 52,000 ha of estate tea, about 39,000 ha are
Government estates (PNP's and PT's). About 11,000 ha of the 13,000 ha private
estates are owned by Indonesian based companies or Indonesian individuals.
3.        Funds and technical assistance for the rehabilitation of Government
estates have been provided in recent years and most Government estates are
in the process of being rehabilitated. An IDA Credit (259-IND) for US$15
million was provided in 1971 for the rehabilitation of PNP's (now PT's)
XII and XIII and the Dutch Government is financing part of the rehabilitation
of PNP VIII. PNP XXIII, the only other Government estate group with tea
estates, is also in the process of rehabilitation with Government funds.
4.        To date, no financial assistance either from Government or outside
sources and very little technical assistance have been supplied for the
rehabilitation of private estates and smallholdings. Only 11,500 ha of
Indonesian-owned private estates and 26,500 ha of smallholder land can be
considered productive tea land, defined as having tea stands of 60% or more.
(Tables 1 and 2 give frequency distributions for the main tea growing
regions).



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Tea Smallholders
5.        Smallholder tea was established by the distribution of planting
material from estates to smallholders, and a close relationship developed
between the two sectors. In addition to planting materials, estates pro-
vided fertilizer on credit, recovering payments by deductions from the value
of green leaf supplied to estate factories for processing.  Smallholder tea
standards were then good, but with changing conditions, the smallholders
probably suffered more than the rest of the industry. About 21,000 growers
.ow cultivate the 26,500 ha of productive tea land.
6.        The size of tea gardens varies widely within and among regencies.
The average smallholding is 2.05 ha with tea accounting for 1.3 ha. However,
in the Garut/Tasikmalaja area, which is the most typical for tea smallhold-
ings and where most of the rehabilitation will take place, the average
smallholding with tea bush density of 60% or more is 1.8 ha with a tea area
of 1.1 ha. The remaining 0.7 ha is devoted to other crops, principally
paddy and cassava. Average yields on stands with 40% density or less are
only about 210 kg/ha; stands with average densities of 60% give average
yields of about 480 kg/ha. Since climatic and geographic conditions are
good, it would be possible to increase yields on rehabilitated tea to 730
kg/ha and replanted tea with clonal material to 1,600 kg/ha (880 kg/ha and
1,700 kg/ha, respectively, for estates).
7.       .Nearly all smaliholders have title to their land and security of
tenure should not be a problem for tea development. Land reform legislation
of 1960 specifies a maximum freehold of 11 ha dry land and requires title
registration of all holdings. Luras (village headmen) maintain current
records and are authorized to certifv the validity of title claims.
Private Estates
8.        There are about 10,700 ha of tea in production in West Java on 53
estates and 1,900 ha in Central Java on 6 estates employing about 15,600
laborers. In addition to these Indonesian-owned estates there are about 2,750
ha which are foreign-owned. They are not included in the project. The
Indonesian-owned estates produced about 4,700 tons, about 9% of total Indonesian
production in 1970, of which slightly less than half was green tea. A portion
of black tea production is exported.
9.        In contrast to smallho.ders, whose area with tea bush densities
over 40% was only 50%, nearly 80% of private estate land has stand densities
of over 40%. In addition, unlike smallholders, some estates have reserve
andi suitable for new tea expansion estimated at about 4,200 ha. Apart from
tea, the only other major crop on tea estates is rubber which covers about
3,500 ha.
10.       The decline in tea husbandry on private estates is, in many cases,
nearly as severe and suffers from the same defects as smallholdings. Owners
of estates have limited resources to maintain the scattered areas of poorly
populated tea stands. In addition they do not have the expertise or



ANNEX 3
Page 3
knowledge of modern husbandry methods to rehabilitate large areas of old tea.
There is an urgent need for improved knowledge on all aspects of tea culti-
vation, including better management at all levels. Satisfactory rehabilita-
tion can only be achieved by adherence to a systematic long-term development
plan for each estate.
B. Production
11.       Smallholders produce about 25% of total Indonesian tea output
and private Indonesian-owned estates about 9% (see Table 3). Most of the
tea is grown at elevations of less than 700 m above sea level. West Java
produces about 94% of all tea produced by the private sector, principally
in the 7 regions listed in Table 4. Private estates in Central Java account
for the remaining 6%.
12.       In 1960, smallholders produced about 42,000 tons of tea, but output
has since declined to about 15,000 tons (1970/71). Smallholder tea area also
decreased from 64,400 ha in 1960 to 51,000 ha in 1970/71 and the number of
smallholders producing tea is 39,000. Of the 51,000 ha, only 26,500 ha can
be considered productive tea land cultivated by 21,000 smallholders.
13.       Table 5 gives production projections for the tea industry.  Govern-
ment estates show large increases in output as a result of rehabilitation
programs. Projections for smallholders and private estates show that without
the project, supplies from the private sector will decline by about 3,300 tons
in 1980. The proposed project would arrest this downward trend, but the
total effect of the rehabilitation program would not be felt until 1985 when
supply from smallholders and private estates would exceed 1971/72 production
by about 4,000 tons.
15.       Indonesia produces black teas by the orthodox process, and green
teas of which about 55% is re-processed into scented teas. Table 6
summarizes Indonesian tea production showing sources of leaf, the type
and agency of processing. Table 7 indicates market outlets. Out of a
total of 54,500 tons, 33,200 were exported in 1970. The remaining 19,000
(when adjusted for a 17.5% moisture loss in reprocessing into scented tea)
were sold within Indonesia. Of this, about 10,800 tons were scented tea,
reprocessed in Central Java. About 5,400 were lower grade black teas and
2,800 tons were unscented green teas consumed mainly in West Java.
C. Consumption
16.       Export is the main outlet for black Indonesian tea and generally
includes only the better qualities. It accounts for about 85% of total
black tea production. The lower quality black teas are consumed within
Indonesia where the major markets are the outer islands, areas around tea
estates, and towns in East and West Java as indicated in Table 6.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
17.       Scented and unscented green tea is mainly consumed in Central and
West Java. Scented tea dominates the market in Central Java. Scented tea
is green tea re-processed with jasmine and red gambir flowers which are
grown mainly in Central Java and cannot be transported over long distances
without losing their scenting qualities. Processing of this type of tea
is concentrated, therefore, in this part of Indonesia. Unscented green
tea is mainly consumed in West Java.
18.       Although accurate estimates could not be obtained, the trends in
domestic tea consumption as indicated in Table 7 have been most striking.
.Ltal and per capita consumption increased from pre-war until 1960 and then
showed a rapid decline. Exports, however, declined as a result of deteriora-
tion in tea quality and the marketing system. It should be noted that
smuggling of tea out of Indonesia in the late 1950's and early 1960's tended
in official statistics to overestimate domestic consumption and underestimate
exports. Since 1960 output declined even faster than before and reduced the
availability of tea on the domestic market. Government regulations favoring
exports in order to earn foreign exchange were a further impediment to sale
on the domestic market. Per capita consumption, which was nearly four times
as high in 1960 as in 1939, declined sharply during the past decade and in
1970 was at about the same level as in 1939. The increase in per capita
consumption between 1939 and 1960 was about 4% per year and indicates the
absorption capacity of the Indonesian tea mark.et. There is little doubt
that the domestic market will expand rapidly if supplies can be made
available and a better distribution system developed. Black teas in
particular should benefit from this development since the scented green tea
market is localized and the production of scenting flowers limited, and
unscented green tea is an undistingpished product, serving a special role
only in the traditional eating habits o'f the Sudanese of West Java.
19.       In Table 5, production and consumDtion projections show the effect
of various assumptions on export availabilities. The production projections
have been described previously. Consumption estimates assume: (i) no in-
crease in per capita consumption; (ii) an increase in per capita consumption
of 4% per year as experienced during 1939 to 1960. The projections take into
account a population increase of 2.3% per year. They indicate that without
the proposed project export availabilities in 1985 would be reduced by 35%
from 1970/71 levels. Even with the project, production would not be sufficient
to maintain exports at 1970/71 levels if yearly canita consumption increases
at 4%. .
D. Prices
20.       Three of the major factors influencing green leaf prices for
smallholders and private estates are: (a) distance from a processing unit;
(b) type and number of nearby processing units; and (c) seasonality of
supply. Where there are isolated processing units, with little competition,



ANNEX 3
Page 5
close to the source of supply, they may pay relatively low prices for the
leaf; where there is competition among processors, prices are immediately
forced upwards. Large scale factories with inadequate throughput will often
pay high prices in attempts to reduce overhead costs per unit of output. In
two districts (Purwakarta and Tasikmalaya) leaf travels as far as 100 kilo-
meters to the nearest factory. Consequently, leaf quality and growers prices
are very low, and one new black tea factory is proposed for each district.
21.       Unfortunately there are no comprehensive historic price series
for green tea sold by smallholder and private estates on the local market.
However the mission obtained price series from three estates selling made
green tea to local leaf blenders and resellers. These estates produce better
qualities of leaf and are thus not entirely indicative of smallholder leaf
prices. Nevertheless, while the level of prices may not be directly compara-
ble, the trends are similar and characterize the domestic market situation.
Table 8 shows that there has been a strong upward trend in prices. To what
extent this increase is due to improvement in quality could not be deter-
mined. But undoubtedly the increasing shortage of tea supplies for domestic
consumption was a strong factor in pushing prices up, a fact which was con-
firmed by all processors and leaf buyers interviewed. Interesting also, is
the fact that price developments on the international market exercised appa-
rently very little influence on prices for leaf going onto the domestic market.
In 1969, for example, there was a slump in world market prices, but only a
slight decline in domestic prices. While prices on the international tea
market declined prices on the domestic market generally moved in the opposite
direction. Prices of Indonesian tea on the world market also improved, a
reflection of the better tea quality as a result of rehabilitation of Govern-
ment states.
22.       The quality of leaf produced by smallholders is usually lower than
that supplied by private estates. The mission found that smallholder leaf
prices were around Rp 25-30/kg. It should be possible through the project
to raise leaf quality to at least the present standards of better estates,
which implies that grower prices should increase to about Rps 40/kg at
constant 1972 price levels during the second part of the 1970's. However,
international tea prices are expected to decline, and although their effect
on prices for tea flowing into the domestic market is limited, some down-
ward pressure can be expected. Consequently the project analysis is based
on projected prices increasing from Rps 25/kg in 1972 to Rps 35/kg in 1980.
E.  ProcLeaf Collection
23.       Processing.  Tea manufacture takes place under a variety of
conditions and in a number of different types of factories producing
black tea, green tea or scented tea. For government estates, which produce
only black tea, factories are always located on the estates. In the private
sector, black tea factories may be situated either on private estates or be
independent. In either case they may process either smallholder or estate
leaf, or both.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
24.       Essential to the making of black teas is a controlled leaf fermenta-
tion (oxidation) which involves both chemical and biological activity and re-
quires a degree of leaf maceration or crushing (rolling) to release the
chemicals from within the leaf cells. These chemicals can be destroyed by
heat and therefore maintenance of low temperature in the early stages is
important. It is this fermentation which blackens the tea. In green tea
manufacture, it is essential to reduce fermentation to a minimum. Heat,
therefore, is applied deliberately in the early stages of processing to
destroy the chemicals which would cause such fermentation. Both methods
require partial maceration (rolling) of the leaf to cause the cells of the
leaf to rupture and release their contents which can then be dissolved in
the tea infusion. The greater the degree of maceration, the easier it is to
get a quick or strong infusion.
25.       Final tea quality depends on the quality of leaf received from
the field. While poor manufacture can spoil a tea, good manufacture cannot
improve on the quality of the incoming leaf. Smallholder leaf in Indonesia
is frequently of very poor quality, being too mature, containing too high
a percentage of stalk, or having been picked too far in advance of processing.
Final tea quality depends entirely on taste and liquoring qualities, and is
not influenced by physical grading which, in the case of black teas, is
merely a separation of different sizes and shapes of leaf particles and stalk.
26.       Green Tea Factories.  The essential basic unit for a green tea
factory is a single fire-heated rotating cylinder or a kettle over an oven.
Additional capacity is provided by adding more units. Processing with
kettles is a very simple operation and the only investments required are
the building and kettles costing about Rps 60,000 for a single kettle unit.
Rolling the tea before burning is usually done by foot. These low costs
explain the widespread use of these units which enables many farmers to
process their own leaf and that of their neighbors. The quality of tea
produced, however, is usually very low.
27.       Heated rotating cylinders are often combined with mechanical
rollers which replace small scale foot rolling. Cylinders are usually
mechanically driven. The capacity of these factories is greater than that
of kettle operations, and investment costs are much higher, about Rp 1.8
million for a unit containing 5 cylinders, 2 Jackson rollers and a diesel
engine. The average operating cost for a cylinder unit is about Rp 18/kg,
varying from Rp 12.5/kg to Rp 20/kg depending on the size of the unit.
The quality of the tea produced is better than that from kettle units.
28.       There are over 750 green tea factories of all sizes in West Java,
excluding the many make-shift kettle units operated seasonally by individual
smallholders. The estimated distribution is as follows:

All tea factories are supposed to be registered and licensed with the
Ministry of Industry, but enforcement of that regulation is difficult.
29.       Scented Green Tea Factories.  The essential function of these
factories is to refine the tea and to mix it with jasmine or other flowers
to impart a desired scent. The work is done almost entirely in Central
Java within reach of the areas where the flowers are grown.  The present
output is about 11,000 tons of tea in 62 factories.  Scented tea production
is very labor intensive and it is estimated that about 8,300 workers are
directly employed by the 62 factories.
30.       Black Tea Factories.  Private estate owners usually produce black
tea from leaf supplied by the estate or augmented by purchases from neigh-
boring estates and smallholders. Independent factories in towns with no
estate rely solely on their own transport or collectors to provide suffi-
cient leaf. There are about 50 black tea factories in West and Central
Java, of which 33 are located on tea estates, and 17 are independent. In
general, the buildings of these factories are old and in need of repair.
The machinery in most cases is as antiquated as the factory and only kept in
operation by ad hoc improvisation. Potential capacity is usually in excess
of present output.
31.       Sources of Leaf Supply and Transport.  There are three sources of
leaf: Government estates, private estates and smallholders. Government
estates provide leaf to their own factories almost exclusively. Most of
the leaf grown on private estates is processed on the producing estate
although a small quantity moves onto Government estates and a more signifi-
cant quantity to independent factories or to other estates. Collection is
usually arranged by the buyer and there are no intermediaries as lots are
large enough for direct transactions.
32.       Leaf from smallholders goes to all the alternative processing
facilities. Because tea smallholdings are fairly scattered and individual
production is very small much of the leaf goes through intermediate collecting
points, even that destined for the small scale village green tea factories.
The farmer carries his leaf to collecting points by pikul (two baskets hung
from a bamboo carried across the shoulders; each containing about 30 kg of
leaf). To fit this amount in the two baskets, the leaf must be compressed,
resulting in considerable crushing and leaf damage. From the collecting
point, the leaf is taken either to the small factories by pikul or to the
larger factory by truck. The large scale factories organize their own leaf



ANNEX 3
Page 8
transport either with their own trucks or through agents. Improper leaf
handling by truckers results in further damage before arrival at the factory.
The village (Desa) authorities often exert their authority by allocating of
collection areas to the various agents or factories and may levy official
and unofficial taxes on leaf transactions.

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
Guidelines for Selection of Smallholders and Private Estates
Smallholders
1.        About 70% of tea smallholders covering about 50% of the land in
the project area operate their units with hired labor on a regular basis.
Social custom in Java (the so-called Burotani system) also prevents even
quite small farmers from cultivating their farm entirely with family labor.
Landless labor is usually employed at a total cost equivalent to 20% of the
value of harvest, even though farm families may be underemployed. Total
rehabilitation area under the project would be distributed among various tea
garden sizes in proportion to the number of farmers in each size group. This
distribution is as follows:
Size of tea area per farm in ha             % of total area
1/4 - 1                               65
1- 2                               20
2- 3                                10
3- 7                                 5
2.        Principally due to the initial shortage of planting material, the
project would be confined to those areas which have the highest concentration
of smallholders in the Garut/Tasikmalaya, Bandung/Purwakarta and Sukabumi/
Ciandjur regencies. Present smallholder tea in any one of these areas exceeds
the proposed rehabilitation area. Thus the project could be located in only
one area. However, it is considered advantageous to include all 3 areas
in order to enhance the demonstration effect. The areas proposed for the
project are illustrated in the map. The distribution of the project area
among these areas would be in proportion to their shares of farms with
bush densities of 60% or more as indicated in the Table below.

The restriction of project participation to farmers with average stands of
60% density ensures that benefits would accrue to those who have exhibited
better tea husbandry practices.
3.        Criteria for project participation would be as follows:
(a) holdings woula have at least 1/4 ha of tea, since
inclusion of smaller areas would put too great a strain
on the extension service and credit supervisors;
(b) at least 1/2 ha of each holding would be reserved for
subsistence food crops;
(c) the tea land should not have any steep slopes;
(d) each smallholder must hold cultivation rights for his
farm; and
(e) replanting would be restricted to a maximum of 50% of the
existing tea area, and not more than 1 ha, irrespective
of size of the holding.
4.        Because of the shortage of planting material and organizational
constraints, not all farmers eligible under para 3 above could participate
in the project. The PMU would select among those eligible, on standards of
good husbandry as exhibited by weed control measures, tillage of land, etc.
5.        Private Estates.  Private estate lands are leased from Government
under a 30-year concession which can be renewed for a further 25 years
subject to verification of satisfactory management. In some cases the
ownershiD of estates is not clear, because of previous nationalization and
later transfer to new owners. Assurances would be obtained from Government
during negotiations that estates participating in the project would be



ANNEX 5
Page 3
limited to those owned by Indonesian registered companies or Indonesian in-
dividuals, having no title d:Lsputes, and holding a concession which would cover
at least the credit repayment period, or would be extended to do so. Estates
which have a close association with smallholders, particularly through purchase
and processing of smallholdes leaf, would have preference. Eligibility
for credit under the project would be contingent upon the preparation of a
long-term development plan, to be approved by the PM!.  The PMU could assist
in this preparation.
6.        All provisions aboire notwithstanding, project participation would
be contingent upon satisfactory financial and managerial approval by BRI
or its agents.

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
Factory Rehabilitation and Construction
A. Present Condition of Private Tea Factories
1.        Most privately owned black tea factories are exceedingly old and
dilapidated. Structures are often patched and clad in bamboo mattings, posing
a great fire hazard. Machinery and equipment is usually outdated and in need
of extensive repair. Power generators and electrical installations are in
poor condition, and equipment inventories are virtually non-existent.
2.        Withering is performed on wire and bamboo flats that are often
broken down. Heating ducts and systems are unsatisfactory. Rolling equip-
ment is old and worn, resulting in extensive leaf damage. However, the
worst conditions are found in the drying rooms, where operators work under
poorly-lit conditions with unreliable and badly maintained driers. Thermo-
meters are either faulty or nonexistent. Sifting and packing equipment is
in need of repair, and lack such components as filling shutes and magnets.
Tea bins are in particularly bad condition.
B. Selection of Factories for Rehabilitation
3.        The selection of black tea factories to be rehabilitated under
the project would be based on the following criteria:
(a) present structure must be basically sound;
(b) factory layout must be able to accommodate equipment
sufficient to produce at least 500 tons of made tea
per year;
(c) factory must be located close to smallholder concen-
trations;
(d) owners must be willing to purchase and process small-
holder leaf;
(e) owners must be willing to undertake rehabilitation in
accordance with financial and managerial conditions of a
project loan.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
4.        Of the 14 factories visited by the appraisal mission, which
constituted the most likely candidates, 5 were tentatively selected as being
most suitable: Tjiwangi and TjLsudjen in Cianjur District, Sukarapi in
Purwakarta District, Pamegaten in Garut District, and Sembawa in Tasikmalaja
District. Should further investigation result in the elimination of any of
these 5, the PMU would then recommend alternative factories on the basis of
the above criteria.
C. Condition of Factories Prooosed for Rehabilitation
5.        Tjiwangi.  The Tjiwangi factory has 2 withering floors of 15 x 60
meter each. Troughs can be placed lengthwise in 3 groups of 4 pieces, making
12 troughs for each floor. The wooden floors are in bad condition and
should be completely replaced in 2 phases. In the sidewalls of the lofts,
windows are to be constructed on both sides in order to guarantee a good
air ventilation. In general the floor tiles of roller room and dryer room,
and especially those of the fermenting room, are in bad condition and are
due for renewal. The corrugated roofing sheets of the building should all
be renewed. A sufficient number of power tools are available at this
factory.
6.        Tjisudjen.  The building of this factory is in a remarkably good
condition except for the wooden floors of the withering lofts, which need
to be replaced. Both withering floors measure approximately 15-1/2 x 65
meters and can accommodate 18 troughs with a length of 12 meters. Trucks
that bring the green leaf to the factory can drive to a platform which is
connected to the first floor by a foot bridge. The wetsifting equipment
in the roller room is outdated, in poor condition and should be replaced.
7.        Sukarapi.  The Sukarapi factory consists of 2 building, each
60 meters long and divided by a partition. One building, 25 meters wide,
accommodates Roller, Fermenting, Drier and Sorting rooms, whereas the
second building, 16 meters wide, can accommodate 18 troughs. For good air
ventilation, windows are to be installed in the side walls. Except for a
group of rollers and some old drying chambers, no tea machinery whatsoever
is available. But, of the available diesel generators, one set with an
output of 125 kvh is still in acceptable condition. Therefore, in the
rehabilitation budget, only funds for one additional set are included,
compared with 2 sets for the other factories.
8.        Pamegaten.  At this factory, the withering house is separated from
the main building, and measures approximately 21 x 40 meters. Two lofts are
available and can each accommodate a group of at least 12 withering troughs
having a capacity of 1000 kg. Windows should be installed on both sides.
Since the layout of the buildings presents the use of the exhaust air of
the drier to heat the air for the withering troughs, funds are budgeted for
the purchase of heat exchangers.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
9.       Sembawa.  This factory has a very large building, measuring
20 x 80 meters. Although at present it is in a rather bad condition, it
has the potential to be converted into a modern tea factory. The building
has two withering floors equipped with old wire flats in very bad condition.
The first floor is connected by means of a foot bridge to the leaf reception.
Consultants suggest removal of all old withering equipment, and even the
floor of the second loft, and the installation of 12 to 24 troughs on the
first floor only. At present the side walls of this factory consist of
cement impregnated bamboo sheets, which should be replaced by corrugated
iron sheets. Also, the roofing sheets are due for renlacement, as is the
wooden withering floor.
D. New Factories
10.       Site Selection.  New factories are to be located in areas where
there is a present and projected shortage of black tea processing capacity
for smallholder leaf. Specific sites would be selected by owners of the
proposed factory, subject to approval of the PMU, but these sites would be
in Garut and Purwakarta Districts, where the greatest shortage exist.
Smallholder leaf from these districts now travels as far as 100 km to the
nearest black tea factory.
11.       Specifications.  Each factory would have an annual output capacity
of 500 tons, with provision for future expansion to 1000 tons. Buildings
should therefore measure approximately 70 m x 25 m and consist of a ground
floor to accommodate rollers, driers, sifters and packers, and a second
story for withering troughs. A ground floor extension of 7 m x 25 m would
house offices and furnaces. Buildings should be oriented between east and
west with the rolling room located at the west end to restrict the entry of
morning sunlight. A separate power house 10 m x 15 m should be constructed.
E. Design and Supervision
12.       Selection of Consultants.  Consultants to design and supervise
factory rehabilitation and new factory construction would be selected by and
appointed by the factory owners, subject to approval by PMU and IDA. Con-
sulting contracts would be approved by IDA prior to appointment.
13.       Responsibilities of Engineers.  Consultants thus appointed would
prepare and submit through the PMU to IDA plans and specification for each
subproject. In addition, they would prepare tender documents and assist in
bid evaluation. Bid documents would be submitted through the PMU to IDA for
approval prior to advertisement, and contracts would be awarded after IDA
approval of bid evaluation and consultant recommendations. Construction and
installation would be supervised by the consultants, who would also conduct
or arrange for qualified inspection before final payment. Upon express



ANNEX 7
Page 4
recommendation of the PMU, consultant contracts may also include provision
for factory management and supervision for a specified period during and
after start-up. Training of permanent factory managers may also be a pro-
vision recommended by the PMU.

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
Training of Staff and Growers
Senior Staff
1.        One of the project objectives is that the Project Management Unit
should be managed by Indonesians at the earliest opportunity. Accordingly,
as part of their duties, the internationally recruited consultants would be
required to train Indonesian staff to take over after the consultants
departure. The posts of assistant to the Technical and Development Officer
and the Factory Consultant would be held by Indonesian nationals; the In-
donesian general manager would be supported by an internationally recruited
Chief Project Advisor, while the Indonesian accountant would be trained by
an internationally recruited Accountant Systems consultant for a period of
about a year.
2.        The assistants would be assigned definite and substantive duties,
the extent of which would be progressively increased subject only to the
capability of the candidate. Under these arrangements, the Indonesians would
learn and gain experience by actually doing the jobs concerned. During the
last twelve months (3 in the case of the accountant system consultant) prior
to their departure, the executive consultants would be serving as advisors
to their successors. It is believed that such arrangements would be more
effective than the usual counterpart arrangements whose effectiveness is
often hampered by division of responsibility and duplication of effort
resulting in discordant relationships.
Other Staff
3.        It is expected that the majority of the staff would be seconded
from the Ministry of Agriculture while some may be recruited from tea estates
and high school graduates. The majority would therefore have a general agri-
cultural background but would need some specialized training on tea. For
this purpose, suitable training facilities would be needed.
4.        After considering various alternative locations, the mission
believes that the most suitable is Pasir Sarongge, a sub-station of the
Tea Research Insitute at Bogor. It has adequate and well maintained tea
areas for demonstration and practical training together with good experi-
mental facilities. After establishment of the new tea research station in
Gambung training would also be carried out at this center.
5.        The available buildings at Pasir Sarorgge are insufficient.  Simple
buildings would be constructed to serve as classrooms, dormitories and other
utilities to accoimmodate a maximum of 40 people. Housing would be needed for



ANNEX 8
Page 2
the Tea Officer in charge of training and two Senior instructors, but it
may be possible to rent houses in the neighboring village.
6.        It is proposed that the training center be made available during
the first quarter of 1974. All newly recruited technical staff would initially
be given short courses lasting at least one month. Thereafter, arrangements
would be made for refresher courses lasting for a week; these would also be
supplemented by periodic staff seminars, in the field, under the Tea Officers
and the Technical Development Officer as may be deemed suitable.
7.        The PMU would arrange study tours abroad to countries having a high
standard of tea cultivation. They would be arranged for the Tea Officers and
the Assistant Technical Development Officer.
Growers
8.        Since there would be about 7,700 tea growers in the scheme, it is
unrealistic to expect all growers to undergo formal training courses. The
project would, therefore, select farmers for training at a rate of 40 farmers
at a time for a one week course. Their selection would be based on good
crop husbandry, even distribution among villages, and willingness to
cooperate. After training, these selected growers would form a widespread
network of farmers who would demonstrate improved techniques in their own
villages.
9.        Most of the growers would be trained through extension staff visits
to farms supplemented by regular field demonstrations to be conducted by
tea instructors which would involve all growers in the villages concerned.
The growers would, in this way, receive training under conditions similar
to those on their own farms.

construction of new factories;
(c) to advise the factory owners regarding building and machinery
layout, machinery specifications, cost estimates and
procurement matters;
(d) to determine the location of the new factories;
(e) to help in supervising construction works for new factories
and factories under rehabilitation.
Functions of Advisory Committee
10.       The main functions of Advisory Committee would be:  to provide a
formalized channel of communications between the growers as a group and



ANNEX 9
Page 5
the PMU; to ensure that the affairs of the PMU are designed and conducted
in a manner that meets the growers' practical interests; to provide a body
which the PMU could use to support its activities in the concerned areas
particularly as such activities bear on human, non-technical problems;
and to provide a source of social pressure against those defaulting on
credit repayment or generally failing to follow the technical advice as
given by the extension staff.
11.       The Committees would not engage in any executive or administrative
matters. Their regular channel of communication with the PMU would be
through the minutes of the Committee's meetings, copies of which would
be forwarded to the Project Management Board. The PMB would, at every meeting,
go through the minutes and direct the general manager of the PMU if and
what actions should be taken. The general manager would be required to
reply in writing to all substantive queries raised in the minutes or attend
the committee's meetings for the purpose of dealing with such queries.

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
Draft Outline of Proposed Project Performance Report
As part of its reporting obligations under the Project, PMU would
submit a Project Performance report annually to IDA. The principal components
of this report are outlined below.
1.   Project Disbursement.  PMU would base this section of the
report on its own records and on the summaries of BRI accounts
which would be submitted regularly to the PMU. Disbursements
to sub-borrowers would be broken down by sub-borrowers cate-
gory and the number of sub-borrowers should be shown in each
category. Total disbursements, rather than IDA credit dis-
bursements would be given. Within each category, disburse-
ments would be shown by item or type of expenditure; e.g.
fertilizer and pesticides, factory machinery, civil works,
etc. PMU expenditures should be broken down by category
such as training, extension, head office, studies, etc.;
2.   Physical Accomplishments.  This section would present assets
actually created and services rendered by investments detailed
in Section 1: e.g. hectares rehabilitated and replanted
for smallholders and estates, training facilities completed,
training programs conducted and number of participants, status
of factory development, and status of project-related studies;
3.   Yields, Production, Marketing and Prices.  Data would be
presented in this section for project sub-borrowers and also
for the industry as a whole. To complete this section, PMU
would rely on reports from extension officers, factories,
and government statistical agencies;
4.   Financial Performance.  For project sub-borrowers, inform-
ation would be presented on financial benefits of project
participation, and on sub-loan repayments. Cost/benefit
analysis should be conducted on the basis of data presented
in Section 3.
The format of this report and the methodology to be used in its
preparation would be agreed during initial project supervision.

ANNEX 10
INDONESIA
SMALLHOLDER AN;D PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
Nursery Program
1.        All major replanting and replacement planting under the project
would be done using VP material. Only in the early stages of the project
would some seed material be used (for 150 ha) to avoid delay in the planting
schedule. VP plant material in Indonesia is limited to stock mother bushes
held by the Research Institute for Estates Crops (RIEC). With PT XII and
XIII both engaged in tea rehabilitation, VP plant material from RIEC is in
constant demand. To meet the present and projected shortage private and
government estates must begin to establish their own nurseries, using RIEC
cuttings. Under the proposed project, it would also be essential for
the PMU to establish material requirements for the rehabilitation program.
Since mother bushes require 3 years from initial planting to yield cuttings,
these nurseries must be started without delay.
2.        Ten ha of multiplication plots would be established in 1973 to
provide cuttings for nurseries beginning in 1975/76. About 4 ha of nursery
plots would be established during 1973 to provide planting material in 1974.
Nurseries would be increased to 15 ha by 1975. The annual output of
the multiplication plots would permit an increase in plantings from 500 ha
to 5,000 ha per annum, but additional private nursery facilities would be
required in the last 2 years of the project, for the rooting of these cuttings.
Until 1976/77 part of the planting requirements would have to be supplied
from outside the project mainly from the RIEC and some government and private
estates. A number of estates have proven material in leaf production. These
could be "run up" to supply cuttings. Plant requirements and sources are
indicated in Table 1. To perform clonal selection for PMU nurseries, to
identify all possible sources of supply, and to advise on the establishment
of nurseries, Government has extended the contracts of experts of the U. K.
Overseas Development Agency (ODA). Their engagement does not represent a
cost to the project.
3.        A list of vegetative propagated clonal material available in West
Java is presented in Table 2. Clones in groups A and B would be suitable
for immediate planting and those in group C would require further nursery
trials before planting is recommended. The table provides a rank/order
comparison of available material as a means of evaluating critical characteris-
tics. Values range from 5 (exceptional) to 1 (unsatisfactory).

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
Smallholder Credit
A. Procedures
1.        The system and procedures for extending credit to smallholders
under the proposed project would be similar to those now in effect under
the Improved Bimas Rice Intensification Program. Some modifications have
beer proposed to account for the differences arising from the fact that
tea is a perennial crop whereas rice is annual. Disbursement and col-
lection periods would be 5 years and 20 years, respectively, rather than
1 year as for rice.
2.        Brief Description.  Credit to smallholders would be extended
principally in kind (approximately 80%), the balance being monthly cash pay-
ments to meet added labor costs under the project. Authorization to receive
supply credit would be by way of certificate detailing the types and quantities
of materials to be issued. This certificate, signed by the Village Unit
Mantri (Manager) of BRI, and based on technical recommendations of the ex-
tension officer, would be surrendered to the supplier upon receipt of the
specified materials. The supplier in turn would submit the certificate to
the BRI for payment. Cash payments would be made by BRI directly to the
farmer. Technical supervision of sub-borrowers would be the responsibility
of the extension officers of the PMU, but accounting and financial super-
vision would be the responsibility of BRI.  An Accounting Systems Specialist
would assist BRI in establishing effective accounting and supervision pro-
cedures.
Detailed Procedures
3.        (Step 1)  A smallholder wishing to participate in the project would
contact the extension officer assigned to his desa and request a field
inspection of the area proposed for improvement.
4.        (Step 2)  Upon field inspection and such further consultation as
might be required, the extension officer would prepare technical recommenda-
tions for the area to be improved. A summary of these recommendations,
expressed in terms of the types of quantities of inputs required, would be
entered on the smallholders loan application form and signed by the extension
officer.



ANNEX 13
Page 2
5.        (Step 3)  The smallholder would then complete the application form
and submit it to the village unit of BRI.
6.        (Step 4)  Credit inspection would be conducted by BRI staff and
would include confirmation from the Village Headman (Lura), in writing,
that the applicant is entitled to cultivate the properties listed for in-
clusion in the project.
7.        (Step 5)  Upon approval of his loan application, the smallholder
would enter into a loan agreement with BRI, and would assign to BRI such
collateral as is deemed necessary by the bank to secure the specified loan
amount. 1/ This agreement would be subject to annual confirmation through-
out its duration, by the extension officer to ensure conformity with recom-
mended husbandry practices, and by BRI staff to ensure satisfactory credit
rating and the maintenance of the specified collateral.
8.        (Step 6)  Staff of the BRI village or mobile unit would then
prepare certificates for the borrower's material input requirements for the
first year as specified in the contract. Separate certificates would be
required for planting material and for chemical inputs since different
suppliers would be involved for each. Certificates would be signed by
the BRI Mantri, and issued to the sub-borrower. 2/
9.        (Step 7)  The smallholder would then present these certificates
to the designated supplier to receive the specified types and quantities
of inputs. To minimize the cost of input distribution and the uncertainty
of compliance with quantity specifications, technical recommendations should
be tailored to permit the distribution of whole packages of material wherever
possible.
10.       (Step 8)  The smallholder would endorse the certificate as proof
of having received the specified types and quantities of inputs, and sur-
render it to the supplier.
11.       (Step 9)  The supplier would then prepare an invoice for the
materials released in exchange for the certificate, using prices specified
1/ In most cases, the principal collateral would be claims against future
crops. However, if BRI, on the basis of its credit investigation is
unable to extend the credit specified in the loan application, an
amended application may be approved, in consultation with the extension
officer, such amendment to cover a different or reduced area of land
so as to reduce the credit requirement without jeopardizing the technical
integrity of the input recommendations.
2/ Batching of certificates for signature and issue would greatly reduce
administrative costs, and would not effect the benefit to the smallholder.
However, certificates must be at the disposal of the smallholder in
sufficient time to permit the collection and applications of material
inputs at the optimum time of the growing season.



ANNEX 13
Page 3
in the supply contract with the PM.U. 1/ The invoice with the certificate
attached would be submitted to the local BRI unit for reimbursement. At the
discretion of the supplier, certificates could be bunched and a common invoice
submitted, itemized by type of input.
12.       (Step 10)  Inasmuch as prior approval for this credit would already
have been granted by BRI, disbursement could be made within several days
of invoice receipt by the bank. Inspection by the bank at this point would
require only:
(a) verification that invoice and certificate amounts were
consistent; and
(b) verification that certificate amounts were in accordance
with those specified in the respective loan agreements.
Such inspection would be conducted by staff of the village
units, but the cash requirements are such that actual
disbursement probably would be handled by the supervising
branch office.
13.       (Step 11)  The cash payment to the smallholders credit would be
disbursed monthly on a prorated schedule based on the incurrence of labor
expenses as specified in the loan agreement. The village unit would be
expected to disburse these funds, and would probably require 1 week notice
of intent to collect by the smallholder.
14.       (Step 12)  Certificates and cash authorizations for each year
covered by the loan agreement would be prepared annually by the village unit
staff, by a date sufficiently early in the season to permit the timely
collection and application of inputs. Each certificate would require:
signature of the village unit mantri confirming the satisfactory credit
and collateral position of the smallholder. Before the preparation of cer-
tificates, however, the local extension officer would be required to con-
firm in writing the use of proper husbandry practices by the smallholder
during the previous season.
15.       (Step 13)  Prior to the issue of certificates, village unit staff
would submit to the Lura a list of names and properties to be included in
the year's disbursements. Signature on this list by the Lura would confirm
the continuing rights of those listed to cultivate the specified properties.
16.       (Step 14)  Upon receipt of signatures as specified in 12 and 13
(above), village unit staff would then release certificates to smallholders
and the procedure of 7 through 11 (above) would be repeated.
1/ These prices would have formed the basis for estimating total credit
requirements at the time of application. Significant price changes might
require amendments to the subloan agreement with respect to the collateral
assigned as loan security.



ANNEX 13
Page 4
17.       (Step 15)  The collection of principal and accrued interest on all
credit whether extended in cash or kind would be made by the village unit
of BRI, in cash, directly from the smallholder in accordance with the schedule
set out or duly revised in the loan agreement. 1/
1/ Revision of the original repayment schedule could be made in recognition
of crop failure or individual financial difficulties. In the former
case, the extension service should be consulted to determine the extent
of crop failure in terms of area effected and yield reductions, and
thereby to establish a suitable revision of the repayment schedule.
Accelerated repayment should be without bonus to BRI.

B. Draft Proposed Accounting System
for Smallholder Sub-loans
18.       To assist BRI in thee administration of the proposed project, the
following accounting system is proposed for the effective control of credit
distribution and collection. Such modifications as are required by law or
the established accounting system of BRI, and those recommended by the
financial advisor, are assumed.
Documents Required
1.   Loan Application
2.   Loan Agreement
3.   Chattel Mortgage (as required by BRI, including ownership
papers)
4.   Credit Authorization
5.   Credit Account Record A
6.   Credit Account Record B
7.   Supply Certificates
8.   Voucher:  credit disbursements (containing cancelled supply
certificates and cash credit receipts)
9.   Credit Report (annual)
10.   Production Performance Report (annual)
11.   Consolidated Project Disbursements Record
19.       All documents except items 5 and 6, "Credit Account Record" and 11,
"Consolidated Disbursement Record" would be contained in a file under the
sub-borrowers name, such files to be kept in the village unit in alphabe-
tical order. Items 5 and 6 would be in the form of single manila cards
maintained separately from the files but in the village unit and in alpha-
betical order. Item 11 would constitute the village unit's current position
record for all credit activities under the project.
20.       Accounting Procedure.  A file in the name of the applicant would
be opened at the time of credit application, and documents 1, 2, and 3 entered
in accordance with the credit procedure outlined in section A of this annex.
21.       Upon approval of the loan application, a Credit Authorization
would be prepared on the basis of the technical recommendations of the
extension officer as set out in the loan application. A sample format of
the Credit Authorization appears as Appendix 1 to this annex. This document
would detail credit authorization by object of expenditure and year of pro-
posed disbursement.



ANNEX 13
Page 6
22.       A Credit Account Record (Type A) would also be prepared at this
time. This card would constitute a running record of disbursements and
collections during the disbursement period. A sample format appears as
Appendix 2 to this annex.
23.       The form on which supply certificates are printed should consist
of 2 sections, separated by a perforated line. One portion would constitute
the supply certificate, to be detached and handed to the sub-borrower: the
other would be the bank's record of certificates distributed and would, by
containing the signature or mark of the sub-borrower, constitute a receipt
for each certificate issued. Forms should bear a unique identification
number which would appear on both the certificates and record portions.
The supply certificate should bear the name and branch of the supplier,
type and quantity specifications for materials covered by the certificates,
and the signature of the BRI village unit mantri or his designated staff
member. The record portion of the form, to be retained by the village unit,
should contain the same information as the supply certificate, but should
also bear he signature or mark of the sub-borrower as proof of certificate
receipt. A sample format for this document appears as Appendix 3 to this
annex.
24.       Cash disbursements to smallholders should be made in accordance
with a prorated monthly schedule of authorized labor expenditures. Receipts
signed by the smallholder should be obtained in duplicate, one copy to be
placed in the Credit Disbursement Voucher of the sub-borrowers file, the
other to be filed as a source document for the Consolidated Disbursements
Record of the village unit.
25.       The Consolidated Disbursement Record, which constitutes the
village units current record of transactions under the project, should be
updal:ed weekly. A summary of this record should be submitted monthly to
the branch office of the district. Such a summary should contain:
(a) disbursements and collections for the reporting month
(disbursements to be listed by type of source document);
and
(b) total disbursements and collections during the project to
date (disbursements to be listed by type of source document).
A sample format for the Consolidated Disbursement Record appears as Appendix
4 to this annex.
26.       Other source documents for the Consolidated Disbursements Record
would include invoices from suppliers, attached to their respective payment
authorization slips and receipts for payment. Separate files should be kept
of these documents for each supplier. Payment to suppliers would probably
be made by a credit to the companies' bank accounts, in which case a copy
of the notice of deposit would substitute for the receipt for payment.



ANNEX 13
Page 7
27.       Annual Credit Reports, to be prepared by BRI staff, and annual
Production Performance Reports, to be completed by the extension officer,
should be completed for individual borrowers mid the decision to authorize
the next credit installment made sufficiently early in the season to permit
the timely receipt of inputs by the smallholder. Reports should be based
on the crop year, and their preparation in August-September would facilitate
a better distribution of workload for the village unit staff.
28.       At the end of the disbursements period specified in the Credit
Authorization, Credit Account Record A should be replaced by Credit Account
Record B as the current record of collections for each sub-borrower. A
sample format for type B appears as Appendix 5 to this annex. In practice,
a separate card file should be started for types B, and a transfer tag
affixed to each card in the type A file for which a B card had been prepared.
Eventually, all types A would have corresponding types B, and the original
card file could be moved to dead storage space.
29.       Appendix 6 is a schematic presentation of the relationship among
documents and files discussed in this section.

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
Financial and Operating Results
A. Assumptions
1.        Cost and Prices.  All costs and benefits under the project have
been assessed on an incremental basis over present and projected values
without the project.
2.        Yields and Prices.  Yields and prices are discussed in detail in
Annex 3. A summary of values used in the financial analysis is presented
below:
Yield               Prices (Rp/kg)
Full
Present   Development       Present  1980
Smallholders: (kg made tea/ha)
Rehab. Leaf                  480           730              25       35

3.        Cost of Labour.  All estate and factory labour has been costed at
Rp 110 per day including benefits other than housing. This is somewhat higher
than the actual average for all labor types, which fluctuates seasonally and
among individual enterprises. It is assumed that this margin over actual rates
is sufficient to compensate for real rate increases of 2-3%/year through 1980.
Smallholder hired and family labor has been costed at Rp 85 per day. 1/
However, since this labor force is experiencing real rate increases, real
costs have been raised by 5% per year.
4.        Period of Financial Models.  Field development models have been
based on a 30 year economic life. Properly treated, tea bushes should remain
productive for a much longer period. Factory models are based on a 25 year
period, the economic life of the civil works component. The PMU budget has
been prepared for the 8 years of project disbursement. It is expected that
1/   Rp 85/day is present casual rate, whereas Rp 110/day used for estates
is present rate for permanent employees, including benefits other
than housing.



ANNEX 14
Page 2
the PMU would continue to exist, perhaps in a modified form after the project
period, but its principal role in project execution would have been accom-
plished by that time.
5.        Field Development.  Investment has been defined as the cost of
clearing land plus the full cost for 3 years of replanted tea. For rehabili-
.ated tea the incremental cost for 3 years have been considered.  (See Table
1 .)
B. Financial Returns
6.        Project Management Unit.  Table 2 of this Annex presents a budget
for the PMU over the project period of 8 years. The Table demonstrates the
significance of revenue earnings in the reduction of the net capital
contribution by Government.
7.        Government of Indonesia.  Table 4 presents the projected government
cash flow under the project. Should government provide funds to meet a
portion of BRI's commitment under the project this outflow would be in
addition to those presented in the Table. It is assumed that terms of such
supplemental financing would be sufficient to meet direct costs, and would
not adversely affect tbh financial results of the project to government.
8.        Smallholder Field Development.  Since costs and revenues are
directly related to area, a single model is representative of the benefits
to all smallholders. The model assumes that 1 ha would be developed under
the project, of whiich .4 ha would be replanted and .6 ha would be rehabilitated
by the application of fertilizer, pesticides, and better management techniques.
Yield and price assumptions are discussed in Chapter VI. Replanting has been
phased over 2 years in order that increased yields from rehabilitated bushes
would compensate for uprooted bushes and prevent a significant decline in the
smallholder's cash income. A 2 year fallow period was also included. Hired
and family labor has been costed at the current rate of Rp 85/day and adjusted
for expected real rate increases of 5% per annum through 1980. Based on cost
and benefit comparisons with and without the project, the rate of return on
investment would be 27%, over a 30 year period. Net income from the project
above present levels would enable the borrower to repay the loan of Rp 140,000
at 12% in 10 years after an initial grace period of 5 years. Interest during
the grace period would be paid annually by the borrower. (See Table 5.)
9.        Estate Field Development.  A model of 100 ha was prepared for estate
field development, of wlhich 63 ha would be replanted and 37 ha rehabilitated.
Development has been phased over 6 years to ensure the availability of planting
material and to keep annual development areas within manageable limits. Based
on with/without comparison (Table 6), the model results in a rate of return
of 12% on investment over a 30 year period (Table 7). Net income from the
project would enable the borrower to repay the loan of Rp 23 million at 12%



ANNEX 14

in 10 years, after an 8 year grace period. The longer grace period for
estates reflects the higher proportion of replanting. During the grace
period, interest would be paid annually by the borrower. The rate of return
is considered acceptable on the following grounds:
(i) estimated revenues without the project are optimistic, both in
terms of yield and, as quality declines, price;
(ii)  increased leaf production on estates with factories permit
factory operation at closer to capacity, thereby reducing the
unit cost of made tea which has not been considered in the
analysis; and
(iii)  incremental analysis understates the borrowers ability to
service debt.
10.       Rehabilitated Factories.  The rehabilitation costs differ for each
of the 5 proposed factories, but are within 12% of the US$320,000 average used
for analytical purposes. At the time of appraisal, 2 of the 5 factories were
not operating, and the remaining 3 were producing poor quality tea and encoun-
tering frequent mechanical disorders. A generous estimate of production with-
out the project is 400 tons per factory per year, declining by 25 tons per
year to 250 tons. Net costs and benefits to the project under this assump-
tion yield, conservatively, a 17% rate of return over 25 years (Table 8).
The borrower would be able to repay the US$238,000 loan at 12% over 10 years,
after an initial grace period of 5 years in which interest would be paid
annually by the borrower.
11.       New Factories.  New black tea factory investment in West Java would
yield a 14% rate of return (Table 9). Repayment over 10 years at 12% is
achievable after a 5 year grace period. This rate is considered acceptable
on the following grounds:
(i) production build-up has been phased over 3 years, although
in fact capacity output would probably be achieved at an earlier
date;
(ii)  debt would account for only 70% of total investment and
therefore debt service would not be jeopardized;
(iii)  additional capacity is considered essential in Garut and
Purwakarta to ensure that smallholders derive the maximum
benefit from the project;
(iv)  no provision was made for special marketing provisions which
could increase returns to owners which might integrate
these installations into vertical or horizontal combines;
(v)  financing arrangements could reduce the effective cost of
capital below tuie 12% explicit rate of funds provided under
the project.

that the project management unit would eventually form a permanent part of the Ministry
of Agriculture, its need for project execution would cover a peried of 8 years. The
responsibilities, resources and funding of the unit would probably change after that
time. Budget data exrlude debt service costs.

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
A. Methodology
1.        Costs and Prices  All costs and benefits under the project have
been assessed on an incremental basis over present and projected values
without the project. Production, yield and price assumptions are discussed
in Annex 3. All expenses have been costed at present or projected market
rates except family farm labor, for which a shadow rate of Rp 60/day is used
as opposed to Rp 85/day paid for casual hired labor. Both rates have been
increased by 5% per annum to account for increases in the real cost of labor.
The shadow rate is based on the average daily rate on an annual basis that
casual labor would earn taking into account seasonal fluctuation and
unemployment. Estate labor has been costed at Rp 110/day. A physical
contingency of 5% per annum has been included for the cost of factories.
Price contingencies have been excluded.
B. Benefits
2.        Increased Production  The project would halt the rapid decline in
private sector tea production, and by 1985 would result in an increase of
about 4,000 tons over present production levels. At the expected price of
Rp 300/kg for black tea, this increase, plus the production compensating for
projected declines without the project, would have an annual wholesale value
of Rp 3.0 billion. A small quantity of project leaf would find its way into
the green tea market and reduce, slightly, the overall production value.
Assuming a 4% annual growth in per capita domestic tea consumption, the pro-
ject production would not be sufficient to maintain the present level of net
export availability. However, only a slight decrease would occur, rather than
the 35% reduction in tea exports and foreign exchange earnings projected in
the absence of the project (see Annex 3, Table 5).
4.        Increased Farm Incomes  As a result of increased production and qua-
lity, smallholders with 1 ha under the project would realize an increase in
annual net income of Rp 81,000 at full development, (from Rp 36,000 to Rp
117,000). Expected declines without the project would increase the net bene-
fit to Rp 97,000 per year. These estimates are based on constant 1972 prices,
except for a leaf quality premium of Rp 10/kg, and a real cost increase for
family and hired labour of Rp 18/day by 1980. Estates net Income from leaf
production would increase by Rp 9 million per year per 100 ha (Rp 11 million,
adjusted for expected yield declines). Leaf processed within the estate has



ANNEX 15
Page 2
been assigned a transfer value equal to the projected market price. The
overall effect of the project on net farm income would be annual increases
of Rp 970 million to smallholders, and Rp 335 million to estates.
5.        Employment Effects  Estimates of jobs created by the project are
complicated by the existence of underemployment in farm families, and by the
social practice of engaged hired labor for a standard share of harvest work,
despite such underemployment. Smallholder development would create an addi-
tional 5,800 man years of work at full development. This represents an in-
crease of about 70% over present requirements. Nearly 1,000 man years of this
increase would be taken up as a result of reduced underemployment, which is
estimated to be equivalent to that quantity of labor hired by social custom.
Net employment created would be 4100 man year equivalent, although the work
would actually be performed primarily during the 9 month growing season.
Estate field development would create about 1900 man year equivalents of work,
and prevent declines in employment of a further 3200 man years as estates area
and production declined in the absence of the project. Employment in rehabili-
tated factories would not change in total, although there would be some shifting
among menial job types. New factories would create about 100 positions, inclu-
sive of leaf collection. In total, the project would create over 5,000 jobs
for field and factory workers.
6.        Institutional Improvements  In addition to the direct financial
benefits to sub-borrower-, the project would contribute to the strengthening
of the smallholder extension service. Staff qualifications and operating pro-
cedures developed within the PICh would serve as models for the improvement of
extension services to other regions and crops. Training facilities and pro-
grams under the project could also serve as examples of the needs and possi-
bilities relating to other sectors. Furthermore, technical assistance to BRI
would improve the capacity of its Central and West Java field staff to appraise
and supervise tree-crops credit and the management study could result in sub-
stantial improvements in BRI's organization and operating procedures.
C. Rate of Return Calculations
7.        The table of this annex presents the incremental cash flows generated
by the project under the assumption specified in para 1. The rate of return
would be 15% on total investment except the BRI management study. The over-
all rate of return on investment in nurseries, field development, and fac-
tories would be 23%. Rate sensitivity is presented at the foot of Table 1.

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
Bank Rakjat Indonesia
1.        Bank Rakjat Indonesia (BRI), which has endured many changes since
it was first established in 1896, is the oldest rural bank in the country.
It was first called BRI in 1945, integrated into the single state bank in
1965, and reformed in its present shape with a new charter at the end of
1968.
2.        Its main function is to provide rural credit and banking facilities,
and thereon to assist the govenrment with agricultural development policies
and programs. BRI gives credit to agricutlural cooperatives, farmers,
fishermen and other agricultural enterprises. It also lends on commercial
terms, with emphasis on cooperatives, to rural industries, small-scale
enterprises and to finance handicrafts. In the last year or so, an
increasing share of its business has been in transport and tourism. It also
provides normal banking services, including acceptance of current, savings,
and time deposits. It administers government credit for rural development
programs (i.e. small-scale irrigation and farm roads). BRI supervises
village banks and paddy banks (at a small loss) under policies and procedures
set by Bank Indonesia. It administers the current improved BIMAS program
with Bank Indonesia funds. Additionally it now provides limited medium-
term inivestment credit for improvement of rural infrastructure, including
farm mechanization, rice processing and storage.
3.        Operations and Finance.  Data prior to 1969 are unobtainable.
Major operational data are available only for 1969 and 1970. Loans disbursed
and outstanding for the two years are given in Table 1. Loan disbursements
are increasing in volume, but trade and services, rather than agriculture,
now account for over half BRI's operations.  Mediumrterm investment credit,
started late in 1969, has gone mainly to rice millers, hullers and for small
irrigation works. The 1970 decline in advances for agriculture, livestock,
fisheries, and cooperatives, was partly due to a reduction in advances to
cooperatives. Advances to PN Pertani were for fertilizer stocks, and were
guaranteed by Bank Indonesia. The large increase in BIMAS advances in 1970
was due to BRI taking over credit responsibilities under the improved BIMAS
program.

4.        BRI has an authorized capital of Rp 300 million, all government
owned, but as yet none has been paid in. A special committee is reviewing
the capital structure of all state-owned banks. It has not yet reported,
but it is expected to recommend Rp 11 billion as BRI's equity capital. Main
sources of new funds are Bank Indonesia and deposits, as is shown in Table 2.
The government's successful financial stabilization programs have produced
a useful increase in deposits from the private sector from 1970 onwards.

5.        At the end of 1970, BRI had reserves and retained earnings of
Rp 774 million, after starting at the end of 1968 with a net loss of Rp 36a
million. BRI's financial statements for 1969 and 1970 are at Appendix 1,
and income and expenditure statements at Appendix 2. State banks have been
required to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of 30%. BRI's was 54% at the
end of 1969 and 43% at the end of 1970. The excess liquidity was partly due
to slow communication with some outlying branches, but also to inadequate
and cumbersome accounting systems and reporting procedures. BRI made an
operating profit of Rp 1.1 billion in 1969, and Rp 1.3 billion in 1970.
Due to increased administrative expenses (for expanded staff training and



ANNEX 17
Page 3
improved office facilities), profit for 1971 is expected to be about Rp 0.8
billion.
6.        Organization and Management.  The present arrears position of the
Bank's loan portfolio is unsatisfactory, around one-fourth of all loans
outstanding. The majority of loans overdue at the end of 1970 arose from
the rice intensification programs, and earlier lending to cooperatives and
the private sector. Although BRI apparently does not show its loans
receivable by age, about 8% of all overdues, or 2% of loans outstanding,
are considered as bad debts.
7.        BRI's Management Board consists of one President Director and
three Managing Directors, each in charge of a group of head office sections.
The Board is supervised by a 3-man Council, two from BAPPENAS and one from
the Ministry of Finance, all appointed for 3 years. At the end of 1970, the
total number of employees was about 10,000 (including village and mobile
unit staff), of which 1,500 were at head office. Also at that time, BRI
had its head office (in Jakarta), 13 regional offices, 218 branch offices,
77 sub-branch offices, 537 village units and 509 mobile units. By the end
of 1971, village units had increased to 1,071, mobile units to 578.
8.        The present organizational structure was inherited from BRI's 1967
predecessor, and has only been marginally modified to cope with changed cir-
cumstances. Recording and operating procedures are outdated, and there is
much overlapping between sections. Office equipment is inadequate. There
are excess personnel in some sections and shortages, particularly of
qualified and trained officers, in others. These short-comings often prevent
appropriate and timely decisions by BRI's management. To remedy them, the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) has agreed to finance the bulk of the cost of
a modernization project for BRI, with particular emphasis on accounting
equipment and procedures.
9.        Modernization Project.  In 1971, ADB agreed to lend BR1 US$3.4
million, being the foreign exchange cost of a US$4.4 million project, lasting
about 3-1/2 years, to modernize BRI. The project consists of some modification
and consolidation of sections within head office, the adoption of improved
accounting, auditing and reporting systems and procedures, and the initial
mechanization of 126 branch offices in E. Java. ADB's loan finances (a) the
foreign exchange cost of consultants, who will help improve accounting
systems and train staff and (b) the procurement of adding, calculating
and bookkeeping machines. Three consultants assist in project implementation,
and one evaluates BRI's medium-term agricultural credit program, makes
staffing and procedural recommendations, establishes appraisal criteria and
identifies a number of credit projects. The major benefits of the project
should include savings in administrative expenses, improved quality of
accounting staff, better service to customers, faster flow of management
information, improved loan repayments, and reduced excess liquidity.
10.       As of November 15, 1972, contracts had been signed for the purchase
of accounting equipment for East and Central Java. Equipment for West Java
will be purchased during 1973. Accounting systems have been designed and
the training of operators and supervisors has begun. The consultant examining



ANNEX 17
Page 4
BRI's medium-term credit program has not as yet reported, and there is some
uncertainty within ADB as to the ability of the incumbent to make useful
recommendations within the period of his assignment.
i1.       Proposed ProJect Assistance.  To assist BRI in the effective
implementation of the proposed Tea credit, to ensure effective administration
and supervision of sub-loans, and to minimize bad debts under the project,
technical assistance in the form of training for BRI staff would be required.
Funds have been provided to train BRI staff involved in the project in
technical aspects of tea cultivation. This training would be carried out at
the Tea Research Institute of Bogor. An internationally recruited consultant
would be engaged to advise BRI in establishing an accounting system for
the project and to advise operating staff on the appraisal and supervision
of project sub-loans.
12.       Proposed Management Study.  A management study of BRI has also been
included in the proposed project, the objective of which would be to recommend
ways and means of improving the capability of BRI to meet the growing demand
for medium- and long-term rural credit and bankine s-rvices. Improvement
under the modernization project would be fully integrated into the study's
recommendations. Terms of reference acceptable to IDA would be established
upon completion of the Credit Review scheduled for October, 1973.
13.       Rice Intensification Program.  The improved BIMAS program was
started as a pilot project in Jogjakarta in 1969/70, and its success led to
its adoption on a large scale in 1970/71 as a substitute for previous programs.
Its main feature is that individual farmers rather than villages as a whole
are eligible for seasonal loans for rice production. Loans are available
from village and mobile units of BRI. Each village unit covers from 600 to
1,000 ha, farmed by 1,800 to 3,000 farmers living in about five adjoining
villages. Each unit employs three persons: an agricultural officer, bookkeeper,
and casheir. Mobile units, operated from BRI branch offices, serve the
more widely scattered villages. These are essentially similar to village
units, but instead of being permanently located, they visit different villages
in rotation. The total number of village units under this program will not
exceed about 1,300, and mobile units about 600, so that most of the anticipated
expansion has already taken place.
14.       Under the new BIMAS program, loan procedures have been simplified.
Farmers make individual loan applications, and these are countersigned by
the village headmen, who confirm the right of the applicant to exploit the
property listed in the application. After a cursory credit check by BRI,
with a total lapse time from application of as little as one week, loans are
processed and approved in one day. Release slips enable farmers to obtain
fertilizers and pesticides from local merchants, and BRI provides a pre-
determined cash credit for living expenses. Loan policy is flexible.
Maxuii,mn amounts per ha for input and for living expenses have been laid

down, but farmers are free to choose the composition of their loan within
these limits, provided it shows promise of improving production. 1/
15.       Loan details up to the end of 1971 under this program are given
in Table 3.  For the wet season, 1970/71, the average size of loan was
Rp 8,400 per ha, or Rp 6,400 per farmer. Although disbursement of loans
for the wet season, 1971/72, was not complete by December 31, 1971, the
average to that date for that season was Rp 8,500 per ha, or Rp 6,700 per
farmer. The average area financed per farmer was 0.76 ha in 1970/71, and
0.79 ha in 1971/72. These figures suggest there has been no substantial
change in the credit pattern over these two major seasons. The average
number of farmers financed per unit (village and mobile) for the wet season
1970/71 was about 1,250. Comparable figures for 1971/72 are not yet
available.

/4   Loans still being disbursed.
16.       The program has not been going sufficiently long to show any
long-term trends in repayment rates.  The difference between those for
1969/70 and 1970/71 (97% and 79%) shows clearly that when a credit program
of this sort is rapidly expanded the repayment rate falls. However,
repayments are still being made for 1970/71, and the final rate is likely to
be over 80%. When compared with the BIMAS Gotong Rojong Program, the
improved BIMAS program does confirm that controlled credit to individual
farmers is more manageable than uncontrolled group credit, provided there
is some basic infrastructure through which credit may be channelled.
However, a repayment rate of just over 80%, if sustained for a number of
years and not improved upon, is unsatisfactorily low. With improvements
in the efficiency of the village and mobile units, coupled with a higher
quality of administration in BRI as a result of the recent ADB loan and
later proposals, the prospects of improving the repayment rate are good.
1/   For example, a farmer would not be allowed cash for living expenses only,
but would have to take at least a minimum amount of fertilizer.

17.       The headquarters of IlRI's operations in West Java is the regional
office at Bandung. Under this office, there are 20 branches, 41 sub-branches,
300 village units, and 72 mobile units. A summary of the Bank's activities
in West Java appears below in Table 4.

Interest rates on deposits range from 0 to 9% on demand deposits and from
12% to 18% on time deposits. Interest rates on loans are specified by
Bank Indonesia.
18.       Loan authority within BRI is very centralized in West Java as it
is in other provinces. Village unit chiefs are only permitted to authorize
loans under the BIMAS scheme, and these are limited to Rp 100,000 per
borrower. All other working capital applications must be referred to the
branch office. Credit authority varies among branch managers, but in no
case exceeds Rp 1 million. Applications over Rp 1 million must be sent
to Bandung for consideration, and those exceeding Rp 5 million must be
forwarded to Jakarta. All applications for investment credit, regardless
of size, must be sent to Jakarta for approval. There are only 3 loan
appraisal officers in Bandung to cover all of West Java. The only technical
staff in West Java is an Agricultural Engineer who is assigned as the
Chief of the BIMAS Section, Bandung. Technical advise is sought, to the
extent possible, from relevant government authorities at the time of
appraisal. Supervision of BRI loans also suffers from a grave shortage of
qualified staff. Although a regular reporting schedule is established
for each borrower, interviews with both borrowers and bank officials
confirm that these schedules are seldom adhered to, and furthermore, the
repurt data often remains unverified.
