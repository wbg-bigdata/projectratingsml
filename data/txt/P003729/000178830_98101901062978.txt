SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
(CREDIT 400-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the project completion report for the Indonesia
Smallholder and Private Estate Tea Project, for which Credit 400-IND was
approved in June 1973 for the sum of US$7.8 million. The Credit was closed
on December 31, 1982. At March 31, 1983 an amount of US$7.7 million had
been disbursed.
This report was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional
Office following a mission to Indonesia in March 1983, and reflects infor-
mation made available by the various agencies connected with the project,
namely Team Khusus of the Directorate-General of Estates, which monitored
the project, the Project Management Unit, the agency responsible for the
project, and Bank Rakyat Indonesia, which administered the subloans to the
participants. A most useful document was a draft Project Completion Report
prepared in February 1983 by Team Khusus. Other sources of information
included the Appraisal Report (No. 124a-IND) dated May 16, 1973, the Credit
and Project Agreements dated June 22, 1973, and subsequent amendments to the
Credit Agreement. Supervision reports, correspondence with the Borrower and
internal IDA memoranda as contained in relevant IDA files have also been
consulted. The PCR was substantially completed and submitted to the Opera-
tions Evaluation Department in April 1983.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments
on June 9, 1983. No comments were received.
The valuable assistance provided to those who prepared this report
by the Government of Indonesia and the World Bank Resident Staff in
Indonesia is gratefully acknowledged. Special mention must be made of the
DirectorGeneral of Estates and his Team Khusus staff, of the Project Manager
and the PMU staff, and of the staff of Bank Rakyat Indonesia.
The project has not been subjected to an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED).

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
(CREDIT 400-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
The project, approved by the Board in 1973, was designed to
increase the productivity c,f the private sector tea industry, including
smallholders and private estates, mainly in West Java, in order to meet the
demand of a growing domestic market, particularly of good quality black tea.
Generally this objective was achieved, though appraisal targets were not
entirely met. The emphasis at appraisal on black tea, as distinct from green
tea, has not fully materialized.
Implementation by PMU and BRI was generally satisfactory, though
slower than anticipated because of the project's organizational arrange-
ments. The project period had to be extended by two years and the closing
date by almost one year. Ihe selection of participants was a major problem
and participants preferred complete replanting to field rehabilitation.
Total project cost was Rp 10.7 billion, a 68% cost overrun due mainly to
inflation. Disbursement was very slow, but picked up in the last 3 years.
By April 25, 1983 US$7.7 m, or 99% of the Credit, had been disbursed. On
the whole, field development was more successful than factory development,
and smallholders performed better than private estates. Training and
extension services proved very beneficial. Technical assistance was
generally most useful. IDA was supportive and helpful. Though the World
Bank Group no longer assists tea projects, there is a need to continue tea
rehabilitation on the favorable parts of West and Central Java, and the
Government has indicated it will continue the program started under the
project through a modified organization.
In spite of achievements somewhat lower than appraisal targets, the
recalculated economic rate of return is 16.9%, as compared to the appraisal
figure of 15%. In the long run the net annual income of the average small-
holder from tea will exceed appraisal estimates.
On balance the project has been substantially successful and
has achieved most of its main objectives. The following were some of the
points of particular interest:
- the selection of participants was a major problem (para. 2.01);
- participants preferred complete replanting to field rehabilitation
(para. 2.02);



- iv -
- major cost overruns were mainly due to inflation (para. 3.01); and
- some implementation problems resulted from the project's
organizational arrangements (paras. 5.01-5.07 and 7.02).

SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT
(CREDIT 400- IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Smallholders and private estates in West and Central Java produce
about a third of Indonesia's tea. While Government-owned estates produce
mainly black tea, most of which is exported, smallholders and private
estates produce mostly green tea for the domestic market. The Indonesian
tea industry declined sharply after World War II, particularly in the
sixties, as a result of war disruptions, subsequent neglect and a shortage
of capital and technology. Government-owned estates were rehabilitated and
recovered, with assistance from IDA Credit 259-IND (US$15 million; September
1971), but the private tea sector continued to decline at the rate of 10%
p.a. and was in critical need of rehabilitation. The Government (GO)
commissioned a detailed survey of the smallholder and private estate tea
sectors, which was carried out in late 1971 under finance from Credit 259.
The present project was the outcome of that study. Appraisal took place in
late 1972, an IDA credit of US$7.8 million was approved in June 1973, and
the project became effective in November 1973.
1.02      The project was designed to increase the productivity of the private
sector tea industry, mairnly in West Java, in order to meet the demand of a
growing domestic market, particularly of good quality black tea. This objec-
tive would be achieved over 8 years through: (a) the rehabilitation or
replanting of 10,000 ha of smallholder and 3,200 ha of private estate tea
gardens; (b) the rehabilitation of 5 existing and the construction of 2 new
black tea factories; and (c) the provision of technical assistance to the
Project Management Unit 'PMU) and Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). At negotia-
tions in April 1973 agreement was reached on the following issues: (i)
strengthening of the project organization and management with the creation of
a Project Management Board (PMB) and a PMU, the appointment of PMU consultants
with full executive responsibiities, the provision of an attractive compensa-
tion to PMU staff, and the establishment of Advisory Committees; (ii) the
principle of eventual corporate ownership of the two new factories by small-
holder cooperatives; (iii) the regulation of the price of smallholder tea
according to an agreed formula; and (iv) agreed procedures on procurement,
financing and distribution of fertilizers and pesticides. Conditions of
effectiveness included the establishment of a PMB and a PMU and the appoint-
ment of a Project Manager and internationally recruited consultants to assist
the PMU in project execution and to advise and train counterpart staff.
II. IMPLEMENTATION
2.01      It took 6 months to meet the conditions of effectiveness, but
despite various constraints the strengthening of management had a very
positive impact on project implementation. As expected, progress was very
slow over the first few years because of difficulties in introducing insti-
tutional changes and the novelty to farmers and BRI of long-term credit.
The main problem was in i:he selection of participants. PMU helped small-
holders in the preparation of a large number of applications that proved
unacceptable to and were rejected by BRI. The total number of applications



- 2 -
rose from 577 in 1975 to a peak of 3,124 in 1980, while the percentage of
acceptance rose from 44 in 1975 to 74 in 1981. The main reason for rejection
by BRI was unsatisfactory land title, but BRI also had stringent requirements
for collateral on immovable property and rejected many applications because
of minor indebtedness under other schemes. As a result the very poorest and
most needy farmers were often precluded from financial assistance and the
average level of participants was probably higher than originally envisaged.
Similar problems were encountered with private estates and factories. BRI
rejected most of the applications presented through PMU. Delays were caused
by disputed titles of ownership and the reluctance of owners to commit
themselves to investment in black tea manufacture. In fact a high proportion
of incremental tea leaf produced under the project has so far gone into the
manufacture of green, not black, tea, but as the domestic green tea market
is limited and none of the Indonesian green tea is exported, it does not
really matter very much to what use any particular tea leaf is put provided
overall black tea production picks up - which is one of the main objectives
of the project.
2.02      Annex 1 shows the physical achievements of the project.   It will
be noticed that the participants were not keen on field rehabilitation (26%
of appraisal targets for smallholders and 0% for private estates), while
complete replanting was much more popular (159% of appraisal targets for
smallholders and 60% for private estates). Actually it is likely that about
10% of so-called replanting was in fact new planting. A majority of small-
holders and all the private estates believed, probably correctly, that it
was more advantageous to replant completely rather than to rehabilitate by
infilling. Project targets were revised several times to take into account
the preference of participants and the speed of processing of applications
by BRI. Factory development suffered the most delays. Rehabilitation of
all but one of the five factories only started in 1980 and work on two
factories was not quite completed in March 1983. In two cases the so-called
rehabilitation amounts in fact to the construction of a brand-new factory.
It was difficult to overcome the reluctance of PTP XII and PTP XIII to
construct a new black tea factory each to process smallholder tea.
Eventually PTP XII agreed, but not as a subsidiary company as originally
intended, to accept a loan under the project to build a new factory at
Panglejar with an initial capacity of 1,000 t of made tea p.a., to process
(initially) 50% smallholder tea and 50% its own tea. PTP XIII did build a
new factory as well to process smallholder tea at Taragu, but with
second-hand equipment and financed under its own funds. The global project
objectives were thus achieved. However, it appears unlikely that either PTP
will be willing to hand over their factory to smallholder cooperatives in
future.
2.03      Procurement was to follow standard IDA procedures, except for
machinery and equipment for factory rehabilitation where prudent shopping
was allowed. IDA, however, agreed to waive ICB for the procurement of
inputs to subborrowers, not only because it proved to be unduly slow, but
mainly because this generally resulted in higher prices, and P.T. Pertani, a
government company, was allowed to act as supplier and distributor of
fertilizers and agro-chemicals.



- 3 -
2.04       The project period was extended by about two years and the closinm.
date by almost one year to allow targets to be met and the credit to be
fully disbursed.
III. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
3.01       Total project cost (Annex 2) was Rp 10.7 billion (US$19.5 m), a
68% cost overrun over the appraisal estimate of Rp 6.4 billion (US$15.4 m),
despite lower physical achievements in field and factory development.
Inflation was responsible for 45% of total project cost as compared to the
price contingency of 27% allowed for at appraisal. During the (extended)
project period the following cost increases occurred: nursery stock from
Rp 8 to Rp 25 per plant; daily wages from Rp 100 to Rp 400; a new factory
(PTP XII) from Rp 308 m to Rp 1,136 m; PMU expenditures from Rp 90 m to
202 m; and operating costs per participant from Rp 14,000 to Rp 39,000.
3.02       Disbursement (Annex 3) was extremely slow.    By the end of the
seventh year (FY79/80) total disbursement was only 26% of the credit as
compared to the appraisal estimate of 87%. Disbursement picked up during the
last three years and by April 25, 1983 US$7.7i m or 99% of the Credit had been
disbursed. Several reallocations were made between categories of expendi-
ture. Under Categories I (field development) and III (PMU) amounts disbursed
were 208% and 153%, respectively, of the original allocations, while under
Categories II (factories) and IV (consultants and training) they were 93% and
71%, respectively, of the original allocations. The percentage disbursed
under Category I was increased from 85% to 100% towards the end of the
project.
3.03      Project accour,ts were generally well kept, and audits were satis-
factory and submitted regularly, though sometimes late.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01       From 1975 to 1981 nearly 15,000 applications were received from
smallholders, of which 8,462 or 57% were accepted. 5,570 ha (54% of applica-
tions) were replanted and 1,720 ha (57% of applications) were rehabilitated.
However, it is estimatec! that approximately 2,000 unsuccessful applicants
followed the example of the participants and improved their tea gardens,
though they received no financial assistance from the project. To ensure
better growth and higher yields only vegetative propagation of selected clones
was used in tea nurseries. PMU nurseries were gradually phased out as
smallholders were able to produce their own planting stock equally well and
more cheaply using the planting kits issued them by PMU. 92% of replantings
were between 0.25 and 1.00 ha in extent, while 25% of rehabilitated gardens
were over I ha in extent. Generally the tea gardens replanted or rehabili-
tated are of a high standard, particularly where conditions are favorable
(e.g., around Cilukuk), but some are still below standard. Towards the end of
the project, but before the volcanic eruptions of Mt. Galunggung in 1982, a



- 4 -
PMU survey revealed that 82% of the gardens were in good or fair condition.
Excessive intercropping (e.g., with cabbage) is practiced in some areas
(Garut) and this may reduce tea yields. On the whole the farmers used
fertilizers and agrochemicals satisfactorily, though they often have a ten-
dency to wait for an attack before applying pesticides. The 1982 volcanic
eruptions affected smallholders around Tasikmalaya and Garut: 139 farmers
suffered a total loss, while many more suffered some temporary, sometimes
considerable, loss in yield and revenue. Random sampling by PMU showed that
annual yields of made tea in replanted gardens were more or less in line
with or slightly higher than appraisal estimates (1,135 kg/ha at six years
and 1,400 kg/ha at eight years), while yields in rehabilitated gardens were
consistently much higher than appraisal estimates (1,000-1,200 kg/ha after
three years as compared to 730 kg/ha).
4.02      Field development of the five private estates consisted entirely
of replanting. Performance has been very variable, depending on the readi-
ness of the particular estate to accept PMU advice and improved techniques.
One particularly cooperative estate (125 ha) achieved good results, another
one (225 ha) achieved generally satisfactory results, a third one (400 ha)
obtained variable results ranging from excellent to poor, while two estates
(210 ha and 250 ha) accepted loans but no technical advice and have had poor
results.
4.03      Five factories were "rehabilitated" under the project, but in fact
two of these are new and received loans to cover the cost of machinery,
equipment and power supply. The new combined full annual capacity of these
five factories is 3,800 t of made black tea, while their new potential
production after their replanting program is 4,050 t and neighboring small-
holders' production is estimated at almost 800 t. The surplus production of
about 1,000 t will go to green tea factories.
4.04      The new PTP factory at Panglejar will start operating by the
middle of 1983. With an initial annual capacity of 1,000 t of made black
tea, it is committed to accept 50% of smallholder tea, though its own
production after its replanting program is 1,000 t (formerly 500 t).
Smallholder tea production in the area is 2,300 t. Most of the surplus
production will go to green tea factories. The milling capacity of
Panglejar could easily be doubled, with little additional machinery;
adequate space has been allowed for this expansion.
4.05      The intention of regulating the price of smallholder tea according
to an agreed formula was never implemented. Most smallholder leaf (often of
poor quality, because of rough plucking) goes to green tea factories for
lower prices than can be obtained from black tea factories, where standards
are higher. This is mostly a matter of choice for the farmers and little
can be done about it, apart from better prices for leaf by black tea
factories, themselves constrained by relatively low export tea prices.

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.01       The PMB, located in Jakarta, was set up for the formulation of
policies and for ensuring proper coordination. In fact it met verv rarely and
was ineffective, though a subcommittee of 4-5 members did meet regularly.
5.02      As provided for at appraisal, Advisory Committees were established
at the kabupaten and kecamatan levels. The provincial Governor also called
meetings from time to time to discuss tea problems.
5.03      PMU dealt with technical matters while BRI was responsible for
financial matters.   This separation of functions inevitably led to some
problems and delays inherent in such a system. Nevertheless PMU performed
creditably on the whole and implemented the project satisfactorily. Its
recordkeeping and accounting were satisfactory and its reports and audited
statements of accounts were submitted regularly to IDA. In fact its
internal records were, if anything, too elaborate and cumbersome. In spite
of initial difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff PMU eventually
developed into a reasonably efficient organization. The maximum strength of
the staff reached 128 as compared to the appraisal estimate of 225. However,
the ratio of staff to number of participants proved just about right. PMTU
staff training in accounting and management was provided. By the end of the
project all salaries were approximately four times the levels agreed to at
negotiations, mainly due to inflation and devaluation.
5.04      Training.   PMU developed an active training program covering both
staff and farmers at the Research Institute for Tea and Chinchona (RITC) at
Gambung and at the village level. The courses were practical and effective.
Staff training included three-week intensive technical and organizational
training courses for new staff (163 participants) and refresher courses (250
participants) once or twice a year, both at RITC.     Farmer training included
nursery work, all field coperations, plucking and pruning. A two-way training
was started in 1981 between PMU and BRI staffs; the latter were trained in tea
cultivation and economics; while junior tea inspectors (JTIs) were trained in
banking requirements and procedures. Finally, overseas visits were organized
for selected senior PMU and BRI staff to other teagrowing countries.
5.05       The Extension Services of PMU were well organized and effective.
For approximately 8,000 smallholders there were five tea officers and 50 JTIs,
giving a ratio of approximately 160 farmers per JTI as compared to the ratio
of 100 per JTI recommended at appraisal. PMU successfully introduced clonal
planting stock, set up clonal nurseries and issued nursery kits to farmers
interested in producing their own plants. The transfer of good tea planting
technology was generally well taken up by the farmers, not only the partici-
pants assisted under the project, but many more farmers outside, so that the
spin-off effects of the project were quite substantial, though difficult to
quantify. PMU supervised all nursery and field operations and gave
appropriate advice as required. In addition, the staff spent much time in
processing applications and contacting farmer groups to check on the
distribution of agricultural inputs.



- 6 -
5.06      Research.   Tea research as carried out for the project by RITC was
not entirely satisfactory, due mainly to lack of experienced senior staff and
finance. The clone adaptability trials were discontinued in 1978 and no firm
recommendations emerged from the fertilizer trials.
5.07      BRI administered all the subloans made under the project.    Its
performance was much criticized, perhaps unfairly, by supervision missions,
especially during the first half of the project period. Its procedures were
considered too slow and cumbersome, and its criteria for approving smallholder
applications, different from PMU's, were considered too stringent. Also at
first it was short-staffed and its internal communications were slow. Coor-
dination between PMU and BRI was not always satisfactory. Under pressure from
IDA some improvements and streamlining in BRI procedures were eventually
introduced and the number of applications approved increased significantly.
As is often the case in credit projects, arrears in loan collections went on
increasing throughout the project period. Various reasons have been offered
for this, but they are not convincing. However, BRI does not seem to be
unduly perturbed by this state of affairs. There will no doubt be some bad
debts and write-offs caused by the total losses incurred by some farmers due
to the volcanic eruptions of 1982. BRI reports were satisfactory and regular,
though often late.
5.08      Technical Assistance.   Of the two consultants employed under the
project to assist PMU the main one, the Technical Advisor, proved very useful
and his services were retained for most of the project period, though his
title was changed to that of Chief Project Advisor. H{owever, the services of
the Factory Advisor, whose appointment was also a condition of effectiveness,
were of little use to the project because he came on board too soon and his
contract expired before factory rehabilitation and construction could be
implemented. The management study of BRI was reported to have been useful,
while the Financial Advisor developed an accounting system and helped to train
counterpart staff. Several marketing studies were carried out for PMU, but
they did not bring about any appreciable improvements and the distribution
system remained unchanged. The study of the possibility of crop diversifica-
tion by the tea growers of West Java was undertaken in 1980 by the University
of Padjadjaran; all the crops grown and studied for years in Java were
examined, but none of them was considered to be more profitable than tea in
the traditional tea-growing areas.
5.09      IDA supported the project fully and went out of its way to help the
borrower, PMU and BRI. During the first seven years, there were ten supervi-
sion missions, one of them called a review mission. Supervision responsibi-
lity was mainly with RSI Jakarta. Between 1980 and 1982 the project was under
constant supervision from RSI and no specific supervision mission was mounted.
Communications, mutual understanding and respect between IDA and PMU and BRI
were excellent throughout. IDA agreed to relax some of the more stringent
procurement and financing procedures and convinced BRI to streamline and
simplify its own procedures. IDA agreed to extend the project period by two
years and the closing date by almost one year to allow the disbursement of a
substantial balance of about US$2.5 million.



- 7 -
5.10       Followup.  There is a need to continue tea rehabilitation on the
favorable parts of West and Central Java. The total area involved is
probably at least 10,000 ha. Though the World Bank Group no longer finances
tea projects, IDA is concerned that GOI should continue to provide the
necessary assistance (credit, extension and technical services) to small-
holders and private estates. The Director General of Estates has given a
formal undertaking that GOI will continue the program started under this
project, though there will be modifications to the organization. The "PMU"
system will be continued but under standard government management
conditions. Cooperatives will be created to handle the purchase of inputs
for farmers and the sale of farmers' leaf; the start made with group working
by farmers will serve as the embryo for cooperatives. BRI will continue to
assist smallholders. Private estates will deal with either the
Import-Export Bank or BRI.    A reorganized "PMU" will continue to deal with
all technical matters, including private estates and factories. It is hoped
by the Government that smallholders will eventually become shareholders of
the new PTP XII factory at Panglejar. Finally, it is hoped that the
domestic consumption of tea, both green and black, will continue o
increase, and it is expected that all the domestic demand for tea will
continue to be met entirely by Indonesian-grown tea.
VI. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
6.01       At appraisal it was considered that the principal economic benefit
would be increased production of smallholder and private estate tea to meet
expanded domestic consumption. Despite a reduction in the rehabilitation
program total tea production from both smallholders and private estates will
increase to 24,300 t in 1985/86 (appraisal estimate: 25,300 t). There will
be a substantial increase from smallholders because of better yields. In
addition, it is expected that tea exports will increase from 40,000 t in
1972 to over 49,000 t in 1985/86.
6.02       Costs and benefits are expressed in constant 1982 rupiahs.     The
following exchange rates per dollar have been used: Rp 415 from 1974 to
1978, Rp 625 from 1979 to 1981, and Rp 700 thereafter. In the economic
analysis, the economic price of tea has been used, based on world market
prices and forecasts made by the Bank's Commodity Division, adjusted for
transportation, processing, and handling costs. The shadow wage rate has
been assumed to be half the market price. On the basis of these assumptions
and a project evaluation period of 30 years, the economic rate C: return
(ERR) is 16.9% (appraisal: 15%) (Annex 4). It would take a 32% decrease in
future revenue to reduce the ERR to 10%, the opportunity cost of capital.
6.03       A prime obje,ctive of the project was to increase the net annual
income from tea df-the average smallholder from Rp 36,000 to Rp 117,000 at
full development. Using 1982 constant prices for farmgate revenues and
operating costs, this objective can be attained with the expected increase
of smallholder income from Rp 75,000 to Rp 315,000 in year 30.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01       Overall the project may be considered to have been a success.
Over 10,000 smallholder tea farmers (8,400 under the project and some 2,000
more as "spin-off") replanted or rehabilitated about 9,000 ha (7,300 ha
under the project) of tea gardens in West (and Central) Java, increasing
annual yields from about 400-500 kg of made tea/ha to over 1,000 kg/ha in
rehabilitated gardens and between 1,100 and 1,400 kg/ha in replanted
gardens. The downward trend of tea production has been reversed, though it
is too early as yet for the full effect of the project to be felt. It is
estimated that the total smallholder tea production will be 18,000 t in
1985/86, in line with the appraisal estimate, while private estate produc-
tion, with 6,300 t, will be below the appraisal estimate of 7,500 t. The
total tea production of Indonesia was 88,000 t in 1980/81 as compared to
58,000 t ten years before, and it is estimated that in 1985/86 it will be
115,000 t as compared to the appraisal estimate of 82,600 t. The domestic
consumption has more than doubled in 10 years and the exports have increased
by 15%.
7.02       With hindsight it is easy to see that the operational design of
the project was not one likely to achieve the smooth implementation of its
objectives. Too many agencies were involved, and PMU had neither the
authority nor the financial ability (or power) to ensure timely or smooth
procurement and distribution of the large range of agricultural inputs that
were basic to the project. Nevertheless both PMU and BRI performed credi-
tably on the whole and much has been achieved. The PMB never functioned
properly, but the local Advisory Committees were useful.
7.03       The main constraints regarding the private estates were the reluc-
tance of their owners to accept and follow the procedures and techniques
advocated by PMU and their inability to provide their share of financing.
Long delays were experienced in finding willing and suitable black tea
factories for rehabilitation, but in extremis these were found and satisfac-
tory results are expected from them. The one brand-new black tea factory is
not yet operational, but will help in the processing of smallholder tea. A
second such factory was built, but without project funds.
7.04       The recalculated economic rate of return of the project was 16.9%
as compared to the appraisal estimate of 15%.
