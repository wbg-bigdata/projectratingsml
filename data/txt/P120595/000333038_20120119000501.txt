SUMMARY
1. This Restructuring Paper seeks the approval of the Country Director to introduce the
   following change in the Kingdom of Tonga, Post-Tsunami Reconstruction Project
   (P120595, Grant No. H628-TO) and any necessary accompanying amendments to the
   projects legal documents. The proposed change responds to the evolving needs of the
   Government of Tonga as outlined in an electronic mail from the Project Management
   Unit to IDA dated February 24, 2011 and follow-up discussions carried out with the
   Ministry of Finance during the supervision mission of October 2011. The proposed
   modification is to:

       •   Amend the project Financing Agreement to include “Force Account? as an
           additional procurement method.


PROJECT STATUS
2. The Tonga Post-Tsunami Reconstruction Project has disbursed ca. SDR 595,000 out
   of a total Grant amount of SDR 3,320,000 (ca. 18%). However, two large works
   contracts totaling ca. USD 2.84 million have recently been awarded.

3. The objective of the restructuring is—as in the original project—to assist the
   Government of Tonga to implement its Niuatoputapu Priority Tsunami Recovery
   Program aimed at recovering the living standard of the population living on the island
   affected by the tsunami of September 30, 2009, through the reconstruction of
   residential houses with auxiliary water facilities in Niuatoputapu, and strengthening
   Tonga’s capacity to address future natural disasters. The Government remains
   committed to the development objectives of the project and all critical legal covenants
   (including financial audit reports) are being met. The most recent Implementation
   Status and Results Report rated the overall project as moderately satisfactory.


PROPOSED CHANGES
4. Procurement. This project restructuring involves adding “Force Account? as an
   additional procurement method for civil works and amending the Financing
   Agreement to allow this. The civil works for this project will be taking place on
   Niuatoputapu, an isolated island approximately 330 nautical miles from the capital of
   Nuku’alofa. In accordance with paragraph 3.8 of “Guidelines: Procurement under

                                            4
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits? published by the Bank in May 2004 and revised in
October 2006 and May 2010, it is justified to use Force Account where qualified
private construction firms are unlikely to bid for these small works contracts at
reasonable prices, and as this is an emergency operation, prompt construction is
necessary.
