F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
EMGC II is the second Development Policy Lending Operation (DPO) to support policy
and institutional reforms as outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY04-
07. This credit's reform program and objectives aim to facilitate Zambia:




                                              ii

  -To maintain and deepen Zambia's macroeconomic framework conducive to robust
growth;
  -To strengthen the credibility and institutional capacity of the public sector;
  -To enhance Zambia's growth opportunities while improving its poverty impact.
  In addition, the expected results of the Credit are embedded in the CAS for FY08-11
and contribute to its goals and objectives.
  IDA and the Government of the Republic of Zambia agree that achieving these
objectives in part depend on the implementation of specific reforms in the areas of: (i)
public sector management; (ii) macroeconomic management including the reduction of
arrears and the establishment of a credit rating bureau; (iii) agriculture;
  (iv)infrastructure; and (v) business environment.

  The actions and outcomes under the development policy operation will help deepen and
consolidate the macroeconomic gains that Zambia has registered over the last three years
, will contribute to the sustainability of the reform process in the area of public sector
management, financial sector development and private sector development. In addition, it
will also contribute towards the bridging of a financing gap that exists in the
implementation of Zambia's Fifth National Development Plan and it will contribute
towards improving aid effectiveness by being part of a harmonized approach to budget
support.

  More specifically the operation aims to contribute to (i) improved management of
public resources and credibility of Government vis-à-vis domestic suppliers by reducing
arrears; (ii) timely payment of pensions by Zambia's Public Pension Fund (PSPF); (iii)
availability of creditworthiness information of borrowers to Commercial Banks;
(iv)improved ability to execute in year programs and reduced disconnect between plans
and budget execution; (v) improved quality of data maintained in Zambia's civil service
Payroll Management and Establishment Control (PMEC) system; (vi) a simplified
institutional framework to reduce bureaucratic procedures for businesses; (vii)           the
reaching of consensus on the roles and mandates of each actor, public and private, in the
agricultural marketing sectors; and to (viii) the ability of the road agencies to operate
their statutory tasks.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      In 2007 Zambia was in the midst of the most robust period of economic growth
and macroeconomic stability the country had enjoyed in decades. Helped partly by a
benign external environment average annual GDP growth since 2003 had exceeded 5.5%
and growth was actually accelerating further in 2006 and 2007 to roughly 6% per year.
Prudent fiscal and monetary policies were also helping abate inflation significantly, with
Zambia achieving in 2006 single digit inflation of 8.2 percent, the lowest level in three
decades.

2.      The attainment of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) completion point in
April 2005 together with the additional debt relief through the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) in January 2006 also had led to a much improved external position
leading to a current account surplus in 2006 and a much needed build up of reserves.
Fiscal space was also enhanced by the reduction in the interest bill resulting from the debt
relief. The domestic borrowing requirements were reduced from 5.1 percent of GDP in
2003 to 2.9 percent in 2006 while the overall fiscal deficit was down to 2.9 percent of
GDP in 2006 from 6.6 percent in 2003.

3.      With continued strength in the copper sector, a small rebound in agriculture
growth, plus the continued dynamism from the services sector, the overall economic
outlook was very positive. Expectations were that annual GDP growth would continue at
a pace of 6 percent for 2008-2010, inflation would remain at single digit levels, and there
would be continued improvement in the external sector due to expected export growth,
particularly in the mining sector.

4.      This period of macroeconomic stability with low inflation and low fiscal deficits
was a significant departure from the long history of struggle with large macroeconomic
imbalances and lack of consistency in the implementation of reforms. In the past, the
government had typically dealt with fiscal imbalances by constraining investment
spending and increasing arrears, which generated large quasi-fiscal obligations in the
1990s and also threatened overall development. Commitment to structural reforms was
also weak, resulting in the government's failure to create an environment within which
the private sector was encouraged to diversify away from copper by pursuing alternatives
both in the domestic and export markets.

5.      The good economic performance, however, had not translated into a significant
decline in poverty. While the depth and severity of poverty had declined rapidly in the
1990's the downward trend had tapered off suggesting that the benefits from economic
growth were not reaching parts of the population. The overall poverty headcount had
declined from 73 percent in 1998 to 64 percent at the end of 2006. One explanation of
the weak growth-poverty relationship was that the growth was concentrated in urban
areas anchored on capital intensive sectors such as construction, mining, retail and whole
sale trade, which are less pro-poor than the agriculture sector.



                                             1

6.      In this context, in 2006, the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ)
launched the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP), its Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS), covering the period 2006-2010.         The FNDP was seen as the key strategy
document that would help reach the goal set by the National Vision 2030"to become a
prosperous and middle income country by the year 2030". The vision called for
economic and expenditure policies plus institutional reforms that would accelerate
growth and lead to sustained poverty reduction. The FNDP recognized that policies that
enabled the sharing of growth needed to be undertaken by the government.

7.      The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY2004-07 was structured
along the predecessor to the FNDP ­ the Transitional National Development Plan
(TNDP) and was aligned with three strategic priorities: (a) sustained economic growth
anchored on a diversified and export-oriented economy; (b) improved lives and
protection of the vulnerable; and (c) efficiently and effectively managed public sector.
The FY2008-10 CAS which was presented to the Board together with the Economic
Management and Growth Credit (EMGC II) was aligned with the FNDP, which in turn
continued the strategic trend of the TNDP ­thus providing continuity to the government's
program as well as to the Bank's engagement.

8.      The EMGC II also took place in the context of a changing approach to budget
support. In 2005, on the basis of a good track record of economic performance and the
existence of a well articulated government strategy the government and the donor
community agreed on establishing a harmonized framework for joint budget support ­ the
Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS). The PRBS process was and still is a
collective effort to provide predictable and performance based budget support. The PRBS
is anchored on a Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) which outlines a rolling
multi-year reform program. The PAF contains policy and institutional reforms as well as
outcome indicators which are part of government strategy contained in the TNDP and
later the FNDP. Government's performance under the PAF is assessed annually, each
June, and the rolling plan of reforms for the subsequent years agreed to each October.

9.      Program performance is assessed by a simple and direct method: assessing the
number of PAF indicators met, partly met, or not met, with each indicator being weighted
equally. One point is given for indicators met, while half a point is given for indicators
partially met.

10.     The EMGC II was the second Development Policy Operation as identified in the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), FY04-07. EMGC II aimed to support the policy and
institutional reforms outlined in the CAS and the government's overall reform program
stemming from the TNDP and the FNDP.

11.     Although a self-standing operation (not a part of a programmatic series), the
EMGC II was indeed supporting a slice of what was then already a multi-year reform
program. EMGCII supported a subset of the PAF actions in the areas of public sector
reform, macroeconomic management, and wealth creation. These actions were linked to
specific government reforms in public pay policy, public finance management, pensions,
financial sector development, infrastructure, agriculture, and the business environment. It



                                              2

was expected that in conjunction with the new CAS and provided continued government
commitment to reforms, the Bank would follow the EMGC II with a clearly defined
programmatic approach to budget support through a PRSC series.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

12.    EMGC II (US$10 million) was the second (of two) Development Policy
Operation (DPO) to support policy and institutional reforms as outlined in the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY04-07. This credit's reform program and objectives
aimed to facilitate Zambia:

· To maintain and deepen Zambia's macroeconomic framework conducive to robust
  growth
· To strengthen the credibility and institutional capacity of the public sector
· To enhance Zambia's growth opportunities while improving its poverty impact

In addition, the expected results of the Credit are embedded in the CAS for FY08-11 and
contribute to its goals and objectives.

13.    The actions and outcomes under the development policy operation would help
deepen and consolidate the macroeconomic gains that Zambia had attained over the last
three years, and would contribute to the sustainability of the reform. In addition, it would
also contribute to help bridge the anticipated financing gap for implementation of
Zambia's Fifth National Development Plan and contribute towards aid effectiveness by
being part of a harmonized approach to budget support.

14.    More specifically the operation aimed to contribute to (i) improved ability to
execute the budget reducing the gaps between planned and budget execution; (ii)
improved management of public resources, enhanced cost effectiveness and credibility of
Government vis-à-vis domestic suppliers by reducing arrears; (iii) timely payment of
pensions by Zambia's Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF); (iv) improved management
and control of Zambia's civil service payroll through the establishment of the Payroll
Management and Establishment Control system (PMEC); (v) financial sector
development by enhancing availability of creditworthiness information of borrowers to
Commercial Banks; (vi) a simplified institutional framework to reduce bureaucratic
procedures for businesses; (vii) agriculture sector development by setting a process for
reaching a consensus for legislating on the roles of the public and private actors
agricultural markets; and to (viii) improve infrastructure by enhancing the ability of the
road agencies to carry out their statutory tasks.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

15.    The original PDO and key indicators remain unchanged.




                                             3

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

16.     The program supported the government's overall program outlined in the PAF for
2006-2008. Within a set of 30 policy reforms or outcome indicators in the PAF, eight
specific reforms were selected as EMGC II prior actions. The prior actions were chosen
based on their importance in advancing the government's reform agenda. The eight prior
actions belonged to three broad pillars in the PAF:

(a) Macroeconomic management; with a focus on financial sector development and
reforms in the public sector pension fund.

(b) Public sector reform; with a focus on budget implementation, payroll management;
and reduction of arrears to suppliers.

(c) Wealth creation; with a focus on key measures in agriculture, business environment;
and enhanced provision of infrastructure.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

17.     The original policy areas remained unchanged.

1.6 Other significant changes

18.     The policy reforms were expected to be implemented during calendar year 2006
and within the CAS period FY04-07. However, delays in implementation of some of the
prior actions led to postponements in completion of appraisal as well as negotiations. All
reforms were carried out by early 2008 (as opposed to June 2007) and the credit was
approved in May 2008, almost a year later than originally planned.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

19.     The credit selected eight of the thirty indicators as prior actions from the PAF
expected to be implemented in CY2006. The assessment of the overall performance of
this program was undertaken during the joint harmonized framework, the PRBS process,
in June 2007. The assessment, noted that overall performance against the indicators and
targets included in the PAF for CY2006 had shown a downward trend, compared with
achievements for CY2005. The targets for 19 of the 30 indicators were fully achieved,
and substantial progress was observed on another four, while seven indicators had not
been achieved even partially. Utilizing the rough measure of program performance (see
paragraph 9), this was equivalent to 70 percent achievement, compared to an 85 percent
achievement rate in CY2005. It must be noted, however, that such comparisons are not
necessarily very illuminating considering the differences in program targets and ambition
of the indicators across years can vary quite significantly.




                                             4

20.      In terms of the broad areas of the PAF, in 2006 most progress was achieved under
in the actions under the umbrella of wealth creation (which focuses on reforms in the
areas of agriculture, infrastructure, and private sector development), followed by social
equity. This was followed by the area of macroeconomic management and finally by
public sector reforms.

21.      The report noted that in view of the budgetary challenges government had faced
in 2006, because of an unanticipated decline in revenues, the achievements against the
PAF targets were in line or slightly ahead of what could have been expected for the year.
It was also noted that the expansion of the PAF to include additional areas had resulted in
some targets being overambitious and not in line with agreed definitions under the
Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) or sector initiatives.

22.      With regard to the specific eight indicators (prior actions) supported of the credit,
government had not met three of the prior actions by the time of the June 2007
assessment. However, government did follow up and by the time of negotiations in
March 2008 all prior actions had been met.

  List conditions from Legal Agreement/ Program Document                              Status
  A. Public Sector Reform
   i)   Public Service Management: PSMD in Cabinet office has implemented a       Met
        payroll management and establishment control system (PMEC) in six
        additional central spending agencies enabling the human resource officers
        to directly access the system.
   ii) Public Finance Management: MOFNP has ensured predictability of budget      Met
        execution by providing 34 out of 49 budget heads with annual calculated
        expenditures of between 95% and 105% of the total funding for fiscal year
        2006.
   iii) Public Finance Management: MOFNP has reduced domestic arrears to          Met
        suppliers with (i) stocks diminishing from ZMK532.8billion at end 2005 to
        equal or less than ZMK491.8 billion at the end of 2006 (ii) ZMK147billion
        released to further pay down the arrears in 2007, and (iii) a commitment
        expressed in the 2008-2010 MTEF/Green paper and the 2008 budget to
        reduce these arrears to negligible levels by 2009.

  B. Macro Economic Management
   iv) Financial Sector Development: BOZ has issued a license for the creation of Met
       a credit reference bureau.

       Planning has implemented a phased reduction of arrears of contributions
       owed by the Government to the Public Service Pension Fund with: (i)
       stocks diminishing from ZMK464 billion at the end of 2005 to equal or less
       than ZMK388 billion at the end of 2006; (ii) ZMK112 billion released to
       further pay down arrears in 2007; and (iii) a commitment expressed in the
       2008-2010 MTEF/Green paper and the 2008 budget to reduce these arrears
       to negligible levels by the end of 2008.

                                                                                        Met
  C. Wealth Creation
  vi) Agriculture: The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MACO) has              Met
        drafted and finalized consultations with stakeholders on an agricultural
        marketing legislation.
  vii) Infrastructure: The authorities have strengthened its capacity to address
        identified bottlenecks to development in the management of the road             Met
        infrastructure by filling 80 per cent of the staffing vacancies of the National
        Road Fund Agency, the Road Development Agency, and the Road
        Transport and Safety Agency.
  viii) Private Sector Development: The authorities have: (i) established the
        Zambia Development Agency taking on the responsibilities of the former
        Zambia Investment Centre, Zambia Privatization Agency, Zambia Export
        and Processing Zone Agency, Small Enterprise Development Board, and
        Export Board of Zambia; and (ii) developed an implementation plan for the
        ZDA to accomplish further progress in the areas of removal of barriers to
        export and setting up of businesses.




23.      At the moment, it is also possible to assess the performance of the program in
CY2007, based on the assessment of the program carried out in June 2008. The overall
performance against the indicators and targets included in the PAF for CY2007 was
broadly consistent with that of CY2006, measured by a rate of achievement of 66.7
percent slightly below the rate of 70 percent for CY2006.

24.      With regard to progress in continuing and deepening reforms in the specific areas
supported by EMGC II, government's performance during CY2007 was strong in public
finance management, public sector management, agriculture, and private sector
development where all targets for 2007 were met. The only area where targets were not
met was meeting the goals of reducing arrears in payments of the public pension system.
Government failed to meet the end year target of reducing pension arrears from the end
2006 figure of K305 billion to K270 billion by end 2007, despite it releasing most of the
money committed to clearing arrears in 2007. The problem arose due to the contracting
of new arrears (specifically from the defence forces and the late remittance of central
government's contribution from December 2007 ­ valued at K8.3 billion) and the non
estimation of interest payments on accrued arrears. As recommended at that review, the
indicator was revised in the PAF 2008-2010 to take into account this earlier weakness
where the indicator was a stock of total arrears whose value would be difficult to attain.
The new indicator measures a value of not more than two months of employer's
contribution, considered to be more realistic. Follow up actions in the areas of financial
sector development and infrastructure, which had been supported by EMGC II were not
included in the PAF for 2007-2009.

25.      Furthermore, a preliminary assessment of government's performance for CY2008
(the full review will be carried on June 24, 2009) indicates that follow up in progress in
the areas supported by EMGC II has continued. There has been good progress in
improvements in the business environment, and government has also remained
committed to meeting the targets in public finance management to improve budget
execution and provided resources for the clearance of domestic arrears. In agriculture,


                                                         6

progress continues to be made towards having a new Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA)
with a draft bill currently being developed by the Ministry of Justice, with an intention to
submit it to Parliament in the next parliamentary sitting in the third quarter of 2009.

26.    In the areas of pension reforms and macroeconomic management the reduction of
arrears to the public pension system was provided for in the 2008 budget, however the
contracting of new arrears by defence forces has continued to be a problem which
government needs to address going forward. Overall, government continues to be
committed to undertake the reforms under the PAF.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

27.    There were delays in implementation of reforms supported by the EMCG II that
were expected to be carried out in CY2006, but were not implemented until early 2008.
This can be largely traced to the tightening of the fiscal situation in 2006 with lower than
expected revenues, which had a particular impact in delaying two prior actions related to
the reduction in arrears.

28.    This was exacerbated by competing demands on the budget since 2006 was also
an election year. On the other hand, policy reforms that did not require significant
budgetary resources, such as the reforms in the wealth creation pillar, were implemented
in a timely manner.

29.    It must be noted, however, that in CY2007, with the elections behind and a very
strong revenue performance, much progress was achieved in the areas of strengthening
macroeconomic and public sector reforms. The recent relatively stronger performance in
macroeconomic management and public sector reform are in part explained by alignment
of these reforms with the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as the ongoing program in the public
sector, the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability program
(PEMFA) and corresponding policy dialogue.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

30.    The memorandum of understanding (MOU) that governs the PRBS process
defines reporting requirements such as the bi-annual meetings to discuss progress and
review the PAF, institutional arrangements such as the Joint Executive Committee (JEC)
and Joint Steering Committee (JSC) and other platforms for evaluation, mainly the
Sectoral Advisory Groups (SAGs).

31.    Cooperating partners (CPs) also review government's reform efforts under the
FNDP and PAF through various sector groups. Different CPs are leads in sectors where
they have a comparative advantage and are key players, in line with the Joint Assistance
Framework for Zambia (JASZ) which was developed in 2007 to increase aid coordination
and reduce transaction costs to GRZ.




                                             7

32.     While the current PAF results framework has improved since 2005 when the
interim PAF was prepared under a harmonized donor agenda, it is a difficult assessment
framework to utilize due to its substantial reliance on higher- level outcome indicators
whose progress is difficult to meaningfully assess on an annual basis, than on policy
actions or outputs. For example in the area of pension reform, the PAF has been
measuring the stock of arrears attained at end year. This tends to reduce the focus from
assessment of the overarching FNDP macroeconomic objectives in this area which are to
secure fiscal and financial stability in the sector. The current situation in pension points to
a substantial attainment of this objective. The remaining challenges still to be resolved in
this area require a constitutional amendment of the Pension Act which needs a relatively
longer timeline to be achieved. An improvement of the PAF to begin to address these
weaknesses was made in January 2009 to monitor progress under the PAF 2008-2010
with the inclusion of annually measurable output indicators in the energy sector.

33.     In addition, some indicators in the PAF do not have a reliable data system due to
lack of annual data for some sectors, such as the water sector. This has made assessment
of all indicators in the PAF difficult. Going forward, sectors have agreed to revise
previously poorly defined indicators that have not been measurable.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):



34.     EMGC II is expected to be followed up by a set of programmatic PRSC's that
support the PRBS process and government program laid out in the multi-year PAF 2008-
2010. The PRSC's will support the objectives of the CAS FY08-11 which highlights the
need to support improved macroeconomic management and public sector reforms.

35.     The PRSC's which will provide the predictability of financing, which is desired
by government and will support the core objective of the Bank's macroeconomic
program to help Zambia better manage its financial resources in order for fiscal policy to
foster more inclusive growth. The PRSC's will continue to support some of the reforms
areas supported by EMGC II in public finance management and macroeconomic
management that still require a few actions to attain the policy outputs. They will also
focus on support of reforms actions in the wealth creation pillar of the PAF in agriculture
and energy. Reform in these sectors supports the theme of the FNDP which is broad
based wealth and job creation where the strategic focus is economic infrastructure and
human resource development focusing primarily on agriculture, infrastructure and private
sector development. At present, PRSC1 has undergone a regional operations committee
(ROC) review which has authorized appraisal. Appraisal is likely to be completed in the
second half of CY2009.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Overall rating: Moderately Satisfactory

36.     The objectives of EMGC II were and are still relevant to the country situation and
priorities as articulated in the government programs, the TNDP and FNDP and the PAF.
Based on critical inputs such as the Public Service Management Program (PSMP) and
analytical work which included a Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Report (PEMFAR), a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), an
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), a Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (PVA)
including diagnostic work on pro-poor growth, the credit rightly identified the need to
focus on improving public sector performance, maintaining a conducive framework for
macroeconomic growth, and enhancing the opportunities for reducing poverty through
reforms that provide a better business environment.

37.     EMGC II aligned with the joint donor framework, the PRBS process and utilized
the PAF 2006-2008 in identifying prior actions to support. The PRBS process had only
began substantively in 2006 and as a result the PAF had weak policy content in some
areas such as private sector development and pension reform. The framework was
therefore not able to adequately support the attainment of the program objectives.

38.     In view of the tradeoffs that the use of the PAF entailed, the overall assessment of
the relevance of the objectives as well as the design and implementation is moderately
satisfactory.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

PDO 1: Maintain and deepen Zambia's macroeconomic framework conducive to robust
growth. Rating: Satisfactory

39.     The government's macroeconomic program continued to sustain macro stability
providing a good basis for implementing the structural reform agenda outlined in the
FNDP. The government maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic framework supported
by the IMF through the PRGF arrangement.

40.     The recent economic developments show that growth remained strong throughout
the period 2005-08 and Zambia's macroeconomic framework remained robust (Table 2).
The positive growth developments were helped by a very favorable external environment.
More recently Zambia has been impacted by the global crisis, especially on account of
much lower copper prices. However, this impact has been mitigated by an increase in
copper production ­a result of new large foreign investments that preceded the crisis.

        f = 2009 IMF forecast.

41.     In addition to the strong growth performance experienced, government's
commitment to macroeconomic stability resulted in declining inflation underpinned by
adequate fiscal policy agreed under the PRGF arrangement with the IMF. The PRGF
arrangement which supported a structural agenda in the areas of public expenditure
management, tax reform, debt management and financial sector development was
successfully completed at the end of 2007.          A new IMF PRGF arrangement was
subsequently agreed to in June 2008.

42.     A recent assessment of the performance under the new arrangement has noted that
a few exogenous factors have affected economic conditions. These are mainly the surge
in global food and fuel prices in the first half of 2008 which led to a significant increase
in inflation and the global financial crisis which led to a drop in commodity prices. The
drop in copper prices significantly affected the balance of payments as the sector
provides 60-70 percent of the country's export revenue. As a consequence, the IMF has
increased substantially its balance of payments support for 2009.

43.     Government's commitment to the maintenance of sound macroeconomic policies
is one of the underlying principles of the Memorandum of understanding (MOU) between
GRZ and budget support donors, mainly assessed by a positive implementation of the
PRGF arrangement with the IMF program.               Throughout the PRBS process, the
macroeconomic framework has been maintained by an active participation of the IMF.
The prior actions that supported this development objective were thus complementary to
the government's performance under the IMF program.

44.     EMGCII specifically aimed to assist government reforms that focused on
reducing arrears to the public service pension fund (PSPF) and to improve Zambia's
credit culture. This would consolidate the macroeconomic gains achieved by the country



                                                10

particularly in promoting fiscal sustainability and contribute to sustainability of reforms
in the financial sector. Attainment of these objectives would lead to the timely payment
of pensions by PSPF and the availability of credit worthiness information of borrowers to
commercial banks.

45.     Public Service Pension Fund

        In the area of pensions, expected outcomes have not been fully achieved. The
government's target in 2008 was to reduce the amounts owed from K305 billion at the
end of 2007 to not more than two months by end year, approximately K23billion. While
the required budgetary allocations were made, the end year value was K93billion. The
target was not met mainly as a result of continued late payment of employers'
contribution, by the defense forces. While the government arrears reduction plan has
significantly reduced government liabilities to the pension fund and potentially freed up
resources that could be channeled to other priorities areas, without addressing the current
problem of late payment of employers' contributions by some institutions, this will
continue to pose a challenge for PSPF in meeting its current liabilities in the short to
medium term. The recent MTEF 2009-2011 reiterates government's commitment to
clear all pension arrears by end 2009.

46.     A deeper problem in the area of pension reform though, is the fact that PSPF is a
defined benefits scheme, which has unfunded liabilities that make it financially insolvent.
An amendment of the constitutional clause regarding Pensions has been proposed.
However the constitutional amendment process is yet to be finalized, the process is
expected to be completed by 2011. Additionally, for this to reform to be undertaken a
broad and potentially difficult consultative process with all stakeholders is required. At
the moment, these discussions have not yet begun.

47.     Financial Sector Development

        With the establishment of a credit reference bureau in 2008, there was an
expectation of improvement in availability of creditworthiness information on borrowers.
While the established Credit Reference Bureau African Limited (CRBAL) is functional,
it is not populated enough to provide useful information.         As of end year 2008,
commercial banks had not been actively submitting creditor information to the bureau, as
privacy agreements dictate the need for borrower consent to allow banks to share
information, hence inhibiting the bureau's effectiveness. This may improve marginally in
the coming years following the directive from the Central Bank in late 2008 for
commercial banks to observe this requirement. The positive attainment of this objective
which would reduce the cost of and enable quicker access to finances for the private
sector is yet to be achieved.

48.     The policy reforms in these two areas supported by the credit have enabled some
improvements in terms of the current Pension fund financial standing compared to its
position a few years ago and have also enabled some access to creditworthiness
information on borrowers. The country has also achieved relatively strong
macroeconomic performance since 2005. Although a few actions are still required under



                                            11

these reform areas in order to achieve outcomes expected by the operation, the rating of
the attainment of this PDO is satisfactory.


PDO 2: Strengthen the credibility and institutional capacity of the public sector.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

49.     The attainment of this PDO was dependant on reforms in public sector
management that would result in improved access to and quality of data in the PMEC
system, as well as improved ability by government agencies to execute in year programs
thus reducing the disconnect between plans and budget execution. The program also
supported government reforms that focused on reducing arrears to general contractors
that would lead to improved management of public resources and improve the credibility
of GRZ vis-á-vis domestic suppliers. Attainment of these outcomes was to contribute
towards sustainability of reforms in these areas.

50.     Public Finance Management- Domestic Arrears

        The Public Expenditure      Financial Accountability assessment (PEFA) report
2008, showed a significant improvement in reduction of the stock and monitoring of
expenditure arrears mainly as a result of government's strategy in the MTEF's and the
regular reporting by the responsible departments. By end 2008, domestic arrears had
been substantially reduced to K193 billion from K376.4 billion in December 2007. This
was however, above the government end year target for 2008 of K120billion. In the
medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) for the period 2009-2011, government has
committed to clear all arrears by the end of 2009 and has allocated K176 billion in the
2009 budget to this effect. As at end March 2009, arrears owed to domestic suppliers had
been furthered reduced down to K144 billion.

51.     The progress made thus far has shown that government has made a committed
effort in tackling this area of concern and has allocated resources towards this. Current
arrears being owed have not been paid only due to the verification process that is being
undertaken by government agencies prior to payment, some of these institutions have not
until recently been adequately staffed. As a result of the clearance of significant amounts
of the arrears owed, governments' credibility vis-á-vis domestic suppliers' has improved.

52.     Public Finance Management- Budget Execution

        Budget execution has continued to improve over the last four years. By December
2007, 91.8 percent of heads (45 out of 49) had annual expenditures between 95 % and
105% of total funding, as government had committed. This was a marked improvement
from 55 percent in 2005. As at end 2008, approximately 41 out of 49 heads (84 percent)
had annual expenditures between 95 % and 105% of total funding. This reflects a
continued commitment by government towards meeting its targets under the PAF and the
broader FNDP goals.




                                            12

53.     The PEFA 2008 report, noted that whilst budget performance on aggregate has
improved, variances across individual budget heads continue to be significant, although
progress since the 2005 assessment is evident. Total expenditure variance averaged just
below 15 percent for the three years, from 2005 to 2007. Some of the specific reasons for
the deviations for institutional heads include: relatively low resource absorption capacity
by some MPSAs and thus differing discretionary releases of funds to different
institutions, and weaknesses in planning (e.g. the ex ante planning of pay awards).

54.     Overall, the slightly improved performance (reflected in the lower average
variance from the high variance levels found in 2005) indicates greater consistency in
policy focus and adherence to sustained financing of policy priority programs, i.e. in
health, education and agriculture, infrastructure sectors, as envisaged in the FNDP. The
result of these improvements is that the credibility of the budget has improved
significantly as it is to a large extent implemented in accordance with estimates as
approved by Parliament.

55.     Public Service Management

        The roll out of a payment establishment and management control (PMEC) system
to additional central agencies as government had planned, was not undertaken in 2008.
While the government planned to increase the number of central agencies linked to the
system from five at end 2007 to thirteen at end 2008, there has been no implementation
of this action. Government has been relying on the installation of fiber-optic lines by
Zambia Telecommunications Limited (ZAMTEL) particularly in Lusaka where all
ministry headquarters are, which has been delayed. The PMEC program had not initially
been designed to use the ZAMTEL fiber-optic network. To counter this delay, a web-
based roll out was attempted by government but security inadequacies have not enabled
this to be achieved.

56.     However, the PEFA report of 2008, states that as a result of an update in the
central site communication equipment in 2007, an automated Payroll Management and
Establishment Control (PMEC) system is fully operational, which directly links
personnel data and payroll data to ensure consistency and monthly reconciliation for civil
service. The payroll system processes wages and salaries for about 132,000 central
government employees. However, 2000 employees are still on the old legacy system due
to fact that they cannot be fused into the current organization structure.

57.     In spite of the automated PMEC system in most agencies, there are still delays in
processing changes to personnel and payroll which lead to retroactive adjustments. There
is recent evidence of very long delays which have resulted in undue payments and
financial losses to the Government. The overall assessment is that while internal controls
of the operations of the payroll system are functioning, the evidence of lapses in the
updating of personnel data by end users poses a risk to the accuracy of the system. On
account of the challenges with regard to timeliness of changes to payroll and personnel
records, the overall performance of government in ensuring effectiveness of payroll
controls was noted to be same as it was in 2005.




                                             13

58.     Government has undertaken significant strides since 2005 in improving public
finance management in the areas of budget execution and clearance of domestic arrears
which have improved credibility of the budget and credibility of government as viewed
by domestic suppliers. While challenges still exist with regard to the timeliness of
changes to payroll records, other areas such as integration and reconciliation of records
and internal controls have improved. However in view of the delays in the roll out of the
PMEC system to central agencies which would substantially improve challenges faced in
timeliness of updating records and payroll thus saving government undue payments, the
programs achievement of this PDO is moderately satisfactory.

PDO 3: Enhance Zambia's growth opportunities while improving its poverty impact.
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

59.     In order to accomplish this objective the program supported reforms in the areas
of agriculture, infrastructure and business environment/ private sector development.
These reforms are part of the wealth creation pillar of the PAF and support the FNDP
theme which is broad- based wealth and job creation through citizen participation and
technological advancement, while the focus is on economic infrastructure and human
resource management. Government action in these areas would result in a simplified
framework to reduce bureaucratic procedures for businesses, the agreement on roles and
mandates of each actor, public and private in the agricultural marketing sectors and the
ability of the road agencies to operate their statutory tasks.


60.     Private Sector Development

        Reducing administrative barriers is a government priority in the area of private
sector development. In order to reduce the cost of doing business and increase
participation of Zambians in the economic process, in line with the FNDP theme,
government undertook institutional and legislative changes in 2005. The establishment of
the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA) in 2006 following the enactment of the ZDA
Act dissolved the five agencies that had been responsible for investment, trade, small
enterprise development and privatization these were the Zambia Investment Centre,
Zambia Privatization Agency, Zambia Export and Processing Zone Agency, Small
Enterprise Development Board, and Export Board of Zambia. This resulted in the
creation of the ZDA an economic institution responsible for ensuring a holistic and
strategic view on increasing trade and investment levels in the country as well as having
an efficient, effective and coordinated private sector led economic development strategy.
The agency would be a one stop facility for all trade and investment inquires.

61.     With the establishment of the agency, a work plan for the removal of barriers to
export and business was also developed for its implementation, which would result in the
reduction in the number of days it takes to start up a business from 35 days in 2005 to ten
days by 2007. This would significantly reduce the cost of doing business and promote
private sector participation in economic development.




                                              14

62.     The Doing Business report 2009 shows an improvement in Zambia's overall
ranking overall since 2008 from 101 to 100 and an improvement in the ranking for
starting business from 84 to 71. The number of procedures required and duration of days
for starting a business in Zambia are fewer than the regional average for other low
income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as is the cost and minimum capital required as a
percentage of gross national income (GNI) per capita. These results were attained as a
result of specific actions by government agencies in the areas of business registration and
tax registration, as well as the simplification of banking procedures. This has led to an
improvement in the business environment.

63.     Going forward, government has committed in the PAF 2008-2010 towards
undertaking more actions that would improve the business environment even further
particularly in the area of licensing. This is specifically reducing the administrative cost
of compliance with business licenses by eliminating and streamlining the current number
of licenses.

64.     Agriculture

        The agricultural sector is a key sector in the FNDP and seen to have great
potential for enhancing economic growth and accelerating poverty reduction. The FNDP
notes that the poor functioning of agricultural markets is one of the challenges that
compromise the ability of the sector to benefit from its full potential and hence make a
significant impact on reducing the country's poverty levels. In order to improve the
sector's ability to contribute more effectively to growth and poverty reduction, the PAF
for 2006-2008 included the need to define the roles and responsibilities of the public and
private sector when it comes to Zambia's agricultural marketing system.

65.     EMGC II supported the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MACO) with
the drafting and finalization of consultations with stakeholders on an agricultural
marketing act. Both a concept note and cabinet memorandum on the proposed
Agricultural Marketing Act were presented to Cabinet in 2007 and it was envisaged that
bills proposing amendments to the current Acts would be tabled before Parliament in
2008.    The proposed legislation will provide for a more efficient and transparent
agricultural marketing system, attracting private sector participation, contributing to
increased agricultural production and farmer's incomes. This will be done through
encouraging the participation of the private sector.

66.     Although the draft act has been widely discussed within government, the concept
paper defining this act is still with the Ministry of Justice and the act has not been
submitted to Parliament as had been expected in 2008. This extensive consultation
process is a character of the policy reform environment in Zambia. As a result of these
delays, there continues to be significant influence by government, especially in the area
of maize pricing. This has a negative impact on encouraging private participation in the
sector.




                                             15

67.    Infrastructure

       EMGCII noted that the need for a well designed and maintained road network for
a landlocked country like Zambia was critical to minimize the impact of transport cost on
its overall competitiveness. To improve the predictability of financing and strengthen
implementation capacity of the government, three road agencies each assigned with
specific tasks were created. The National Road Fund Agency (NRFA) responsible for the
coordination and management of the road financing functions, including collection,
disbursement, management, and accounting of Zambia's road fund; a Road Development
Agency (RDA), tasked with the management responsibility of the public/proclaimed
network, and which includes planning, programming, implementation, monitoring,
overall supervision of all road works and axle load control in the country; and a Road
Transport and Safety Agency (RTSA), responsible for implementing policy on road
transport and traffic management, road safety and enforcement of laws regulating road
transport and traffic safety in the country. To ensure that the newly created agencies
operated effectively vacancies in the new agencies were to be filled. Under the PAF for
2006-08, it was agreed this was a priority and that by the end of 2006, 80 percent of all
posts will be filled and that from 2007 onwards all posts will be occupied. The PAF also
monitored kilometers of roads up graded, rehabilitated, and kilometers of unpaved roads
maintained.

68.    Since all three road agencies were adequately staffed in 2008, a system to attain a
well maintained national core road network exists. Challenges still exist however
particularly with regard to meeting the targets on the core unpaved network in the rural
areas, which would have the most poverty reducing impact. The review of the annual
work plan for 2008 by RDA shows that while targets for the rehabilitation of the core
paved and unpaved road network were met, with targets for maintenance of paved roads
also significantly met, only 62 percent of the target for maintenance of the core unpaved
road network, that is, 12,436 km out of the targeted 20, 058 km was met in 2008.
However, preliminary results of a current road condition survey which covers almost
35% of the unpaved core road network show a significant deterioration in the condition
of unpaved roads classified as being in good and fair condition from 32% to 10%
between 2006 and 2009. Most of these roads are rural roads that are essential to provision
of social services such as health and education and linking the rural markets to urban
centers. More resources and supervision need to be focused towards this area.

69.    Available information from the RDA and the NRFA has shown that challenges
are also being faced in public finance management and implementation of sound
procurement practices in the sector. These are areas, in addition to strengthened
supervision of road construction projects by RDA that need to be addressed going
forward.

70.    The enactment of the AMA has a fundamental role in unlocking the constraint to
growth in the agricultural sector which has the potential to have a tremendously positive
effort on growth, employment and poverty reduction. To attain these outcomes in this
area, a major step is required to be completed by government, which is parliamentary
submission and approval of the AMA. Additionally, increased focus by RDA on meeting



                                            16

rural road targets could have a potentially positive impact on service delivery in those
areas and reducing the increasing rural-urban divide. As a result of the required actions
in two of the three reform areas which have a great impact in achieving the PDO
outcome, the rating of attainment of this PDO is moderately satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

71.     The program's objectives were and continue to be relevant to the current country
context. Government's performance in undertaking reform actions in the areas supported
by the program in macroeconomic management, public finance management and wealth
creation has on the overall been positive and consistent with its past track record since
2005. Although there continue to be delays in key some areas such as agriculture, and
public sector management. Overall, government has undertaken many of the major steps
required to meet the development objective outcomes that were expected by the
operation.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

72.     The program document stated that the operation was meant to extend Zambia's
track record of policy and institutional reform setting the stage for movement towards a
programmatic approach under the new CAS FY08-11.

73.     Although the level of reform to be achieved in each progressive year was set at a
higher level than the previous in the PAF making comparisons between subsequent years
difficult, it can be noted from the joint annual reviews and using recent information that
government's pace of undertaking reforms has been slightly below the performance of
the previous years. Nevertheless, the progress made does provide an adequate basis on
which government should be supported to assist the country meet the national goals as set
in the FNDP.

74.     In addition the PRBS process has enabled strengthened donor coordination at the
sectoral level which has also enabled the improvement of the policy content of the PAF.
The PAF review meeting which took place in January 2009 provided this opportunity in
the energy sector where important output indicators were included in the PAF 2008-2011,
anchored on policy actions.

75.     While the participation by sectoral ministries and civil society has improved in the
last eighteen months, there is still need to further strengthen the institutional
arrangements for monitoring progress prescribed by the MOU provisions particularly the
joint executive committee and to ensure consistent involvement of civil society in the
national consultative processes such as the SAGs which feed also into the PRBS
processes.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

None.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

Rating: Significant

76.     The attainment of the development outcomes could be affected by both
exogenous factors, especially stemming from the global financial crisis and domestic
factors based on the government's commitment and or capacity to advance in the reform
program.

77.     There is a significant risk that a protracted global recession could worsen
significantly the macroeconomic outlook and the fiscal sustainability, not only through
lower copper prices but overall lower external demand and negative output growth. This
could alter significantly the macroeconomic framework, making difficult the
sustainability of the progress and reforms that have been achieved.          For example, the
effects of the global crisis, so far, have resulted in increased inflation, and volatility of the
nominal and real exchange rates, making macroeconomic management difficult in the
short term. This may potentially reduce government's domestic revenues and the ability
to meet its fiscal goals. This could have a negative effect in meeting milestones of
reforms that require substantial budgetary allocations such as pension, domestic arrears,
and cause a differential between the actual and authorized budget allocation making
budget execution difficult.

78.     A protracted global crisis could also contribute to create a political economy
environment in which it would be difficult to advance in some important reforms such as
reducing the role of the state in some areas of agriculture marketing. Another domestic
factor that could contribute to risks to the PDOs is that the country is scheduled to have
general elections in 2011. This by itself creates the risk of pressures to depart from the
goals in the areas of macroeconomic management and public sector reform and could
negatively affect the willingness to implement some of the most difficult reforms under
the wealth creation pillar, especially with regards to reforms in agriculture and the energy
sector.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry



Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

79.     The Bank's performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The reasons for this
rating include: the consistency with the CAS objectives, the focus on reform measures,
and the choice of prior actions which took into account experience gained from the
previous EMGC I and supported the extension of Zambia's track record in these areas.
The credit was also consistent with Government's development strategy, articulated in
the FNDP and aligned with the harmonized donor PRBS process. The operation was also
anchored on findings of considerable analytical work, in the areas of public finance
management, public sector management, investment climate and poverty which identified
the key constraints in those areas which were hindering the performance of the public
sector, the deepening of progress in macroeconomic management and the creation of a
conducive business environment that encourages private sector participation.

80.     The project team consisted of seasoned professionals with relevant technical
expertise in the areas of public sector reform, agriculture, private sector development,
infrastructure and financial sector reform. The Bank team was also well managed by an
experienced team leader who ensured that close consultation was also carried out with the
IMF and other local PRBS donors.

81.     However a few challenges were faced, as the appraisal period was extended from
2007 until 2008. The operation also overestimated the ability of government to meet the
prior actions at the time anticipated and its pace a continuing with the follow up reforms
needed to fully attain the PDO outcomes. In addition, the PAF which had an emphasis on
rather weak measures ­compared to the ambition of the government's objectives, as well
as a heavy and growing reliance on outcome indicators instead of important policy
reforms has weakened the important catalytic role that an operation like this could have
in terms of quality and depth of the policy dialogue. This also weakened the role the
operation could have as an instrument to encourage focus on the most critically important
reforms to help meet government objectives.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

82.     In line with the harmonized PRBS process, the Bank mainly utilized the main
annual PRBS June review to monitor the program. The June review assesses government
performance on attainment of targets for the previous calendar year using an end year
deadline. The Bank policy however allows for a longer time frame for assessment
focusing mainly on attainment of prior actions. At the time of appraisal in June 2007, the
government had still some of the prior actions and only met all of them in 2008.


                                             19

83.     The Bank team which consisted of seasoned professionals with relevant technical
in the areas supported by the credit as well as an experienced team leader showed
responsiveness to government's changed needs in the timing of negotiations and a
commitment to follow through on the operation that had taken almost a year longer than
initially planned. However, this extension of time had a marginally negative effect on the
quality and depth of dialogue around this operation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.     Given that the design of the operation had to rely on a PAF that does not
contribute as much as it could to support policy dialogue and reforms that can be critical
to the achievement of government's objectives, the overall rating is moderately
satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.     The interim PAF developed in 2005 provided the initial framework for the
harmonized provision of budget support to the Zambian government. The PAF 2006-
2008 was developed in 2006 building on the interim PAF. The PAF 2006-2008 was
prepared jointly by government, led by the staff of the Ministry of Finance, and the PRBS
donors. Extensive consultations were held within the sectoral advisory groups (SAGs)
which consist of representatives from civil society, private sector and government.

86.     The PAF has improved significantly in substance and scope since 2005. The
inclusion of new sector policies and refinement of previous indicators has required a
more proactive coordination and leadership role by the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry
of Finance has on the overall been able to provide this required leadership.

87.     Government was significantly delayed in undertaking required actions to achieve
the end year targets in the PAF for 2006, in reform areas of macroeconomic management,
public sector management, public finance management and agriculture. As a result of
these delays, the prior actions of the credit had not been met at the time of the joint
review in June 2007. The performance in implementing the broad reform program for
2007 in the PAF for 2007-2009 was also somewhat weaker than previous years.

88.     With regard to the EMGC II operation, the government also experienced a few
setbacks in meeting the effectiveness timelines, after the credit was approved. These were
mainly as a result of a change of key staff that had been involved in the operation design
and negotiation and the halt of government functions after the death of the late President.




                                            20

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89.     While the Ministry of Finance does provide overall leadership in the PAF
process, it has struggled to provide consistent leadership with respect to monitoring the
timely implementation of reform program by other ministries and agencies. The lack of
participation by key sectors in the annual review processes even until June 2008 also
limited the ability to undertake timely follow up actions, hence affecting the effectiveness
of the Joint Executive Committee (JEC). Government did however improve the level of
participation of key sectors during the review meeting in 2009. The result of which is
that implementing agencies are monitoring implementation in a more timely manner than
was previously the case.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

90.     Challenges are present with respect to the timely implementation of reforms by
government especially by the various ministries and agencies, which are outside the
control of the Ministry of Finance. However, in light of the improved cross sectoral
participation in the PAF process and improved monitoring capacities of the implementing
agencies in 2009, the overall borrower performance is deemed to be moderately
satisfactory


6. Lessons Learned


    ·   The design and sequencing of reforms need to take into account the track record
        of the government especially in those areas that have been chosen by the
        operation. This will ensure that expected outcomes can be more realistic and
        focused on reforms in areas where chances of success are higher.

    ·   In order to improve accountability that will lead to better implementation of
        reforms, there is a need for strengthening the link between the PRBS processes
        and other national processes through the sectoral advisory groups (SAGs). This
        will enable increased involvement of other stakeholders such as civil society and
        parliament.

    ·   The assessment of government performance under the PAF showed that while the
        Ministry of Finance substantially undertook the actions required in reform areas
        under its control, the performance of other government agencies in meeting their
        targets was not as consistent over the same period. The role of a strong Ministry
        of Finance that can catalyze involvement from the different sectors is a key
        element in cross-cutting operations such as the PAF.

    ·  It must be recognized that operating in a donor harmonized framework can lead to
       trade-offs, especially since policies governing budget support can differ between
       some donors and the Bank. The limits of using a single instrument to achieve
       multiple objectives (e.g. harmonization, predictability, contribution and
       encouragement to reforms) need to be acknowledged.

    ·  In order for the PAF to be a good catalyst for the implementation of a program to
       meet government's objectives, it is essential that it focuses on both the outcome
       indicators that would measure government performance on an annual basis and on
       the underlying policy and institutional reforms that would lead to these outcomes.
       This would avoid excessive reliance on mainly outcome indicators and lead to a
       more balanced approach towards supporting needed reforms.

    ·  Consistent dialogue among donors and between donors and government can lead
       to improvements in the content of the PAF. A successful example of this has
       been the inclusion of energy sector indicators in the PAF 2008-2010.




7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

91.    The borrower has evaluated its performance under EMGC II in a written report
(see Annex 4). The borrower noted that most of the key lessons and recommendations
under EMGC II were similar to those it had made under the previous operation EMGC I.

92.     One of the recommendations made, was the need to streamline the number of
conditions that are attached to loan agreements in line with current reforms that are being
implemented by multilateral institutions. The Bank agrees that when there is an existing
IMF program, having prior actions in the areas of macroeconomic management in
addition to what is in an IMF program, can be avoided.

93.    The borrower also made a recommendation for the Bank to fully align with the
PAF assessment framework so as to reduce transaction costs. The Bank did align the
EMGC II with the PAF and PRBS process, as it only selected prior actions that were part
of the PAF 2006-2008 multi-year rolling program. The Bank also undertook its appraisal
of the program, during the June 2007 joint PRBS review meeting. In addition, the Bank
uses only the attainment of selected PAF indicators, the prior actions, in providing its
budget support. This enables the government to concentrate its efforts on attainment of
only a selected number of reforms to obtain the Bank budget support allocation. As was
the case in EMGC II, the Bank processes even provide for flexibility when more time is
required for government to meet the prior actions of an operation.

94.    The Bank acknowledges the borrower's recommendation on the possibility of
streamlining the letter of development policy when policies are already outlined in the
FNDP as well as the PRBS, PAF, MTEF and other documents.

95.    The borrower also made a recommendation to avoid the use of policy based
conditions as requisites for tranche releases of funds as such policies are influenced by
factors beyond government control. While the Bank does recognize that the political
economy environment in Zambia requires an extensive consultation process, the Bank
only selects reforms that the government has committed to undertaking which are already
contained in the PAF. Moreover, the Bank policies with respect to development policy
lending require that its operations support policy and institutional reforms that the
government has committed to undertake.
