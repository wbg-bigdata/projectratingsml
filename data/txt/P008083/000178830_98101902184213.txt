INTE7P.1ATTONAL BANK FOR RECONSTPUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECIJTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE: TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY, LTD.
WITH THF. GUARANTEE OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
1.        T submit the follmoing report and recommendation on a proposed
loan eniiivalent to $2.0 million to the Trinidad and Tobago Development Fi-
nance Company, Limited (TTDFC), with the guarantee of Trinidad and Tobago.
The loan would help finance the import component of TTDFC's operations
over a period of two years. Amortization would conform substantially to
the aggregate of the amortization schedule applicable to the sub-loans
and investments financed bv the proposed loan. The interest rate would
be 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        In 1961 the Bank made its first loan to Trinidad and Tobago for
power net of cancellations, of $21.4 million with the guarantee of the
Unitedl Kingdom.  Since Trinidad and Tobago's independence in 1962, Bank
lending hns amounted to $28.0 million. The Bank now holds $30 million,
including $13.6 million not yet disbursed. Almost one-half of the
lending has been for power, about one-fifth each for highwqays and education
and the remainder for an agricultural settlement and a family planning proj-
ect. A summary statement of Bank loans to Trinidad and Tobago at March 31,
1972 is attached as Annex I.
3.        The to7o power projects have been completed. After some initial
difficulties, good progress has been made in the agricultural project.
Tlhere were delays in the highway project, due largely to the poor perform-
ance of the initial consultants who were replaced late in 1969, but now
works are proceeding satisfactorily. Progress on the education project
has been good, with work started on 16 out of 20 new schools.   The family
planning loan (no. 743-TR) was declared effective on January 31, 1972, after
contractual arrangements were completed with the architectural hospital con-
sultants and an architect to head the population section of the project im-
plementation ttnit.
4.        The Bank. is presently considering a port improvement project in
Port of Spain, a second education project and a sugar rehabilitation project.
These should be ready for presentation to the Executive Directors in the
course of the next 12 months.



- 2 -
5.        So far there have been no operations of the International Finance
Corporation in TrinIdad and Tobago which became a member of the Corporation
only in June 1971. An IFC mission visited the country in mid-January to
discuss possible investment projects.
PART IT - THE ECONOMY
6.        The political stability achieved under the leadership of Prime
Minister Eric Williams was seriously endangered in April 1970, when demon-
strations against the trial of some Trinidadian students in Canada deteri-
orated into civil disorders. In November 1970, the state of emergency im-
posed at the time of the April disorders was lifted. It was, however, re-
introduced in October 1971 in the wake of serious labor problems at the
largest construction project in the country, a desulphurization plant.
7.        The latest economic report (WH-192a) was distributed to the Exec-
utive Directors on September 3, 1969. An economic memorandum (CA-10) was
circulated on May 13, 1971.  A country data sheet is attached as Annex II
to this Report. The 1969 economic report highlighted the possibility that
crude oil reserves might not last more than ten years, and that Trinidad,
whose quite high per capita GN? ($813 in 1970) is generated mainly by petro-
leum, might be faced with a severe cutback in its GNP if no alternative
sources of income were developed in the meantime. Diversification appeared
essential in any event, so as to provide additional employment for the
rising labor force.
8.        Particular attention was given in the economic report to the scope
for rapid development of tourism as an alternative source of income and em-
ployment. Trinidad and Tobago has a considerable tourist potential, but the
Government has been reluctant to encourage the expansion of this sector be-
cause of its concern that a large influx of foreign tourists might give rise
to difficult social problems.   Trinidad's Five-Year Development Plan, pub-
ished in 1969, did nevertheless foresee a major increase in foreign exchange
earnings from tourism.  The political disturbances of April 1970 resulted in
a setback tn the development of tourist facilities in Tobago.   However, with
a grently improved campaign to attract tourists, the industry has recovered
rather well. although demand prospects, like elsewhere in the Caribbean, are
now less promising than they seemed at the time of the 1q69 economic report.
9.        Ilv contrast, the outlook for oil has changed considerably for the
better since 1969. AMOCO, a subsidiary of Standard Oil of Indiana, has con-
firme(d the existence of an important oil and possibly a very large gas field
off the east coast of Trinidad.   AMOCO has started producing oil and realized
a fltow, of around 2n,n0n barrels a day in April 1972, thus adding about one-
seventh to Trintdnd's recent production.   There are reasonably good chances
that tltis outptut will rise to 9n,n00 barrels a day by the end of 1972 and
further increase in 1973. As to gas, the size and quality of the reserves
is sucht as to provi(le a possible basis for a liquified natural gas venture
orientecd to the U.S. market.



-3-
10.       The promising developments in the petroleum sector have not alle-
viated the pressing need for diversification for the sake of increasing em-
ployment, since the petroleum industry offers only very limited direct em-
ployment.  The disturbances of 1970, when economic growth slowed down to
about two percent, have brought to the fore the serious unemployment and
underemployment problem in the country. Unemployment in Trinidad and Tobago
is around 14 percent and is concentrated among the young and unskilled. The
Government contrihution to coping with this problem has been principally
through actions with a long-run impAct, for example, by supporting a family
planning program and by making the education system more relevant to the needs
of the economy. In the wake of last year's events, the Government also
initiated a number of job-creating activities, mostly of the small public
works variety, to reduce the number of unemployed. However, it has recognized
that this is of little permanent benefit, unless new economic activities can
be found. For the medium-term task of finding jobs, the Government has relied
mainly on the private sector to promote tourism and manufacturing. It is giving
special attention to projects in the countryside, designed to slow down the
movement of young people to the urban centers of Port of Spain and San Fer-
nando.
11.       The other issue which the disturbances brought to the surface was
the widespread feeling that, while Trinidad had enjoyed political independ-
ence for almost a decade, the economy was still dominated by foreigners.
National particination in major foreign-owned companies is now being sup-
ported by all parties.   In 1970 the Government bought the branch of the
Bank of London and Montreal and converted it into the first and only nation-
ally held commercial bankc. It also bought 51 percent of the ordinary shares
of the British-held Caroni, Ltd., the largest sugar company in the country.
In the oil sector, a small company, Trinidad Tesoro, has been set up as a
joint venture by the Government and the U.S. Tesoro Oil Company.
12.       Apart from the Bank, which has been the major source of external
financing, loans have been provided principally by the Inter-American De-
velopment Bank (IDB), and the U. S. Export Import Bank (EXIMBANK). IDB is
financing agriculture, housing, and water and sewerage, and is considering
an educational project. EXIMBANK is mainly involved in power and telecom-
munications. Past lending of the main official lending agencies is sum-
marized below:

Except for a $1.3 million loan for water and sewerage, IDB loans have been
extended from the Fund for Special Operations, carrying 2.25 to 3.25 percent
interest rates, and terms ranging from 7 to 27 years. EXIMBANK loans have
been provided for 2.5 to 15 years, with interest of 5.5 to 6.0 percent.
13.       The external public debt has,sremained low, and the service on
this public debt in 1970 amounted to.5.0 percent of export of gpods and
services, net of imports of crude oil and-investment in,come payments.    In
these circumstances, Trinidad io anxious to borrow abroad for productive
projects which would diversify and strengthen the economy, and should be
considered creditworthy for further externa-l borrowing on conventional
terms.
PART III - THE PROJECT
14.       An Appraisal Report on the,Trinidad and Tobago Dev.elopment Finance
Companv, Limit,ed (No. DB-83a) is being distributed separately.    Since comple,-
tion of the Arpraisal Report, the audited financial statements for 1971 have
been received.   Tlese do not differ significantly from the results given in
the App'raisal Report, which has not been revised.   The actual figures, how-
ever, are given in the Loan and Project Summary in Annex II of this Report.



-5-
15.       In 1969 a Bank mission concluded that the establishment of a devel-
optnent finance company would be a catalytic factor for the further develop-
ment of the economy of Trinidad and Tobago. In response to a request from
the Government, Bank staff worked with the steering committee which was
responsible for completing the proposal for establishing the company. A
possible loan to the company, which was not yet established, was under
preparation in Spring 1970 when, as a consequence of the disturbances in
Port-of-Spain, further action on the loan had to be postpbned. In May
1970, the Trinidad and Tobago Development Finance Company, Limited (TTDFC)
was established, and it was agreed that the Bank appraise the new institu-
tion and its prospects once it was a going concern. TTDFC opened its door
for business in October 1970. In accordance with this understanding, an
appraisal mission visited Trinidad and Tobago in May-June 1971 and negotia-
tions took place in November 1971. The Borrower was represented by Messrs.
M. M. de Souza, Chairman of TTDFC, and J. E. N. Scoon, General Manager, the
Guarantor bv Mr. F. Rampersad, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Fi-
nance, and Miss Bourne, Legal Advisor. Subsequently, delays in governmental
approval of a Memorandum of Agreement with the Commonwealth Fund for Techni-
cal Cooperation (CFTC), needed by CFTC to contract an advisor to TTDFC, de-
layed presentation of the proposed loan.
Development Prosnects for Industry and Tourism
16.       TTDFC has been set up primarily to advance manufacturing and
tourist activities. The Government's policy in the manufacturing sector
has been to promote private sector activities, more recently with emphasis
on private investment with at least a 25 percent local ownership. This
policy has been implemented through the Pioneer Industries Ordinance which
is administered bv the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) for the
Mlinistry of Industry and Commerce. In addition to fiscal concessions made
under the Ordinance, IDC provides factory sites and building shells for cer-
tain industries, as well as small loans. Moreover, import licensing has
been extended as a means of import protection. Almost 95 percent of manu-
facturing ontput has been for the domestic market.    Since 1968, with the
opportunities afforded by the Caribbean Free Trade Area (CARIFTA) and with
a certain saturation reached in import substitution, growth in manufacturing
exports has accelerated. Prospects for further growth in manufacturing
production are quite good. There is room for additional products for the
domestic market, especially in processed and preserved foodstuffs, and
many opportunities exist in the CARIFTA market and beyond. Trinidad and
Tobngo has a work force which has shown a good ability to learn quickly new
skills. TTT)FC is giving snecial attention to the international competi-
tiveness of its client firms.
17.       Trlh incentives established for the hotel industry, as well as a
small llotel Loan Futnd, hiave been applied verv restrictively since the Gov-
ernrcent lias not tintil recently considered tourism as a priority sector for
(ICvelopmelnt.  Now the Government is giving special attention to building



- 6 -
hotels for medlium income groups both from the West Indies and from outside
areas.  As tourism is recovering from the 1970 setback already referred to,
considerable investment opportunities exist, initially in good part in Tobago
whiere alternative development possibilities are quite limited.
Financial Intermediaries
19.       Seven commercial banks, which originated as overseas operations
of British, Canadian and American banking parents, have been the only sig-
nificant local source of credit. The Government, which bought one of the
seven banks in 1970, as mentioned in paragraph 11 above, expects that during
the next few years Trinidadians will control a majority interest in all seven.
With few exceptions, the banks intend to incorporate in the country and sell
a majority of their shares to nationals, thereby complying with the Government's
new policy. Commercial banks have been able to attract substantial deposits
which have been on-lent mostly in short-term operations. The prime rate is 8
percent, but the effective rate is mostly 9-1/2 to 10 percent. Loans up to
five years with a floating interest rate are being made to first rate cus-
tomers and to those able to pledge strong security. These loans take
mainly the form of overdraft lines specifying a ceiling, within which in-
dividual loans are rolled over. Such operations in practice appear limited
to companies with equity capital exceeding one-half of total-resources.
19.       Trust companies attaclhed to the commercial banks provide limited
mortgage lending for residential and commercial properties. Life insurance
companies, which rapidly expanded business in recent years, also have lim-
ited themselves to these types of mortgage financing. The securities mar-
ket is embryonic and the informal Call Stock Exchange is not yet developed
to the point where large sums of capital could be raised.
20.       Since the commercial banks largely confine themselves to short-
term operations, TTDFC should be able to obtain sufficient medium and long-
term business to become a viable institution. Several commercial banks are
shareholders in TTDFC and have indicated their desire to limit their long-
term lending to their largest clients, while leaving the medium-size busi-
ness to TTDFC. Moreoever, the Government has decided that, with TTDFC's
establishment, IDC loans will be limited to a maximum of TT$50,000 to firms
with total assets of not more than TT$100,000. TTDFC will also be able to
provide equitv capital to businesses, a facility not offered by the other
financial institutions.
TTDFC  Its Objectives and Policies
21.       TTDFC is a limited company incorporated under the Companies Act in
Mav 1)70. Of the authorized share capital of TT$50 million ($25 million),
TT$4.27 million has been subscribed and half of this amount has been paid in.
Subscrlhed but unpaid share capital can be called upon two weeks notice by
a decision of the General Assembly. The Government alone has subscribed
TT$4 million (or 95 percent). The 15 non-government shareholders are well-
established btusinesses: banks, insurance, petroleum, manufacturing and



-7-
construction firms. Of the 15 private shareholders, six are branches or
affiliates of foreign companies. The Government has stated that it will
hold not less than 51 percent of TTDFC's share capital. In practice, it is
likely to hold a much higher percentage for the foreseeable future.
22.       The broad objective of TTnFC is to promote economic development
by asststinp- in the establishment and expansion of business enterprises.
It will. do this by participating in share capital, granting loans and pro-
viding other forms of financing and technical assistance. TTDFC also has
as objectives the development of the capital market and the enhancement of
ownership and control of enterprises by nationals.    Under its Articles of
kssociation, TTDFC is authorized to lend to a wide range of businesses,
such as manufacturing, tourism, fishing, forestry, processing of agricul-
tural produce and ventures and services related thereto. TTDFC plans to
concentrate on the financing of industrial, tourism and commercial agricul-
tural enterprises, medium in size. It will not be its policy to invest in
petroleum or real estate.
23.       TTDFC has adopted a Statement on Investment and Operational Poli-
cies that sets general investment criteria, being (a) technical feasibility,
(b) commercial viability, and (c) contribution to the economy. In assessing
the contribution to the economy particular weight will be given to: (i) im-
port substitution, (ii) use of local raw materials, (iii) employment oppor-
tunities, (iv) foreign exchange earnings and (v) the development of ancil-
lary industries. TTDFC's Statement of Investment and Operational Policies
follows the operational policies usually adopted by development finance
companies which have obtained financing from the World Bank Group.
Organization and Procedures
24.       Board of Directors:   The Company's Board of Directors consists
of eight members, including the Chairman. The present Board is composed
of one director appointed by the Central Bank and seven directors appoint-
ed bv the Government. Four of the government appointments are respected
businessmen, active in manufacturing, insurance and law. The government
representatives are the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Planning
and Development, the Senior Economist of the Ministry of Agriculture and
the hanager of the Operations Department of the Central Bank. The
Chairman is a capable and energetic insurance executive, who takes an ac-
tive interest in TTPFC's activities.
25.       Management and Staff:   Management and staff of TTDFC are academ-
icallv qtialified, butt laclc experience in the operation of a development
finasice company. TThFC has made arrangements to obtain an advisor who has
suchi experience, and whose main strength is in project appraisal. The ad-
visor, J. S. I.. de Fonseka, has been engaged by the Commonwealth Fund for
Technical Cooperation on behalf of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago
an(d is seconded, for a two-year period, to TTDFC.  The Bank has assisted
in finding him.  The Government also is nepgotiating with the Arthur D.
Little Company for constlting services to TTDFC in dealing with complex
projects.



26.       Procedures:  TTDFC still has to develop its appraisal work. In
the past, substantial delays have occurred between Board action on invest-
ments and the signing of contracts.  As this was due to the method of
neonotiation and the manner in which legal advice was sought, TTDFC is now
working on a standard mortgage debenture and plans to bring its legal of-
ficer into lending operations at an earlier stage.
Projected Operations and Resource Requirements
27.       On the basis of past trends of investment in manufacturing and
tourism, the outlook for investment in these sectors, and TTDFC's pipeline
of projects, TTT)FC's loan approvals for the 1971-1975 period are estimated
at TT$14.1. million. TTDFC's total investment program (loans plus equity
investments) for the period is projected to be TT$17.2 million. Estimated
disbursements by TTDFC would amount to 7 percent of estimated gross invest-
ment in manufacturing and tourism.
28.       For the years 1972 and 1973 investment approvals (both loan and
equity) are forecast to total TT$6.8 million at a projected interest rate
of 9-1/2 to 1n percent. In the March 1972-March 1974 period such a level
of approvals wotuld result in commitments of TT$5.6 million, TT$1.9 million
in local currency and TT$3.7 million in foreign exchange.   TTDFC at the
end of December 1971 had uncommitted local currency of TT$3.4 million but
no foreign resources. During negotiations, the Government agreed to pro-
vide TTDFC withi additional local currency in the amount of TT$2.5 million
during 1972, in the form of a subordinated loan of TT$2.0 million by the
effective date of the loan, and in the form of share capital or subordinated
loans of TT$0.5 million by December 31, 1972. TTDFC will then have enough
local currency resources to cover domestic procurement, not only for March
1972-March 1974, but for around two years thereafter. However, TTDFC will
need TT$3.7 million in foreign exchange to cover commitments to be made up
to liarch 1974. A Bank loan of $2 million would cover this estimated foreign
exchange requirement.
29.       TTDFC will earn small net profits in 1972 and 1973. Being a new
company, just starting its operations, administrative costs weigh relatively
heavily in the initial years.  Consequently, profitability over the 1971-75
period will be low, amounting to 2.2 percent of year-end shar,e capital in
1971 and graduially rising to 6.2 percent in 1975. Over the five-year period
1971-75, earnings after administrative-expenses will cover interest payments
a minimum of 1.4 times and principal repayment to creditors will be covered
by collections from borrowers a minimum of 1.7 times in each year in which
such repayments arc due. hlowever, TTDFC will not be able to pay substantial
dividends for a long time.



-9-
Terms of Proposed Loan
30.       The terms of the proposed loan are those normally applied to
lending to development finance companies. However, since TTDFC is a new
company and his not had time to build up its business to an adequate level,
TTDFC would be given concessional treatment in respect of the commitment
charge applicable to the Bank loan.
31.       Prior Bank approval would be required for all sub-loans requir-
ing Bank funds of more than $100,000, with an aggregate free limit of
$500,000. The debt/equity ratio would not exceed 3:1. During negotia-
tions it was agreed that the Government would carry the foreign exchange
risk associated with the proposed Bank loan. Disbursements would be made
on the basis of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment and supplies and 35
percent of expenditures on construction works, being the estimated foreign
exchange component.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and TTDFC, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between Trinidad and Tobago and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agree-
ments conform to the normal pattern for loans for development finance com-
panies.
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECONMENDATION
34.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
