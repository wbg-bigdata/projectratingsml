APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
TUNISIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Agriculture provides about 18% of Tunisia's GDP and employs over
50% of the active population. Exports of agriculture products amounted
in 1974 to D 100 million representing some 25% of Tunisia's total exports.
The agricultural sector has lagged behind overall economic growth with a
growth rate of 3.8% during the 4th plan (1973-76) as compared to 7.7% for
the whole economy. One of the Government's main objectives during the 5th
plan (1977-1981) is self-sufficiency in the main agriculture products and a
balanced foreign trade in other food products.
ii.       Agricultural credit is provided mainly by the Banque Nationale de
Tunisie (BNT). Several Government agencies are also involved in the provi-
sion of short-term credit, while investment credit is mostly financed (through
BNT) by special funds provided by the State budget or by foreign aid. At most
50,000 Tunisian farmers, i.e., 15% of all, have access to institutional credit,
most of them large or medium-size farmers. Agricultural credit policy is char-
acterized by the great number of institutions and programs involved and the
diversity of financing terms under various funds. This framework, while
allowing a certain flexibility of credit provisions, has had detrimental
effects both in institutional and economic terms which were compounded by
easy lending terms and conditions (low interest rates, high grant element).
Recent developments show some progress in terms of definition of target
groups and of interest rate levels.
iii.      BNT, a multi-purpose bank established in 1959 and controlled by
Government, is the only institution ext2nding medium and long-term credit to
agriculture in Tunisia. Funds relent by BNT for agricultural invectments are
mainly Government, bilateral aid and Bank/IDA funds, and, only in a small pro-
portion, BNT's own funds. BNT is well managed, has an adequate accounting
system and competent staff, and has since its origin consistently shown a
satisfactory profit.
iv.       Bank/IDA involvement in Agricultural Credit in Tunisia started with
the First Agricultural Credit Project (Loan/Credit 779/263, US$8 million).
The Loan/Credit which became effective in March 1972 was to finance part of
Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT) lending to commercial farmers for investment
in grain farm mechanization and dairy farming and to Societe Tunisienne de
l'Industrie Laitiere for development of date palm plantations; financing of
technical assistance to BNT was also included. The Project implementation
during 1972 through 1974 was slow due mainly to competing funds on more con-
cessional terms available to potential subborrowers. Once this issue was
resolved project implementation and disbursements were satisfactory and as
of October 1, 1976 total Loan/Credit disbursements reached US$7.4 million
and the remaining US$0.6 million were fully committed.



- ii -
v.        This report appraises a Second Agricultural Credit Project for
which a Bank loan of US$12 million equivalent is proposed. The Project would
support a two-year lending program for on-farm development of small and com-
mercial farms, for selected agroindustries and a four-year lending program
for small holder date-palm plantation development. Banque Nationale de
Tunisie (BNT) would be the Borrower and would be responsible for Project
implementation. Whereas the First Credit Project aimed principally at in-
creasing agricultural production through credit to large farmers and to a
Government controlled company (STIL), the Second Project aims also at the
improvement of the living conditions of small farmers with so far little or
no access to institutional credit, and at the participation of associations
of small farmers in pursuing development of modern date plantations.
vi.       The total cost of the Second Agricultural Credit Project is esti-
mated at about US$26.3 million equivalent of which about 45% would be in
roreign exchange. Financing of investments would come from the following
sources: subborrowers would on average contribute 23% of investment cost,
the Tunisian Government would contribute through grants for small farmers
investment and for date plantation development 10%, and through loans for
date plantation development an additional 10% of the cost, BNT would con-
tribute from its own funds 12% and the Bank 45% of the Project cost.
vii.      The range of items to be financed under the Project is varied and
would be purchased by individual subborrowers over a period of 2 years (4
years in the case of date plantations) and would not be suitable for bulk
procurement or international competitive bidding. Therefore most of the
procurement under the Project would be through normal commercial channels,
and local bidding in the case of deep well drilling.
viii.     The financial rate of return of subproject as established on the
basis of representative models would range between 11% and over 50%. The
overall economic rate of return is estimated at 34%. With assurances ob-
tained from BNT and the Tunisian Governinent during negotiations, the Project
would be suitable for an IBRD loan to BNT of US$12.0 million equivalent for
12 years including a grace period of 4 years.



APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
TUNISIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Tunisia and BNT have requested a Bank loan to
help finance agricultural credit for investments in small and large scale
grain and mixed farming, for dairy farming, for development of new date-palm
plantations to be owned by groups of small farmers and for selected agroin-
dustries.  The Borrower for the Bank loan would be the Banque Nationale de
Tunisie (BNT). BNT is already the Borrower under the First Agricultural
Credit Project (Credit 263-TUN, US$3.0 million and Loan 779-TUN, US$5.0
million) which finances investments generally similar in purpose.  This
Credit/Loan is now fully committed and is expected to be fully disbursed
by the end of 1976.
1.02      The total Project cost would be US$26.3 million of which the re-
quested Loan of US$12 million would cover the foreign exchange cost estimated
at approximately US$12 million. The balance of the Project cost would be
financed by (i) subborrowers contributions, (ii) BNT's own funds, (iii) Gov-
ernment grants in the case of small farmers and date plantations and (iv)
Government loans in the case of date palm plantation development.
1.03      The Project was prepared with the assistance of two FAO/IBRD CP
missions in September 1974 and September 1975, and was appraised in November
1975 by Messrs. J. Cerych and H1. Lenot (Bank) and G. Clement and A. Sommer
(consultants). Mlessrs. Merghoub and Bertelsmeier were responsible for the
project through negotiations and final processing. Mrs. Anne McLaughlin
checked figures and tables and helped with calculations.
II. COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Country Background
2.01      Tunisia, with an area of some 164,000 km2, is the smallest and
least endowed of the North African ltaghreb countries. From a climatic and
agricultural point of view the country can be conveniently divided into
three parts: Northern Tunisia (20% of land area); Central Tunisia (20%) and
Southern Tunisia (60%). The population (5.6 million in 1975) concentrated
in Northern Tunisia and along the eastern coastline is growing at about 2.3%
annually. Average per capita GNP for 1976 is estimated at about US$754; the



- 2 -
absolute poverty level for 1976 is estimated at US$191, the relative poverty
level at US$192. 1/
B. The Agricultural Sector
General
2.02      Only in Northern Tunisia, where average rainfall exceeds 350 mm, is
grown a wide range of rainfed crops, dominated by wheat and barley. Yields
are often depressed when fluctuations in the amount and the seasonal distribu-
tion of rainfall result in drought or floods. Central Tunisia agriculture,
with average rainfall of 200-350 mm, is characterized by rainfed tree crops
(predominantly olives and almonds), marginal cereal production, and sheep
grazing. Southern Tunisia, where rainfall drops below 200 mm, has extensive
grazing with some date and vegetable crops cultivated in the oases.
2.03      Some 53,000 km2 (5.3 million ha), or 33 percent of land area, is
classified as cultivable land; the remainder is range land suitable for exten-
sive sheep grazing, low-yielding forest and desert. The cropped area is about
3.1 million ha including 1.3 million ha under perrenial crops, but only 110,000
ha, or 3.5 percent are equipped for irrigation. Irrigation is mostly confined
to the Lower tMedjerda Valley, the Nebhana area near Sousse and Cap Bon, and the
oases of Southern Tunisia. Principal irrigated crops are tomatoes, peppers,
potatoes, melons and citrus. Off-season vegetables are grown in small quanti-
ties along the coast near Sousse and Zarzis and on the island of Jerba. Areas
in vegetables increased considerably during the 1960's.
2.04      The State owns 815,000 ha of land cultivable or suitable for agri-
culture while the private sector owns as much as 4.5 million ha. Legislation
exists for land redistribution and consolidation in public irrigation areas,
transfer of public land to private farmers, and distribution of part of the
collectively-owned land to individuals.
2.05      In 1975 agriculture contributed about 16 percent of GDP, employed a
little over 50 percent of the labor force, and provided some 20 percent of
total exports (principally olive oil, citrus and other fruits, and vegeta-
bles); however, agricultural exports excluding olive oil represent only a small
part (15%) of total farm output. Agricultural imports (mainly cereals, edible
oils, dairy products livestock and sugar) have increased sharply over the past
decade and represented about 27 percent of total imports in 1975 (estimate).
The net trade balance in agricultural products was persistently negative over
the last decade. Price regulations are in effect for a limited number of com-
modities (including cereals, milk, edible oils, and sugar) and retail mark-up
on all foods is Government-controlled.

of 8% p.a. and the actual GNiP growth rate of 10% p.a.



- 3 -
2.06      Mlany factors constrain intensive agricultural development.  Insuf-
ficient rainfall causes irrigation to play an important role in diversifying
the basically extensive rainfed agriculture. The potentially irrigable area
is limited to 200,000 ha, mostly in tiorthern Tunisia where rainfall is already
above average and where incremental benefits from irrigation development are
lowest. Other constraints are inadequacies in the agricultural extension
services (Annex 1), the credit system (Annex 2) and, in some areas, ready
access to marketing centers.
2.07      Grain Farming and Mixed Agriculture:  Rainfed grain farming is the
principal farming practice used in Northern Tunisia. In areas where annual
rainfall is below 500 mm alternate-year cropping is still practiced. Where
adequate water supply is available livestock production and dairy farming is
sometimes combined with grain farming. The principal grains produced are soft
and hard wheat and barley. After a record harvest in 1972 (1.2 million tons)
the grain production remained satisfactory in 1973 and 1974, and reached in
1975, another record year, 1.3 million tons. The general increase in produc-
tion compared to the years prior to 1972 is due largely to greater use of
fertilizers and selected seeds. The area under grain cultivation has also
increased by some 15% during the period covered by the present Plan (1973-76),
reaching in 1975 about 1.5 million ha. The production of vegetables and
tomatoes on irrigated land also increased substantially.
2.08      Tree Crops:  Yearly tree crop production fluctuates round 1 million
tons, of which olives, even in a mediocre production year, represent about
50%. The average annual production of olives for the period 1973-75 was
480,000 tons with important yearly variations depending largely on the rain-
fall (1972: 900,000 tons, 1973: 375,000 tons). Citrus fruit production is
stable, averaging some 100,000 tons/year.
2.09      Livestock and Dairy Production:  The current estimate of the exist-
ing livestock inventory /1 in Tunisia is as follows:
1973         1975
Cows /2                                     335,500    384,000
of which pure breed                          17,500      24,000
Sheep (female) /2                         2,555,000  2,790,000
Goats (female) /2                           569,000    765,000
/1   Source:  ONEP and USAID Survey.
/2   No data available for male animals.
The milk production per pure breed animals is estimated to be on average about
2,400 1 per year as compared to only 450 1 for local breeds. In 1975 Tunisia's
milk production of 260,000 tons of milk had to be supplemented by imports of
some 130,000 tons equivalent in powder to meet the increasing demand. The



consumption of milk and milk products is expected to reach 520,000 tons by 1980
and to meet this demand Tunisian milk production would have to grow annually
by 12%, which appears highly unlikely. The main reason for the relatively low
milk production was, until January 1976, the uneconomically low price of milk
(D 0.065/1) set by the Government. Only two categories of farrmers could op-
erate profitably or at least without loss under these conditions: (a) very
large and modern dairy farms, and (b) farmers who could sell their production
directly to consumers at unregulated prices (about D 0.100/1) generally much
higher than the Government price. In January 1976 Government increased the
milk price to D 0.090/1; this measure improves the necessary impetus for more
investment and growth within dairy farming.
2.10       Date Plantations:  Tunisia's date production is concentrated in the
semi-desertic southern and southwestern part of the country. The bulk of the
date production still comes from traditional oases which cover some 10,500 ha.
Characteristic of these traditional oases are the high density of trees, out-
dated methods of cultivation and mediocre yields. The system of land tenure
is marked by an extreme fragmentation of ownership, so that in some cases the
fruit of a single palm tree may belong to more than one family. Mlodern plan-
tations irrigated by artesian wells cover an additional area of about 1,400
ha, of which 815 ha were planted since 1972 by the Societe Tunisienne de
l'Industrie Laitiere (STIL) under the First Agricultural Credit Project. With
the exception of one plantation dating back to the late 1920's, all plantations
are under 14 years of age. The production of the last 5 years varied accord-
ing to climatic conditions and availability of ground water, between 39,000
and 58,000 tons annually of which the praised Deglat variety represented about
20%. Date exports, nearly exclusively the Deglat variety, amounted during the
same period in average to about 5,800 tons per year.
2.11      Agro-Industries:  Excluding olive oil mills, there are presently
in Tunisia about 300 enterprises which can be classified as agro-industries.
They employ full time about 10,000 people and account for about 1% of GDP.
The characteristic features of the sector are: (a) preponderance of flour
milling, canning and edible oil industries in terms of turnover and invest-
ment, (b) large number of small enterprises, (c) concentration around Tunis
and coastal urban centers, (d) technical inadequacy of the often obsolete
machinery and plant, (e) inadequate technical training and, (f) limited,
if any, coordination between agricultural and industrial producers.
2.12       Olive Oil Production:  Between 1968 and 1974 olive oil exports rep-
resented on average about 50% of the value of all agricultural exports and
were in value terms the most important export commodity after crude oil and
phosphate. There are about 1,100 olive oil mills in Tunisia and their nominal
extraction capacity of 180,000 tons/year is theoretically sufficient to cover
the country's requirements even in good production years. Many of the mills
however, are ancient, have run down equipment with low productivity and pro-
duce second-rate oil. M[oreover the geographical distribution of the mills is
such that oil extraction capacity is inadequate in the North while there is
a surplus capacity in the South. Due to further extensive new plantations
in the North, this imbalance will reach much greater proportions if new
mills are not constructed in the North.



-5-
Development Objectives
2.13      The Government's Fourth Plan (1973-76) aimed at an annual increase
in agricultural output of 6.2% over the level reached at the end of the Third
Plan (1969-1972) but an annual growth of only 3.8% is being attained. The
policy under the Fourth Plan was to emphasize directly productive investments
including rehabilitation of existing irrigation infrastructure, encourage a
higher level of investments by the private sector, and direct more resources
to production of livestock, fish, fruits and vegetables. Access to agricul-
tural credit was to be facilitated in order to increase investments and to
reach small farmers. Extension services were to be strengthened to reach more
medium and small farms. The Plan also contained specific proposals for in-
creasing security of land tenure and proposed to enforce existing legislation
for sequestration of underutilized land.
2.14      The preparation by Government of Tunisia's 5th Development Plan
(1977-81) is well advanced. The principal objectives of the Plan will be:
(a)  Full employment of the additional rural and urban working
population;
(b)  Self-sufficiency in food production; and
(c)  Continuous increase in the living standard of the
population.
2.15      Self-sufficiency in food production is defined as (i) reaching pro-
duction levels of grains and livestock (milk and meat) to meet expected in-
ternal consumption, and (ii) reaching in other agricultural products a ba-
lanced foreign trade. Under the maximum growth projection, and based on the
latest production evaluation, this would mean producing in 1981 1.8 million
tons of grains (estimates for 1976, 1.3 million) 170,000 tons of meat (1976,
105,000 tons) and 600,000 tons of milk (1976, 268,000 tons). Agricultural
exports should reach D 79.5 million (D 60.3 million, 1976), and agricultural
imports should not be higher than D 94 million (1976 D 81 million). Expressed
in yearly growth rates these objectives are for grains 6.7%, for meat 11.1%,
for milk 17.5%, for agriculture exports 5.7% and for agriculture imports 3%
only. The Government tentative estimates of investment in agriculture needed
for reaching this growth over the period of the Plan would be D 507.0 million
(US$1.2 billion). While the objective to reach self-sufficiency in grain pro-
duction and to increase agricultural exports by 5.7% yearly appears feasible
in case of rigorous application of the Plan, the prospects of increasing milk
and meat production to the projected levels seems highly unlikely.
C. Previous Agricultural Projects
2.16      The Bank/IDA financed its first agricultural project in Tunisia, the
Cooperative Farm Project, in 1967 (Loan/Credit 484/99-TUN, US$18.0 million
reduced to US$9.2 million). Following major changes in Tunisia's agricultural



-6-
policy in 1969, the original project was substantially revised and then com-
pleted in 1973. 1/ In 1971, the Bank/IDA approved a loan/credit for the Agri-
cultural Credit Project (Loan/Credit 779/263 TUN, US$8.0 million) now fully
committed and expected to be fully disbursed by the end of 1976 (para 4.01
through 4.14). IDA also finances a Fisheries Project (Credit 263-TUN, US$2.0
million) aimed at development of Tunisia's inshore fisheries.  Implementation
of the Project is satisfactory, all funds are committed and are expected to
be disbursed by the first quarter of 1977. In December 1974, the Bank ap-
proved a loan for an Irrigation Rehabilitation Project in thie Medjerda Valley
and Nebhana (Loan 1068-TUN, US$12.2 million): the loan became effective in
September 1975 and Project execution is in its early stages.
III. AGRICULTURAL CREDIT
A. General (Annex 2)
3.01      The Tunisian banking system comprises the Central Bank, 12 commer-
cial banks (the two most important 2/ being Government-owned), 43 local mutual
credit banks and several other financial institutions. 3/ The banks are con-
trolled by the Central Bank through a variety of measures: rediscount rate,
rediscount ceilings, regulation of interest rates, prior approval of loans,
reserve requirements, ratios (liquidity, solvency, medium-term financing,
etc.). These control measures reflect concern over important issues such as
banking liquidity, incentives to finance investments, financing of seasonal
activities and encouragement of savings; the control system however has been
too rigid and bureaucratic to be well-adapted to the new economic policies of
encouraging private investment and establishing an open market economy. The
detrimental effects of the low interest rate structure on the economy in terms
of resource mobilization and allocation have been detailed in a recent Bank
economic report (No. 962-TUN) and in the IFC-sponsored work on the financial
sector.
Agricultural Credit
3.02      The Ministry of Agriculture is involved together with the banks,
especially Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT) and the Caisses Locales de Credit
Mutuel (CLCMs), in the planning and in the provision of agricultural credit.
3.03      Short-term credit is granted to larger farmers by BNT, or, to a
small extent, by other commercial banks, and to the smaller farmers by the
1/   Project Performance Audit Report circulated to the Board Januarv 8, 1976.
2/   Societe Tunisienne de Banque (STB) and Banqle MNationale de Tunlisie (BNT).
3/   One of whiich, Banque de Developpement Econom ique de Tunis je (RDTET), is 1

CLUMs and by several Government agencies under specific programs (usually
credit in kind, as part of an input package) for a given crop (grain, olive
oil) or for a given region. In 1975, the banking sector provided about D 8
million to 12,000 farmers, and Government agencies about D 4 million to
40,000 farmers. The sectoral distribution of short-term credit does not fol-
low the national priorities or the contribution of each crop to total produc-
tion but is more influenced by commercial banking criteria: e.g., grain
farmers, often being wealthier, receive more than half of the short-term
credit extended by the banks, while contributing about 20% of total agricul-
tural production. About 90% of all loans were disbursed in Northern Tunisia.
3.04      Investment credit for agriculture is mostly financed by special
funds provided by the State budget or by foreign aid; the banks themselves
invest very little of their own funds in medium- and long-term loans to agri-
culture as loans to industry and commerce are safer and more profitable.
Each special fund has its own lending terms, its own appraisal procedures and
its own target group. Government-financed grants are often given in addition
to loans. In 1975, BNT (through which almost all loans and grants including
FOSDA are channelled) granted about 14,000 investment loans to farmers and
1,300 loans to cooperatives for a total amount of D 14 million including
grants. More than one-third of the loans were for agricultural machinery and
another third for tree plantations. About 50% of the loans were disbursed in
Northern Tunisia.
3.05      Credit to agroindustries is provided by a great number of banks.
Short-term credit, which includes also rediscountable credit for financing
stocks of olive oil, wine and grain held by state agencies, amounts to about
20% of all short-term credit to manufacturing industries, or 7% of all short-
term credit. Investment credit is provided almost entirely by three banks,
STB, BNT and BDET; they also provide equity capital for some agroindustrial
companies.
3.06      FOSDA.  The most important source of investment credit for agricul-
ture is the Special Fund for Agricultural Development (FOSDA), a Government
fund financed by a yearly budget appropriation and channelled exclusively
through BNT. The funds are used for direct investment grants and for loans
to small- and medium-size farmers. The lending conditions are revised each
year, and in the past have provided for low interest rates (3%-4.5%) and
maturities related to the life of the investment, ranging from two years
(rabbit breeding) to 25 years (pistachio trees).  All the repayment risk is
carried by the State budget; recoveries in the past have been around 65%. In
1975, FOSDA loans were made to about 13,000 private farmers for D 4.7 million
(plus D 1.3 million in grants) and to about 94 cooperatives for D 800,000
(plus D 57,000 in grants). With an average loan amount to private farmers of
D 662, the FOSDA clientele tends to be composed mostly of small size farmers.
3.07      Actual access by farmers to both short-term and investment credil is
limited: at most, 50,000 Tunisian farmers (15% of all) have access to insti-
tutional credit (banks, CLCMs and Government agencies). Small farmers' access
to credit is even more limited partly because of loan securitv requirements
(lack of title to Land) but also because of the inability or unwillingness of



BNT, the most important provider of credit, to develop a small farmers' lend-
ing program:  BNT is a commercially oriented bank and has been reluctant to
engage in such a program where both costs and risk are high. The Government
and BwNT's management have just begun to address the need to formulate credit
policies which allow for credit to reach small farmers in an effective manner
and still be recollected. In the past the few projects or institutions spe-
ciallv geared to small farmers (the CLCMs and some Government agencies for
short-term credit, the IJorld Food Program (IJFP) and some bilateral projects
for investment credit) were either ineffective, being hampered by institu-
tional difficulties (e.g., the CLCMs, para 3.21 ff), or limited in scope,
sometimes financing no more than pilot projects.
3.08      The great number of institutions involved in agricultural credit
and the diversity of financing terms under various funds allow for a certain
flexibility in credit terms which could be adapted to target groups; however
this framework has had detrimental effects both in institutional and economic
terms, which were compounded by the easy lending terms and conditions (low
interest rates, high grant element). In institutional terms, the control of
credit is difficult because of the multiplicity of credit-giving institutions
outside the banking system, and the precise delimitation of the roles of the
various institutions involved is not always clear. In economic terms, the
availability to farmers in some cases of several credit sources under differ-
ent lending terms has often led to a competitive situation, with a high de-
mand only for the funds with low rates, cursory project appraisal, little
supervision and low repayment pressure. The situation has been only partly
corrected by administrative decisions on eligibility of farmers for specific
funds. The subsidized credit policy, particularly interest rate subsidies
and investment grants, constitutes a heavy burden on the budget and it dis-
courages banks from providing funds to agriculture (especially investment
loans). The low interest rate level encourages capital-intensive invest-
ments.
3.09      Under a covenant of the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (1068-
TUN), the Government (tMinistry of Agriculture) agreed to review its agricul-
tural credit policy and institutional framework and to submit its study and
recommendations to the Council of Mlinisters not later than October 31, 1975,
so that the decision on implementation of the recommended changes could have
been taken by end of November 1975. The study efforts have led to a new set
of lending policies and procedures for FOSDA. Bank staff have reviewed the
drafts of decrees containing the new measures at various stages since January
1976; Government hopes to pass the decrees by late 1976. The draft recommend-
ations represent concrete progress in at least two important respects:
(i)  an income-based definition of small farmers who would be
eligible for concessionary financing under FOSDA aimed at
insuring eligibility to smaller farmers, and
(ii)  an increase in interest rates from 3-4.5% to 6% for all
types of FOSDA lending.



The maximum loan amounts per ha or per head of livestock, the proportion of
investment grants and farmers' contributions, and the repavment terms have
also been revised. The need to reduce the number of credit institutions and
programs and to improve coordination between them has been recognized but a
concrete plan for achieving this has not yet been proposed. Government has
a study under way to make proposals on this problem.
B. Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT) (Annex 3)
3.10      BNT was created in 1959 to provide agricultural credit and to
perform all normal banking and financial operations. BNT is also the second
most important commercial bank in Tunisia, providing short-term loans to
commerce and industry. Its paid-in capital reached D 4 million in November
1975, of which 25% is held by the Government, 44% by Government-controlled
companies, 17% by the Caisses Locales de Credit Mutuel (CLCIMs) and 14% by
private shareholders.  It is administered by an 11-man board, two of whom are
private members. Its current President was appointed in 1974 and previously
served as Acting General Director of BDET.
3.11      BNT's internal organization appears, in general, satisfactory,
although the decision-making process should be reviewed with emphasis on
decentralization. The need for decentralization has been recognized by BNT's
management and more delegation of authority to branches is planned. The staff
is adequate for BNT's present operations but would need to be expanded if BNT
was to take a substantially more active role in credit to small farmers and
agro-industries.
3.12      BNT's lending and granting procedures vary depending upon the source
of funds.  BNT staff appraises itself loans made from BNT's own resources
(almost all short-term) and from IBRD/IDA and IJSAID funds. A consequence
of the project implementation covenants under the First Agricultural Credit
Project was the improvement in procedures used by BNT staff for the appraisal
of investment projects financed by the Bank/IDA with, as result, high repay-
ment performance on these sub-loans. On loans made from other funds, BNT only
performs a credit-worthiness study of the prospective borrower and the lending
decision is taken outside BNT by Government. Supervision procedures are also
less stringent for these loans than for those under the First Project. BNT's
charges above the interest rate are small (at most D 10 per application).
3.13      BNT makes short-term loans out of its own resources to large private
farmers (D 4.9 million in 1975) and to cooperatives (D 0.8 million in 1975).
The recent creation of the Mutual Guarantee Societies (SCMs) will allow small
farmers to borrow directly from BNT, being jointly and severalLy liable as
members of a SCti.
3.14      On its own resources, BNT has practically made no medium- and long-
term loans to agriculture but only to industry and commerce. BNT's agricul-
tural loans have been financed by funds for investment credit from budgetary
sources or from foreign borrowing or aid, which are channelled through BNT.



- 10 -
Total agricultural medium- and long-term lending amounted in 1975 to D 11
million (80% of which went to private farmers). Investment grants are often
provided in conjunction with these loans (D 3.1 million in 1975). BNT's
equity portfolio amounts to about D 1.5 million, with investments mostly in
other banks and finance companies (43%) and agroindustries (22%).
3.15      The resources used by BNT for lending are broken down into normal
and special resources. Normal resources totalling D 109 million at end 1975
consist of capital, free reserves, deposits, and rediscount facilities. Spe-
cial resources amounting to D 42 million in commitments at end 1975 include
BNT's borrowings (from USAID and IBRD/IDA) and managed funds from budgetary
resources (including FOSDA and some eight other funds) or from foreign aid;
BNT does not normally bear the repayment risk on managed funds but does on
foreign borrowings.
3.16      BNT's profitability has been good and a sizeable profit has been
generated every year. The spread between interest received and cost of re-
sources has been around 3% of average total assets and operating costs have
been kept low (1.5% of average total assets). As a result, dividends paid
have been quite large. BNT's total assets are projected to increase at about
12.5% per year for the next five years, and net income after tax at about
10.5% per year. BNT's financial profitability is expected to remain satis-
factory.
3.17      BNT's financial structure, although generally satisfactory, seems
to point to undercapitalization, despite the 1975 capital increase to D 4
million. The building-up of reserves has not kept pace with the growth of
deposits and lending. Other standard financial ratios appear satisfactory.
The financial covenants under the First Project on BNT's financial condition
are generally complied with, except for the solvency ratio - capital and re-
serves as percentage of sight and fixed term deposits - which is still less
than the required 10%, but has improved substantially by December 31, 1975.
3.18      BNT's main lending risk is linked to its exposure in the agricul-
tural sector (50% of its outstanding loans and participations) and is there-
fore compounded by output fluctuations (bad harvests) and by political and
organizational difficulties. The overall provisions against losses estab-
lished by BNT are large and sufficient to cover its risks. A better manage-
ment of the provision for loans under litigation would be advisable, in order
to follow more closely the changes in the portfolio of loans under litigation.
However, the provision for miscellaneous risks is in any case large enough to
provide sufficient protection.
3.19      BNT s recovery procedures on loans made from its own resources ap-
pear thorough and methodical, at least during the early stages of collection
efforts during which about 75% of the recoveries are made. Many old loans, on
which there are no more repayment prospects, are however still carried on the
books and not written off against provisions. Repayment rates vary from 92%
(BNT short-term to cooperatives, IBRD/IDA First Agricultural Credit Project)
to 50% (German Fund for Irrigation) or even 32% (Special Fund for Financial
Assistance to Cooperatives), depending upon the efforts BNT makes for recovery.



- 11 -
3.20      BNT has a reasonably good accounting organization as well as a man-
agement information system. Its internal and external auditing need to be
improved (see para 6.16).
C. Caisses Locales de Credit Mutuel (CLCM) (Annex 3)
3.21      The CLCtIs are rural credit cooperative societies, whose purpose is
to promote savings and to provide short-term credit, under a limited mutual
guarantee system, to rural people, and, among others, small farmers. Managers
are BNT staff members seconded to the CLCMs. The first CLCMs were created in
1963 in the Cap Bon as part of Government efforts to extent mutual credit; the
first nine received a state grant. In 1965-66, their management was taken
over by BNT but they remained separate entities. They have been plagued by
numerous problems: poor management, inadequate assistance by the Government,
poor repayment (due to the farmers' unwillingness to repay what they considered
as Government grants and to the lack of efforts on the part of the CLCMs' staff
and Directors to recover loans overdue) and most of them were in a dismal fi-
nancial position. BNT attempted to correct the situation through training and
financial assistance, but the situation did not improve much and was further
aggravated by the cooperatives' situation (although the loans made to coopera-
tives were ultimately repaid by the Government) and the poor harvests in 1967-
69. The CLCMs now play a relatively minor role, collecting small deposits
mostly for BNT's benefit (almost half of the CLCMs' assets are in deposits
with BNT or in BNT shares, yielding a low return of about 3.2%) and providing
short-term loans to agriculture and commerce.
3.22      As a whole, the CLCMs have lost money every year since 1968, al-
though in 1974 about 22 CLCMs made a profit as compared to only 12 in 1970.
The CLCM deficit is due essentially to their low return on loans (2.7% to
3.2% on loans to agriculture) and on other assets, especially assets with
BNT.   Recoveries are low, and arrears account for close to 50% of the loan
portfolio; contrary to what could be expected in a mutual credit system,
neither the other borrowers nor the CLCM Directors exert pressure on the
delinquent borrowers. The future of the CLCMs is uncertain. Their close
contact with small farmers is very valuable; however, for them to play a use-
ful role, drastic financial and administrative measures need to be taken.
The creation of the Societes de Caution Mlutuelle (para 3.13) may imply that
the CLCMs are expected to dissolve or be completely absorbed by BNT, although
Government intentions are far from clear. The on-going credit study and re-
view should help to clarify the issues and should ultimately result in their
solution.

I\V. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE FIRST AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Loan/Credit 779/263-TUN US$5.0 m/3.0 m
Project Description
4.01      The Loan/Credit was made to finance part of Banque Nationale de
Tunisie (BNT) lending to commercial farmers for investment in grain farm
mechanization and dairy farm development in Northern Tunisia and for date palm
plantations to be undertaken by the Societe Tunisienne de l'Industrie Laitiere
(STIL) in the desert areas of South Western Tunisia. The Project included
financing of technical assistance to strengthen BNT's loan appraisal division,
olantation management of STIL and vehicles for technical services.
4.02      BNT was to lend to subborrowers not more than 70% of the subprojects'
cost and IDA/Bank was to reimburse BNT 75% of these subloans thus contributing
52.5% of the subproject cost. The subloans were to be made at an interest
rate of 8% p.a. for a period varying from 6 to 15 years according to invest-
ment category, with grace periods between 1 and 8 years. However, in line
with Government's stated policy to restore confidence in the private sector
and to encourage commercial farmers' investment, IDA/Bank agreed during nego-
tiations to Government's request to allow a temporary Government interest sub-
sidy of 2% so that the resulting interest rate to subborrowers would be only
6/%. The on-lending rate of 6% remained in effect throughout Project implemen-
tation.
4.03      The Project cost was estimated at US$15.0 million and the Loan/
Credit of US$8.0 million was to cover the estimated foreign exchange cost of
the Project.
Project Implementation
4.04      The Project became effective on January 25, 1972 and by April 1972
some 85 applications for a total of D 275,000 under categories Mechanization
and Dairy Farms were approved, and drilling of the first 4 wells and also
planting of 80 ha of date palms was completed. Project implementation re-
mained satisfactory through 1972 with the exception that Government did not
strictly enforce the stipulation of the Loan Agreement requiring BNT to charge
at least the same interest rate on all loans similar to those under the Proj-
ect and instead disbursed to farmers eligible under the Project loans from
FOSDA funds on more advantageous terms. During 1973 and 1974 loan disburse-
ments for farm mechanization and dairy farm components dropped far behind
schedule due to BNT's tendency to use the lower cost and risk-free FOSDA funds
to finance such investments and to the decreased viability of milk production
in the face of low milk prices fixed by Government and the high cost of im-
ported colJs.
4.05      The issue of competing FOSDA funds was settled by end .January 1975
when Government officially instructed BNT that no FOSDA funds be used for



- 13 -
farmers qualifving for a Bank-financed loan. Government took this step only
after the Bank informed it that unless the issue was satisfactorily resolved
by the end of January, the Bank would cancel the part of the Loan allocated
for Dairy Farm Development.
4.06      During 1975, and 1976 disbursements under the Farm Mechanization
component have been satisfactory.  Lending for Dairy Farms improved only
marginally because of lack of interest in new dairy investments due mainly
to low milk prices. To help alleviate a shortage of milk and milk production
in Central Tunisia, the Bank agreed in July 1974 to BNT's request to include
in the Project the financing of a Milk Processing Plant based principally on
imported milk in powder form to be built by STIL in the Sousse Region. The
Date Palm Plantation subproject, after slow implementation during the second
half of 1972 and 1973 made good progress in 1974 and 1975, and is now nearly
completed.
4.07      The following table shows a summary evolution of BNT's disburse-
ments under the three categories during the Project period and the overall
disbursement improvement in 1975 and 1976.

4.08      In compliance with the Loan Agreement, BNT set up a Project Unit
composed of one expatriate agricultural credit expert, 4 Tunisian agricul-
tural engineers and supporting staff. The performance of the Unit, whose job
consisted of loan application evaluations, supervision of subprojects and ex-
tension services to subborrowers, was satisfactory throughout Project imple-
mentation. Bank disbursements under the category Technical Assistance were
limited to the foreign exchange part of the expatriate expert's remuneration,
all other expenses relating to the Project Unit were born directly by BNT.

4.09      As of October 1, 1976, total Loan/Credit disbursements reached
US$7.4 million and the remaining US$0.6 million were fully committed. The
Loan/Credit is expected to be fully disbursed by the end of 1976.

- 15 -
4.11      In physical terms the Farm Mechanization component remained behind
the estimates due to slow Project implementation in 1973 and 1974. The number
of disbursed loans as of June 30, 1976 for harvesters represented 48%, for
crawler tractors 33% and for wheel tractors 64% of estimates. The total number
of subloans was 75%, and the aggregate amount of subloans disbursed was 74% of
appraisal estimates.
4.12      The Dairy Farm component is to be considered the least successful
of the Project. The reasons for this were (a) competing financing by FOSDA
funds, (b) artificially low price of milk parallel to steep increase in
prices of imported heifers, and (c) structure of investment other than pro-
jected (little investment in wells and irrigation - Table in para 4.10).
4.13      The Date Palm Plantation component was by far the most successful
in its implementation. Out of the estimated 900 ha, 813 were already planted
as of September 30, 1975, and additional 73 ha are being planted during 1976.
In all 13 deep wells were drilled with a total artesian yield of 633 1/s.
The total cost should reach about D 1.85 million when the subproject is fully
completed.
4.14      BNT's financial and institutional performance under the Project was
generally satisfactory although a few features still need to be reviewed and
improved (auditing procedures, financial covenants (para 3.17 and Annex 3)).
Project Impact
4.15      BNT's records of operations do not enable evaluation of physical
and financial investment results at the subproject level, nor do statistics
permit ex post analysis of the subproject results. However, if a judgment
is based on the findings of the Bank's supervision mission and on reports of
BNT's Project Unit staff the large majority of subprojects under the Grain
Farm Mechanization component are successful both from the technical and the
financial point of view. It appears that the expected economic rate of re-
turn on investment (22%) has generally been attained. Dairy farming was suc-
cessful mainly in cases where the farmers were able to sell their produce on
the free market, however, the recent (January 76) price increase of milk
should improve financial viability of those subprojects where farmers sell
their products at Government prices. The rapid increase in date prices
(1970/71: D 130/ton, 1975/76: D 280/ton-Deglat variety) will more than
compensate the increases in operating cost. Final judgment on the financial
and economical success of date palm plantation component will however only
be possible in about 12 to 15 years after the plantations have reached full
production.

V. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
5.01      While the First Project aimed principally at increasing grain and
milk production through mechanization and modernization of large farms in
Northern Tunisia, and at improving BNT's capability as an agricultural credit
institution, the Second Project would not only aim at increasing agricultural
production to meet Tunisia's rising demand and to diminish the huge agricul-
tural production deficit, but would also contribute to extension and improve-
ment of agricultural investment credit to small farmers who so far have had
little or no access to institutional credit. The Project would contribute
to further development of the desertic Southern Tunisia by helping to finance
date palm plantations to be established by small farmers associations; it
would also improve Tunisia's export position in olive oil by establishing
small but modern and economical oil. mills allowing for production of premium
quality olive oil. Continuity in improvement of efficiency of BNT as an
agricultural credit institution would also be an aim of the Project.
B. Description
5.02      The Project would finance part of BNT's medium- and long-term lend-
irig for agriculture and would consist of four major components:
(a)  Medium- and long-term lending to small farmers for on-
farm investments;
(b)  Medium- and long-term lending to commercial farmers for
on-farm investment for grain and dairy production, for
overall farm development, and for vegetable and fruit
production;
(c)  Medium- and long-term lending for investment in collec-
tively owned smallholder date-palm plantations;
(d)  Medium- and long-term lending to agro-industries, prin-
cipally olive oil mills.
Small Farmers
5.03      This category would include grain, dairy and mixed farming, small
orchards and vegetable growing. Investment would be in agricultural equip-
ment such as ploughs, seeds and few cultivators, in dairy cross-breed heifers,
in draft animals and in well and irrigation improvements. Investment in
tractors and heavy agricultural machinery would not be financed under this
category except in case of investment loans to semi-public organizations



- 17 -
such as Societe liationale de Motoculture (SONAIO) or cooperatives providing
tractors and harvesting services to small farmers. The large majority of
borrowers is expected to come from the Northern part of Tunisia, the north-
eastern coastal areas and from around the larger consumption centers, but
qualified applications from the rest of the country will also be considered.
Criteria to be applied for qualification as a small farmer are described
below in para 6.04. SONAIO or cooperatives providing tractor and harvesting
services to small farmers would qualify under this component after Bank's
prior approval of specific investment and operating plans. About 660, or
70%, of the total number of Project sub-loans and 32% of the total amount
of Project sub-loans are expected to be disbursed under this category.
Commercial Farmers
5.04      The category would include grain farms, dairy farms, fruit and vege-
table producers and mixed farming. Investment is expected to be mainly in
tractors, harvesters and heavier agricultural machinery and equipment, in pure
breed dairy heifers, stables, and milking facilities, and in construction and
improvements of shallow wells and irrigation infrastructure. As in the case
of small farmers, most of expected subborrowers will come from the North and
the North-east, where rainfed grain production is concentrated and where the
aquifer often permits construction of shallow wells and irrigation, although
qualified applications from the rest of the country will also be considered.
About 275, or 30% of the total number of Project sub-loans, representing
27% of the total amount of loans are expected to be disbursed under this
category.
Date Palm Plantations
5.05      The beneficiaries of loans under this category would be the Societes
Civiles de Mise en Valeur (SCMV), production cooperative-type farmer develop-
ment associations (Annex 1, Appendix 1) investing collectively in date palm
plantations in the Djerid and Nefzaoua regions. Under the First Agricultural
Credit Project, STIL has completed planting of over 800 ha of date plantations
in the same two regions. The technical success of STIL's venture resulted in
the creation by local smallholders of over a dozen SClIVs eager to follow
STIL's example. Three of them have already received FOSDA loans for planta-
tion development and are proceeding with planting. The membership of the
SCMVs varies between 10 and over 50 persons and land holdings depending
ultimately on the yield of the wells are generally around 2 ha per member
(as much as 4 ha in the earliest SCMVs and about 1 ha in the later ones).
5.06      Investment would be for ground-water development (deep artesian
wells) with irrigation and drainage network, land levelling and land prepara-
tion, planting and maintenance (first 7 years) of date palms and windbreaks,
pumping stations, tractors, miscellaneous agricultural implements and storage
facilities. As under the First Credit Project, Government would bear the cost
of dry bore holes. Plantations would be in the Djerid and Nefzaoua areas in
South Western Tunisia, which appear to be most appropriate climatically and
have proven substantial artesian aquifers. The Project would finance four



- 18 -
plantations of between 50-75 ha depending on the yield of each well. About
21% of the total amount of subloans are expected to be disbursed under this
category.
Olive Oil Mills and Other Agro-Industries
5.07      Important new plantations of olive groves in North and Central
Tunisia in recent years will increase Tunisia's olive production from the
present average of some 550,000 tons to about 900,000 tons by 1981. The
increased production will result in an overall severe shortage of oil extrac-
tion capacity in the two regions, and some one hundred new mills (capacity of
30 tons/day each) will be needed to meet the requirements. The required and
expected increase of olive oil production will result in increased availabil-
ity of olive cake and the need for several mills specialized in olive cake oil
extraction. The growing fruit and vegetable production based mainly on new
irrigation will ca]l for extension of existing processing facilities and/or
construction of new ones.
5.08      BNT has in the past few years financed from its own funds on average
six to eight olive-oil mills each year and the Project would help finance 18
such mills over a period of two years. Other agro-industries such as an olive
cake oil extraction mill and/or fruit and vegetable processing facilities
could also be financed under this category after Bank's prior approval. About
20% of the total loan amount are expected to be disbursed under this category.
C. Cost Estimates
5.09      The Project cost estimates are based on recent BNT experience, on
current prices (Octover/November 1975) of the respective investments and the
representative models of production units examined during appraisal (Annex 5).
Total Project cost is estimated at D 11.0 million (US$26.3 million) of which
approximately 45%, or US$12 million equivalent, would be in foreign exchange.
These estimates are summarized in the following table:

D. Financing

be shared in the following amounts and proportions:

5.11       BNT would be the Borrower of the Bank Loan.  The Loan would be for a
period of 12 years including a 4 year grace period, at 8.7% interest and Gov-
ernment would carry the foreign exchange risk. The Loan maturity and grace
period are based on projections of lending operations and subborrower repay-
ments (Annex 6).
5.12      The subborrowers' contribution in case of small farmers would vary
from subproject to subproject and would amount to 20% of investment cost (para
6.04). In the case of commercial farmers and agro-industries the subborrowers'
contribution will be not less than 30% of the sub-project cost, and in case of
date plantations it will be not less than 15% of all investments other than
well drilling, and not less than 10% of the cost of the well. State Agency
for Edible Oil (ONH) will also lend directly to olive oil mills for oil
storage facilities.



- 21 -
5.13      Government's contribution, which will be channelled through BNT
will be of two varieties: (a) Government grants for small farmers and date
plantations (para 6.04) and (b) Government loans in case of date palm planta-
tions. As banking regulations prohibit BNT to extend loans with a term longer
than 7 years, BNT would not participate in financing investments in date-palm
plantation with its own funds.
5.14      BNT would finance from its own resources 25% of the individual
subloan amounts to all categories of subborrowers except date plantations.
The Bank Loan would finance 75% of the total BNT disbursements under the
Project, including the Government loan for date plantations.
E. Procurement
5.15      The range of goods to be financed for on-farm development components
is varied, not suitable for bulk procurement, and individual contracts would
be far too small to warrant international advertising. Foreign suppliers of
farm machinery and edible oil extraction equipment are well represented in
Tunisia, necessary service facilities are available, competition is keen and
prices are competitive. Farmers would therefore purchase agricultural equip-
ment of their choice through existing local channels. Machinery and equipment
for olive oil mills would also be procured through local channels on the basis
of the best offer out of not less than three. Dairy farm development would
require procurement of cross breed and pure breed incalf heifers, most of
which would come from Government or local private dairy farms. However,
should all required heifers not be readily available, provision for import
through existing channels would be made by ONEP. Date palm plantation devel-
opment would require drilling of 4 to 5 deep wells over a four year period
involving a total cost of about US$0.8 million. These works would be carried
out after local competitive bidding, which allows foreign firms to participate,
had been announced in the local press; copies of each contract will be sent
to the Bank. The total amount involved for the purchase and installation of
pumping stations, about US$200,000 would be too small to attract firms other
than those already represented in Tunisia; procurement would therefore be
through existing commercial channels.
F. Disbursement
5.16      BNT's disbursement to subborrowers would be in accordance with the
phasing of individual subproject development and would vary from one to three
years for all loans except date palm plantations where the disbursement period
would extend over 7 years. Since the Project commitment period is for two
years the Bank loan would be disbursed in about 4 to 4-1/2 years. Bank would
not contribute to the financing of the date palm plantation pre production
maintenance after the 4th year of the Project. The Bank would reimburse BNT,
against certified statements, 75% of all loans disbursed under the Project.
A detailed disbursement schedule is given in Annex 7.

VI.  PROJECT ItPLEMENTATION
A. Organizattion and Management
6.01      BNT would be the Borrower and would carry out the Project.  The
Ministry of Agriculture through its Regional Offices and its specialized
agencies would assist BNT in appraising loan applications of small farmers
for on-farm development, and of SCMIVs for date palm plantations, and in
supervising implementation of same subprojects.
6.02      Under the First Agricultural Credit Project BNT created a Project
Unit consisting of 5 agriculturalists and supporting staff which, during im-
plementation of the Project, acquired substantial experiences in subproject
evaluation. The staffing of the Unit would be completed by an engineer qual-
ified in agro-industries and the Unit would be maintained and expanded as
required during implementation of the Project. Assurances to this effect
were obtained during negotiations.
B. Lending Policies and Procedures
6.03      Lending procedures would be similar to those under the First Agri-
cultural Credit Project. BNT technical staff would appraise all subprojects
and would periodically visit subborrowers' farms to ensure funds are being
used for the intended purposes. In case of appraisal and supervision of
loans to small farmers and to SCMVs grouping small farmers, BNT's technical
staff would be assisted, as needed, by the staff of the regional agricultural
officers.
6.04      Small Farmers:  The criteria which will determine whether a given
farmer is eligible for small farm concessional development credit and Govern-
mental development grants are taken from the revised criteria for the Govern-
ment financed FOSDA system. It is a condition of effectiveness that the re-
vised FOSDA criteria have been adopted and applied by Government. Additional
eligibility criteria agreed for IERD-financed subloans would concentrate lend-
ing upon the rural poverty target group. Eligibility will depend on the pre-
project income level derived from farm size, crops, estimated yields and
prices. The maximum level pre-prcject Development per capita income for farm
families would be about D 100 (US$240).  By the beginning of the commitment
period in 1977, the estimated absclute poverty level will be US$208 per capita;
the relative poverty level US$226 (para 2.01). Farmers would not be consid-
ered for sub-loans under the small farmer component if the annual farm income
should exceed about D 600. In order to insure that the project's impact on
the rural target group be maximized BNT would check that agriculture consti-
tutes the main source of beneficiaries' income. To insure moreover that
credit on concessional terms is extended to those farmers who have not had
sufficient access to institutional credit, farmers applying for IBRD-financed



- 93 -
subloans would only be eligible if they had not received more than D 5,000
under concessional credit terms from FOSDA and similar funds.  IBRD-financed
subloans would not exceed the difference between the aggregate amount of
concessionary credit received and the D 5,000 limit. The D 5,000 ceiling for
overall concessionary lending to small/medium farmers would also reduce the
incentive for larger farmers seeking eligibility and thus minimize the risk
of leakage.
6.05      All farmers who would not be eligible for concessional development
credit according to the criteria discussed in para 6.04 above would be eligi-
ble for development loans under the category Commercial Farmers. Sizes of
the subborrowers' farms would range in most cases between 100 and 300 ha for
investment in grain farms and between 50 ha to 150 ha for investment in dairy
farming.  The median pre-Project farmer family income would be between D 2,000
- D 2,500 (US$4,800 - US$6,000). Sub-borrowers under the Agro-Industrial
component are expected to be large farmers owning extensive olive groves or
merchants and private investors.
6.06      Government and BNT would further ensure that subborrowers under
the Project would have access to short-term credit for input financing either
directly from BNT, the CLCM's, the SCM or other Governmental specialized
agencies. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
Subloan Size and Review
6.07      Size of subloans to small farmers would be in accordance with the
newly proposed FOSDA regulations (para 3.06 and Annex 2 Table 6), according
to category of farm investment. Mlodification of these ceilings would be sub-
ject to prior Bank approval. Depending on the category of the subborrower
Bank-approval would be needed for sub-loans exceeding the following amounts:
Bank Approval Required for
Category of Subborrower                      Sub-Loans Exceeding
SONAMO                                          Every sub-loan
Service Cooperatives                            D 30,000
Commercial Farmers                              D 50,000
Date Palm Plantations
and Agroindustries                            D 100,000
The aggregate amount of subloans to SONAMO is limited to $900,000, and to
$600,000 in the case of service cooperatives. Subloans to individual small
farmers would not exceed an aggregate amount of D 5,000 (para 6.04).

Terms and Conditions of Project Sub-Loans
6.08      The terms and conditions of Project Sub-Loans would vary according
to the subborrowers category. Small farmers would be charged the Government's
proposed increased interest rates for all FOSDA loans, a standard rate of 6%.
Although still on the low side of what could be desirable economically, the
proposed new rate would be a considerable improvement over previous FOSDA
rates and would put Tunisia's agricultural credit on a sounder economic basis.
Small farmers would benefit from the other conditions proposed under the new
FOSDA regulations, including selective investment grants.
6.09      Loans for Date Palm Development would be limited to the farmer's
development partnerships (SCIIV) (Annex 1, Appendix 1). Loans would include
maintenance of the plantation during the first 7 years. Interest would be at
6%, given the heavy initial investment and the long non-productive period of
new plantations, the interest charges would be borne by Covernment during the
non-productive period.
6.10      Loans to commercial farmers would be at 7% interest and to agro-
industrial investors at 8% with no rebates.
6.11      Repayment and grace periods would be in line with the proposed
FOSDA terms for small farmers; for commercial farmers, date plantations and
agro-industry they would correspond to the expected development period of the
investments financed:
Interest    Grace    Repayment
Rates      Period    Period        Total
Small Farmers                              6%          2          3-6        5-8
Commercial Farms:
Grain Farms                           7%         1           7           8
Dairy Farms                           7%         3           5           8
"fixed Farming                        7%          1           7          8
Date Palm Plantation                       6/%         8           7          15
Agro-industries                            8%          2           5           7
Detailed terms and conditions of sub-loans and investment grants to small
farmers and SCMUVs vary according to the type of investment and are summarized
in Annex 9 Table 1.



- 25 -
6.12      BNT would carry 100% of the default risk of outstanding amounts on
loans to all subborrowers other than small farmers and small farmers associa-
tions (SCMVs). For small farmers and SCMVs, BNT would be onlending its own
funds in blend with Bank funds but will have partial recourse to Government
in the case of non-repayment of loan installments one year after due. BNT
would assume 10% of the default risk on sub-loans granted during the first
two-year period following Bank loan effectiveness and 25% later on. The
smaller proportion of risk to be borne by BNT on sub-loans to small farmers
and SCMVs, categories of subborrowers considered by BNT as less credit-worthy,
would encourage BNT to undertake medium term lending to these subborrowers and
to follow-up more closely sub-project appraisal and supervision. BNT would
also play a more active role in agricultural development, a sector where BNT's
activity and direct involvement has so far been very limited. The phased
assumption of risk will also provide the opportunity for BNT to develop the
procedures and staffing required for it to assume risk on small farmer lending.
Even the partial assumption of risk by BNT on small farmer credit is expected
to result in improved repayment performance; current FOSDA loan repayment on
which BNT takes no risk is only 65% of dues while BNT collects 92% of dues on
its own funds lent to farmers. Increasing the level of risk assumption by
BNT on small farmer lending is expected to continue and Government intends to
have BNT and all lending institutions in Tunisia gradually assume the repayment
risk for all lending, including FOSDA.
6.13      Government would periodically reimburse BNT the differential between
the on-lending rates and the Bank rate of 8.7%. In addition Government would
pay to BNT a compensatory commission equal to 3% of the portion of outstanding
loans financed by the Bank. This commission would cover BNT's Project related
administrative expenses and would enable BNT to set up an adequate provision
for bad debts.
6.14      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Lending
Policies and Procedures outlined in paras 6.03-6.13 would be applied for all
lending under the Project, and that no loans for purposes similar to those of
the Project on terms more advantageous would be made available to subborrowers.
C. Monitoring of Development Results
6.15      In order to improve lending policies investment results at the sub-
project level would be monitored on a representative sample basis. BNT would
set up a mechanism for this purpose not later than 12 months after effective-
ness of the loan. Suggested procedures would be submitted by BNT to the Bank
for approval within 9 months after effectiveness. Assurances to this effect
were obtained during negotiations.



- 26 -
D. Accounts and Audits
6.16      BNT has a good accounting organization as well as a management
information system. BNT is also subject to the customary supervision of banks
by the Central Bank, and Government appoints a Financial Controller (Controleur
Financier) to protect its interest in BNT. External financial control is
carried out by an independent controller (Commissaire aux Comptes) appointed
by the shareholders' General Assembly. During appraisal of the First Agricul-
tural Credit Project, this external financial control had been found unsatis-
factory and Bank had obtained during negotiations assurances that BNT's
accounts would be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank.
BNT complied with this condition in 1971, but beginning in 1972, the quality
of external auditing deteriorated and became unsatisfactory. Bank staff have
discussed this with BNT management and the Bank obtained formal assurances
during negotiations that auditing will be done by an independent auditor
acceptable to Bank, and that the Audit Report will be submitted to the Bank
and the Board of BNT, not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal
year. Due to efforts to improve the 1975 audit the report is not expected to
be received until the end of the year. It would be condition of effectiveness
that audit for year 1975 has been completed and submitted to Bank.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATIONS
A. Production and Marketing
Production
7.01      Investment under the Project is expected to generate the following
incremental production at full development:
Quantity               Value
tons                 D'000
Grain                                             13,155                  710
Fruit and Vegetable                              22,700                 1,350
Milk                                               6,500                  585
Beef                                                 370                  125
Oxen                                                 225 heads             80
In-Calf Heifers                                      115 heads             45
Dates                                              3,000 tons             540
Olive Oil                                          5,357 tons           3,241 /1
Total                                                                 6,676
/1   Including olive cake.



Mlarket ing
7.02      No difficulty is expected for marketing of all agriculture products
except olive oil. Tunisia is a net importer of grain (320,000 tons in year
1974/75) and the generated incremental production would barely cover 4.1% of
the present imports. Fruit and vegetable production financed under the Proj-
ect would also be consumed locally, principally in the main urban centers such
as Tunis, Bizerte, Sousse and Sfax and no marketing problems and difficulties
are to be expected. Tunisia's milk production in 1975 amounted to about
260,000 tons and had to be complemented by imports (in powder form) of 150,000
tons equivalent of whole milk. The production deficit is expected to be even
higher in 1976 and present milk production would have to be doubled between
1975 and 1980 to meet the projected consumption figure for 1980. Beef produc-
tion in 1975 amounted to about 95,000 tons and some 5,000 tons had to be im-
ported. Consumption is expected to reach 134,000 tons by 1980, an increase
of 35% as compared to the consumption figure for 1975. The Project's incre-
mental production would cover only about 1% of the consumption increase. No
marketing difficulties are therefore to be expected either for milk and milk
products or for beef.
7.03      The Project generated date production at full development would be
entirely dates of the Deglat variety which are essentially for export. How-
ever, only the top qualities are exported so that 50% of the produced quantity
or about 1,500 tons would be available for export. The quality of the Deglat
variety is highly praised on the European market and quantities presently
exported (average 1972-74, 5,800 tons) constitute only a fraction of the
European imports. An increase in Deglat exports of 1,500 tons should in no
way modify this relation.
7.04      In 1975 Tunisia olive oil exports encountered substantial difficul-
ties due on one hand to an excellent harvest on both sides of the M4editer-
ranean basin and on the other hand to new import restrictions on the part of
the European Community. An agreement signed in January 1976 by Tunisia and
EEC provides for a reduction of import duties on olive oil from US$570 equiv-
alent per ton to US$420 equivalent per ton which, at current prices, re-
presents an import levy of respectively 50% and 30%.  This reduction should
substantially facilitate Tunisia's olive oil export; however, an effort based
both on improvements of quality and presentation and on diversification of
markets will be needed to overcome possible future difficulties should the
present convention not be renewed.
B. Financial Benefits
7.05      The financial results for typical investment models under the Proj-
ect are given in Annex 5. The calculations are based on Tunisian prices for
the second half of 1975 for both inputs and outputs. The financial rates of
return of the models vary between 11% (Model 7: Date Palm Plantations) and
over 50% (Model 1: 5 ha Fruit and Vegetable Farm). The sensitivity analysis



- 28 -
vields the following: if investment cost were raised by 10%, the financial
rates of return would vary between 8% and over 50%; an increase in operating
expenses of 10% would result in financial rates of return between 11% and over
50%; and if revenues were to drop by 10% the rates would range from 4% to over
50%.
Economic Rate of Return
7.06      The economy is expected to realize a return of 34% from total proj-
ect investments, including physical contingencies (Annex 8). The economic
rate of return for each component of the Project is expected to be 38% for
Farm Development, 13% for Date Plantations, 36% for Oil Mills. The economic
rate of return on the farm development component is higher than what the rate
of return on the First Agricultural Credit Project (excluding date plantations)
is likely to be because a number of small subborrowers are expected to invest
in new wells, small scale irrigation and fruit and vegetable crops which have
a high economic and financial rate of return. No such subprojects were
financed under the first Credit Project. Hired labor has been valued at
prevailing wage rates. Family labor has been costed at 50% because of limited
employment opportunities on farms affected by the Project. Grain, livestock
products and fertilizers have been valued at projected world market prices.
Other commodities and inputs have been valued at farm-gate prices adjusted for
import duties, taxes and subsidies. A sensitivity analysis was applied to
test the Project against changes in investment costs, operating expenses and
production results. By increasing investment costs and operating expenses
alternatively by 10% the rate of return for the whole Project would drop to
29% under either assumption. By decreasing the value of the benefits by 10%,
the overall return would drop to 23% (Annex 8).
Project Beneficiaries and Income Increases
7.07      About 935 private farmers, 4 SCMVs with a total membership of about
300 and 18 oil mills would benefit from the Project. Of the 1,235 benefi-
ciaries, about 960 (i.e., more than three quarters) would be small farmers,
including all the SCMV members. They would receive 48% of the Bank loan,
accounting for 53% of the total investment cost. About 475 farmers, including
most of the SCMV members (or about 38% of the beneficiaries), can be defined
as belonging to the rural poverty target group (para 6.04). At full develop-
ment (2-5 years for investments other than orchards and plantations) the small
farmer beneficiaries would have an increase in farm income from a maximum of
D 600 to an average of D 1.578. About 280 farmers and the 18 oil millowners
would belong to the class of medium and large landowniers and/or businessmen.
The income of farmers in this group would be expected to increase from a
medium between D 2,000-D 2,500 to a medium between D 4,500-D 6,000 with full
development of their project investments.



- 29 -
C. Economic Benefits
Employment
7.08      The Project would generate substantial employment opportunities.
An estimated 1,300 man years of additional family labor would be generated
from investments in farm development, thus reducing underemployment on the
935 farms at an investment cost of D 4,200 (US$10,000) per job created (in
1975 prices). In addition, 300 man years of additional family labor would
be generated from investments in date plantations at an investment cost of
D 5,300 (US$12,700) and 350 jobs would be created in the oil mills at a cost
per job of D 5,000 (US$12,000).
7.09      There would also be sizeable employment opportunities generated
through the additional investments, the additional consumption of inputs and
the increased production, via backward and forward linkages. These employ-
ment opportunities have not been quantified. The additional foreign exchange
earnings attributable to the Project would not be significant, most of the
production being consumed locally.  The improvement in the quality of ex-
ported olive oil and resulting higher prices and higher foreign exchange
earnings have not been quantified.
Other Benefits
7.10      The Project would further result in non-quantifiable institutional
benefits affecting both agriculture credit in general and BNT in particular:
(i) Although the Project itself would directly reach only a limited
number of the 85% of the Tunisian farmers not having access to
institutional credit, it would free other governmental funds
likely to be used for additional loans to small farmers pre-
viously deprived of access to credit ("ripple" effect).
(ii)  The Project would strongly support the present trend toward
an improvement in agricultural credit terms (clearer defini-
tion of target groups, higher and more coherent interest rates,
better coordination between various institutions and programs).
(iii)  Finally, the Project would support institutional building withLn
BNT and encourage it to become more involved in lending to small
farmers and to assure more of an agricultural development role.
VIIt.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AID RECOtMENDATIONS
8. 1      To insure successful project implementation the following major
assurances were obtained during negotiations:



- 30 -
(a)  BNT would maintain its existing Project Unit, increasing
staffing by one engineer qualified in agro-industries and
by additional personnel required to adequately evaluate
loan applications and supervise subprojects (para 6.02);
(b)  Subprojects would be monitored on a representative sample
basis. A mechanism and monitoring procedure would be pre-
pared by BNT not later than 9 months after Project effec-
tiveness and would be submitted to the Bank for comments
(para 6.15);
8.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan would be (a)
that audit of BNT's accounts for 1975 has been completed and auditor's report
submitted to Bank (para 6.16) and (b) that policies and procedures outlined
in paras 6.03-6.13 would be implemented for all FOSDA lending (para 6.14).
8.03      The Project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$12 million
equivalent to BNT for a term of 12 years with 4 years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
TUNISIA
Agricultural Sector
General
1.        Tunisia has a total area of about 164,000 km2 and a population of
5.6 million with an annual growth rate of 2.3%. About 9 million ha is agri-
cultural land of which only about 3 million ha are currently cultivated and
110,000 ha are irrigated.  Agriculture provides about 18% of GDP, and employs
over 50% of the active population.  Exports of agricultural products amounted
in 1974 to D 100 million representing some 25% of Tunisia's total exports.
2.         From an agricultural point of view Tunisia can be divided into
three distinct regions:
(i) The North (4 million ha) comprising the North and North-
west of the country and Cap Bon. About 60% of the popu-
lation lives in this region, the land is of good quality
and rainfall is adequate reaching 500-1,500 mm during 70-
100 days per year; the region has over 3,500 farms of over
100 ha; irrigated areas cover 80,000 ha. About I million
ha are planted with cereals, practically all of the coun-
try's citrus orchards are located in the area, principally
in Cap Bon; about 30% of the total number of olive trees
are in the North, and almost all the vineyards. The
principal tovwns are Tunis, Bizerte, Beja, Jendouba, le
Kef Nabeul and Siliana, each of them the seat of a
Governorate.
(ii) The Center (6 million ha), has mainly pasture and grazing
lands.  Rainfall is limited to between 200 mm and 350 mm
for 40 to 70 days per year; apart from extensive livestock
raising, the main crop is olives. Around the main towns
vegetables are produced on about 13,000 ha. The principal
urban centers are Sousse, Mahdia, Kairouan and Kasserine.
(iii) The South (6 million ha), comprising the Governorates of
Sidi-Bouzid, Gafsa, Sfax, Gabes and Hiedenine, has a semi-
desertic climate and arid soils. Agricultural production
is concentrated in the oases which produce all of Tunisia's
date crop, and also some vegetables and fodder crops. Olive
trees are cultivated in the less arid areas, but yields per
ha are several times lower than in the other regions.



ANNEX I
Page 2
3.        Whereas the overall growth of the Tunisian economy during the decade
1961-70 amounted to over 60%, the value of agricultural production in constant
1966 prices increased only by 20% due to unfavorable climatic conditions and
the failure of the Government imposed cooperative system. During the first
lhalf of the present decade GDP in constant terms increased by over 65% and the
value of agricultural production in 1974, admittedly an exceptionally favor-
able year, was more than double that of 1970.
Institutional Framework
4.        Ministry of Agriculture.  The activities of the Ministry of Agri-
culture are divided over a number of departments (directions). Direction des
Grands Travaux Hydrauliques (major water-supply works), Direction du Genie
Rural (rural engineering), Direction des Resources en Eau et en Sol (water
and land resources), Direction de la Production Agricole (agricultural pro-
duction), Direction de la Recherche, de l'Enseignement et de la Formation
Professionnelle (research, education and training), Direction des Peches
(fisheries), Direction des Forets (forestry), Direction des Services Vete-
rinaries (veterinary services), Direction des Affaires Foncieres et Legisla-
tives (real estate and legislative affairs) and Direction des Services Admi-
nistratifs (administrative services).
5.        There are also two State Secretariats:  Secretariat d'Etat des
Resources Hydrauliques et du Secteur Irrigue (water resources and irrigated
sector), and Secretariat d'Etat de l'Agriculture en Sec (rainfed agriculture);
two councils: Conseil Superieur de la Recherche (Higher Research Council),
Conseil Superieur des Peches (Higher Fisheries Council); two commissions:
Commission des Marches (Markets Commission), Commission d'Etude et d'Agre-
ment des Projets (Projects Study and Approval Commission); and one committee:
Comite Consultatif du Credit et de 1'Encouragement (Consultative Committee
for Credit and Promotion). Finally at Cabinet level an Inspector General
for Agriculture, a Planning and Project Evaluation Department, a National
Center for Agricultural Studies and a Financing, Credit and Cooperation
Department.
6.        A number of semi-autonomous organizations and agencies are in charge
of specialized activities. Subject to some central Government auditing these
organizations are autonomous in financial and management matters.
The principal agencies are:
(a)  National Edible Oil Agency (Office National de l'Huile ONH),
(b)  National Grain Agency (Office National des Cereales ONC),
(c) National Wine Agency (Office National des Vins - ONV),
(d) National Livestock and Pasture Agency (Office National de
l'Elevage et des Paturages ONEP), and
(e) National Fisheries Agency (Office National des Peches - ONP).



ANNEX I
Page 3
7.        The first three were intended to be essentiallv marketing organiza-
tions with the marketing monopoly of the commodities concerned but have since
acquired extensions and credit channelling functions. ONEP has a broader
responsibilitv including in addition production and extension, import and
export regulations of livestock and animal feed.
8.        Other semi-public entities are in charge of the agricultural devel-
opment of a given region. To this category belongs the Miedjerda Valley
Development Authority (Office de Mise en Valeur de la Vallee de Medierda -
OMVVM1) which is responsible for carrying out the irrigation development, land
reallocation and agrarian reform of the Lower Medjerda Valley (90,000 ha), and
the smaller Nebhana and Lakhmes Development Authorities. Further development
agencies are planned for Badrouna and Mogods. The State Land Agency (Office
des Terres Domaniales - OTD) controls the approximately 750,000 ha of Govern-
ment lands (see para 16).
9.        Several semi-autonomous entities are import related:  the Coopera-
tive Centrale des Semences et de Plantes Selectionnees provides most of cereal
seeds, the Societe Nationale de la Protection des Vegetaux, carries out much
of the plant protection activities, the Cooperative Centrale des Grandes Cul-
tures is responsible for fertilizer marketing and distribution and the Societe
Nationale de Mlotoculture (SONAMO), formerly Cooperative Centrale de tIotoculture
(COCEIIO) provides small and medium farmers with tractor and harvester related
services.
10.       Agronomic Research.  Agronomic Research is concentrated around 3
main institutions: Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique Tunisienne
(Tunisian National Agronomic Research Institute - INRAT) with central labora-
tories in Tunis and 16 experimental farms spread through the country, Institut
National Agronomique de Tunis (Tunis National Agronomic Institute - INAT) and
Centre de Recherche du Genie Rural (Rural Engineering Research Center).
Regional research centers are in the Beja, Bizerte, Jendouba, Sousse and Gabes
Governorates.  According to Government claims, significant results were ob-
tained between 1970 and 1974 in the field of new varieties of high-yielding
wheat, in improvement of cultivation systems (crop rotation and weeding), in
selection of fodder plants suited to each region and in development of new
varieties of vegetables and fruit trees.
11.       Agricultural Extension Services.  The Ministry of Agriculture's
Extension Division in the Department of Agricultural and Livestock Production
is the principal agriculture extension organization in the country. However,
several other agencies and institutions also have extension responsibilities,
namely the Ministry's Crop Protection Division, Agricultural Production
Division, Livestock Production Division, Office des Terres Domaniales (OTD),
Office de Mise en Valeur de la Vallee de la Medjerda (OMVVM), Office de IMise
en Valeur Agricole de lNebhana (OMIVAN), Office National des Cereales (ONC)
(grain production) and Office National de l'Elevage et des Paturages (ONEP)
(stockraising and pastures).
12.       In 1974 the total staff serving the agriculture extension sector
was as follows:

Of these, the Ministry's Extension Division employed 19 engineers and 6 tech-
nical officers in its head office and 35 engineers and 264 technical officers
in the field. All sectors of agriculture are said to be covered but the num-
ber of farms per extension officer is high since it is estimated that one
field officer has to supervize on average 1,200 farmers. In spite of this
the extension activities of the different agencies sometimes overlap at the
level of their contacts with farmers, with as a result conflicting advice
given to them.
13.       Agricultural Education in Tunisia is entirely under the responsi-
bility of the Ministry of Agriculture and is provided at four levels: uni-
versity, para-university, secondary and vocational. At university level,
the four-year course at the Institut National Agronomique de Tunis (INAT)
leads to the qualification of Agricultural Engineer. Para-university educa-
tion is provided by four specialized institutes (irrigation, rural engineering,
horticulture, forestry), with two-year courses leading to the qualification of
Technical Assistant. Secondary education is given by nine agricultural high
schools through four-year courses leading to middle-rank Technical Officer
positions. Vocational training which is given to adults already working is
provided at 16 centers and consists of two to four-year courses depending on
the type of specialization.
14.       The results of the various agriculture education programs appear to
be satisfactory, and there are presently in Tunisia (private, semi-public and
public sector): 700 agriculture engineers, 4,600 technicians and 2,700 per-
sons with vocational training. The following table shows the attendance of
the different forms of training in 1971/1974:

The total number has almost tripled over five years, with the increases parti-
cularly evident in respect of the vocational training centers and fishery
training. However permanent vocational training will become increasingly
urgent in order to update specialized knowledge.
15.       Land Tenure.  Basically three categories may be distinguished:
-    the state-held land, mainly rainfed farms that were taken
over from their former foreign owners. These lands were
the first to be organized as cooperatives in the late 1960s;
-    the privately owned farms of the "traditional" sector, where
land tenure problems are hampering the development of the
country's most important agricultural resources; and
-    the collectively owned lands, especially in Central and Southern
Tunisia, where population pressure has rendered the traditional
tenure system obsolete.
16.        State-Owned Lands.  Over the period 1956-64 the State acquired more
than one million ha by the purchase of foreign-owned lands and by the nationa-
lization of "habous" lands. In 1961 the "Office des Terres Domaniales" (OTD)
was established to manage these lands and preside over their final distribu-
tion. These lands have become the core of the cooperative farm structure
which at the time was intended eventually to include all private farms. After
the repeal, in September 1969, of the decrees to put under cooperative owner-
ship the entire agricultural sector, lands previously privately held were
returned to private ownership and an inventory and a review of the future role
of the remaining lands led to a plan whereby some 126,000 ha would become
state farms; 351,000 ha would remain as production cooperatives; 76,000 ha
would be allocated to demonstration, research and teaching purposes, and the
remaining, 262,000  ha would be sold to the private sector.  State farms



ANNEX 1
Page 6
are on some of the best soils and have a good production potential. The re-
maining cooperative farms are managed in the same way as state farms and con-
sequently are cooperatives only in name. It is not clear what their future
will be. The Government has stated its intention of gradually transferring
decision-making power to the members of the cooperatives, who at present are
little more than wage laborers. It seems probable that the cooperative farms
will remain de facto state farms for several years to come. Since 1970, ex-
perience has shown that the main problem with the state farms and cooperatives
is management. OTD still feels that it must exercise a high degree of central-
ized control over its farms, thus leaving little freedom to the manager.
17.       The land earmarked for transfer to the private sector is admittedly
inferior, and the main reason for its proposed transfer is that its low pro-
ductivity hampers the efforts of the state farms to become economically viable.
This land is to be disposed of in the following way:
(a) by exchange for private land in public irrigation
perimeters whose present owners prefer not to shift
to irrigated agriculture;
(b) by allocation through settlement schemes;
(c)  by direct sale of entire farms to farmers grouped
in a corporation or production cooperative; or
(d) by leasing to individuals pending final disposition.
Privately Farmed Lands
18.       Private holdings are by far the most important category of ownership.
Private farms occupy 4.5 million ha, as against 0.8 million ha of agricultural
land held by the state. Even after the return, in 1969, to the doctrine of
the coexistence of state, cooperative and private farms, a disproportionately
high share of the Government's attention in terms of investment and technical
services is still concentrated on the state and cooperative farms, even though
most of the potential for agricultural growth lies in the private farms, es-
pecially in the "traditional" sector. How much of this potential will be
realized depends in large measure on the resolution of two land tenure prob-
lems: (a) the absence of secure and registered land titles, and (2) the un-
restricted fragmentation of holdings with its corollary of concentration of
ownership.
19.       Of the total productive area (agricultural, grazing and forest) of
about 9 million ha, roughly 3 million ha have registered titles. The Land
Registry Act of 1885, providing both for a complete cadastral survey and de-
livery of a clear title and for a somewhat less secure certificate of regis-
tration, led to the registration of some 2.5 million ha, virtually all in
large ownership units in the North. This system of land registration was



ANNEX 1
Page 7
voluntary and served in the first place the interest of the European settlers
although in practice many Tunisian landowners made use of it. This system,
which was somewhat simplified in 1965, is still available, but very little
used because most of the large landowners who can afford its expenses have
already taken advantage of it. For the benefit of the smaller landowners,
a compulsory registration of land not previously registered was established
in 1964. The cost is D 50 per ha, entirely borne by the State. Of the
previously owned lands some 2 million ha have so far been titled leaving 2.5
million ha still unregistered. The time required to complete the coverage is
estimated at at least 20 years.
The Collectively-Owned Lands
20.        Some 2.1 million ha out of 9 million ha of productive land is owned
collectively by tribal groups, called "farqa", mostly in the Center and
South. 1/ These are the remmants of a tenure system that in earlier centu-
ries covered the entire country. Even now, the collective lands, which con-
sist entirely of extensive grazing lands, are continuously decreasing because
of pressure to use the more suitable areas for cereals under individual tenure.
The collective lands were in ecological equilibrium until increasing popula-
tion led to overgrazing and a disorderly increase in cereals production, with
consequent deterioration of soil and vegetative resources and gradual exten-
sion of the desert into certain areas.
21.        In 1971 the Government passed legislation intended to provide a
definitive solution to the uncertainty surrounding the future of the col-
lectively-owned lands. With the help of local boards ("Conseils de Gestion")
it aims at transforming from collective to individual ownership those lands
that are: (1) planted in tree crops either by the individuals concerned or
by the State, capital recovery charge being levied in the latter case, (2)
suitable irrigation perimeters. The total area that could thus be transformed
into private holdings has been estimated at I million ha. The remaining 1.1
million ha is by implication only suitable for grazing and would remain under
collective ownership and management.
1/   The total area of collectively-owned lands including non-productive land
is about 6 million ha.

A. Date Palm Plantation
1.        Tunisia's date production dates since early times and is concen-
trated in the semi-desertic Southern and Southwestern part of the country.
The bulk of the date production comes still from traditional oases which cover
some 10,500 ha. The production of the last 5 years varied, according to
climatic conditions and the availability of groundwater, between 39,000 and
58,000 tons of which the praised Deglat variety represented about 20%. Date
exports - nearly exclusively the Deglat variety amounted during the same
period on average to about 5,800 tons per year.
2.        The best suited areas in Tunisia for high quality date production
are the Nefzaoua and Djerid areas situated respectively South and North of
Chott El Djerid. It is also in these regions that STIL owns presently over
1,000 ha of modern date plantations, the greater part of which were financed
under the IDA/Bank First Agricultural Credit Project.
3.        Traditional oases cultivation in the Djerid accounts for a total
area of around 3,400 ha. Characteristic of these traditional oases are the
high density of trees (between 250 and 300 trees per hectare), outdated
methods of cultivation (largely due to lack of resources) and mediocre yields.
The system of land tenure is marked by an extreme fragmentation of ownership,
so that in some cases the fruit of a single palm tree may belong to more than
one family. Larger holdings are most often managed indirectly in one of the
.ollowing forms:
-    the "khammessat", based on a division of the harvest
between the landowner (4/5) and the tenant (1/5);
-    the letting of land against payment of a rental;
-    the "norgharsa", a tree-planting lease (fruit trees).
4.        In these oases the ownership of water is generally separate from
that of land. For centuries irrigation has been practiced with spring water
whose flow rates were originally very substantial (in 1920 1,930 I/sec in
the Djerid). With the introduction of well-drilling techniques, numerous
tubewells have been sunk, initially close to springs, with a view of increas-
ing the volume of water available for traditional date palm plantations and
subsequently also for the development of modern oasis cultivation. By March
1974, 33 artesian wells and 18 pump wells had been completed in the Djerid.
Slowly the volume of flow has started to decrease with a corresponding con-
tinuous fall in the watertable: by 1973, of a total discharge of 2,045 1/sec
the natural springs represented only 1,030 1/sec i.e. 50% of the total, where-
as artesian tubewells accounted for 32% (650 l/sec) and pump wells for 18%
(365 1/sec).

The Government has begun to rehabilitate the old palm groves:  at
Nefta (DJerid) 865 hectares have been provided with an irrigation system of
semicircular flumes and a ntmber of additional wells have been drilled; at
11 Ouidane (Degache) 721 hectares have been provided with a main 9 km pipeline
connecting several wells, compensating reservoirs and secondary pipelines;
inprovements to the tertiary system have yet to be made. The Government's
investment in the rehabilitation works amounts already to D 1.2 million;
the total cost of the scheme covering 1,200 ha is estimated at n 3 million.
6.        New Plantations comprise:
(i)  Young oases with a maximum age of about 14 years; these in-
clude modern privately owned plantations (570 hectares),
some of which are managed by STIL and date palm plantations
developed by STIL between 1966 and 1970 covering an area of
282 hectares in the Djerid;
(ii) In 1971, under the Bank's First Agricultural Credit Project,
STIL was to plant about 900 ha of new date palm groves in
Djerid and Nefzaoua. As of November 1975, 550 ha were suc-
cessfully developed and planted in the Djerid and 263 in
Nefzaoua; plantation of a further 73 ha is scheduled for the
current season. Some of the local population, impressed by
the apparent success of the STIL venture, have formed farmer
development associations (Societes Civiles de Mlise en Valeur -
see Para 14 below) and are extremely keen to continue planting
on their own. Among the 14 SCMIVs approved and registered so
far, three have started development work. Their plantations
will represent a total of some 100 ha when completed and are
all located near Nefta in the Djerid area.
7.        Yields and Production.  The date palm commences to produce dates
from the third or fourth year after planting, but quantity is small and the
quality of the dates is mediocre. By the 7th year production reaches about
20 kg per tree, increasing each year by about 10 kg/tree, and from the 15th
year to the age of 60 years the date palm is in full production yielding, in
a modern plantation, between 80 and 120 kgs. After the 60th year the yield
starts to decrease and the replacement of the palms has to be envisaged.
Average yields in Tunisia in traditional groves are 30 kg/tree for the
Deglats and 40 kg/tree for ordinary varieties.
8.        Tunisian production averaged between 1971 and 1974 45,000 tons of
which 12,000 tons were Deglats; exports amounted over the same period in
average to some 6,300 tons a year, of which 5,800 tons were Deglats; the
balance, representing some 85% of all dates produced, is consumed locally.
9.       Marketing.  The date has been and still is the staple food of the
oases and Saharan peoples. With the growth of urban consumption centers in



ANNEX 1
Appendix 1
Page 3
Tunisia and with the expansion of export markets, the ordinary varieties of
dates traditionally cultivated no longer meet the market requirements. The
Deglat has become the most sought after variety; its commercial value has
risen rapidly from D 100- 130/ton in 1970 to D 200 - 250/ton in 1974 and
D 280/ton in 1975. (The officially established floor prices - actual prices
are frequently higher).
10.       Producers frequently sell their dates as a standing crop to the
khammessat, who then assume responsibility for harvesting, sorting, crating
and resale to wholesalers. Wholesalers may also purchase standing crops
direct from producers. They then provide transportation at their own expense
and deliver the dates either to merchants in Tunis or Sfax or to exporters.
Up to 1964/65 dates were exported by Tunisian merchants who sold their product
to firms in Marseilles. Initially these firms established a whole series
of industrial facilities for the processing of imported dates; subsequently
they formed a single grouping (Europe Dattes). To protect the Tunisian pro-
duction and to increase exports, Government granted STIL a monopoly for the
marketing and export of dates. In 1972 Government abolished STIL's monopoly
and since 1973 a second company formed at Soliman (Cap Bon) also has authority
to export.
11.       Prices of Deglat dates on export markets have constantly risen; they
are high in relation to prices for Iraki and Algerian dates mainly because
they are better processed and presented. As a result Tunisia is selling its
date production on foreign markets at a higher price and quicker. France,
which is the major importer, also re-exports part of its purchases to Italy,
and to various other European countries (particularly Germany).
12.       Development Prospects.  The essential factor to further development
of date palm plantation is the availability of irrigation water. A regional
study undertaken under UNESCO (1968-1971) concluded that the problem was less
one of resources than of methods and operating costs. A recently concluded
water resource study of the Tunisian South, prepared by the French consulting
firm SOGREAH concluded that the Djerid irrigated area could - as far as
potential water resources are concerned, be increased from the present 4,750
ha to about 10,750 ha. The data are similar for the Nefzaoua area (Annex 1,
Appendix 1, Table 1).
13.       Drilling of new wells has however contributed to a drop in the
groundwater level, and consequent decrease of yields of the existing wells in
the old oases. A program for the expansion of new palm groves has to be
accompanied by a rehabilitation of the old oases with additional pumps and
equipment needed to maintain current rates of flow. Such a program, start of
which has already been made at Nefta and Degache, is projected by the Mfinistry
of Agriculture as part of the Master Plan for Development of Southern Water
Resources to be based on the results of the above mentioned study by SOGREAH.

B. Societes Civiles de Mise en Valeur
14.       The Societes Civiles de Mise en Valeur (SCMVs) were created under
a 1971 law to allow for joint purchase and cultivation of land by groups of
individual farmers. They are, in fact, but not in name, small cooperatives.
Each member owns shares for an amount equivalent to his contribution (in
cash or in kind) to the SCMV. The members are jointly and severally liable.
15.       The SCMVs were created principally with a view to allow farmers in
the Southern oases to jointly dig and use a deep well for date palm planta-
tions. The State sells the land to the SCMV for a symbolic amount, but with
certain obligations (to dig a well, to plant palm trees). Out of 40 applica-
tions to create an SCMV, 15 have been approved and 3 already have completed
their wells and started planting.
16.       The first SCMVs had few members, about a dozen, usually richer farm-
ers. Those most recently created have about 50 members, usually smaller
farmers. All the SCMVs created so far are in the Djerid and cover about 50 ha
each.
17.       According to the law, the SCMVs are created for at least thirty
years and cannot be dissolved earlier, so as to provide for joint cultiva-
tion of the land. Actually most SCMVs seem to be inclined not to continue
to cultivate the land in a cooperative form but, once the investment is com-
pleted and loans are fully repaid, leave the cultivation of the individual
plots to the SCMV member.
18.       The present SCMV subprojects evaluation procedures to be applied for
plantations financed from Government FOSDA funds are as follows:
(a) Grant of land to SCMV by Government Land Administration (Office
des Terres Domaniales OTD);
(b) Technical study by the Government water resources administration
(Direction des Ressources en Eaux Souterraines, DRES);
(c) Approval by the Ministry of Agriculture (Direction de la Produc-
tion Agricole, DPA);
(d) Decision by BNT defining the amount of loan, subborrowers con-
tribution, disbursement modalities and other terms of loan;
(e) Establishment of joint and several liability documents binding
all members of the SCMV, and of mortgage of SCMV's land as
soon as Title is received.
(For representative operational model of a 75 ha date plantation, see Annex 5
page 3 and Tables 13 and 14).

Olive Oil Production
1.        Olive growing and olive oil production is one of Tunisia's oldest
agricultural activities and dates back to the Ronan colonisation. Some 1.25
million ha are presently planted with over 50 million olive trees. Olive
production has two outstanding features, namely (a) olive trees are among the
few crops that produce under semi-arid conditions (average rainfall as low
as 150-200 mm) and can survive successive years of severe drought, and (b)
the olive production is notorious for its fluctuations from year to year due
partly to rainfall but also to other factors which are not well understood.
The Tunisian olive harvest between 1969/70 and 1974/75 varied between 125,000
tons and 901,000 tons and olive oil exports represented between 1971 and 1974
in value on average about 50% of Tunisia's agriculture exports.
2.        Although olive production is practiced throughout Tunisia North of
MIedenine, it is heavily concentrated in 3 zones: Sfax, the Sahel, and the
Mejerda Valley. In Sfax it is the predominant crop and 80% of the culti-
vable land is planted with olive trees. Cultivation practices vary according
to rainfall: in the North, tree density is normally 100-130 trees/ha, often
intercropped with vineyards or annual crops. Towards the south tree density
declines and, in the Sfax region, tree density is as low as 20 trees/ha,
without intercropping. In all regions, olive trees are often mixed with
other fruit trees, such as almond or pistachio trees. With the current age
structure of trees, the average oil yield/ha is 220 kg in the tiejerda Val-
ley, 200 kg in the Sahel and 130 in Sfax. Under the various development
plans of the 1960's an important planting progran was carried out, of which
the first effects will be felt during the second half of the 1970's; during
the 1980's these trees will come into full production.
3.        A survey of land utilization in 1971 and 1972 estimated the number
of olive trees at about 52 million, occupying an acreage of some 1,242,000 ha,
of these:
(a) 21% were classified as "very young", i.e. less than
10 years;
(h) 27% were between 10 and 20 years and in early production;
(c) 45% were adult trees, in full production;
(d)  7% were old, over 70 years, with declining yields.
As more of the younger trees come into production or into full production,
only partially offset by the falling yields of the older trees, average
olive production can be expected to increase by some 6.5% p.a. between now
and 1985.

6.        According to the inventory by governorates, the deficit will be
greatest in the Tunis, Beja, Jendouba and Siliana governorates in the North,
and in Kasserine in the central region; there will be surplus capacity in
the South due to the ageing of the olive groves. To meet the expected regional
shortage of olive oil extraction capacity in Northern and Central Tunisia,
about one hundred new mills (30 T/day each) have to be built by 1981.

A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
TUNISIA
Agricultural Credit
A. Financial Environment
Introduction
1.        The Tunisian Banking System comprises the Central Bank (Banque
Centrale de Tunisie, BCT); 12 commercial banks (of which 3 are foreign-
owned and 1 in the process of liquidation); 3 investment banks (Banque de
Developpement Economique de Tunisie, BDET), Compagnie Financiere et Tour-
istique COFITOUR, Banque Generale d'Investissement, BGI); 1 development fi-
nance company (Societe Financiere et de Gestion, SOFIGES); 43 local mutual
credit banks (Caisses Locales de Credit Mutuel; CLCM); the Postal Checking
Accounts System; the Housing Savings Fund and the National Savings Bank.
There are also several insurance companies and a Stock Exchange (Bourse). In
addition, the Treasury receives deposits and performs some banking operations
for government agencies and public and semi-public enterprises. Three
government-owned institutions have played a central role in the Government's
credit policy and investment program: two commercial banks, Societe
Tunisienne de Banque (STB) and Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT) and an in-
surance company, Societe Tunisienne d'Assurances et de Reassurances (STAR).
The Banking Law
2.        The Banking Law 67-51 of December 7, 1967, modified in January,
1975, sets forth the conditions governing the operations of banking insti-
tutions. Each bank has to be authorized by the Central Bank and must specify
whether it intends to work as a commercial bank or as an investment bank.
The commercial banks are entitled to receive deposits and they may invest
them either in short-term loans or, within certain limits set by BCT, in
medium-term loans (not more than seven years); they may also grant long-
term loans out of special funds. The investment banks may receive only fixed
term deposits for more than one year; they finance investments through equity
participation and medium- and long-term loans. The law and subsequent BCT
regulations spell out certain requirements (see below paras 4-6: The Control
of Credit).
The Central Bank
3.        The Central Bank, in addition to its functions as currency-issuing
bank and custodian of foreign reserves, acts as banker to the Government and



ANNEX 2
Page 2
to the commercial banks. It accepts deposits from the banks and makes
payments on their behalf; it may discount Treasury bills and Government-
guaranteed securities or accept them as collateral. It may rediscount com-
mercial paper, loans for crop marketing (cereals, wine and olive oil), short-
term and medium-term loans. In order to control the overall volume of credit
extended by the commercial banks, BCT relies primarily on the following:
(a) Rediscount rate and control of the banks' rate structure;
(b) Prior approval of bank loans above specified amounts;
(c) Variations in the rediscount ceilings;
(d) Ratios affecting the operations of the commercial banks;
(e) Reserve requirements;
(f) Moral persuasion, instructions to banks and penalties.
The Control of Credit
4.         The main provisions of the Banking Law in respect to banks are
as follows:
(a) Mlinimum paid-in capital of D 200,000.
(b) Minimum allocation to legal reserves of 20% of the net yearly
profit until equity reaches a certain percentage of deposits
set by BCT ("solvency ratio" of 10%).
(c) Fixed assets shall not exceed 75% of equity.
(d) Participation in the equity capital of any given company
shall not exceed 10% of equity and reserves of the bank, nor
shall it exceed 30% of the capital of the company (this provi-
sion has not been strictly enforced).
(e) Banks must close their accounts on each December 31; the ac-
counts must be certified by a "Commissaire aux Comptes" (ex-
ternal comptroller); verification of accounts is usually
performed only from an arithmetical point of view and by
checks against supporting documents.
5.        The regulations through which BCT can control credit are:
(a) The Rediscount Rate: The basic rate has been 5% since 1966. In
certain sectors BCT applies differential rates: export credit,
seasonal crop financing and medium-term credit for housing



ANNEX 2
Page 3
guaranteed by the Government (4%); medium-term credit for
large industrial facilities, for agricultural equipment,
for tourism investments, for investments in the poorer re-
gions and for investments by export-oriented companies is
rediscounted at 4.25%.
(b) Control of the Banks' Rate Structure
(i)  Deposits:  Banks are allowed to pay interest on deposits
at rates ranging from 0.5 to 6.5% (see Table 1).
(ii) Lending Rates: Interest rates charged by banks on their
lending operations are also subject to BCT control, which
sets minimum and maximum rates for certain types of trans-
actions, depending if the loan is rediscountable or not.
Rates vary from 4.75%O (export financing) to 8% (non-
rediscountable medium-term loans). These rates do not
apply to loans made from budgetary resources or foreign
borrowings (see Table 1).
(c) Prior Approval of Bank Loans
(i)  Short-term loans above D 5,000 are rediscountable only
with BCT approval and rediscount of only a portion of
the loan may be granted (except for agricultural and
olive oil seasonal credit, where the limit is D 20,000
and for commercial paper discount, where the limit is
D 150,000). Furthermore, loans above D 150,000 for
commercial transactions, government-financed transac-
tions, agricultural, mining and some industrial acti-
vities, and all loans above D 50,000 in other sectors
cannot be made without prior BCT approval.
(ii) Medium-term loans always require prior BCT authorization
(except for new investment projects of new companies
agreed by the Agence de Promotion des Investissements
(API) or the Tourism Agreement Committee) and are re-
discountable only with BCT approval.
(d) Rediscount Ceilings
(i)  Regular ceiling of D 12 million is subdivided into
ceilings for each bank; since January, 1974, no financ-
ing above the regular ceiling is allowed but banks are
authorized to borrow on the interbank money market in-
stead.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
(ii) Seasonal ceilings for financing of the marketing of grain
(D 11.5 million), wine (D 2.6 million) and olive oil
(D 15.5 million). Use of the rediscount ceilings is
shown in Table 1. Their use has increased in 1975 to
about 70-80%, mostly because of the heavy demand for
olive oil financing.
(iii) Medium-term ceiling of D 12 million, to which a bank
may have access only if it has invested at least 15%
of its deposits in medium-term loans (use of resources
ratio). The medium-term ceiling is used at 51-57%.
(e) Ratios: The five ratios used by BCT are shown in Table 2.
(f) Reserve Requirements: Banks have to deposit with BCT 6.5%
of their own deposits except for non-residents' blocked accounts
where the requirement is 40% (in September 1975, reserves with
BCT amounted to D 27.2 million).
6.        These control measures are intended to contribute to the four gen-
eral objectives of the money and credit policy of Tunisia:
(a) the control of banking liquidity;
(b) the incentive system to finance investments;
(c) the financing of seasonal activity;
(d) the encouragement of savings.
B. Demand and Supply of Agricultural Credit
Regulation of Agricultural Credit
7.        The Agricultural Planning and Development Office in the Ministry of
Agriculture is in charge of the general planning of the agricultural sector
and of the global evaluation of the credit needs of agriculture. The Consulta-
tive Committee on Agricultural Credit and Incentives, comprising representa-
tives of BNT and the Ministry of Agriculture, is advising the Government on
credit policies and recommending the allocation of budgetary resources for
agricultural credit. It also decides on the granting of loans by the Fonds
Special pour le Developpement Agricole (FOSDA); however, because of the great
number of FOSDA loans it has to review (about 10,000 loan applications, some-
times more than 1,000 per meeting), it often merely endorses recommendations
made by the staff of the Ministry and of BNT without discussing the individual
investment projects. BCT, in addition to its general regulation activities,
is directly involved in rediscounting short-term credit for olive oil, wine
and cereals; it also refinances stocks of citrus for exports outside of the



ANNEX 2
Page 5
normal rediscount ceiling. The olive oil rediscount facility has been over-
drawn because of export marketing difficulties.
Short-term Credit to Agriculture
8.        No surveys have been made on non-institutional credit by merchants
and big landowners and no data is available. Short-term credit to agricul-
ture in cash is provided mainly by BNT and the CLCMs, although a few commer-
cial farmers are clients of other commercial banks (less than 10% of the total
amount). The amount of short-term credit extended by the banking system to
the agricultural sector and its sources is shown in Table 3. BNT and CLCM
short-term credit is described in more detail in Annex 3.
9.        However, many farmers do not have access to credit in cash from
banks, but receive credit in kind from various government agencies, which
either are specialized by crop and type of farming (grain, oil, livestock)
or manage state farms (Office des Terres Domaniales; OTD) or specific re-
gions (Office de Mise en Valeur de la Vallee de la Medjerda; OMVVM) or pro-
vide mechanization services (SONAMO). The terms of these loans are often a
cash payment upon delivery of the inputs (seeds, fertilizers, plant protec-
tion materials, or mechanization services) and payment of the remainder at
the time of harvest; they are often not considered loans, and not accounted
as such. The various agencies responsible for this type of credit are
described in Annex 1. Data about the volume of loans extended is unreliable
and unprecise. Normally, there is no interest charge.
(a) The Grain Agency (Office National des Cereales; ONC) extends
credit for seeds, fertilizers, and herbicides to about 4,000
farmers, most of them large-size commercial farmers. In 1972
/73 it provided D 485,000 of inputs, and in 1973/74 D 611,000.
Loans are for 12 months at 3%, and borrowers' contribution
(initial cash payment) is 25%; repayments are said to be good,
since the harvest is mortgaged and sold to ONC.
(b) Several grain cooperatives (Cooperative Centrale de Ble,
COCEBLE; Cooperative Centrale de Semences, COSem) Coope-
rative Centrale des Grandes Cultures, CCGC) supervised by
ONC have similar programs reaching at most 5,000 large-size
farmers (about D 500,000).
(c) The National Edible Oil Agency (Office National de l'Huile;
ONH) and the Livestock and Pasture Agency (Office National
de l'Elevage et des Paturages; ONEP) are more active in
medium-term credit (see paras 13 and 18) but also provide
some short-term credit (D 200,000).
(d) The Medjerda Valley Development Agency (OMVVM) provides all
inputs under credit to farmers in its area together with
technical assistance. Borrowers' contribution is 10% and
the total amount of loans for 1971/72 was D 350,000; for



ANNEX 2
Page 6
1972/73, D 492,000; and for 1973174, D 600,000 (about 5,000
farmers). Under the recent Irrigation Rehabilitation Project
(1068-TUN) credit may be provided to about 4,000 small farm-
ers through OMVVM and through a similar agency in the Nebhana
region (OMIVAN).
(e)  The State Land Agency (OTD) provides very little credit itself
(D 19,000 in 1973/74) but cooperates with SONAMO, previously
the Central Mechanization Cooperative (COCEMO), in the provision
of loans in kind for mechanization services and some inputs.
SONANfO reaches about 11,000 farmers directly and 8,000 through
the mechanization services distribution centers; in collaboration
with OTD.
All these credit programs in kind can be estimated to reach at the very most
40,000 farmers, for an amount of at most D 4 million.
10.       70% of the short-term credit is not given as part of an extension
and input package but disbursed in cash by BNT and the CLCM. The sectoral
distribution of short-term credit does not seem to be in line with the
national priorities or the contribution of each crop to total production,
but it is better explained by banking criteria. Grain and vegetable culti-
vation, which account for 35% of total production, received about 75% of
BNT and CLCMI credit. The tentative distribution for 1972/73 was:
Percent of total                             Short-term credit
value of produc-        Growth rate            (72/73)

Grain farmers borrowing from BNT are usually commercial farmers and BNT is
channelling most of its short-term resources to them.  The large amount of
CLCM credit for the cultivation of vegetables is due to the importance of the
CLCMs in the Cap Bon region. Compared to BNT, however, the CLCM loans are
distributed in a fashion somewhat closer to the structure of production in
the region where they are provided.
11.       The total number of farmers having access to short-term credit, in
cash or in kind, is probably no more than 50,000 or 15% of the total number of
private farmers in the country (only 3% of the total receive credit in cash).
While credit in kind may reach farmers in various categories, credit by BNT



ANNEX 2
Page 7
(and the other commercial banks) reaches large farmers who can borrow about
D 1,600, and the CLCM reach smaller farmers, with average loans of D 275. Al-
though data are very limited, it has been estimated (on the basis of regional
surveys) that about 50% of commercial farmers (e.g., more than 50 ha in the
Jendouba Governorate) have access to BNT short-term credit, 30% of medium-size
farmers (10 to 50 ha) receive credit either from CLCM or in kind, and 5% of
small farmers (less than 10 ha) receive credit in kind.
12.       The regional breakdown of short-term credit also shows important dis-
parities (Table 3). The North receives 90% of the short-term credit. This is
linked to the disparities in financing specific activities; for example, live-
stock, whose share of financing is less than its share of total agricultural
production, is one of the main activities in the Center and South, while grain,
whose share of financing is more than its share of production, is grown mostly
in the North. The CLCtls provide most of the short-term credit in the Cap Bon
(citrus and vegetables) and in the Sahel (olives).
Long-term Credit to Agriculture
13.       This encompasses also medium-term credit (between 1 and 7 years).
The amount of long-term credit outstanding from the banking system to the
agricultural sector is shown in Table 4. From 1961-71 the average sources of
investment funds for agriculture have been: state 52.5%, foreign aid 18.5%,
loans disbursed through the banks 7%, loans disbursed through state agencies
0.8%, grants disbursed through the banks 1.2% and self-financing 20%. Most
long-term credit is channelled through BNT, but only a negligible amount is
financed by BNT's own resources: most of the loans are financed from budget-
ary sources and foreign aid. Long-term credit outside the banking system is
limited to the financing of livestock (sheep and heifers) by ONEP (D 500,000/
year). BNT lending is described in more detail in Annex 3. Some of the in-
vestment loans financed from budgetary resources are part of a financing
package that provides also a grant to cover part of the investment costs;
this grant is also disbursed by BNT.
14.       The volume of BNT long-term lending is shown in Table 4.  Less than
3% of long-term credit comes from BNT's own funds. Such a situation is in
direct contrast with the short-term credit situation. BNT, who has to use
14% of its deposits in medium-term loans, prefers to invest them in industry
and services, with safer and more profitable investments and higher interest
rates, and has so far not been encouraged to do otherwise.
15.       In the case of long-term credit, the correlation between the import-
ance of an activity and the amount of credit received is somewhat stronger
than in the case of short-term credit:

/1   Grain production.
The grain sector again seems to receive a bigger share of investment and
loans, but it should be noted that the agricultural machinery is also prob-
ably used for cultures other than grain. The livestock sector receives
very little investment and credit for a variety of reasons (poorer farmers,
low milk price acting as a disincentive to invest). The heavy share of
investment under land improvement is mostly financed by the state (dams,
irrigation system) or by credit under other categories.
16.       The total number of long-term loans to private farmers through
BNT was 19,500 in 1973, 28,400 in 1974 but only 14,000 in 1975. Possibly not
more than 1,000 farmers receive credit from ONEP for livestock. At most 10%
of all private farmers receive long-term credit. The group reached by aach
fund will be discussed in Annex 3, but beneficiaries range from small farmers
under the World Food Program (WFP) in the Center and South, to medium-size
farmers under FOSDA to large commercial farmers under IBRD/IDA.
17.       The regional breakdown of long-term credit shows a predominance
of the North (half of total) but less disparities than for short-term
credit, probably because of the influence of WFP (and to some extent
FOSDA) in the regional diversification (financing of olive trees, date
palm trees, and to a lesser extent livestock). (See Table 4).



ANNEX 2
Page 9
C. Credit to Agro-Industries
18.       Total credit to agroindustries is shown in Table 5.  Credit from
outside the banking system is provided only by the National Edible Oil Agency
(ONH) which gives short-term and (interest free) medium-term credit for ex-
tension and rehabilitation of olive oil extraction plants. These medium-term
credits are for rehabilitation and modernization of existing plants and their
storage facilities (but not for creation of new facilities); they amount to
about D 50,000 to D 100,000 per year, but their volume is likely to increase
in view of the present difficulties in oil marketing and resulting shortage
of storage facilities. 1/
19.       Short-term credit to agroindustries includes seasonal rediscount-
able credit for financing stocks of olive oil to ONH, of wine to the Union
Centrale des Cooperatives de Vinification (UCCV) and of grain to ONC, COCEBLE,
CCGC and COSem; financing of grain stocks is provided only by BNT, the other
two by a banking pool. These credits are partially rediscountable under BCT
rediscount ceilings, up to 80% for wine, 75% for grain and 60% for oil (prob-
ably to be increased to 80%). The interest rates are 5.75% on the rediscount-
able portion and 6.75% on the remainder, thus leading to average rates of
5.95% for wine, 6% for grain and 6.15% for oil (to decrease to 5.95%). Re-
payment is made when the stocks are sold, normally within a year, but with
longer delays now in the case of oil. The use of these rediscount facilities
is given in Table 1. Similar credits are also given in relatively small
amounts for fruits and vegetables (to private traders) and for dates to the
Societe Tunisienne de l'Industrie Laitiere (STIL).
20.       BDET loans to agroindustries have been as follows (commitments):

BDET loans to agroindustries have been for a variety of projects (canning,
fruit processing, oil extraction, flour mill, feed mill) but since 1974 BDET
has been reducing its lending to agroindustries, giving first priority to
heavy industry. Borrowers' contribution is between 30% and 40%. The lending
rate is 8% but will soon increase to 9%. STB loans to agroindustries have
been (commitments):

ANNEX 2
Page 10
They mainly finance olive oil extraction plants, flour mills and canning
factories. Borrowers contribution is at least 30% and the interest rate is
between 7% and 8%. No adequate breakdown of BNT loans to agroindustries is
available but, of D 9.4 million outstanding loans to agroindustries at end
of September, 1975 (15% of outstanding loans to commerce and industry, exclud-
ing seasonal credit for wine, oil, grain and dates), half went to canning
factories, one third to milk factories, 11% to pasta factories and 5% to flour
mills. The close relationship between BNT and STIL is described in Annexes 3
and 4.
21.       The banking sector has also taken equity participations in agro-
industrial companies. Although precise data is not available, it can be
estimated that 7% of the BDET portfolio (about D 300,000), 22% of the BNT
portfolio (D 250,000) and a very small proportion of the STB (and SOFIGES)
portfolio (D 150,0000), or a total of about D 700,000, is invested by banks
in agroindustry, of which almost half in the sugar mill company, Societe
Tunisienne du Sucre (STS), and 20% in the STIL group. BNT's portfolio is
detailed in Annex 3.
D. Agricultural Credit Policy
22.       As can be seen from the above description, agricultural credit in
Tunisia is characterized by the great number of institutions involved and by
the diversity of financing terms under various funds. This situation is the
result of the piecemeal approach of the Tunisian Government, which has not
elaborated a global agricultural credit policy encompassing all institutions
and all funds involved, but instead has met every challenge as it came,
creating new institutions or new funds or letting institutions enter the
credit field to compensate for BNT's inability or reluctance to do so. This
framework, while allowing a certain flexibility of credit provisions which
could be adapted to target groups, has had detrimental effects both in
institutional and economic terms, which were compounded by the easy lending
terms and conditions (low interest rates, high grant element).
23.       In institutional terms, not only is the control of credit at the
national level made difficult by the multiplicity of credit-giving institu-
tions outside the banking system (thus leading possibly to an excessive
credit demand by large farmers who have access to several sources of credit,
from both banks and national agencies), but also the precise delimitation
of the roles of the various institutions involved is not always clear. A
case in point is credit to small farmers. The only institutions especially
geared to small farmers' credit needs, the CLCNIs, are left somewhat dormant,
with no attempts made to improve and reorganize them, but also with no clear
design of terminating them and integrating their clientele in the new struc-
tures. At the same time, a new mechanism, the Societes de Caution Mutuelle
(SCMs), is set up, with heavy publicity, important Government resources
(through BNT) and great expectations, but with no clear policy statement



ANNEX 2
Page 11
that they are to replace the CLCMs. The institutional scene seems to be
spLit between several institutions, each trying to maintain its own credit
activities, with little coordination with others, while the Government
places its expectations with and favors sometimes one and sometimes another.
The low interest rates on long-term agricultural lending have led the banks
to invest their funds in industry (8% or 9%) or in short-term lending to
agriculture (6%) rather than in medium- and long-term loans to agriculture.
The financing of agricultural investments had therefore to be provided by
the Government.
24.       In economic terms, the availability to farmers in some cases of
several credit sources for the same object with different conditions and at
different rates has often led to a competitive situation where the credit
demand was high for those funds with low rates, cursory project appraisal,
little supervision and low repayment pressure to the detriment of funds with
higher interest rates, thorough appraisal and supervision and high repayment
pressure (such as the first Bank loan). This situation has been only partly
corrected through administrative decisions defining the eligibility of partic-
ular groups of farmers for specific funds. Also the tendency not to press
very hard for recovery of some loans (which was much stronger earlier, but
still exists) has led many farmers to confuse loans and grants and to be
delinquent in repayments, despite heavier penalties and the (somewhat theore-
tical and not always strictly enforced) resulting inability to borrow again.
25.       The liberal credit policy has also had some detrimental effects on
the economy.  It represents a heavy burden on the budget, because of the sub-
sidized interest rates and the important grant element. For example at end
1974, D 2,073,000 (D 3.1 million in 1975) had been disbursed during the year
(through BNT) as grants under FOSDA, Fonds d'Encouragement de la Peche (FOSEP),
Fonds Allemand d' Irrigation (FAI/FAIN), and WFP; excluding Bank funds, out-
standing medium-term loans for D 27,667,500 accounted for an annual interest
subsidy of D 1,940,000 (under the assumption of a 3% average lending rate and
a 10% opportunity cost of capital). The loans in arrears which are also sup-
ported by the budget amounted to D 3,190,000 at end October 1975 of which
about D 2.5 million would have to be written off by the Government. The bud-
get has therefore to finance agriculture through credit subsidies in rather
substantial amounts on a recurring basis.
26.       The low level of interest rates also has an impact on the invest-
ment structure. As a global pattern it encourages capital-intensive invest-
ments, does not generate adequate employment opportunities in the rural areas
and therefore encourages migration to the cities, thus creating a vicious
circle of lack of manpower in the rural areas and subsequent demand for more
labor replacing, capital-intensive investments. However, the demand for
labor in the other sectors of the economy also has to be taken into account
and rural employment should not be created for employment's sake, but employ-
ment generation should be one of the objectives of agricultural policy to be
weighed against others like output, trade balance and regional development
(taking into account the impact of the level of interest rates on investment
design). The rural employment situation is discussed in Annex 1.



ANNEX 2
Page 12
27.       In social terms the credit policies have not resulted in a clear
strategy for providing credit to small farmers as a target group but have
attempted various, sometimes conflicting, limited measures whose impact has
been minimal in terms of improving the access to credit for the poorer portion
of the rural population. The limited access of small farmers to the credit
system may be partially due to lack of adequate security for loans (lack of
title to land), but the main reason is the inability or unwillingness of BNT,
the main provider of agricultural credit, to expand its lending to small farm-
ers. BNT considers itself a commercial bank and is reluctant to engage in
a small farm lending program where costs would be high. The only institutions
or projects in the past reaching small farmers were either quite ineffective
because of institutional problems (e.g., the CLCMs), or limited in scope
(WFP), being sometimes only pilot projects. Only about 15% of all Tunisian
farmers at most have access to credit. Government and BNT's management have
just begun to address the need to formulate credit policies which allow for
credit to reach small farmers in an effective manner and still be recollected.
28.       Under a covenant under the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (1068-
TUN), the Government (Ministry of Agriculture) agreed to carry out a study
which would "encompass a critical review of the conditions presently govern-
ing agricultural credit in Tunisia taking into account Tunisian credit condi-
tions in general, agricultural income of farmers, and priorities and objec-
tives of production by crop or groups of crops," and to submit the study and
the subsequent recommendations to the Council of Ministers before October
31, 1975, so that the decision on implementation of the recommended changes
could have been taken by end November 1975. Bank staff have reviewed the
drafts of decrees containing the new set of lending policies and procedures
for FOSDA at various stages since January 1976. Government hopes to pass the
decrees in late 1976.
29.       The draft recommendations (Table 6) represent concrete progress in
two respects:
(i) An income based definition of small/medium farmers who would
be eligible for concessionary financing under FOSDA aimed at
insuring eligibility to smaller farmers; and
(ii) An increase in interest rates from 2-4.5% to 6% in all cases
except loans for deep wells and soil and water conservation
(4%) and loans for soil and water conservation, tree crops
and forage production, on which no interest would be charged
during the non-productive period.
The maximum loan amounts per ha or per head of livestock, the proportion of
investment grants and farmers' contributions and the repayment terms have
also been revised.

APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
TUNISIA
A. Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT)
Institutional Aspects
1.        The stated primary objective of BNT is to promote agricultural de-
velopment by providing short-, medium- and long-term loans, and, more general-
lv, to carry on all normal banking and financial operations, includ-ing com-
mercial loans; it can also take equity investments. BNT operates under the
Banking Law and BCT regulations (see Annex 2).
2.        Under the First Project a policy statement was agreed as a condi-
tion of effectiveness between BNT and the Bank at the time of negotiations.
This statement, although promulgated, does not seem to have been enforced;
only some of its covenants were put into practice. The Loan Agreement, how-
ever, stated that any change in the policy statement, which would materially
Ind adversely affect the objectives, financial conditions or operations of
BNIT was an event of suspension, or of acceleration of maturity. The cove-
nants materially affecting BNT are described later in this Annex.
3.        BNT's paid-in capital increased from D 0.4 million in 1965-67 to
D 1.6 million in 1969-73 to D 3.2 million in 1974-75 and to D 4 million by
November 1975. It is distributed as follows (as of October 1975):
Tunisian Government .........      .............................  25%
Government-controlled Corporations and Cooperatives ...... 43.6%
CLCM .....................................................   16.9%
Private Shareholders ........      .............................  14.5%
A covenant in the Loan Agreement for the First Project stipulated that BNT
shall exercise its rights under subscriptions and agreements to subscribe
to its capital shares so as to ensure receipt of the capital funds available
to it promptly as needed for its operations. In this respect, BNT's sub-
scribed capital was increased from D 1.6 million to D 4 million on May 25,
1974, but was fully paid only in December 1975, i.e., more than 18 months
later.
4.        BNT is administered by a board whose members serve for six years:
it consists of a chairman (who is also the general manager), the deputy
general manager, three Government representatives, four representatives of
state companies and two private members. A financial comptroller, who is
not a 3oard member, is in charge of safeguarding the Government's interests
in Bl'TT.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
5.        BNT's head office is in Tunis; there are 3 agencies in the city and
28 in the rest of the country, all in important cities or tourist centers.
Total staff (including those on secondment to CLOts) number about 900, of
which 64% are at Headquarters, 25% in branches and 11% with the CLCMs; 30% of
the staff has a university education but few are specialized in agriculture
or agricultural economics. An important management problem encountered by
BNT has been the lack of continuity at the top management level due to the
fast turnover of presidents (having had the same president for its first ten
years, BNT then had three presidents in five years), none of them staying
long enough to outline and fully implement an overall development policy for
BNT and for agricultural credit in general.
Operating Policies and Procedures
6.        BNT is making loans to agriculture out of its own funds almost ex-
clusively for short-term credit. The resources for medium- and long-term
loans to agriculture come from several different funds, and each fund has
different rules about appraisal procedures. On FOSDA/FOSEP 1/, the technical
appraisal is done by a Ministry of Agriculture representative, and the finan-
cial appraisal (basically a creditworthiness study) by BNT. On FAI/FAIN, 2/,
SIDA 3/ and PAM 4/ loans, the decision is taken by the respective Project Man-
agers who seek BNT's advice. On FSA 5/ and Bank loans, BNT staff (actually
the Bank Project Unit) is in charge of appraisal.
7.        The provisions under the First Project for training and project im-
plementation applying to BNIT were (in addition to the general statements on
the training of staff included in the Policy Statement):
(i) Adequate staffing of the Agricultural Credit Division, to
be headed by an experienced and qualified agriculturist or
agricultural economist with administrative experience whose
appointment had to be made after consultation with the Bank;
(ii) Part B of the Project consisted of the provision of experts
to train and supervise the technical staff of the Agricultural
Credit Division of BNT;
1/   Special Fund for Agricultural Development/Special Fund for the
Encouragement of Fisheries.
2/   German Fund for Irrigation.
3/   Swedish International Development Agency.
4/   World Food Program.
5/   Special Agricultural Fund.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
(iii) To that effect, BN4T was to employ, in consultation with the
Bank, a farm management specialist, assisted by three experts
in loan evaluation and supervision.
Instead BNT decided not to involve the Agricultural Credit Division in manag-
ing the Project but to set up a separate special unit to appraise subprojects
and manage the implementation of the Project. The Unit was staffed with an
expatriate farm management expert, a project analyst acting as his counter-
part, three technical experts (farm mechanization, dairy farms, and irriga-
tion and date plantations) and several junior project analysts. The unit
also took charge of FSA loans. As a result, the Bank was no longer involved
with the Agricultural Credit Division, which was mostly in charge of short-
term credit, and, until recently, of supervising the CLCMs. The performance
of the technical experts in the Unit has ranged from adequate to excellent.
8.        In 1975, greater autonomy was given to branch managers to grant
short-term credits, within certain limits. Short-term credit is secured over
the relevant crop and is also protected by insurance against fire and hail.
Medium-term loans are secured by liens over stock and equipment, with legal
evidence of landownership. Long-term loans are secured by a mortgage on land.
Not all land is properly titled (see Annex 1), which in effect limits BNT
lending; with the progress made on land registration and the introduction of
new landownership certificates, however, this constraint can be expected to
decrease over the years. Supervision of other than Bank-financed loans is
insufficient, but the continuing provision of short-term loans to farmers
allows BN`T to keep in close contact with the financial situation of its bor-
rowers.
Operations
Short-term Loans
9.        BNT makes short-term loans from its own resources (see Table 2).
Agricultural short-term loans are made only to commercial farmers (mostly
in the North, see Annex 2); small-size farmers borrow from the CLCMs. Aver-
age short-term loan amounts are about D 1,600 for individual borrowers and
D 6,300 for cooperatives. The interest rate is 6% to 7%. Loan amounts are
subject to ceilings per ha which vary between D 10/ha for grain to D 270/ha
for off-season tomatoes.  Table 1 shows the amount of BNT short-term lending
and the ceiling per type of cultivation.
10.       The recent creation of the SCMs (Societes de Caution Mutuelle)--
mutual guarantee societies--will allow the smaller farmers to borrow collec-
tively from BNT, being jointly and severally liable. To qualify as a share-
holder of an SCM, a farmer must own a small-size farm, i.e. cultivating 20-
100 ha of grain or 1-4 ha of citrus or 2-10 ha of vineyards, or 1-5 ha of
fruits and vegetables, or 1-10 ha of fodder crops or 250-1,000 olive trees;
the owner of 5 ha of irrigated off-season fruits and vegetables may, at full
implementation of his project, reach a net annual income of up to D 3,000.
Thus this definition includes relatively large farmers and excludes small
ones who are nevertheless above the subsistence leve. The SCM loans are



ANNEX 3
Page 4
intended to be part of a credit and extension package, and will be mostly in
kind. These loans have to be guaranteed by the SCM and approved by a local
credit committee consisting of local representatives of the Ministries,of
Agriculture and Finance, of BNT, of the National Farmers Union, of the market-
ing agency involved (OC, ONH, etc.) and of the President of the SCM. As of
November 1975, 22 SCMs had been created and 19 more were in the process of
being established, mostly in the North, with an average membership of 200
members per SCM and an average capital of D 1,200. A general Guarantee Fund
would serve as a reserve for write-offs; its funds would come from a 2% in-
terest charge (the interest rate would be 6%,I 4% going to BNT and 2% to the
Guarantee Fund). Each SCM would also have its own provision for bad debts
funded by a commission additional to the interest charge. The loans which
are still unpaid two years after their disbursement (i.e, usually 12 to 15
months in arrears) would be written off as follows:
5% by BNT (provided the BNT representative to the local credit
committee did not vote against the loan)
25% by the SCM
70% by the Guarantee Fund (75% if BNT does not participate).
The SCM provision fund (including earnings on funds deposited by the SCMs)
shall be used to write off losses. However, the individual SOC shareholder
is responsible only to the extent of his share in the SCM (i.e, at least D 5
and, on the average, D 6) which is a limitation to the concept of mutual
liability. Because of bureaucratic slowness after the promulgation of the
law establishing SCMs (December 1973), no credits had been made to SCMs by
early Fall 1975, but they were expected to start soon thereafter.
11.       Short-term loans are made by BNT to industrial and commercial enter-
prises, and also to finance stocks of grain, olive oil and wine. These loans
are made to ONC and to three cooperatives (CCGC, COCEBLE, COSen) for grain,
to ONH for oil and to UCCV for wine. Their amount varies with the production
and the marketing possibilities (see Annex 2).
12.       BNT has made some medium- and long-term loans to industry and com-
merce on its own resources, but practically none to agriculture. BNlT's out-
standing medium- and long-term loans from own funds (excluding the counter-
part funds it provided under the first Bank project) have increased from
D 2.6 million in 1971 to D 8.9 million in 1974. However, commitments of
medium- and long-term loans for agriculture amounted only to negligible
amounts until 1974 (D 940 in 1972, D 2,100 in 1973, D 260 in 1974), but to
D 370,000 in 1975 (138 loans). Resources for medium- and long-term agricul-
tural credits have come from the budget (FOSDA/FOSEP), from bilateral aid
(FSA, FAI, SIDA) or from multilateral aid (PAM, IBRD/IDA) (see Table 2).
Total agricultural medium and long term lending amounted in 1975 to D 11
million (80% of which went to private farmers). Table 3 shows the break-
down of lending by loan size for each fund.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
13.       The FOSDA/FOSEP provide loans at low interest rates (2%-4.5%) and
direct investment grants. For each type of investment, the proportion of
self-financing, of grant and of loan, the maximum loan amount (per ha or per
tree), the repayment terms and the interest rates are specified (see Annex 2,
Table 6 for the present conditions and the proposed changes).
14.       The FSA fund is financed by a 1959 USAID loan of D 1.66 million to
Tunisia and additional credit for D I million between 1968 and 1971. This is
a revolving fund (with a 1% replenishment fee out of the 4% interest), which
is still disbursing.  Medium- and long-term loans are made to cooperatives
and to medium-size farmers with lending conditions usually the same as under
FOSDA. BNT carries one-fourth of the non-repayment risk out of its own
funds, the rest being charged to the FSA fund itself; repayments are rela-
tively adequate (811%). Under a free limit provision, loans above D 10,000
must be approved by the USAID mission in Tunis. The FAI fund is financed by
a 1968 German loan for D 676,000, of which D 170,000 were still available in
mid-1975. It is used only to finance well drilling and pumps. The interest
rate is 3% or 4%. The loans are appraised by a Project Unit (in the Ministry
of Agriculture) and approved by the Ministry of Agriculture; BNT does not
carry any risk (repayment 51%). The SIDA fund (D 1 million from Swedish Aid)
and D 200,000 of counterpart funds finance a development project of small
farms in Northern Tunisia. Short-and medium-term loans will be provided, in
conjunction with technical assistance to about 4,000 farmers near Le Kef and
Jendouba, most of whom farm less than 20 ha. Loans are usually in-kind and
interest rate is 3%. Four World Food Program (WFP) projects from 1967 to
date have financed, as part of a rural development project, a development
program of $32.5 million in Central Tunisia, mainly tree planting and sheep
grazing. This is, in fact, more a development grant than an agricultural
credit program (repayment 5%, but data not yet significant).
Equity Investments
15.       The equity portfolio of BN4T (see Table 5) has more than trebled
over the last five years from D 511,000 in 1971 to D 1,553,000 by September
1975. Investments are mostly in finance (43%) and in agroindustries (22%).
BIT has equity participation exceeding 20% of the capital in two companies,
the Societe Immobiliere et de Participations (SIMPAR) (40% of capital and
10.5% of BNT's portfolio), and the Societe Tuniso-Yougoslave de Developpement
(SOTYD) (25/% of capital and 0.5% of BNT's portfolio) since October 23, 1967
(despite a BCT norm and a Loan Agreement covenant to be enforced by December
31, 1972). The Societe Tunisienne de l'Industrie Laitiere (STIL) accounts
for about 13% of the whole portfolio. In addition to milk factories, STIL
manages date plantations, fruit and vegetable processing units, hotels and
department stores, maintaining very close ties with BNT, which owns 20% of
its equity capital.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
16.       Under the First Project, some covenants were specifically addressed
to the financial relationship between BNT and STIL (or other companies):
(i) The aggregate of lending 1/ and equity participation in any
single enterprise not to exceed (unless such excess is fully
guaranteed by the Government or a responsible financial in-
stitution):
- 25% of BNT's net worth (i.e. paid up equity
plus free reserves) 2/;
- 15% of BNT's net worth plus outstanding long-term
government loans;
- 50% of the total assets of the enterprise;
(ii)  The equity participation in any enterprise should not normally
exceed 20% of the capital of this enterprise (this is actually
a BCT regulation which is not very strictly enforced and was
a binding covenant to be enforced by December 31, 1972 for
STIL and SOTYD);
(iii) STIL accounts should be audited.
It is not yet possible to determine from data furnished by BNT if covenant (i)
was respected at all times; in the case of STIL, the 1975 audit of STIL should
provide adequate information.

ANNEX 3
Page 7
Covenant (ii) was enforced on December 29, 1972 for STIL by reducing BNT's
participation from 28.8% to 20%; it has remained at this level since. How-
ever, there are still two companies, SOTYD and SIMPAR, in which BNT has a
participation greater than 20% (see para 15). As for covenant (iii), the
audit reports for 1969/70 (by Peat, Marwick & Mitchell) and 1970/71 (by Price
Waterhouse) (fiscal year ending September 30) have been received in the Bank
and the report for 1972/73 (by CdMA) was given to the Appraisal Mission.
Resources
17.       BNT classifies its resources into two categories, normal and spe-
cial resources. Normal resources, totalling D 109 million at end 1975 or
about 2/3 of the total, consist of:
(a)  Own Resources:  These include capital of D 4 million at end
1975 and free reserves (reserves and provision for miscel-
laneous risks) which have steadily grown due to BNT's regular
annual profit, to about D 6.2 million at end 1975 (from D 3.5
milion at end 1970).
(b)  Deposits:  Sight deposits (including special savings account)
increased from D 18 million at end 1970 to D 58.2 million at
end 1975, a more than threefold increase; term deposits (includ-
ing certificates of deposit) increased from D 7 million at end
1970 to D 18.5 million at end 1975. BNT collected between 14%
and 16% of all bank deposits in Tunisia until 1973, and 19% in
1974. To these should be added about D 5 million deposits by the
CLCMS. Deposits are collected both in the rural and urban sector,
from: the Government (and public agencies): 54%; from coopera-
tives and CLCMs: 13%; and from individuals: 33%.
(c)  Rediscount Facilities:  These are provided by BCT.  BNT was eli-
gible in 1973 and 1974 for D 17 million each year under the
regular ceiling, the medium-term ceiling (if BNT's use of re-
sources ratio is sufficient), the grain, olive oil and wine
ceilings and the "outside ceiling" rediscount for export bills,
i.e, 38% of total BCT rediscount at end 1973, and 33% at end
1974.
18.       BNT's special resources amounted to D 41.5 million used at end
1975, but totalled D 44.8 million in net commitments. They comprise two
types:
(a) BNT's Borrowings
(i) In 1961, BNT borrowed directly from USAID Development Loan
Fund (DLF), with the Government's guarantee, US$5 mil-
lion for 15 years with one year of grace. Full disburse-
ment was achieved by 1967. Interest was paid at 4% and
charged to subborrowers at 7%. Medium- and long-term
subloans were made for financing agricultural investments.



ANNEX 3
Page 8
(ii)  In 1971/72, BNT borrowed $5 million from IBRD (at 7.25%)
with Government's guarantee and $3 million from IDA through
the Government (at 1%), both loans being for 15 years
including 5 years of grace; the average rate was 4.9%
(plus commitment fee). The Loan/Credit will be fully
disbursed by September 1976 (Annex 4).
(iii) Special Agricultural Fund (Fonds Special Agricole FSA):
see para 14.
(b)  Managed Funds:  BNT administers several special funds made avail-
able to it by Government from its own budget or from external
aid. These funds are on-lent on concessionary terms in order
to stimulate the development of various agricultural subsectors.
The lending decision on subloans is either taken outside BNT,
sometimes with BNT having a say only as far as the credit-
worthiness of the borrower is concerned, or shared by BNT with
another agency. BNT does not usually assume any risk except
on funds originating from the Bank/IDA.
(i) In 1967, Tunisia received a Bank loan of US$12 million
at 6% and an IDA Credit of $6 million at 0.75% (484/99-TUN),
(reduced in November, 1970 to $6.1 million and $3.1 mil-
lion respectively) for the development of agricultural
production cooperatives in Northern Tunisia. Average cost
of funds to the Government was 4.25% (plus commitment fee),
but funds were passed to BNT at 4%. Subloans were made by
BNT for onlending at 6%,I/ i.e, with a 2% spread. BNT
assured 5% of the repayment risk on loans to cooperatives.
Full disbursement was achieved in early 1974.
(ii)  In 1971/72, BNT borrowed $1.83 million from IDA (270-TUN)
through the Government (plus $130,000 equivalent frcm the
Government) at 3% for 15 years including 5 years of grace,
with Government assuming 50% of any losses incurred by BNT
due to default by subborrowers. The Credit was to finance
through medium- and long-term loans the acquisition of fish-
ing boats and fishing gear by qualified fishermen. The Cre-
dit is expected to be fully disbursed by December 1977.
(iii) Debts consolidation (Apurement des Dettes, AD): not dis-
bursing any more.
1/   The rate for onlending agreed with the Bank was 8%, but a 2% rebate was
paid by Government.



ANNEX 3
Page 9
(iv)  Fund for the Development of Agricultural Production and
Service Cooperatives (Fonds pour le Developpement des
Unites de Production et des Cooperatives Agricoles de
Service, FODIUPCAS): not disbursing any more.
(v) Special Fund for Agricultural Development (Fonds Special
pour le Developpement Agricole, FOSDA): (see para 13).
(vi)  Special Fund for the Encouragement of Fisheries (Fonds
Special pour l'Encouragement de la Peche, FOSEP): similar
to FOSDA but for the fisheries sector.
(vii) German Fund for Irrigation (Fonds Allemand pour l'Irrigation,
FAI/FAIN): (see para 14).
(viii) Special Fund for Financial Assistance to Cooperatives (Fonds
Special pour les Amenagements Financiers, FOSAF): not dis-
bursing any more.
(ix) WJorld Food Program (WFP): (see para 14).
(x) Swedish International Development Agency Fund (SIDA):
(see para 14).
(xi)  Fund for the Protection of the Wine Industry (Fonds de
Defense de la Viticulture, DV): for D 150,000, has not
been used since its granting in 1962, due to lack of an
agreement between BNT and the Mlinistry of Agriculture.
Financial Position
19.       Profitability:  By careful administration of lending operations
from its own funds, BNT has been able to generate a sizable profit every year
(see Table 6: Income Statement). Gross income has been a low percentage of
average total assets (3.7% to 4.9%) as a result of the low interest rates
structure in Tunisia, but the cost of resources has also been very low (1.0%
to 1.5@' of average total assets), thus allowing for a reasonable spread (2.7%
to, 3.3' of average total assets, except in 1973: 3.8%). Allowance for pro-
visions has been small (0.3% to 0.6% of average total assets) and a sizable
provision for miscellaneous risks has been set up. Operating costs, includ-
ing depreciation, have been kept low (1.4% to 1.5% of average total assets,
and only 29% to 37% of gross income); since 1970, they have increased by 27%
per year on average (gross income having increased by 30% per year on aver-
age). Dividends and directors' fee were sizable, amounting in 1970-1972 to
between 31% and 34% of the net income distributed. The percentage decreased
to 19% in 1973 and 23% in 1974 because of the important allocation to the
tax-free reinvestment reserve (1972 incentives law). Net income as a per-
centage of year-end equity accounted for 24%-32%, except in 1973 when it



ANNEX 3
Page 10
reached 56%; dividends paid were 7% in 1970, 8% in 1971, 10% in 1972 and
1973, 8% in 1974 1/ and 9% in 1975. BNT started paying income tax in 1969
after a nine year exemption.
Forecasts
20.       BNT's forecasts of its flow of funds statement until 1978 have to
be considered as very tentative, with a margin of error higher than usual.
On this basis the mission attempted to derive forecasts of the BNT balance
sheet and income statement (see Table 9). The following assumptions have
been used for projections of the balance sheet until 1981:
(a) The equity capital increased to D 4 million in 1975 and
will reach D 6 million in 1980;
(b)  The reserves and provisions will increase by about 8% per year;
(c) Deposits will grow at about 10% per year;
(d) Short-term agricultural lending will grow at about 21% per year,
although the growth will be higher until 1977 and taper off later,
on the assumption that BNT's effort to reach small farmers will
be limited to the SCMs (accounting for about one-third of total
short-term agricultural lending), and that its lending to richer
farmers will reach saturation;
(e)  Medium-term agricultural lending from BNT's own funds, after a
rapid increase in 1975/76, will expand slowly due to the continu-
ing availability of cheaper FOSDA funds;
(f) Non-agricultural short-term lending will grow only at about
10%, due to increased competition from other banks, thus de-
creasing the proportion of short-term funds not going to agri-
culture from 90% to 80% of total short-term lending;
(g) Non-agricultural medium-term lending will grow at about 22%,
due to BNT's need to increase its medium-term lending to comply
with BCT regulations, and reluctance to do so in agriculture;
(h) IBRD resources and loans are projected on the basis of the last
progress and supervision reports on the existing projects
(Fisheries, Ag Credit I) and on reasonable disbursement assump-
tions for other projects (Irrigation Rehabilitation, Ag Credit
II); no other possible future projects have been taken into ac-
count;
1/   In 1974, 25% of the shares were issued in September and were not divi-
dend earnings; another 25% were created by incorporation of reserves and
distribution of one additional share per two shares outstanding, so that
thf diviLdend npsr share outstandincg as of early 197' was actual3y 12%.



ANNEX 3
Page 11
(i) FSA resources and loans will remain constant (replenishment
fee);
(j) FOSDA resources and lending will grow at about 27% per year;
(k) Total assets will increase by about 12.5% per year.
As for the income statement, it has been assumed that:
(a)  Gross income will increase from about 4.5% of total assets in
1974 to 5.4% in 1981, with a significant increase in 1976 due
to the new FOSDA lending terms;
(b)  The cost of resources wiLl increase from about 1.5% of total
assets in 1974 to 2.3% in 1981;
(c)  The operating costs (including depreciation) will increase very
slowly from 1.5% of total assets in 1974 to 1.7% in 1981;
(d)  Allocations to provisions will remain at 0.5% of total assets;
(e)  As a result, net income after tax will grow by about 10.5% per
year.
On the basis of these assumptions, BNT's financial condition is expected to
remain s-itisfictorv.
,1.       Financial Structure (see Table 7:  Balance Sheet):  BNT has to com-
ply with the financial ratios set by BCT (as described in Annex 2, Table 2).
Tts "use of resources" ratio was always well above the norm (15%):
1971      1972       1973       1974
18.0%     17.1%      28.1%      25.5%
Almost all of BNIT's medium-term loans are for industry and commerce or for
agricultural investments under the first Bank project. BNT does not seem
to have complied with the "development financing" ratio (30% until January
1975):
1970     1971      1972      1973      1974
15.5%    10.1%    10.2%    17.1%    13.0%
As a result, the missing amounts, which should have been invested in Govern-
ment bonds, are blocked by BCT. In 1970 the long-term debt equity ratio was
1:1, but the current ratio was 0.9:1, thus pointing to an unsatisfactory
liquidity position. Although precise data is not available, it can be esti-
mated, on the basis of the trend in the "solvency" ratio (see below), that
the debt/equity ratio has deteriorated after 1970 but improved in 1975 due to



ANNEX 3
Page 12
the increase in capital. However the Loan Agreement for the First Project
provided for the debt/equity ratio not to exceed 4:1, and this covenant seems
to have been respected, since BNT did not borrow large amounts long-term on
its own account.
22.       Other financial covenants were:
(a) Capital and reserves to be equivalent to at least 10% of sight
and fixed term deposits (BCT "solvency" ratio); in fact, the
ratio was:
1970    1971      1972      1973     1974      1975
10.2%   8.6%      7.7%      7.4%     6.8%      8.1%
(b)  Fixed assets, including participations not to exceed 75% of
paid-up equity plus free reserves; in fact, the ratio was:
1970    1971      1972      1973     1974      1975
39%     53%       63%       76%      63%       59%
(c)  BNT to have suitable protection against the foreign exchange
risk with respect to foreign loans.
It would seem that BNT was and still is under-capitalized, despite the recent
capital increase; the building up of reserves after 1970 did not keep pace
with the growth of deposits and lending. In a hypothetical case, if no divi-
dends above the statutory 3% dividend and no directors' fee had been distri-
buted, the ratio under (a) would have been only slightly better:
1970     1971      1972      1973     1974    1975
Amount of reserves (D'OQO)   967        1,257    1,578    1,967    2,723   2,963
Ratio                         10.2%      8.8%     8.1%      8.1%      8.4%    8.7%
The under-capitalization cannot, therefore, be totally attributed to the
dividend distribution policy, but also to the difference between the growth
rate of deposits and the growth rate of net income, thus pointing out the low
level of interest rates:
1971   1972   1973   1974   1975
Annual growth rate of deposits                  29%    22%    13%    60%       0%
Annual growth rate of net income                15%    17%    77%       0%    39%
Annual growth rate of capital plus reserves   9%         8%     9%    46%    37%
23.       Recoveries:  It is also difficult to evaluate the quality of the
BNT loan and investment portfolio and the adequacv of its provisions. Never-
theless, BNT's recovery procedures for loans made out of its own resources ap-
pear thorough and methodical, at least during the early stages (administrative



ANNEX 3
Page 13
procedure) where about 75% of the recoveries are made. If this approach does
not bring results, the loan is transferred to the litigation division of BNT,
which may go to court against the borrower; for the 2,100 or so files under
litigation (amounting to D 3.2 million, of which D 2 million out of BNT's own
funds), an additional 2% penalty interest rate is charged. Ilowever many old
loans on which there are no more repayment prospects are still carried on the
books and not written off, and, for some of them, no specific adequate provi-
sion has been made. The repayment rates are not very well known; they vary
-'Ldely depending on the source of funds and the risk BNT assumes, i.e, BNT's
Lncentive in allocating resources to recovery efforts. It seems that the re-
payment rate on loans out of government funds from 1956 till now has been
only about 50%. Table 8 shows some repayment data for 1975. Loans out of
IBRD/IDA funds were repaid at 92% (as of October 31, 1975) while loans out
of FSA were repaid at 81% and out of FOSDA (for similar investments) at 83%;
the average repayment rate for medium and long-term loans out of special re-
sources was 71% for individuals and 68% for cooperatives, while short-term
loans out of BNT's own funds were repaid at 77% for individuals and 92% for
cooperatives (all data as of October 31, 1975). The short-term loan repay-
ment rates will increase by the end of the marketing period (for 1973/74 they
were 91% for individuals and 93% for cooperatives).
24.       Portfolio:  Although it does not seem that the allocation of provi-
sions and the write-off of bad loans are in line with the recovery and litiga-
tion procedures, the provisions established by BNT are large and sufficient
to cover its risks: the provision for miscellaneous risks amounts to D 3.4
million and the provision for loans under litigation to D 1.1 million (re-
spectively, 40%, 45% and 35% of the loans under litigation in 1972, 1973 and
1974, but the increase in the provision over the previous year amounted to
73% of the increase in loans under litigation in 1973, but only to 23% in
1974). The provision for equity investments amounted to D 129,000 at end
1974; it had decreased from 20% of the equity investment portfolio in 1970
to 9% in 1973 and 11% in 1974, while the quality of the equity investment
portfolio had improved. The mere size of the provision for miscellaneous
risks provides a sufficient amount to cover BNT's own repayment risk, but
better management of the provision for loans under litigation would never-
theless be worthwhile and advisable. The reserve funds amounting to D 1 mil-
lion at end 1974 (legal and extraordinary reserves only) provide additional
protection.
25.       BNT's risk is linked to its exposure in the agricultural sector and
is therefore compounded by output fluctuations (bad harvests) and by political
or organizational difficulties in the agricultural sector (such as the coop-
eratives' movement). In fact, while BNT contributes 25.4% of total outstand-
ing loans by the banking sector (including arrears), at end September 1975,
its share in agriculture (half of BNT's outstanding loans and participations,
but only about 30% of the loans and participations on which BNT assumes a re-
payment risk) is 86.1% and in agroindustry 52.6%; its share in other industry
is 10.6%, in trade 36.9%, and in other services 10.5%.



ANNEX 3
Page 14
Accounts and Audit
26.       BNT has five levels of control:
(a) As a bank, BNT is subject to the usual Central Bank supervision;
(b) As a joint stock company, BNT is subject to the scrutiny of two
external comptrollers elected by the shareholders at the annual
general meeting (see Annex 2 para 4 (e));
(c) As a company with a State equity investment, BNT is subject
to the control of a financial comptroller appointed by the
Government and charged with the protection of Government's
interest in BNT;
(d) As a Bank/IDA borrower, BNT has to have its accounts audited
by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank;
(e) BNT has its own internal inspection, which performs an adminis-
trative and performance control, but not a financial one.
27.       With the Bank's concurrence, BNT appointed Peat, Marwick & Mitchell
as its auditors in early 1971 for its 1970 accounts. The 1970 audit report
did not give an opinion on BNT's accounts and the Bank urged BNT to appoint
new auditors. Price W4aterhouse audited the 1971 accounts in collaboration
with a Tunisian firm, Cabinet d'Informatique, de Management et d'Audit (CIMA).
Starting with the 1972 accounts, CIMA (whose director is also one of BNT's
external comptrollers) did the audit alone, although this change was not
notified to the Bank and the audit reports were not sent to the Bank. The
audit report for FY1974 was received only in 1976 and the audit report for
FY1975 is not expected to be received before end 1976. The quality of those
audits prepared by CIMA is not satisfactory to the Bank and BNT was required
to correct the situation under the Project (see para 6.16). Audit reports
should be communicated to Board members for information, which is not the
present practice. At the same time, the financial statements submitted to
the Bank should be of a format identical to those submitted to the Central
Bank. BNT should also be encouraged to develop an internal financial audit
system.
B. Caisses Locales de Credit Mutuel
Institutional Aspects
28.       The Caisses Locales de Credit Mutuel (CLCMs) are credit cooperative
societies made up of farmers, craftsmen, shopkeepers and merchants. The
purpose of the CLCMs is stated as the promotion of savings and the provision
of short-term credit, mostly for productive purposes, under a limited mutual
guarantee system, to rural people facing difficulty in obtaining credit from



ANNEX 3
Page 15
the banking system. The CLCMs are governed by the Cooperative Law of 1967.
Membership is in principle open to any individual or company but admission is
subject to approval by the Board of Directors and subscription of a share (D
5) in the capital (as a result, capital is variable). Loans can be made only
to members, who must hold shares to the extent of 5%/ of their borrowings.
The joint liability of members is limited to their equity participation, thus
reducing the mutual liability aspect of the operations.
29.       Local credit sections were in operation from 1960 till 1966 as as-
sociations of BNT borrowers but without any well-defined financial role. At-
tempts were also made to create a Cooperative Bank which was taken over by
BNT in 1962. The first CLCMs were created in 1963 by the Government as part
of the objective to generalize mutual credit. During the 1962-64 Plan, a
program was drawn up to establish CLCMs in the Cap Bon region where small
fruit and vegetable farms are predominant. Nine CLCMs were created and re-
ceived a state grant of D 290,000 (the first five with D 50,000 each and the
last four with D 10,000 each). They were then totally independent from BNT
(although some BNT staff were seconded to them). By July 1965, there were
12 CLCMs, of which the most recently created did not receive any state grant.
Under agreements of May 1965 and January 1966 between BNT and the Planning
and National Economy Ministry, BNT becane entrusted with the management of
the CLCMs. The above-mentioned local credit sections of BNT were then abol-
ished.
30.       The main difficulties encountered by the CLGMs during their start-
ing period were:
(a)  Poor management by incompetent and inexperienced boards and
managers;
(b)  Inadequate assistance in terms of finance, technical guidance,
training and supervision by Government;
(c) Poor repayment performance because of borrowers' confusion be-
tween loans and grants.
As a result, the CLCMs were in a dismal financial position. BNT, when taking
over, attempted to correct this situation by seconding staff to the CLCMs,
training their staff, improving their administration, and especially their
financial management, and providing a rediscount facility to CLCM loans. BNT
was also supposed to prepare a development plan for the creation of new CLCMs
in the country. The situation did not improve much, however, and was further
aggravated by the cooperatives' situation and the poor harvests in 1967-69.
31.       Since 1970, the CLCMs have been regarded, on one hand, as remnants
of the cooperative era that should be abolished and, on the other hand, as
the only credit institutions in close contact with small farmers, and there-
fore worthy to be reorganized and developed. No clear policy on them has
emerged so far. There are now 43 CLCMs. BNT processes the accounting data
of the CLCMs and has a special division in charge of overseeing them.



ANNEX 3
Page 16
32.       All CLCMs are managed by a Board of 6 to 12 Directors who are
elected for three years by the members; the Directors are prominent farmers
or merchants. The Board is responsible for approving all loans upon the re-
commendation of the CLCM manager. Each CLCM is staffed by a manager, who is
a BNT staff member seconded to, and paid by, the CLC1I, and by between one and
four employees. A most important factor in the successful management of a
CLCM is the cooperation between the Board and the Manager, and the extent to
which the Board members are able and willing to approve loan applications on
the basis of banking criteria and not of patronage. The CLCM standard stat-
utes provided also for the establishment of a control committee elected by
the General Assembly; as members did not have the competence to carry out
these functions, no such committees seem to have been created in any CLCM.
Each CLCM has an average of 1,800 members.
33.       Most CLCMs are in the north, in the Sahel, and in the Cap Bon re-
gion and these are usually the most successful ones. At end 1974, 9 CLCMs
were in the Cap Bon (Nabeul), 11 in the Sahel (Sousse, Monastir, Mahdia) and
11 in the North (Tunis, Beja, Bizerte), accounting respectively for 49%, 13%
and 26% of total CLCM lending. Of the 9 CLCMs in the Cap Bon, 8 were making
a profit in 1974, compared to 2 out of 11 in the Sahel, 4 out of 11 in the
North, and 8 out of 12 in the rest of the country. The Cap Bon area is the
only region where mutual credit has worked well, partially for socio-cultural
reasons and partially because of the existing economic structure with a great
number of relatively small farmers deriving an adequate income from the
cultivation of fruit, vegetables and citrus.
34.       The CLCMs perform essentially two functions, the provision of bank-
ing services and short-term lending. Due to their location in small cities
where there is often no other bank, they can attract fairly sizable deposits
from merchants, farmers and cooperatives. However, only the richer members
have been able to deposit significant amounts and the interest rates paid
(fixed by law) are very low (see Annex 2, Table 1). The CLCMs most success-
ful in attracting deposits are those not suffering from competition from
another bank, usually BNT (16 CLCMs are in a city where there is also a BNT
branch) or those close to cooperatives having large amounts of liquidity.
The CLCMs account for about 2% of all bank deposits in Tunisia. An important
part of CLCMs' income comes from other banking transactions, especially for-
eign exchange transactions (usually with tourists).
Short-term Loans
35.       The CLCMs provide only short-term credit.  Fewer and fewer CLCM
loans are for agriculture and more and more for commerce. The norms govern-
ing the size of the loans to agriculture and their repayment schedule are the
same as for BNT (see Table 1) but loans cannot normally exceed D 500. Loan
appraisals are usually not very thorough and the feasibility of the proposed
cropping pattern is rarely examined. Collaboration with the local staff of
the Ministry of Agriculture is minimal. The interest rate is 6% (7% for non-
agricultural loans) with an additional 1% paid into a general reserve, thus



ANNEX 3
Page 17
making credit more expensive for CLCM borrowers than for BNT borrowers. Ad-
ditional fees may bring the cost of funds to about 8-9%. In addition, bor-
rowers must hold shares to the extent of 5% of their borrowings and since the
shares are not earning dividends, this represents an additional cost. No
subsidies or grants are made available to CLCM borrowers. The collateral re-
quired is the unlimited liability of the borrower to the CLGM, including his
crop and his real and chattel property. However the joint liability of CLCM
members to others (State, BNT) is limited to the amount of capital shares
owned by each member.
36.       Table 12 shows the amount lent by the CLCMs.  Only in 1969 were
loans made to cooperatives; in 1973, after only 34% had been repaid, the
State repaid the outstanding amount to the CLCMs. The average loan amount
almost doubled in real terms between 1966 and 1974. Only a small proportion
of the members are actually borrowers, at most 10% in 1974, since many have
no interest in the CLCMs and reluctantly became members because of political
pressures. The CLCMs represent a major part of the total agricultural short-
term lending only in the Cap Bon (80%) and in the Sahel (73%) (about 37% for
the country as a whole). However, the CLCMs lend more and more outside agri-
culture (from 9% of their assets in 1970 to 18% in 1974) and less to agricul-
ture (from 38% of assets to 21%).
Resources
37.      'Most of the CLCM resources come from deposits, usually sight depos-
lts _- ,4 million at endi 1974) ana fro.. their equity capital and free re-
serve (D 1 million) the rates paid on deposits are those prescribed by the
Central Bank (Annex 2, Table 1). Since 1971, BNT does not rediscount CLCM
loans (the BNT rediscount rate was 5%, i.e., 1% more than the BCT discount
rate for BNT at the time). Except in 1969, because of the loans to coopera-
tives, the rediscount facility never exceeded D 300,000 (see Table 12). The
State has provided only D 290,000 as a grant to nine of the first CLCMs, and,
asile from its repayment of the outstanding loans to cooperatives in 1972
(D I million), has not provided any other funds to the CLCMs.
Financial Position
38.       Profitability:  The financial spread available to the CLats (3.4%
to 3.9,' of average total assets) is spent almost entirely on operating costs,
which are quite stable at 3.2% of average total assets; this proportion is
not unduly high for a small farmers' decentralized credit system. As a re-
sult, the average loss ranges from 0.4% to 0.8% of average total assets for
the whole CLCM system. The income from loans to agriculture has decreased
from 20% of total income in 1971 to 15% in 1974, while the income from other
loans more than doubled from 14% to 29% of total; the income received from
BNT (deposits and share capital) was quite stable, fluctuating between 34%
and 38% of total income, while the other income decreased from 32% to 21%.
The increase in the volume of non-agricultural loans and, as a result, in
income from them, was a clear consequence of the relative profitability of



ANNEX 3
Page 18
lending to agriculture (2.7% to 3.2% net yield) and to other sectors (8.1%
to 9.2% net yield) this being mostly a result of the substantial arrears on
agricultural loans; the net yield on assets with BNT remained around 3.5%,
and the yield on the other assets decreased from 9.1% to 7% (still quite
large, mostly because of the profit made on banking transactions). The aver-
age yield on assets varied between 4.4% and 4.8% during the period 1971-74
(see Table 10).
39.       Financial Structure.  The CLCMs have neither long-term debt nor
long-term lending but their sizable bad debts hamper their liquidity. Their
capital base is very small and they are undercapitalized for the amount of
risk on loans they have to support. A sizable portion of the CLCM assets
(50% in 1972, down to 40% in 1974) is actually not used for lending but kept
with BNT in low yielding (about 3%) accounts and as equity participation; the
CLCMs have been a source of cheap funds (net yield about 3%) to BNT, instead
of using these funds for their lending operations. The main financial pro-
blem of the CLCMs is the size of their arrears which accounted for 28% of
total assets in 1970, down to 15% in 1974 (see Table 11).
40.       Recoveries:  Because of inadequate recovery procedures, an import-
ant portion of CLCM loans has never been repaid: the annual repayment rate
is barely over 50%, and arrears account for half of the portfolio (1971 -
57%; 1972 - 50%). The situation has improved somewhat since 1972 (1974 - 35%
of the portfolio in arrears) and more adequate provisions, though still in-
sufficient, have been made (from 8% of arrears in 1970 to 20% in 1974). The
situation is, however, very unsatisfactory and cannot be expected to improve
much as long as the old arrears (before 1970) are not written off.

Project Description
2.        The Credit/Loan was made to finance part of Banque Nationale de
Tunisie (BNT) lending to commercial farmers for investment in grain farm
mechanization and dairy farm development in Northern Tunisia, and for date
palm plantations to be undertaken by the Societe Tunisienne de l'Industrie
Laitiere (STIL) in the desert areas of Southwestern Tunisia. The Project



ANNEX 4
Page Z
included financing of technical assistance to strengthen BNT's loan ap-
praisal division, plantation management of STII. and vehicles for technical
services.
3.        The approximate estimate made during appraisal as to the number
and size of subprojects to be financed under the Project were as follows:
(a) 460 grain farms, each about 100 ha surface, investing in
wheel tractors and farm machinery;
(b) 130 grain farms, each at least 200 ha of crops, investing
in crawler tractors and farm machinery;
(c) 240 grain farms each at least 200 ha of crops, investing in
harvesters and farm machinery;
(d) 150 dairy farms, each with at least 8 ha irrigated land; and
(e) 18 date palm plantations each of about 50 ha, to be irrigated
by artesian wells (to be implemented by one subborrower STIL).

5.        The loan categories were originally allocated, each according to
its foreign exchange component; however, Bank's disbursement was in all cases
to be uniformly 75% of BNT loans disbursed. The result of this oversight was
that the Date Palm Plantations Category, which had the smallest foreign ex-
change component, had to be increased from US$0.81 million to US$1.7 million
in order to cover the 52.5% of investment as set up in the overall financing
plan. The overall categories have been adjusted accordingly, so that the
final schedule of withdrawals of the proceeds of the Loan/Credit was:

A.   Grain Farms                     US$5.00 million
B.   Dairy Farms                     US$1.10 million
C.   Date Palm Plantations           US$1.70 million
D.   Technical Assistance            US$0.20 million
Total                     US$8.00 million
6.        The Loan/Credit was expected to be disbursed over a period of 3
years and 3/4, with disbursements starting in second quarter FY72.
7.        The financial rate of return of the subprojects was expected to
range from 14% to 20% and the economic rate of return of the whole Project
was estimated at 22%.
B. Project Implementation
8.        The Project became effective more than six months after the signing
date, due to delays in fulfillment of two effectiveness conditions, namely
(a) the ratification by the National Assembly of the Loan/Credit documents
and (b) setting up of a Technical Unit of four experts within BNT. In 1972
the Project appeared to be off to a good start. The demand for loans under
the mechanization component remained satisfactory through 1972, although the
average loan amounts were somewhat lower than expected. The same phenomenon,
only more pronounced, was observed in dairy loans. The successive supervi-
sion missions repeatedly called Government's attention to this question and
several letters in this respect were addressed to Government. The Date Palm
Plantation component, although somewhat behind schedule, continued to be im-
plemented satisfactorily.
9.        During 1973 loan disbursements for farm mechanization decreased
sharply.  This was mainly due to severe floods in March 1973 which destroyed
20-25%, of the cereal crop in the Project area. The demand for loans improved
later in the year, but remained much under the projected level. Dairy farm
loan applications and disbursements also remained far behind schedule. The
discrepancy with appraisal estimates did not reside so much in the number of
loans made but rather in the average amount of investment financed (D 2,220
instead of D 5,110). The structure of investment made differed substan-
tially from the structure anticipated during appraisal. The average number
of heifers financed by farm was 8.5 instead of 12 as anticipated, and the
irrigation network and equipment which were expected to represent about 42%
of the investment in each loan actually amounted to only 3% of the loan
amounts. Moreover, the cost of imported dairy cows rose from D 300 to D 420-
450 while the price of milk remained unchanged, making it hardly profitable
for farmers to invest in imported dairy cows. Finally the question of com-
peting FOSDA funds was still not resolved and BNT continued disbursement of
these funds to farmers who could qualify under the Project. The implementa-
tion of the Date Palm Plantation component of the Project remained satis-
factory.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
10.       The loan disbursement situation remained much the same through
1974. In the case of the Farm Mechanization component, however, the number
of incoming loan applications and loan approvals increased sharply in the
second half of the year mainly as a result of a Government/BNT decision to
exclude all FOSDA funds from farm mechanization and of lack of new American
AID funds previously also used by BNT to finance this category of subprojects.
In order to speed up disbursements under the Dairy Farm Mechanization, Bank
agreed on July 19, 1974, to BNT's request to include the financing of a Milk
Processing Plant to be built by STIL in the Sousse Region.
C. Project Realization
Investment in Grain Farms
11.       In all about 830 loans were expected to be disbursed under the cat-
egory directly affecting grain production on at least 12,000 ha. The aggre-
gate loan amount to be disbursed by BNT under this heading was expected to be
D 3.4 million (US$6.4 million at the then prevailing rate) resulting in an
average subloan amount of D 4,096. As of June 30, 1976, BNT received under
this category 866 loan applications, of which 693 were approved, 109 were
rejected and 55 were under consideration; and 596 loans were disbursed. The
total loan amount involved for the 693 approved loans amounted to D 2.8 mil-
lion resulting in an average subloan amount of D 4,000, remarkably near to
the original estimates.
12.       The average prices paid for harvester and crawler tractors appear
to be very near to those projected. The more significant difference in wheel
tractor prices may be due to larger tractors purchased than expected during
appraisal.
Investment in Dairy Farm Development
13.       About 150 subloans were expected to be disbursed under this cate-
gory involving purchase of about 1,800 heifers, investment in irrigation on
about 1,200 ha, investment in barn improvement, and purchase of miscellaneous
forage and hay-making machinery. Total investment was estimated at D 1.1
million and BNT disbursements at D 0.77 million resulting in an average sub-
loan amount of D 5,110. As of June 30, 1976, BNT received 256 subloan appli-
cations under this heading of which 138 were approved and 118 rejected. Only
99 subloans were disbursed.l/ The total loan amount involved for the 138
loans approved was D 409,000 (without taking into account the loan for the
1/ Including 1 loan for the milk processing plant at Sidi Bou Ali amounting
to D 159,000.

milk processing plant), the average subloan amount was D 2,963. The pur-
chased 908 heifers include 500 imported pure breed heifers (average price
D 340), the rest were merely exclusively Tunisian born pure breed heifers
(average price D 304).
Date Palm Plantations
14.       All the new plantations under the Project were to be executed by
STIL, a Government controlled holding already owning and/or directly admin-
istering at the time of Project appraisal some 500 ha of modern date planta-
tions. It was estimated that some 18 artesian boreholes will be financed in
the Djerid and Nefzaoua regions of Southwest Tunisia. The Project was also
to cover the necessary irrigation and drainage networks, land levelling and
preparation, purchase and plantation of date palms and windbreaks, construc-
tion of storage and packaging facilities and purchase of tractors with
trawlers. The total cost of the subproject was estimated at D 1.7 million.
As of June 30, 1976, STIL's investments amounted to D 1.58 million, however,
the final figure was expected to reach and somewhat exceed the appraisal
estimate of D 1.71 million. Remaining expenses will cover levelling, soil
preparation, irrigation network of an additional 73 ha, construction of 7
small transit storage facilities and some planting of replacements on the
newly established plantations. The completed Project will therefore cover
a group of 9 plantations (some of them interconnected), of which 4 are sit-
uated in the Nefzaoua area (South of Chot Djerid) and 5 in the Djerid area
(North of the Chot).

APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
TUNISIA
Representative Models
Small Farms
1.        Models No. 1 through 4 (No. 1:  5 ha Fruit and Vegetable Farm, No.
2: 5 ha Vegetable-Livestock-Forrage Farm, No. 3: 10 ha Grain Farm, No. 4:
10 ha Mixed farming) are farms which would qualify under the new FOSDA regu-
lations for concessionary credit. Models 1 and 2 represent farms of 5 ha
located near Tunis or another larger urban center most likely in Northern
Tunisia. PreProject situation of both farms is similar: 2 ha of the farms
are left fallow, 1 ha is cultivated with fruit and vegetables, 2 ha are under
wheat. The existing well is shallow and available water is barely sufficient
for irrigation of 1 ha. Tractor services for ploughing are supplied by and
payable to SONAMO. Pre-Project family farm income is D 320, or D 53 per
capita.
2.        In Model 1 the farmer's investment would consist in deepening and
improving his well, in purchase of pipes for irrigation and in the purchase
of a cultivator. At full development he would cultivate 4 ha of fruit and
vegetables and one ha of alfalfa; all of his production would be sold. The
investment amounting to D 3,255, would be financed as follows: 70% BNT loan,
10% Government grant and 20% own contribution. The financial rate of return
of the investment would be over 50%, due both to the extension of irrigation
and to the much more intensive use of agriculture inputs. At full implementa-
tion (year 3), the net farm income (before loan repayment) would be D 2,185
or D 364 per farmer's family member.
3.        In Model 2 the farmer would complement same investments as in Model
I by the purchase of 10 crossbreed in-calf heifers, and the construction of
a stable. Produced fodder would be wholly used but would not be sufficient
to feed the livestock, so additional fodder would be purchased. The total
investment would amount to D 8,505 and would be financed as follows: BNT
loan 65%, Government grant 15%, and 20% farmer's own contribution. The fi-
nancial rate of return of the investment would be 30%. At full implementa-
tion (year 4), the net farm income (before loan repayment) would be D 2,109
or D 351 per farmer's family member.
4.        Model 3 represents a farm of 10 ha in the grain producing regions
of Tunisia with no possibility of irrigation. Before Project half of the
farm surface is left fallow, 1 ha is planted with olive trees and 4 ha cul-
tivated with grain. The farmer rents tractor and harvesting services from



ANNEX 5
Page 2
SONAMO. The pre-Project farm income is, at, D 87 extremely low and would not
sustain a family. The Project investment is limited to the purchase of two
draft animals and few basic agriculture implements. At full implementation,
1 ha of land would be cultivated under fodder crops to feed the draft animals.
The farmer would continue to rent harvesting services from SONAMO but would
not need to rent a tractor for ploughing. More intensive and timely use of
fertilizer and pesticides would be condition of success of the subproject.
The total investment would amount to D 1,470 and would be financed as follows:
65% BNT-loan, 15% Government grant and 20% farmers contribution. Financial
rate of return of the subproject would be 18%. At full implementation (year
3) the net farm income would be D 442 or D 74 per farmer's family member.
5.        Model 4 represents a 10 ha farm near Tunis or another large urban
center. Before Project 1 ha is cultivated with fruit and vegetables, 4 ha
with grain, I ha is planted with olives and 4 ha are left fallow. SONAI4O is
supplying tractor services. Pre-Project farm income would be D 382 (D 64
per farmer's family member). The investment would consist of well improve-
ments, purchase of a pump, extension of irrigation network, purchase of 10
in-calf heifers and 2 draft animals, and of the construction of a stable. At
full development the farmer would cultivate 2 ha with fruit and vegetables,
5 ha with irrigated alfalfa, he would maintain 1 ha under grain, I ha olive
grove, and seed legumes on the remaining 1 ha. Produced fodder would be
wholly used, but would not be sufficient to feed his livestock, so additional
forage and concentrate would be purchased. Intensive use of farm inputs
would be part of the Project. The total investment would amount to D 8,925
which would be financed as follows: 65% BNT loan, 15% Government grant and
20% borrowers contribution. Financial rate of return of the investment
would be 15%. At full implementation (year 4), the net farm income would be
D 1,577 (D 263 per farmer's family member).
Commercial Farms
6.        Models 5 and 6 are larger farms which would not qualify for con-
cessional credit. Model 5 represents a 100 ha farm without access to irrig-
ation. Before Project 25 ha are cultivated under wheat, 10 ha under legumes
and 15 ha under fodder. Net pre-Project farm income is D 1,870 (D 312 per
family member). The Project would consist of combining grain farming with
dairy farming. At full implementation, fodder would be cultivated on 40 ha,
wheat on 50 ha and legumes on 10 ha. Investment would consist in the pur-
chase of 10 in-calf heifers, the construction of a stable and of an ensilage
pit. The total investment cost would amount to D 8,925. BNT's loan would
cover 70% of the investment and the farmer would contribute 30%. The finan-
cial rate of return would be 28%. At full development (year 4), net farm
income would be D 5,940 (D 990 per farmer's family member).
7.        Model 6 represents a grain farm of 150 ha.  Before Project, 40 ha
are cultivated under wheat, 20 ha are cultivated under barley, 30 ha are



ANNEX 5
Page 3
an olive grove and 60 ha are left fallow. Harvesting and tractor services
are rented from SONAMO. Pre-Project farm income is D 2,256 (D 376 per family
member). The Project would essentially consist of mechanization in order to
cultivate the whole farm area and in order to dispense of SONAMO tractor
services. Investment would consist of the purchase of a tractor and of prin-
cipal agriculture machinery such as plough, seeder, cultivator and trailer.
At full implementation, 50 ha would be under wheat, 40 ha under barley, 30 ha
cultivated fallow, and 30 ha would remain under olives. The total investment
cost would amount to D 7,665 of which BNT loan would cover 70% and farmer's
contribution 30%. Financial rate of return of the subproject would be 34%. -
At full development (year 3), net farm income would be D 4,577 (D 763 per
farmer's family member).
Date Palm Plantations - Model 7
8.        The Project would finance investment in development of 4 date palm
plantations of between 50 and 75 ha each in the Djerid and/or Netfzaoua areas.
The Djerid wells, usually about 650m deep, present on average an,a,Iesian
yield of over 51 1/sec. By pumping the yield can nearly be doubled, and pro-
vides therefore ample supply of water for a plantation of 75 ha. In the
Nefzaoua area the underground water level is at about 200 m and th1- artesian
yields are around 30 1/sec. Thus with pumping, the economical size of planta-
tions is about 50 ha. The final surface of each plantation in both areas
will depend on the effective yields of the new wells. It is expected that
the SCMV investing in Plantation development would have about 50-75 members
(actual membership of the SCMVs now being formed) and one plantation of 75
members would therefore directly benefit some 450 people.
9.         Investment would be in deep well drilling, land leveling and devel-
opment, irrigation and drainage networks, purchase of a tractor and miscel-
laneous agricultural equipment, purchase of young palm trees and windbreakers
and, at the beginning of the cropping period (7th year), construction of a
pumping station and of a storage building. The maintenance of the plantation
during the unproductive period is also to be added to the investment cost.
The total investment for a plantation of 75 ha in the Djerid region (Model)
is estimated at D 263,300 (D 3,510 per ha). The financial rate of return
would be about 11%. Investment in plantations in the Nefzaoua area, due to
higher underground water level, would be lower (in absolute and also per ha
figures) and consequently have a higher rate of return. The expected net
income per farmer (Djerid plantation) family at full development (year 15)
would be D 1,504 or per family member D 250.
Olive Oil Mills - Model 8
10.       The Project would aim at diminishing the regional shortage in olive-
crushing capacity in the under-equipped governorates, partictilatly in the gov-
ernorates of Jendouba, Beja and Kasserine, by financing                  nt of 18
new olive oil mills each of 30 tons/day crushing capacity.           e  18 oil mills
would be in addition to the approximately 15 mills that will be financed (on



ANNEX 5
Page 4
the basis of the present rate of 6 to 8 units yearly) by the BNT from other
funds over the next 2 years.
11.       The establishment of oil mills near the plantations would reduce
transportation costs and losses. The modern equipment installed in the mills
would produce high-quality oil (with low acid content) which would bring
higher prices and would help to increase exports and diversify foreign markets.
The oil mills would have equipment of the discontinuous type for the tradition-
al sector (small order processing) or of the continuous type for those pro-
ducers who process their own output or purchase olive harvests. Each of the
oil mills would be provided with storage capacity (financed by ONH) necessary
to store 50%0 of the expected annual production i.e. about 150 tons.
12.       The investment cost per mill is estimated at D 99,700 of which BNT
loan would finance 63%, ONH loan 7% (67% of the cost of storage), and sub-
borrowers contribution 30%. Financial rate of return of the investment would
be about 29%.

Economic Rate of Return of the Project
1.        The economic rate of return was calculated by aggregating the rep-
resentative models as described in Annex 5 and adding costs for administering
the Project.
2.        The economic rate of return calculations are based on the following
assumptions:
(a)  Output Prices.  For wheat, barley, and beef the Bank's commod-
ity world price projections (in constant 1975 prices) were used
as basic data. The prices of milk and of livestock have been
projected to develop according to the beef price. The remain-
ing products have been priced at prevailing farmgate prices.
(b)  Input Prices.  Investment items have been priced at constant
end 1975 prices net of import duties and taxes.  Prices of
fertilizer and feed grains have been projected on the basis
of the development of the Bank's commodity world price esti-
mates. Prices of replacement cattle have been projected to
change according to the beef price. Other inputs have been
valued at end 1975 farmgate prices, adjusted by taxes where
applicable.
(c)  Labor.  Family labor has been costed at 50% of operating
expenses because some employment opportunities for family
labor are available. Hired labor has been valued at the
prevailing wage rates.
(d)  Olive Oil Mills Benefits.  Calculation of benefits from
olive oil mill investments has been based on the value
added by processing the olives into oil. Price series in-
dicate a strong correlation between the price of olives
and the price of olive oil; in the absence of projections
of olive oil prices, financial prices have been used.
(e)  Administrative Costs.  Costs have been based on salaries of
additional staff to be hired by BNT.
(f) Exchange Rate. The exchange of $2.40 per D 1 has been used
for all calculations.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
3.        Based on these assumptions, the project benefits and costs have
been calculated as shown in the attached table. The Project's economic rate
of return would be about 34%. The sensitivity analysis shows the following
results:
Investment Costs                +10%:        29%
Operating Costs                 +10%:        29%
Benefits                        -10%         23%
4.        The economic rate of return indicates that the Project would result
in substantial gains to the economy.
