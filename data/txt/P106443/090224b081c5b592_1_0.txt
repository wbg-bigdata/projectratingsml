                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress towards achieving the Project Development Objectives remains satisfactory and achievable. There is substantial progress in improving access at the elementary level , with
                         a high net enrolment rate of 97.3%. Secondary net enrolment rate have also increased from 61.26% in the previous period to 64.8%, almost reaching its end of project target. In
                         terms of quality, there were improvements vis-a-vis secondary cohort survival and secondary completion rates. Most of the targets vis-a-vis the intermediate indicators have been
                         achieved which will contribute to the achievement of the PDO indicators. Disbursement levels remain a challenge and will be closely monitored and followed-up on during the
                         extension period.

                         Delays were encountered in the implementation of civil works and the procurement of furniture and equipment. The Department of Education (DepEd) is thus requesting a 6-month
                         extension of the project (ie from May 31 to November 30, 2013) to complete these, particularly the construction of classrooms and Learning Resource Management and
                         Development Centers (LRMDCs) and the associated furniture and ICT equipment.
