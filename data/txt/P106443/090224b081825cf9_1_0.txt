                         Implementation Status Overview
                         DepEd is requesting a 5-month extension for the project due to: (i) delays in release of "authority to spend" from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), (ii) delays in
                         finalizing the design of the quality assurance assistance to the field offices; and (iii) the intention to utilize foreign exchange gains for additional classroom construction. To expedite
                         the extension approval process, DepEd recently submitted two project covenants: (i) the independent validation of School Based Management (SBM) grants; and (ii) the submission
                         of the internal audit report for the project. In addition to classroom construction, the project has also made good progress in terms of quality, with secondary cohort survival,
