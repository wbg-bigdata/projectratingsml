(Loan 2289-TUN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report describes the preparation, appraisal, and
implementation of the Sfax Flood Protection Project in Tunisia, for which Loan
2289-TUN in the amount of USD 25 million was signed on June 16, 1983.   The
project became effective on June 8, 1984 and was closed, as originally planned,
on June 30, 1989.   The loan account remained open until January 17, 1990.
Ultimately, USD 22.3 million were disbursed and USD 2.7 million cancelled.
The Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared
by the Infrastructure Operations Division, Countty Department II, of the Europe,
Middle East and North Africa Regional Office on the basis of, inter alia,
preparation documents, the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project
Agreements, supervision reports, consultants' reports, and quarterly progress
reports.

SFAX FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECT
(Loan 2289-TUN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiect Objectives and ImRlementation. bxuerience
1.         The main objective of the disaster relief project was to minimize the
flood damage potential in Greater Sfa:c by: (a) reducing the risk of loss of life
from floods; (b) providing the population with a greater sense of security;
protecting public and private property; (c) reducing production losses; and (d)
ensuring permanent and efficient maintenance of flood protection infrastructure.
2.         The project consisted of the following physical components:
(a)   rehabilitation of the water course of Oued Ezzit on the northern side
of Sfax;
(b)   rehabilitation and extension of the existing dikes along Oued Maou and
Oued Khalifa on the southern side of Sfax;
(c)   construction of an eight-km long belt canal at about four km from the
city center;
(d)   minor flood protection works in neighboring villages;
(e)   provision of equipment to maintain the flood control facilities; and
(f)   staffing, equipping, and operation of a special Flood Protection
Section within the Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Equipment
in Sfax to be responsible for maintenance and repairs of flood
protection works.
3.         Civil works were generally completed on time according to the original
plans and schedule.   Occasional minor delays were due mainly to the need to
modify highway, railway, and public utility infrastructure along the belt canal
site.   A two-year delay in the issuance of import licenses for maintenance
equipment financed under the project resulted in an 80% price increase for this
equipment.
Results
4.         The project fulfilled its objectives by offering adequate flood
protection.   A renewed sense of security spurred economic development in the
Greater Sfax area, particularly near project sites.

Susetainabil itY
5.         The implementing agency, the Urban Hydraulics Directorate (DHU) of the
Ministry of Equipment, is well aware that sustainability of the flood protection
works is contingent upon systematic routine maintenance performed by a fully
equipped maintenance unit with an appropriate annual operational budget in Sfax.
However maintaining the above budget may well be endangered by the absence of
cost recovery mechanisms which were not addressed through the Sfax Flood
Protection Loan.
Findings and Lessons
6.         The smooth implementation of the flood protection project illustrates
the benefits derived from Bank-Borrower collaboration over a series of related
lending operations in the sewerage subsector.   Relations between Tunisian
authorities and the Bank coatinued to develop in an atmosphere of mutual
confidence  that  ensured  (a)  adequate  project  preparation,  (b)  smooth
implementation, and (c) the ul'--mate success of the project. The decentralized
project m-n-agem-it structure in Sfax under DHU leadership, with assistance from
competent foreign consultants, allowed for effective and quick decision-making
throughout the projec. cycle.   Clearly, D1'U set the tone for a harmonious
working relationship involving different levels within the Tunisian Government
hierarchy, the local population and administrations, contractors, and the Bank.
7.         The Sfax Flood Protection Project is a noteworthy example of a Bank
operation that has been relatively problem-free. This is largely the result of
well prepared detailed engineering and design work, capable contract management,
and successful implementation by highly competent project managers who made
effective use of consultants.
8.         Because storm drainage works in Tunisia were inadequately maintained
and the build-up of debris in the drainage systems often became a source of
unsanitary urban conditions, the Bank insisted on a firm commitment from the
Government to keep the proposed canals clean. In the future, the Bank should
consider financing more flood protection works on the condition that the
Government is committed to the project, takes measures to improve cost recovery
for flood protection works, operation and maintenance, thus ensuring its
sustainability.   It is, therefore, recommended that an impact evaluation be
conducted within five years of project completion to reaffirm the sustainability
of flood protection.

II. BACKGROUND
2.01       Greater Sfax, Tunisia's second largest urban center, had a population
of about 313,000 in 1982.  In October of that year, severe flooding due to
exceptionally heavy rainfall caused considerable damage to Sfax and its suburbs.
A survey carried out after the 1982 flood assessed economic losses at about TND
50 million (USD 80 million). In addition, at least 70 lives were lost, abmut
700 houses destroyed, and another 8,000 houses damaged along with streets, roaas,
bridges, railways, power supply lines, and telecommunication equipment.
2.02       Although thie severity of the 1982 rainfall had an estimated recurrence
of 130 years, Sfax suffered frequent damages from flooding and experienced, more
or less, severe floods in 1934, 1942, 1950, 1957, 1969, and 1973. The need for
providing adequate flood protection contrrl measures had long been recognized.
In the 1.950s and 1960s, protective meastres were studied by various consulting
firms and some flood protection was provided through diversion of the Oued
Khalifa and construction of dikes along this waterway and the Oued Maou. In 1977
and 1978, a foreign consulting firn prepared a sewerage and storm water drainage
master plan proposing a belt canal around the city's perimeter with a number of
storm drainage collectors placed in a '-adial pattern outside the canal.  The
northern section of this canal would drein storm water arourd the city's
perimeter directly into the sea, the southern aection would empty intc the Oued
Maou.   As  financing was unavailable at that time,  the project was not
implemented.  However, immediately after the 1982 flood in November of that
year, the Government requested Bank assistance in the financing of a flood
protection project that would rehabilitate and extend flood protection works 'or
the city.
III. PROJECT QBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.01       The main objective of the project was to minimize the flood damage
potential in Sfax and suburbs by:



-2-
reducing health hazards and the risk of loss of life of the local
population;
providing the population w:th safety measures;
protecting public and private property;
reducing industrial produoction losses; and
ensuring permanent arnd efficient maintenance of flood protection
infrastructure.
3.02       The project supported the following physical components:
(a)   rehabilitation of the water course of Oued Ezzit on the northern side
of Sfax;
(b)   rehabilitation and extension of the existing dikes along Oued Maou and
Oued Khalifa on the southern side of Sfax;
(c)   construction of an eight-km long belt canal at about four km from the
city center;
(d)   minor flood protection works in neighboring villages;
(e)   provision of equipment to maintain the flood control facilities; and
(f)   staffing,  equipping, and operation of a special Flood Protection
Section within the Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Equipment
in Sfax to be responsible for maintenance and repairs of flood
protection works.
IV. PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
4.01       In an urgent effort to rehabilitate the damaged dikes before the i983
rains, the Government engaged a consortium of external and Tunisian consulting
firms to prepare a feasibility study.  In January 1983, with Bank assistance,
a team of 14 highly qualified specialists, completed the study. The study, which
made use of 100-year series of hydrological data, updated the 1978 master plan
and provided the basis for detailed design and for project appraisal.
4.02       The concept of digging a belt canal as a barrier against flooding
together with the construction of storm water drainage systems was innovative
for Tunisia.  The project was designed in such a way as to minimize operating
costs. Owing to good feasibility studies and competent local management, project
preparation was accomplished in a timely manner and detailed design and bidding
documents were available at loan effectiveness. The aspect of project design



and organization that contribated the most to the project's success and eventual
sustainability was provision, at the preparatory stage, for adequate management
structure, assisted by consultants, and budget provision for the maintenance of
works.
4.03       A Bank loan of USD 20 million was originally proposed to cover the
entire  foreign  exchange  cost.   A  recalculation  of project  costs  during
negotiations in April 1983, revealed a probable foreign exchange component of
USD 27.7 million because civil works would be more equipment-intensive than
originally envisaged. Subsequently, the Tunisian delegation requested and the
Bank agreed that the loan would be increased to USD 25 million. The Government
then agreed to cover the remaining foreign exchange cost and full local cost,
either from Government contribution or partially from a loan it was seeking froLl
the African Development Bank (AfDB).   Subsequent negotiations between the
Government and AfDB failed, and the Government, itself, ended up having to cover
the eventual shortfall in external financing.
4.04       The construction of three main storm water drains needed to collect
and remove storm wacer from the impluvium of the inner city had already been
provided for in the ongoing Second Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1675-TUN).
Construction was delayed because of insufficient local funding.   Since these
main storm water drains formed an integral part of the proposed flood protection
system, they were included in the cost and benefit streams used in calculating
the project's internal rate of return (IRR). Moreover, contract award for their
construction was made a condition of loan effectiveness.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Ci'iil Works
5. 01      Civil works were generally completed according to the original
schedule. Occasional minor delays were mainly due to the need to modify highway,
iailway, and public utility infrastructure along the belt canal site. Four major
cont-acts were awarded through international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with Bank guidelines, as follows:
Lot 1: construction of minor flood works in the neighboring towns
of Jebeniana, El Amra, and Sidi Mansour;
Lot 2:  construction of belt canal and dikes along the Oued Khalifa;
Lot 3:  rehabilitation of Oued Ezzit; and
Lot 4:  rehabilitation and extension of existing dikes along the Oued
Maou.

krocMumef  of Ecuipment
5.02       In 1984, two contracts, one for trucks and the other for maintenance
equipment, were awarded, through ICB, to local suppliers and approved ov the
National Tender Board (CSM). Hiowever, a two-year delay in the issuance of import
licenses resulted in an 80% price increase for this equipment.
VI. MAJOR PROJECT RESULTS
Project Objectives
6.01       Recent heavy rainis (January 1990) provided clear evidence that project
objectives had been attained.   The project area was spared the extensive damage
caused by floods elsewhere in central and southern Tunisia.
Proiect Costs
6.02       Based on detailed design, the estimated project cost was USD 48.0
million, of which about USD 35.0 million were allocated to civil works and USD
13.0 million for equipment, 0 & M, and consultants' services. About USD 27.8
million represented foreign exchange.   Actual project costs reached US$40.33
million, with a 16% cost underrun. Civil works exceeded appraisal estimatvs by
only 4% but with additional, unanticipated infrastructure works er.t!ailing the
relocation of elec ric, water supply, sewerage, and railway lines (USD 2.9
million).   A comparison of actual and projected economic costs shows that
Lnflation was much lower than envisaged at appraisal, despite a steady
depreciation of the Tunisian dinar in relation to the US dollar from TND 0.63
in 1983 to TND 0.93 in 1989.  The other components were significantly below
appraisal estimates. Land acquisition and relocation costs were far lower than
estimated at appraisal. Maintenance equipment was not needed for 0 & M until
after completion of civil works, since the contractors themselves performed
maintenance during the implementation phase. Finally, the competent performance
of both DHU staff and the consultants sharply reduced the amount of time normally
needed for consultants' services in a project of this scope.
Disbursements
6.03       Disbursement  was  very  slow  during  the  first  two  years  of
implementation. It accelerated in 1986 reaching 90% of appraisal estimates b½
mid-1988.
Economic Reevaluation
6.04       Considering the topographic and urban characteristics of Greater
Sfax, an intercepting canal between the outside impluvium and the agglomeration
to be protected was the most logical solution. The flood nf 1982 together with
several previous ones were analyzed and a relationship established between flood
frequency and the estimated damage values (in 1983 prices) caused by these
floods. During appraisal, the same computation was repeated with the proposed
investment in place to determine the residual damage values and probable annual
averted damages.   For future years, it was assumed that these benefits would



increase as a result of population and GNP growth in the project area, estimated
at about 3X and 2% p.a. and would contribute to an IRR of 18%,
6.05       The project spurred regional economic development, particularly in the
urban areas along the Oued Ezzit, and contributed significantly to a growing
sense of security among local residents.   Land values in the corridors most
affected by flooding rose multifold (i.e., two to three times). A conserv'ative
ex-post economic evaluation of the project showed an IRR of 23%, confirming the
economic viability of the project. This assessment was based on the assumption
that somewhat higher residual damage values, based on population and GNP growth,
can be expected to be attained at about an economic cost for infrastructure and
maintenance similar to the one originally forecast.
Environmental Impact
6.06       The project had a positive impact on the environment.  In addition to
providing the necessary infrastructure to contain flood waters and reduce
erosion, it reduced potential health hazards by preventing the overflow of
liquid and solid wastes in flooded areas and by draining stagnant bodies of
water. Moreover, there was no known adverse environmental impact in terms of
land use, expropriation, resettlement, or any other ecological or sociological
aspect.   In fact, DHU makes a special effort to mitigate disturbances and
inconveniences to the local population and provides adequate maintenance and
cleanup to ensure prevention of potential health hazards by discharge of solid
and liquid waste in the canals.
VII. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
7.01       DHU is well aware that sustainability of the flood protection works
is contingent upon systematic routine maintenance and cleanup of the canals
performed by a fully equipped maintenance unit with an appropriate operational
budget in Sfax.
VIII. BANK 'S PERFORMANCE
8.01       The Bank concurs with the Borrower's view that the Bank played a
constructive role, which benefitted not only the public works sector but also
the country as a whole (Part II, para. 5).



- 6 -
IX. BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
Main Strengths
9.01       DHU  competently  managed project  implementation,  as  supervision
missions consistently assigned ratings of "1" to all categories of implementation
performance. However, that rating does not reveal enough about:
(a)   the clear role definition under DHU's leadership that allowed for
effective and quick decision making throughout the project Cyc-le and
harmonious working relationships among different levels within the
Tunisian Government hierarchy, local administrations, contractors,
consultants and the Bank;
(b)   DHU's initiative in organizing, staffing, equipping, and placing into
operation a special Flood Protection Section within the Regional
Directorate of the Ministry of Equipment in Sfax responsible for
implementation, maintenance, and repair of flood protection works;
and
(c) effective use of competent foreign consultants to help negotiate and
arbitrate disputes between central and local authorities.
main Weaknesses
9.02       The main obstacle to project implementation was the distance between
the capital and Sfax (350 km). As a result, DHU was not always able to maintain
the lines of communication necessary to solve problems as they arose at the work
site.   Moreover, funds to perform adequate routine maintenance of the flood
protection works once they were completed were only provided through the
intervention of Bank supervision missions.
9.03       Submission of annual audits of project accounts, which were of very
good quality, was consistently late and on a biennial rather than the annual
basis stipulated in the Loan Agresment (Part III, Table 7). Late compliance with
audit covenants is a generalized problem in Tunisia affecting most project
entities audited by the Controller General of Finance, a central Government
agency.
X. RELATIONS BETWEEN THE BANK AND THE BORROWER
10.01      The Bank and the Tunisian Government have collaborated on a series
of lending operations in the water supply and sewerage sector. Under the Sfax
Flood Protection Project, relations continued to develop in an atmosphere of
mutual confidence that ensured the srmooth implementation and success of the
project.



-~~~~~~~7
XI. CONSULTANTS' SERVICES
11.01     Consultants' services for detailed engineering, works supervision, and
the operations and maintenance study were highly satisfactory. Experts actively
participated in discussions between central and local authorities and used their
technical expertise effectively to influence decision making. They responded
punctually to all of DHU requests.
XII. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
12.01     DHU continually used the staff appraisal report not only as a reference
tool during project implementation but also, in its dialogue with local
administrations, as an instrument to underscore the importance of completing the
project as planned.

PART II: THE PROJECT FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Introduction
1.        The floods in the area surrounding Sfax on October 30 and 31, 1982,
brought on by exceptionally heavy rain, caused considerable death (loss of about
70 lives) and destruction (estimated at 1982 constant TD 47.7 million). In the
aftermath, the Government sought to protect the city of Sfax and its suburbs
from future flooding of that magnitude and requested financial assistance from
the World Bank.
Project Design
2.        The flood protection project was designed to protect the region's
economic infrastructure together with the lives and property of the local
population. When it was proposed, it immediately gained broad popular support.
There was only limited opposition, early in the project cycle, from individuals
and groups who feared that their private interests might be adversely affected.
But this opposition was insufficient to deter or delay project preparation.
Project Implementation
3.        After feasibility studies were carried out and World Bank financing
secured, the project got unde.way without difficulty. Civil works contracts were
awarded to three local firms and one foreign one. They were completed generally
within the agreed timeframe and in accordance with engineering design. Works
also included some improvements requested by the Regional Directorate of the
Ministry of Equipment (DRME) and municipal authorities following a dispute over
the dimensions of the belt canal and bypass routes.  Land expropriation took
place without any difficulty. Modifications to public utilities and services
were made with minimal disruption. An operation and maincenancs service was
established in April 1988.
4.        Delays in works execution were due mainly to administrative bottlenecks
resulting from the necessity to modify infrastructure, particularly water supply
and sewerage networks, which had to be raised to above ground at three different
points. In addition, unforeseen changes had to be made to railway lines. The
line towards Gabes had to be moved and three railway crossings along the belt
canal had to be built.
The Bank's Performance
5.        The Bank played a positive role, which benefitted not only the public
works sector but also the country as a whole.  It responded favorably to the
project proposal, supported the feasibility and technical studies, readily
processed and granted the loan, took initiatives towards obtaining the required
budgetary appropriation for maintenance, and provided useful advice during
supervision of the civil works and maintenance organization.



- 10 -
DHU's Performance
6.        Feasibility and Detailed Design Studies.  The studies could have been
implemented entirely by a Tunisian firm. However, DHU decided to use a foreign
firm to guarantee impartiality in reaching conclusions that could have an impact,
both positive and negative, on a significant number of institutions, groups, and
individuals.
7.        Maintenance Organization.  This was the first time Tunisia undertook
flood protection works of such a large scale.  The beneficiaries were citizens
and institutions at the local level. DHU's decision to establish a local flood
protection unit provided a permanent liaison between central and local
authorities.
8.        Additional Infrastructure.  At in early implementation stage, DRME drew
attention to the necessity to relocate utility and railroad lines, which
mitigated an unforeseen delay.   It was also instrumental in settling various
disputes over technical alternatives.
9.        Works Supervision.  The services of the consulting firm that carried
out the technical studies were used regularly during implementation for the sake
of continuity as well as to act as an impartial third party in negotiating
solutions to disputes between the central and local authorities.
ImRact
10.       The flood protection project has changed the landscape of the Greater
Sfax. In essence, new crossroads (Sakiet Ezzit and Sakiet Eddaier) have been
built, new roads along the banks of canals converge on other paved (and unpaved)
public ways, and improvements have been made to the facades of buildings that
now face asphalt roads and brick walls rather than dry river beds in need of
rehabilitation. The inhabitants' sense of security has encouraged the building
of new industrial plants, as well as commercial and residential buildings, in
areas previously considered to be unsafe.   In Sakiet Ezzit, a new supermarker,
retail shops,  and professional offices have opened in recent years.   The
Poudriere district, which had been entirely abandoned, has now become an
industrial zone. Three new factories and many garages have been set up there.
Moreover, the effectiveness of the works in relation to the drainage of storm
water has already been tested by heavy rains. The floods of January 1990 caused
considerable damage to many parts of central and southern Tunisia but not to the
project area. This fact has been widely acknowledged by both the press and the
local inhabitants.
