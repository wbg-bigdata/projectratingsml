I. COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND HURRICANE MITCH
A.   Background
1.    Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Latin America and Caribbean
Region, with income per capita of $410 in 1997, over half of its population in poverty,
one fifth in extreme poverty and weak social indicators. The Nicaraguan highlands cross
the country from the northwest to the southeast, with several mountain ranges cutting the
highlands from east to west. A chain of volcanoes, which contribute to earthquake
activity, rises between the Nicaragua and Managua Lakes and the Pacific coast. The four
principal rivers (San Juan, Coco, Grande and Escondido), empty into the Caribbean.
Like its neighbors in Central America, Nicaragua is prone to national disasters, especially
hurricanes and earthquakes. The most recent natural disaster that caused extensive
damage was the earthquake that hit Managua in 1972.
2.    On October 24, Tropical Storm Mitch was upgraded to a hurricane that quickly
developed into one of the strongest and most damaging storms to ever hit Central
America. At its height on October 26 and 27, Hurricane Mitch sustained winds of 290
kph and dumped heavy rains over Central America. Although the winds diminished as
the hurricane traveled inland over Honduras on October 30, the storm continued to
produce torrential rains. Mitch inflicted its greatest damage in Nicaragua through severe
rains that caused extensive flooding and landslides.  The northwestern corner of
Nicaragua bore the brunt of the storm and a side of the Casitas Volcano collapsed causing
a massive mudslide that buried ten communities at its base.
B.   Hurricane Damage
3.    The areas of Nicaragua most severely affected by the hurricane were the northern
and northwestern parts of the country, comprising the Departments of Le6n, Chinandega,
Esteli, Nueva Segovia, Madriz, Matagalpa and Jinotega, and along the Rio Coco in the
North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN). Severe damage also occurred along the
Rio Grande de Matagalpa in the South Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAS), and some
parts of Managua Department fronting the lake. Preliminary estimates indicate that about
870,000 people were affected (or almost one in five Nicaraguans), of which 45 percent
are children. According to the poverty maps prepared by the Social Investment Fund, of
the 58 poorest municipalities in Nicaragua, 40 are located in the hardest hit departments.
The departments in the Pacific and Central Regions with the most damage include the
coffee-growing heartland, and in the Pacific region, they coincide with the former cotton-
growing areas, which are characterized by extreme levels of deforestation and soil
depletion. Prolonged exposure to heavy rains renders the denuded hillsides especially
prone to mudslides-as witnessed most terrifyingly on the slopes of the Casitas Volcano
on the morning of October 30, when eleven communities were buried by a mudiside.
Numerous roads were washed out and bridges destroyed, including significant portions of
the Pan-American Highway, which is Nicaragua's main trunk road and connection to
neighboring countries. There were direct and indirect impacts on fishing, cattle ranching,
manufacturing, tourism, commerce and service industries. Another tragic effect of the



-2 -
mudslides and floods is the washing away of land mines to undetermined areas, posing a
serious risk to people living in those areas.
4.    The Atlantic Coast also suffered from Hurricane Mitch, although the pattern of
damage was different.  About 38,000 people were affected and the damage to
infrastructure, except for housing, was comparatively light, in part because the region has
so little infrastructure compared to the rest of the country. The damage to crops,
however, is large since cultivation mainly takes place around the edge of rivers.
5.    Estimates of the damage are being prepared by teams of Government, donors and
UINTDP/ECLAC. Preliminary damage assessments are presented below:
*  The Human Cost. Preliminary estimates indicate that about 2,870 people died, 950
were reported missing and 390 injured. As a direct result of the hurricane, an
estimated 65,300 people were placed in temporary shelters, and 370,600 were
evacuated. People in the affected areas are also suffering psychologically due to the
loss of family members and social disruptions.
o  Transport.  Immediately after the storm, about 70 percent of Nicaragua's road
network was considered impassable. Several key trunk road connections (at Tipitapa,
Sebaco, Izapa, Guasaule and Ocotal) were completely cut off, paralyzing transport
and communications.  Preliminary estimates indicate that two bridges were
completely destroyed, 49 damaged, and 26 cut off. About 1,500 km of paved roads
and 6,500 km of unpaved roads were damaged to some extent and many small
villages, particularly in the north-central and northeastern part of the country,
remained cut off for over a month after the hurricane.
*  Water.  The water supply and sewerage systems, including 9 water works for
capturing superficial runoff, more than 33 km of water pipes, and 37,200 latrines
were damaged. About 288,600 houses were affected, and 79 potable water systems
and 9 sewer systems were damaged.
*  Energy and Telecommunications. Generation, transmission and distribution systems
were damaged, including 2 hydroelectric facilities, 10 transmission lines, and 381 km
of distribution lines. Substantial telecommunications infrastructure was also affected.
*  Education. Preliminary estimates from the Ministry of Education show that 315
primary schools were damaged and 255 are being used as temporary shelters. There
was also damage to school materials and books.
*  Health. Seven health centers and 250 health posts suffered major damage, with most
of the damage to facilities and equipment. Unsanitary conditions and the lack of safe
water are placing many people at risk of transmitted diseases such as dengue and
cholera.



-3 -
*  Housing.  ECLAC estimates that about 369,000 people lost their homes, between
32,000 and 50,000 houses were destroyed, 112,600 were damaged, and 94,500
suffered minor damage.
*  Agriculture. The hurricane affected some of the most fertile areas of Nicaragua. A
large proportion of basic grains production was lost, severely impacting poor, small-
scale farmers. Other products also suffered extensive damage or their access to
markets was affected, including bananas, coffee, corn, sorghum, beans and shrimp.
*  Environment. Direct impacts on the environment from the storm include the loss of
fertile soil, mainly around watersheds, due to erosion, landslides and flooding around
river beds. Water was also contaminated due to toxins and agro-chemicals, overflows
of sewers and latrines, and decomposition of dead animals. The coastal zones have
been affected by flows from contaminated rivers, and there has been damage to stands
of trees and losses in reforested areas resulting in loss of habitat and biodiversity.
6.     Preliminary Estimates of Damage and Replacement Costs.  A preliminary
estimate prepared by UNDP and ECLAC (Table 1) suggests total direct and indirect
damage of $900 million (equivalent to 45 percent of Nicaragua's 1997 GDP). The costs
of replacing the damage to infrastructure and the productive sectors would amount to
$1.2 billion.

C.    Response to the Hurricane
7.     In responding to the hurricane emergency, the Government created a National
Emergency Committee (NEC) to coordinate relief efforts and assess damages,
particularly in terms of rescue efforts and emergency assistance to areas affected by



-4 -
mudslides and other isolated communities. Customs warehouses in Managua were used
to store incoming relief supplies and the private sector lent refrigerated facilities to store
perishables. NEC and Government teams worked with the UN system, the Red Cross
and emergency response teams from IDA and other donors to determine priorities,
channel immediate support and coordinate international assistance. The Government also
put in place mechanisms to provide food and emergency health care to thousands of
people in approximately 200 shelters, much of this with help from relief agencies, other
governments, and the private sector. In terms of transport infrastructure, the Pan-
American Highway and other key routes were reopened within a week using temporary
solutions (such as Bailey bridges). The Government is implementing a vaccination
carnpaign and working with the Pan-American Health Organization to rehabilitate basic
health services and implement a vector control program. As emergency needs subsided,
NEC was disbanded and the Governrnent set up six Sector Reconstruction Commissions
(Social, Cooperation and Finance, Infrastructure, Production and Services, Environment,
and Civil Society) to coordinate the longer-term reconstruction effort. The Commissions
are chaired by Government representatives, and also include representatives of political
parties and community members.
8.    The international community responded swiftly to the disaster.  The initial
response, especially relying on the UN system and the emergency response capability of
a number of countries, focused on rescuing communities, re-establishing communications
and transport links, distributing emergency food and medicines to affected communities,
and organizing shelters for displaced populations. IDA staff on the ground in Nicaragua
moved quickly to help the Government coordinate with other donors and conduct a
preliminary damage assessment. IDA also reallocated funds and restructured existing
operations, and quickly disbursed the second tranche of the Financial Sector Adjustment
Credit ($15 million), which provided balance of payments support.
II. ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HURRICANE MITCH
A.   Macroeconomic Framework Prior to the Hurricane
9.    Following a period of stagnation in the early 1990s, Nicaragua's economy had
been growing at a steady pace since 1994 and was heading toward a GDP growth rate of
around 6 percent in 1998 (Table 2). Unemployment had declined from over 20 percent in
1994 to less than 14 percent in 1997, while the annual inflation rate remained steady in
the neighborhood of 10 percent since 1994.  These positive developments were
underpinned by an ESAF agreement reached with the IMF in March 1998. The
macroeconomic mainstay of the ESAF arrangement was the fiscal adjustment program,
designed to reduce the overall public sector deficit (before grants) from almost 16 percent
of GDP in 1996 to 4 percent in 2000. The reduction in the fiscal deficit, in turn, was to
permit a rise in public savings from less than 2 percent of GDP in 1996 to 8 percent in
2000, thereby rendering the country's future growth less dependent of foreign savings.



- 5 -
10.   The ESAF arrangement is a key element of the HIPC process, for which
Nicaragua is eligible on the grounds of its low income level and extremely high external
debt burden. Until October 1998, the macroeconomic and structural reform program had
been on track, so that the decision point under the HIPC was tentatively envisioned for
late 1999. Following the passage of major fiscal reforms, the public sector deficit was
reduced to less than 10 percent of GDP in 1997 and was projected to drop to under 6
percent in 1998. Also, the current account deficit declined from 53 percent of GDP in
1994 to 32 percent in 1997, mainly due to the rapid expansion of non-traditional exports,
which grew at annual rates averaging 20 percent in both dollar and volume terms over the
last three years.
11.   Nicaragua's rapid economic recovery was accompanied by a resurgence of private
sector confidence, reflected in a more than doubling of private investment, from 7 percent
of GDP in 1994 to an estimated 17.5 percent in 1997. The rapid increase in private
investment levels, in turn, was accompanied by a modest decline in public investment,
reflecting the Government's commitment to private sector-led growth. Over the last six
years, Nicaragua had made significant progress in transforming itself from a centralized,
publicly managed to a private sector-owned economy through the divestiture of around
350 state-owned enterprises since 1991 and the closure of the largest state bank
(BANADES) in early 1998. Preparations are also well underway to privatize the second
largest public bank (BANIC), with IFC support, by early 1999 and the state
telecommunications company (ENITEL), by April 1999. Other reforms supported by
IDA include measures to strengthen the regulation and prudential supervision of the
financial system, improve the legal framework for private investment, downsize and
streamline the public sector while building up institutional capacity, and improve the
state's capacity to deliver social services.

B.    Economic Impact
12.   The assessment of damage to the economy are still being refined. Since the
damage occurred fairly late in the year, only part will be reflected in the macroeconomic
indicators for 1998, and much will be shifted to 1999. These will be some slowdown of
economic growth due to the loss of crops and indirect damages in the form of reduced



-6 -
economic activity resulting from production bottlenecks arising from the damages to
infrastructure and other capital goods losses. These negative indirect effects are expected
to carry through into 1999, and will be partially offset by intensified reconstruction
activities, financed through additional foreign inflows from official and private sources.
The loss of domestic goods not easily replaced by imports also is expected to place
upward pressure on prices, so that inflation is expected to rise to 17 percent in 1998,
falling to 15 percent in 1999, compared with about 9 percent a year envisaged before the
hurricane.
13.   Preliminary 1998 estimates suggest that the hurricane would result in realtively
minor fiscal slippages compared to pre-hurricane projections. The 1998 combined public
sector savings would be about one percentage point, of GDP lower after the hurricane,
while the combined public sector balance (before grants) would increase by 1.5
percentage points of GDP to 6.7 percent in 1998. For 1999, the pre-hurricane scenario
had envisaged that the overall deficit would narrow to 6.1 percent of GDP. However, the
Government is discussing with the Fund, possible adjustments to the fiscal program
because of the needs associated with the reconstruction effort and additional social
expenditures.
14.   Permanent damage to the main export crop, coffee, was relatively light (less than
10 percent of production area was affected), but more extensive for bananas and sugar.
The heaviest damage occurred in the basic grains sector, which threatens to lead to food
shortages in isolated areas, and particularly affects small, subsistence farrners. There will
also be higher import levels associated with disaster relief, food imports and
reconstruction needs. As a result, preliminary estimates indicate that the current account
deficit could widen by about $60 million in 1998 (about 3 percent of GDP) and about
$200 million in 1999, compared with pre-hurricane projections. The current account
deficit would widen to 31.2 percent of GDP in 1998 (compared to 28.3 percent estimated
prior to Mitch) and 31.9 percent of GDP in 1999 (compared to 24.0 estimated prior to
Mitch). Rough estimates indicate a financing gap of about $150 million in 1999 (about 6
percent of GDP). The Government expects to fill the 1999 financing gap through the
reprogramming of credits (mainly from IDA and IDB), disbursements of new grants and
credits, emergency balance of payments support from IDA, a proposed augmentation in
the ESAF, and further debt relief, including disbursements under the recently-established
CAETF. reconstruction expenditures, and lower tax revenues in the wake of reduced
economic activity.
C. Government Measures
15.   The Government is taking steps to limit the macroeconomic effects of the
disaster, and set the stage for economic recovery. The Government has reiterated its
commitment to the policies and objectives of the economic program supported by the
current ESAF arrangement. Within this framework, the authorities are intensifying their
efforts to help finance part of the additional reconstruction and social programs through
expenditure and revenue measures. On the revenue side, the Government recently
submitted to the Assembly a reform to the tax system raising excises on cigarettes, liquor,



- 7 -
and soft drinks, and is continuing efforts to improve tax administration.  On the
expenditure side, the Government plans to pursue efforts aimed at shifting resources from
lower priority areas to the reconstruction effort. In the structural reform area, the focus
will be on privatization, strengthening of the financial system, reform of the social
security system, and the strengthening of governance.
III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
A.   IDA Strategy
16.   The proposed Hurricane Emergency Project is consistent with the goal of
maintaining macroeconomic stability in the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Nicaragua. The proposed Project is a key element of the three-part strategy to
assist Nicaragua respond to this natural disaster. The three-part strategy involves:
Emergency Financing, Macroeconom;- Assistance and Debt Relief.   The
Government has an urgent need for emergency financing to cover additional import
needs generated by the emergency, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The
proposed fast-track Hurricane Emergency Project (HEP) would help to meet this
immediate need. It complements actions by IDA in the two weeks following the
hurricane to release the second tranche of the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (all
conditions were met satisfactorily), which provided balance of payments support at a
critical juncture.  IDA staff have also been collaborating with the IMF on a
preliminary reassessment of Nicaragua" macroeconomic situation. Finally, at the
request of several governments, IDA has established a Central America Emergency
Trust Fund (CAETF) to which donor contributions are being channeled to support
hurricane-affected countries in Central America cover multilateral debt service
payments. As soon as conditions permit, IDA and the IMF, in consultation with the
IDB, will carry out a comprehensive debt sustainability analysis, as an input to
determining the appropriate timing for Niearagua's decision point under the HIPC.
* Short- to Medium-Term Rehabilitation. IDA staff are working with counterpart
Government agencies and other development partners to reprogram IDA operations
and/or process supplemental financing to provide for urgent rehabilitation of damaged
social and economic infrastructure. In view of the extent of the damage and the need
for quick support, IDA staff believe that reprogramming of the existing portfolio-as
opposed to designing a new, multi-sector hurricane rehabilitation project-is the
fastest and most flexible way to meet Nicaragua's short and medium-term
rehabilitation needs, given that speed is of the essence. Based on preliminary damage
estimates, we anticipate that 7 of the 10 ongoing IDA operations would be
restructured within existing credit amounts to finance about $70 million of
rehabilitation-related expenditures.  In addition, supplemental funding will be
proposed for an ongoing education project, in the amount of $13 million, and
supplemental financing of about $15 million for transport is under consideration.



- 8 -
Longer-Term  Reconstruction.   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Nicaragua was discussed by the Board on April 9, 1998.  The emergency
Consultative Group for the countries affected by the hurricane in Central America on
December 10-1 1 discussed preliminary indications of needs for new assistance. Over
the next few months, the Government will be preparing a more detailed
reconstruction program, to be presented at a following Consultative Meeting in
Stockholm in the Spring. IDA will review its existing CAS in light of the
reconstruction program. We do not expect that this will require a major reformulation
of the CAS or its key priorities. If this is not the case, we would present a CAS
update to the Board in mid-1999. In addition, IDA is already exploring with the
Government and other donors ways to strengthen Nicaragua's institutional capacity
for disaster preparedness and management. As soon as conditions permit, we expect
to initiate preparation of either a freestanding technical assistance operation, or add a
component to an existing or future operation. This is consistent with the strong
emphasis already in the CAS on institutional development. In addition, we have been
exploring with the Government ways in which the National Integrity System
launched early this year with EDI support, can be adapted to support efforts by the
Government and civil society to ensure that rehabilitation and longer-term
reconstruction programs are appropriately and transparently handled.
B.    Project Objectives
17.   The proposed Hurricane Emergency Project is part of the first phase of IDA's
strategy to assist in the reconstruction of Nicaragua (para. 16). It would assist the
Government in implementing its program to maintain macroeconomic stability while
helping to finance import costs associated with rebuilding social and economic
infrastructure, and re-establishing production levels, in response to the damage caused by
Hurricane Mitch. The performance of the project would be measured by how well
Nicaragua maintains macroeconomic stability in 1999 and beyond, especially in terms of
the current account deficit, and the budget deficit (Attachment 2).
C.    Project Description
18.   The Hurricane Emergency Project will provide immediate, quick-disbursing
support to finance a positive list of imports needed for the rehabilitation program
supporting macroeconomic objectives. While the proposed credit would be entirely
quick-disbursing, it is only one part of an unbundled set of actions by the Bank Group to
respond to the effects of the hurricane. The project will, inter alia, provide assistance for
imports of: (i) construction materials and equipment, water, land and air transport
vehicles, petroleum, and fuel products that are needed for rehabilitation of physical
infrastructure; (ii) seeds, fertilizers, agricultural equipment, materials, machinery and fuel
needed to reestablish agricultural production; (iii) medical supplies and equipment
needed to replenish stockpile of hospitals, health centers, health posts and outreach
programs; (iv) school supplies and equipment for educational facilities that were
damaged or destroyed; and (v) machinery, spare parts and equipment for commercial and
industrial companies. No disbursements will be made to cover used or luxury goods or
military equipment.

19.   The size of the proposed credit at SDR 36.1 million ($50.0 million equivalent) is
based on the Government's request for emergency assistance and an assessment of the
adverse effects of Hurricane Mitch on the balance of payments after taking account of the
assistance expected from the IMF, IDB, and other donors.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS/PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Project Organization and Management
20.   Project implementation arrangements have been streamlined to conform to the
emergency nature of IDA's assistance. In addressing IDA's fiduciary responsibilities,
IDA has sought to ensure that: credit proceeds are administered prudently, and only used
to finance imports of items included on the positive list; required procurement,
accounting and auditing procedures are followed; and, appropriate retention of
documents is provided to allow for IDA supervision and independent audits.
21.   The Project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
with the assistance of the Central Bank of Nicaragua.  The execution of an
Implementation Agreement, satisfactory to IDA, defining the assistance to be provided
by the Central Bank of Nicaragua is a condition of effectiveness. The Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit will provide the basic information on imports (based on
Customs Declarations) and the General Directorate of Customs will maintain the
respective supporting documentation.  The credit will finance 100 percent of the
delivered cost of eligible imports, excluding import duties and taxes, of a positive list
agreed with Government (Attachment 1).
B.    Procurement
22.   Credit proceeds would be made available to finance public and private sector
imports against documentation evidencing that the imported goods were both on the
positive list and procured following agreed procurement procedures. Imports financed
with credit proceeds would be limited to goods from eligible countries as per the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines (Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits, dated January 1995, revised January and August 1996, and September 1997).
No more than 50 percent of the credit would be used to finance the import of any
category of eligible imports on the positive list.
22.   The credit would be used to finance only imports procured in accordance with the
procedures presented in Table 3 below. All procurement of imports by the private sector
of $3 million or above will be based on Simplified International Competitive Bidding
Procedures subject to prior review by IDA. Imports by the private sector less than the
equivalent of $3 million will be acquired based on established commercial practices and
will not need the prior review of IDA



- 10-
23.   Public sector imports financed under this project would follow Simplified
International Competitive Bidding procedures, as provided under IDA's Procurement
Guidelines (Clauses 2.63 and 2.64). Contracts let by the public sector of $1 million or
above and contracts awarded after June 30, 1999 will be subject to prior review by IDA.
However, to facilitate the speedy import of items required immediately for the recovery
effort, public sector imports of less than $1 million equivalent and awarded between
October 25, 1998 and June 30, 1999 may be made based on international shopping
procedures as per IDA's Procurement Guidelines (Clauses 3.5 and 3.6). The Project
would finance the import of fuel and fertilizers by both private and public importers
through established international commodity markets, or through simplified procurement
procedures provided for under the IDA's Procurement Guidelines.

C.   Disbursements
24.   The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against 100 percent of the
delivered cost of imports, excluding imports duties and taxes, of the agreed positive list.
In order to avoid excessive transaction costs for IDA, public and private sector import
contracts of less than $20,000 would not be eligible for financing with credit proceeds.
With the exception of disbursement for goods procured by the public sector estimated to
cost the equivalent of $1.0 million or more, or after June 30, 1999, or of goods procured
by the private sector and estimated to cost $3.0 million equivalent or more, all
disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures for which supporting



documentation would be retained by the General Directorate of Customs and made
available for review by IDA financial management and procurement specialists and
project auditors. The project would be implemented over a one-year period and is
expected to be completed by December 31, 1999. The Closing Date for this credit would
be June 30, 2000.
25.   Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing in the amount of SDR 7.22
million, 20 percent of credit amount, would be provided to finance expenditures incurred
before credit signing but after October 25, 1998, the approximate date of onset of
devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch.
26.   Special Account. The Borrower may request disbursement through a US Dollar
Special Account to be established in the Central Bank of Nicaragua, with an initial
authorized allocation of $12.5 million, 25 percent of the total Credit amount. The Special
Account would be replenished as and when needed to ensure timely disbursements of
funds to cover eligible imports.
D.   Financial Management and Monitoring
27.   The Central Bank of Nicaragua has in place an appropriate mechanism to monitor
and report on the financial transactions pertaining to this operation. The Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit would provide at all times adequate staff for managing the
Project and maintaining proper accounts and records. The quarterly financial reports will
reflect the total transfers of resources of the credit and show the total of eligible financed
imports based on the agreed positive list (corresponding to the lists of imports provided
by the General Directorate of Customs).
28.   Quarterly progress reports of monitoring indicators, the project's financial
transactions, and quarterly audits of project accounts, the Special Account and Statements
of Expenditures by an independent private accounting firm acceptable to IDA, will be
provided by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit within 30 days of the end of each
calendar quarter. The fourth quarter audit report will present the cumulative balances to
the end of the year. The retaining of an auditing firm acceptable to IDA is a condition of
effectiveness.
29.   The Project's monitoring indicators are described in Attachment 2. Reports on
the progress against these macroeconomic indicators will be prepared and sent to IDA
quarterly.

Monitoring Indicators
The objectives of the Hurricane Emergency Project is to assist the Republic of Nicaragua
to finance critical imports needed for the rehabilitation and rebuilding effort, while maintaining
macroeconomic stability. The following indicators would be used to monitor progress toward
achieving the Project's objective:
* The balance of payments current account deficit expected not to exceed 32.0 percent of GDP
in 1999.
* The combined public sector overall deficit expected not to exceed 11.0 percent of GDP in
1999.
Progress toward meeting these targets will be monitored quarterly and the indicators will
be adjusted, by agreement between the Borrower and IDA, as macroeconomic estimates and
projections are refined, in line with the Government's economic program and the Policy
Framework Paper.
