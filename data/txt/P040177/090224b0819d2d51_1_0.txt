                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project will support the development of the institutional capacity of the Comisión Nacional de Bancos y Seguros (CNBS)and the Banco Central de
                         Honduras (BCH) to address vulnerabilities of the Honduran financial system. In this context, the project development objective is capacity-building for dealing with
                         weaknesses of the banking system, a prerequisite for sustainable growthand poverty alleviation. The project would achieve this objective by providing technical
                         assistance for: (i) the design and implementation of a banking sector consolidation program, (ii) the reform of the payments system, and (iii) the improvement of selected
                         aspects of the financial system infrastructure. A financial sector adjustment operation is planned in FY04 to complement the proposed technical assistance operation
                         and achieve the objectives defined in the Country Assistance Strategy.

                         Despite delays in project implementation (partially caused by the instability experienced during the Presidential term of Mr. Zelaya, from 2006 to 2010, in which four different
                         Presidents were appointed to the Central Bank and three Presidents to the CNBS), the project achieved most of its Developmental Objectives by its closing date in February 2013.
                         The last major activity of the project, the introduction of a modern payments system, has been partially completed and it is expected that all qualifying financial institutions will be
                         making use of it by June 2013 at the latest.
