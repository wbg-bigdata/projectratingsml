                         Honduras (BCH) to address vulnerabilities of the Honduran financial system. In this context, theproject development objective is capacity-building for dealing with
                         weaknesses of the banking system, a prerequisite forsustainable growthand poverty alleviation. The project would achieve this objective by providing technical
                         assistance for: (i) thedesign and implementation of a banking sector consolidation program, (ii) the reform of the payments system, and (iii) theimprovement of selected
