SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   The Land and the Economy
1.01      The most populous of African countries, Nigeria comprises 19
federating states, covering an area of about 924,000 km2. The land mass
extends roughly 1,100 km from north to south and 1,300 km from east to
west. Nigeria's terrain ranges from low-lying mangrove swamps along the
coast to semi-desert in the north. The land is generally flat and, except
along the border with Cameroon and in the central plateau, there are few
topographic features higher than 700 m. The Niger and Benue river system
splits the country into three parts and constitutes the major natural
obstacle to land transport. A coastal, rain-forest belt about 100-150 km
wide extends inwards along the bights of Benin and Bonny.
1.02      The population is estimated at about 81 million (1978) correspond-
ing to an average density of about 86 per km2. The population growth rate
is about 2.5% per annum. The majority of the people (estimates range from
two-thirds to four-fifths) live in rural areas and are dependent exclusively
on agriculture. Average GDP per capita, estimated at $560, is unevenly
distributed with per capita income in agriculture no more than $200.
1.03      The Nigerian economy is dominated by the oil sector which accounts
for 30% of GDP, over 90% of export earnings and about 80% of Government
revenue. The increase in the oil prices in 1973/74 enabled the Government
to embark on a massive public sector investment program as part of its
Third National Development Plan, with large allocations for transport (28%),
industry (19%) and education (8%). Federal current expenditure increased from
US$1.1 billion in 1973/74 to US$4.2 billion in 1977/78 and capital expenditure
from US$1.2 billion to $9.7 billion. The GDP growth rate averaged about 6%
per annum between 1974 and 1978, with growth concentrated in the service and
construction sectors. The contribution of the transport and communications
sectors to GDP averaged about 3% p.a.
1.04      Indications are that in the Fourth National Development Plan now
being prepared for 1981-85 the main thrust will be on consolidation of the
nation's economic base and greater emphasis on diversification into productive
sectors other than oil. In the transport sector, preservation and maintenance
of existing facilities and their improved operation are expected to receive
higher priority than the expansion of physical capacity.



-2-
B.   The Transport System
(i) General
1.05      Two major events shaped the development of Nigeria's transport
system in the 1970's--the end of the civil war in 1969 and the economic
expansion triggered by the increase in oil prices in 1973/74.
1.06      The underlying theme for transport development during 1970-74
(Second Plan period) was rehabilitation and reconstruction of transport
facilities, particularly roads and bridges to revive a war-ravaged economy.
Transport investments accounted for about one-third of capital development
expenditures during the Second Plan period. Significant progress was recorded
in the road programs; 3,502 km of federal roads were reconstructed to two-lane
paved standards and improvement works started on an additional 4,056 km at a
total cost of about N 880 million.
1.07      The economic expansion following the 1973-74 increase in oil
prices coincided with the advent of the Third National Development Plan
(1975-80). At the commencement of the Third Plan period, Nigeria was ill-
equipped to meet the exploding growth in demand for transport services.
Monumental traffic jams in Lagos and other major towns were the rule, the
railway system had declined to a point that even for bulk commodities, such as
cement and petrol, road transport had become the preferred mode and port
congestion had reached a level unequalled anywhere in the world. Despite the
progress in road construction recorded during 1970-74, many major inter-city
road links were still incomplete, leaving air transport as the only practical
option for long distance passenger travel; the airports, however, were not
equipped to handle the resultant surge in air travel demand. Faced with these
problems, Nigeria embarked on a transport development program that constituted
a virtual rebuilding of its transport facilities.
1.08      The Third Development Plan (1975-80) envisaged a total public
capital expenditure of about N 45 billion (US$72 billion) of which about 22%
was allotted for the transport sector. Roads accounted for the major share of
the proposed transport investments (74%), followed by railways (10%), air
(8%), ports (6%) and inland waterways, shipping and other transport elements
(2%).
1.09      The primary commodity flows on Nigeria's transport network consist
of import-export traffic moving between the ports and the hinterland. Internal
movements, consisting mainly of passenger traffic, have a pronounced east-
west trend, particularly between the heavily populated areas of southern
Nigeria. In 1970, about 77% (in ton-km) of goods transported in Nigeria was
by road, 22% by rail and 1% by water. Subsequent years were marked by reduc-
tions in bulk traffic travelling by rail as agricultural production for export
declined, and roads increasingly provided the most reliable means of dis-
tributing imports of food and other consumable products such as cement,
fertilizer and refined petroleum products. Thus the modal allocations by 1978
had shifted significantly in favor of road transport which then accounted for
over 90% of total haulage to and from the ports.



-3-
Highways
1.10      Details of the road sub-sector are presented in Chapter II.
(ii) Railways
1.11      The Nigerian rail system, the fifth largest in Africa, consists
of 3,505 km of 1.067-metre gauge single track. The two main north-south
lines--from Lagos to Kano (1,127) km and from Port Harcourt to Maiduguri
(1,444) km--are connected by an east-west line from Kaduna to Kafanchan (179
km). There are also five branch lines with railheads at N'guru, Kaura,
Namoda, Jos, Idogo and Baro. The system is best suited for long-haul bulk
traffic in which railways have an inherent competitive advantage over road
transport. Several stretches of lightweight rail have limited axle load
capacity while extensive lengths of curved track as well as steep grades in
parts of the system reduce operating speeds. As a result trains average no
more than 55 km/hr of running speed, there are frequent stoppages and a
relatively high accident rate.
1.12      The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), created in 1955 as a
statutory public corporation, is responsible for managing and operating
the railway system. NRC employs about 28,000 workers. Railway traffic in
1978 was estimated at 1,612 million ton-km of freight and 1,415 million
passenger-km; freight revenue amounted to N29.8 million, while passenger
revenue provided about N9.3 million.
1.13      Since the early sixties, the railways have experienced a steady
decline in traffic and operational efficiency; there has been an operating
deficit every year since 1964/65 ranging from a low of N1.4 million in
1967/68 to about N34 million in 1974/75. Factors contributing to NRC's poor
performance include declining agricultural output and exports, particularly
cash crops (such as groundnuts and cocoa), once a major portion of total rail
traffic; the substantial improvement of competing goods haulage by road; an
inflexible tariff policy (passenger fares and freight rates remained unchanged
between 1962 and 1977); labor relations problems; and ineffective
management. In view of the mounting difficulties NRC continued to experience,
the Government awarded a N4.6 million management contract in October 1978 to
Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES), a railway management firm,
to set up an effective railway organization and to run NRC for three years
beginning January 1979. The RITES team is composed of a management group of
36 members and a task force of 398 technicians. The activities of the RITES
group during the first six months have centered on stock-taking of existing
rolling stock, workshop facilities and equipment, and spare parts, and
rationalization of their use; establishment of a program of periodic mainte-
nance; and repair and overhaul of equipment. There has already been a
measurable improvement in the availability of locomotives and rolling stock,
and a consequent upturn in the number of passengers and volume of goods
carried. Efforts have also been directed towards improving connections,
establishing and adhering to a timetable, and developing an aggressive market-
ing policy to attract traffic back to railways. Freight prospects, however,



- 4 -
will be governed to a large extent by the success of the Government's efforts
to regenerate agriculture, the location of future industrial growth centers,
and the regulatory practices concerning long-haul bulk traffic.
1.14      The Third Plan envisaged a capital investment of N 986 million for
railways, of which a sum of N 685 million was earmarked for track conversion
requiring the construction of 960 km of standard gauge track parallel to the
existing narrow gauge system. Actual expenditures during the Plan period,
however, have been modest and mostly used for acquisition of locomotives and
rolling stock, minor track and signaling improvements on the existing system
and the rail extension to serve the cement factory at Ashaka. In 1977, the
Government awarded contracts for the survey, mapping and design of the Port
Harcourt-Makurdi main line (490 km), as the first phase of the track conver-
sion program, and the Oturkpo-Ajaokuta spurline (194 km) to serve the iron and
steel complex at Ajaokuta. The survey and preliminary designs for the two
schemes have been completed, but construction is pending a reappraisal of the
track conversion program by the Government. This includes consideration of
other alternatives such as improvement of the existing narrow-gauge system
or construction of the standard-gauge system on a completely different align-
ment to serve new areas of the country. Construction of the Port Harcourt-
Ajaokuta section, however, is expected to receive high priority in keeping
with the transport requirements of the Ajaokuta'Steel Complex.
(iii) Ports
1.15      The Nigerian port system, consisting of four seaport complexes,
namely Lagos, Rivers (Port Harcourt and Bonny), Delta (Warri, Sapele, Burutu
and Koko ports), and Calabar, provides a combined total of 59 deep-water
berths, a quay length of about 12,000 meters and a large number of anchorages
in all the ports.
1.16      Cargo handled at Nigerian ports has more than doubled during
1971-78, from about 6 million tons in 1971 to 15.7 million tons in 1978.
Lagos accounts for about 75-80% of the total traffic, Port Harcourt about
15% and the other ports together the remaining 5-10%. There has been a
significant shift in the nature of cargo throughput at the ports; the share
of imports increased from about 75% in 1971 to 95% in 1978. Commodity
exports dropped from about 1.5 million tons in 1971 to 0.79 million tons in
1978. Excluded from these figures are exports of crude oil, handled at
seven specialized tanker terminals outside the normal general cargo ports;
crude oil exports have averaged about 100 million tons p.a. since 1976/77.
1.17      The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), an autonomous public corpora-
tion established in 1955, is responsible for the management and operation
of the Nigerian port system. The Third Plan (1975-80) provided N 596
million in capital expenditures for port development. The first and the
largest of these new ports, the Tin-Can Island Port, (N190 million) in Lagos
was conmaissioned in October 1977. Other port developments have included the
construction of the new four-berth Calabar (N86 million) and the seven-berth
Warri (N84 million) ports and the Third Apapa Wharf Extension (N84 mil-
lion). The lighterage terminals at Kiri-Kiri (1,560 m) and Ikorodu (1,140 m),



both part of the Lagos Port Complex, came into operation in 1976 and 1977
respectively; work on the Onne lighterage terminal and the Okrike oil jetty of
the Rivers Complex at Port Harcourt is nearing completion.
(iv) Shipping
1.18      The Nigerian National Shipping Line (NNSL) was established in 1958
as a statutory corporation and became fully Government-owned in 1961. It
operates regular services between West African ports and the United Kingdom
and other European countries. The company provides both freight and passenger
services and is a member of five conference lines--UK-West Africa, Continental-
West Africa, Far East-West Africa, Mediterranean-West Africa, and America-West
Africa conferences.
1.19      The Third Plan allocation for NNSL was N 118.1 million, of which
NI 112.0 million was to be spent on acquisition of new vessels. The primary
objective of Government's shipping policy is to enable NNSL to carry about 40%
of Nigeria's sea-borne freight traffic. A contract for the building of 19
ships for the line was awarded in 1977, which would expand the fleet to 27
vessels by 1980. The new vessels consist of ten 16,000 dwt combo (combination
conventional/container) and nine 12,000 dwt conventional cargo ships. Cargo
lifted by NNSL averaged about 620,000 tons p.a. during 1974/75 to 1977/78.
1.20      Commercial vessels registered in Nigeria numbered 107 in 1979 with
a total tonnage of 382,879 dwt. In the private sector, Nigerian Green Lines
is the largest shipping company in Nigeria. Founded in 1972, the company
operates six dry cargo vessels with a total tonnage of 87,807 tons. Nigerian
Green Lines has regular direct sailings from Antwerp and Hamburg to Lagos.
(v) Inland Waterways
1.21      Nigeria's navigable waterways consist of the Niger-Benue river
system, the Cross River, running north from Calabar, and an extensive network
of navigable creeks extending from west of Lagos to east of Calabar. The
Niger and Benue Rivers are navigable for barges all the year round as far as
their confluence at Lokoja.  The Niger River is navigable upstream from Lokoja
to Jebba (900 km inland) for about eight months and the Benue River to Garoua
(1,550 km inland) in Cameroon for about two months. Traffic on the inland
waterway system peaked in the early 1960's when over 300,000 tons of cargo
were moved annually by commercially operated river fleets. The civil war
disrupted commercial transportation on the waterways; by 1970 river-borne
traffic had dropped to about 23,000 tons. Protracted drought in recent years
with the resultant low water levels has reduced the chances of reviving water
transport which has also been hurt by competition from road transport. At
present, river transport accounts for less than one percent of total passenger
and goods movements. A master plan for river development and water management
was completed in 1977. Dredging and hydrographic surveys of the river naviga-
tion channel from Warri to Lokoja have been completed as a prelude to the
development of river ports at Onitsha and Ajaokuta.



-6-
(vi) Civil Aviation
1.22      Nigeria possesses about 77 civil airports and airstrips, of which
46 are open to public use. The responsibility for the development and opera-
tion of the civil airport system lies with the Nigerian Airports Authority
(NAA), which was created as an autonomous corporate body in 1976. NAA's
functions include the operation and maintenance of public airports and
the provision of ground handling services.
1.23      Domestic air transport in 1978 accounted for 534 million passenger-
km, 0.26 million ton-km of freight and 0.35 million ton-km of mail. Demand
for passenger air travel increased multifold during 1970-78; passenger move-
ments increased from 111,000 in 1970 to 1.2 million in 1978 and kilometers
flown (including mail) from 2.5 million to 11.5 million. Demand for air
freight, including mail, remained fairly constant during this period at about
0.5-0.6 million ton-km per year.
1.24      Recognizing the growing demand for air transport services, the
Third Plan provided N 738 million in capital expenditures for aviation
facilities, including N 654 million for airport development, primarily for
upgrading of 16 airports. The highlight of the airport development program
has been the completion of Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos at
a cost of N240 million; it became operational in April 1979. International
air services use the airports at Kano and at Lagos. As part of the Third
Development Plan airports at Ilorin, Port Harcourt, Maiduguri, Sokoto and
Kaduna are being developed to international standards and the airports at
Enugu, Jos, Calabar, Ibadan, Benin, Yola, Warri, Zaria and Gusau are being
upgraded to handle the growing domestic demand for air travel.
1.25      Domestic air transport is handled by Nigeria Airways, a wholly
Government-owned corporation which offers scheduled service between Lagos
and 12 state capitals. International service is provided by Nigeria Airways
and 26 international carriers with scheduled operations from Lagos and Kano.
The Third Plan contemplated a capital expenditure of N 57 million for
Nigeria Airways to be spent mostly on purchase of aircraft. The expansion in
the Airways' fleet has not been matched by growth in its managerial and
professional competence. In view of continuing management difficulties,
resulting in flight irregularities and ineffective use of aircraft and person-
nel, the Government signed a N 3.5 million contract with KLM, the Royal
Dutch Airlines, in September 1979 to provide a management team to operate
Nigeria Airways for a two-year period.
(vii) Pipelines
1.26      Until 1970, the Nigerian pipeline network operated by private oil
companies consisted of about 500 km of crude oil and about 85 km of natural
gas pipelines. Put in service between 1958 and 1965, they transported more
than 13 million tons of crude and over 100 million m3 of natural gas in
1965 from producing areas to export terminals and domestic refineries. The
Third Plan allocated N 550 million for the development of an extensive
pipeline network connecting the national refineries with 20 major regional



- 7 -
storage centres. At completion, this 2,700-km pipeline network will include
a crude oil pipeline from Warri to Kaduna, the site of a new refinery presently
under construction, and product distribution pipelines from the Warri refinery
to Ilorin; from the Port Harcourt refinery to Makurdi; and from the Kaduna
refinery to Maiduguri, Kano, and Gusau. The commissioning of the distribution
network started in 1979; the Port Harcourt-Makurdi and Warri-Ibadan lines are
expected to be fully operational by end 1980.
C.   Transport Planning and Coordination
1.27      Transport development in Nigeria has been guided by two underlying
principles--first to provide infrastructural support for the development of
agriculture, commerce and industry, and, second, to assist in the economic
and political integration of the country. Transport policy objectives as
outlined in the Third National Development Plan have been ostensibly aimed at
coordinated development, economic efficiency, safety, and improved service for
users. Many of these objectives remain unfulfilled, given the Government's
primary preoccupation with providing the basic transport facilities to meet
the explosive growth in the demand for transport services during the 1970s.
The Fourth Plan (1981-85), now in preparation, is expected to consider the
preservation and maintenance of the existing transport infrastructures,
expansion of indigenous executive and management capacity and flexible
regulatory arrangements for transport services as important sectorial objec-
tives, in addition to those enunciated for the Third Plan.

1.29      The actual performance of the transport sector, both in physical and
financial terms, has fallen short of Third Plan targets. At the end of the
Plan's third year, an estimated 23% of the transport sector program had been
completed in physical terms requiring a capital expenditure of about N 3.2
billion (US$5.1 billion) and accounting for about 33% of the Third Plan
allocation for transport. The ports and highways (Federal) sub-sectors
recorded the most progress with about 45-50% of their respective development
programs completed during the first three years of the Plan; progress in
railways was minimal (6%) while the programs for aviation and inland waterways
sub-sectors were about one-fourth completed. The relative achievements of the
different sub-sectors have tended to correspond in inverse degree to the
extent to whiclh local executing capacity was necessary for implementation.



- 9 -
The fiscal constraints arising in the late 1970s and the decline in the real
value of the funds originally allocated to transport under the Third Plan have
entailed a scaling down of the physical targets. Financial constraints,
however, are not primarily responsible for the shortfall in achieving the plan
targets; it is rather the insufficiency of qualified and experienced manpower
that has constrained plan implementation.
1.30      Although the transport sector program of the Third Plan was conceived
without an adequate assessment of the available implementation capacity, its
execution has reflected a pragmatic approach with most of the expenditures,
particularly for ports and highways, directed at eliminating major bottlenecks
in the transport system, an investment strategy with self-evident justification.
This has, however, encouraged an investment attitude that is more oriented
towards rapid achievement of physical targets rather than to a careful assess-
ment of the use of economic resources with its inevitable delays. This
approach is understandable as a short-term expedient, but it has led to
spiralling construction costs and, in some instances, creation of excess
capacity to overcome operational constraints. As the more urgent projects
aimed to alleviate obvious deficiencies are completed and investment choices
become more complex, detailed planning and coordination of transport invest-
ments are expected to become increasingly important in order to achieve
optimal use of available resources and balanced growth of the transport
sector.
1.31      The responsibility for transport planning and administration is
fragmented with no single agency holding a clear line of authority. At
the federal level, the planning and programming for highways is carried
out by the Federal Ministry of Works (FMW), air transport comes under the
aegis of the Federal Ministry of Civil Aviation (FMCA), created in 1975,
while planning and regulation of railways, ports and inland waterways are
the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Transport (FMT) and its asso-
ciated statutory agencies. The planning of pipelines for oil and gas distribu--
tion is carried out by NNPC. This diffusion of planning functions is further
compounded by the planning and programming efforts of 19 state ministries of
works/transport. The Federal Ministry of National Planning (FMNP), while
having the overall responsibility of planning public sector investments
including transport investments, tends to have a macro-orientation to its
planning approach. Its efforts to monitor sector performance at the project
level have been hindered by insufficient professional staff and lack of active
participation by the executive agencies. The only Government agency that has
regularly, albeit cursorily, monitored the progress and problems of the
transport sector is the research division of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
Transport planning in practice has meant the assembling of the programs and
proposals of different Government agencies with only limited coordination
among modal investments; consideration of project alternatives and their
economic justification has been the exception rather than the rule.
1.32      Transportation coordination problems in Nigeria have taken two
forms: "vertical" coordination among federal, state and local government
agencies and "horizontal" coordination among transport modes. Vertical



- 10 -
coordination problems are of particular relevance to the highway sub-sector
(para. 2.29), while the major horizontal coordination problem concerns long-
haul bulk transport, an increasing proportion of which is carried by trucks
too heavy for the roads, although there is evidence that much of it could be
carried by rail at a lower economic cost. Where complementary transport
investments are needed, the lack of timely phasing of such investments has
led to either under utilization of facilities (e.g., the Calabar port is
operational but the major north-south Trunk Road A-4 feeding into it is still
under construction) or to congestion problems at the interface between modes
(e.g., in Lagos where increasing port capacity has not been matched by suf-
ficient access road/rail capacity).
1.33      The Government, however, is aware of the need to improve transport
planning and coordination. A concrete step in this direction was taken by
the creation of the National Transport Coordinating Commission (NTCC) in
October 1977 as a functional unit of FlIT. The Commission's functions include
coordinating transport sector investments, preparing and monitoring the
transport investment program of the national development plans, formulating
policies for the regulation, development and operation of the transport
industry, and improving the information base for transport planning and
coordination. In addition NTCC is entrusted with transport research and
collection and dissemination of transport sector information. The Commis-
sion's membership includes FJW, FMCA, FMT, FIDP, the state ministries of
works/transport, and representatives of the private sector including academic
institutions.
1.34      NTCC's secretariat is headed by a director appointed in September
1978; the authorized establishment of NTCC includes 34 professional staff.
NTCC is still in its formative stage; being a functional unit of FBIT, its
activities are primarily confined to water transport and railways with little
interaction with FMW and FICA.  NTCC recently started preparations for a
national transport survey; this should prove to be a useful effort provided
NTCC keeps the objectives of the survey relatively simple and focuses on
issues that are of critical importance to the future development of the
transport sector. NTCC plans to carry out the survey using its own resources
with technical and advisory services provided by local universities.
D.   Bank Assistance in the Transport Sector
1.35      Nigeria was one of the first African countries to seek Bank assis-
tance in developing its transport infrastructure. In 1958, a US$28 million
loan (193-UNI) was negotiated to assist the Nigerian Railway Corporation in
the implementation of a five-year development program. In 1963, a US$13.5
million loan (326-UNI) provided for extensions and improvements to the port
of Lagos. Thereafter Bank assistance was concentrated in the highway subsector.
Between 1965 and the outbreak of civil war in 1967, three highway projects
were initiated (Credit 73-UNI, and Loans 426-UNI and 427-UNI) totalling some
US$47.5 million. Both road and rail communications were damaged by military
action and by neglect during the civil war. A road rehabilitation project



- 11 -
(640-UNI) involving a loan of US$10.6 million was initiated in 1969 and the
rehabilitation of trunk roads featured as a main item in a transport rehabili-
tation loan of US$25 million (694-UNI) in 1970. Rehabilitation was continued
by Loan 838-UNI initiated in 1972 and providing US$26.3 million to the then
Western State for the rehabilitation of roads and eight bridges, and for a
consultancy to advise on road maintenance. This was followe- by a port
operation in 1973 involving a US$55 million loan (922-UNI) for expansion of
the Lagos port and for improvement of the management and operations of NPA.
1.36      By 1972, differences of opinion had developed between the Government
and the Bank during the execution of the Fourth and Fifth Highway Projects
(Loans 640-UNI and 838-UNI). The Fourth Highway Project (Loan 640-UNI) included
as a component the planning and detailed engineering of the Lagos-Ibadan
expressway. Government and the Bank were unable to reach agreement over the
standards of layout to be employed and the phasing of the works. This became a
major issue and, in December 1974, the Government decided to discontinue
preparation for further Bank projects in the highway subsector. This situation
continued until December 1977, when contact was reestablished to begin the
planning of this project.
1.37      In the meantime, road building had developed as a significant
component in Bank assisted tree-crop and agricultural development projects in
Nigeria.  Four such projects had been initiated, and all four contained
substantial programs for feeder road construction. They were the Cocoa II
project (Ln. 1045-UNI), providing inter alia for the construction of 1,060 km
of feeder roads and the agricultural development projects in Gusau (Loan
1099-UNI), Funtua (Loan 1092-UNlI) and Gombe (Loan 1164-UNI), providing about
660, 700, and 500 km of minor roads, respectively.  This road building, now
well-advanced, has been undertaken by road construction units equipped and
operated as part of the project organizations.  There are now ten additional
Bank-assisted agricultural and forestry projects in progress, with feeder road
components totalling over 6,000 km.
1.38      The genecal picture thus emerging of Bank lending to Nigeria
for transport during the past decade is of concentration on the highway
subsector and within the subsector, on the main trunk road system and on
feeder roads. The Fourth Development Plan now in preparation will provide
a context to review Bank assistance to Nigeria for transport. Within the
highway subsector there are indications that state governments would like
Bank assistance in improving the country's secondary road system and in
building up the capacity of state and local government organizations to plan,
maintain and operate their road transport systems.

II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A.   The Highway Network
2.01      There is a well-defined three-tier system of roads in Nigeria
in which roads are classified by their function and responsibility for
them is distributed between the federal, state, and local Governments:
(1) Federal trunk roads linking the federal and state capitals
and other large towns and ports and providing links with
neighboring countries.
(2) State roads, some of which are major roads linking larger
towns with the Federal Trunk Road System, and others,
secondary roads to provide access from rural areas to
the larger towns.
(3) Local authority roads linking the main and secondary road
systems to settlements in town and country.
2.02      There are currently two groups of federal trunk roads, the Trunk
Roads A which form the principal axes of the system (see MIap 1) and the Trunk
Roads F. The latter were originally part of the main road systems of the
states. The Federal Government took them over from the states in 1974 to
allow the states to concentrate their efforts on the secondary road system.
Some of the Trunk Roads F are integral parts of the national trunk road
system; others, though clearly important, provide links only within or
between adjacent states. Within the state systems, there are normally two
classes of road, Trunk Roads B which provide important local links, and
secondary roads.
2.03      The lengths of each type of road as classified in 1978 are
given below:

Length (km)        bituminous

*Estimates

- 13 -
2.04      Federal Trunk Roads A consist for the most part of two-lane roads.
There is an increasing length of four-lane divided roads, particularly in the
south; for instance, roads linking Lagos with Ibadan and with Benin. Some of
the Trunk Roads A show signs of their origins as tracks in their tortuous
alignment, but most of the Trunk Road A system has now been improved to a
reasonable standard of layout. Road pavements, however, are generally weak.
Because of the heavy traffic and the neglect of routine maintenance, many
pavements on Trunk Roads A need strengthening, and in some cases, recon-
structing. Some Trunk Roads F have been improved; but a larger proportion of
the Trunk Roads F system is still in poor condition. Some lengths are open
only in the dry season, and some lengths now exist only as lines on the
map.
2.05      State roads vary considerably in condition, much depending on
the training and experience of staff available in each state. Most local
government roads are little more than earth tracks. Local Government
Councils (LGC) are developing the capacity to assist in planning the roads
they need but very few have yet the capacity to build and maintain the roads
within their jurisdictions.
B.   Road Transport Characteristics
(i) Vehicle Fleet
2.06      The most recent published motor vehicle statistics date back to
1972, when the in-service vehicle fleet (excluding motorcycles) was estimated
at 119,000, consisting of 48% passenger cars and 52% commercial vehicles.
The motorcycle population was estimated at 77,000. Since 1972, there has
been little effort devoted to systematically collecting and analyzing
vehicle statistics. Although state motor registries collect vehicle registra-
tion data, these have not been regularly transmitted to the central registry;
hence national statistics are not consistently reliable. Since 1973 the
vehicle population has experienced phenomenal growth; in 1978 it was estimated
at about 550,000 vehicles (excluding motorcycles), consisting of 60% passenger
cars and 40% commercial vehicles. This implies an annual growth rate of about
33% from 1973-78, the increase in passenger cars and trucks being 39% and 26%
respectively. The remarkable rate of growth of the vehicle fleet is confirmed
by vehicle import statistics summarized below:

Source:  Federal Office of Statistics
2.07            Domestic manufacture of passenger vehicles started in 1975
when Volkswagen of Nigeria and Peugeot (Nigeria) Ltd. started operations
in Lagos and Kaduna, respectively.   Commercial vehicles are assembled from
CKD components by a number of private concerns (Federated Iiotor Industries,
CFAO, SCOA, Leventis Motors and Bewac) with a total capacity of about 10,000
vehicles p.a. Arrangements for manufacture of commercial vehicles in the
public sector were made in 1975-76 with British Leyland Motor Corporation,
Daimler Benz A.G. of Germany, S.P.A. Fiat of Italy and Steyr-Daimler-Puch of
Austria with assembly plants to be located at Ibadan, Enugu, Kano and Bauchi,
respectively. The vehicle manufacturing and assembly industry is protected
through differential tariff barriers and licensing controls on imports of
assembled vehicles other than buses (para. 2.28). Domestic manufacture and
assembly of motor vehicles increased from about 12,000 in 1974 to nearly
70,000 in 1977.
(ii) Fuel Consumption and Traffic
2.08      As shown in the following table, fuel consumption grew at an a:erage
annual rate of 30% between 1975 and 1978.



- 15 -
Fuel Consumption (m3)            Annual Growth
1975         1976        1977       1978        Rate (%)
Gasoline             1,482,582   2,006,746  2,569,116  3,191,303           29.1

Automotive Gas/Oil   922,377   1,241,297  1,682,666  2,127,162             31.2
Gas Oil             584,039      785,976  1,065,446  1,319,180          31.2
Diesel Oil          338,338      455,321    617,220    807,982           33.6
TOTAL         2,404,959   3,248,043  4,251,782  5,318,465           30.3
Source: NNPC
Considering fuel consumption as roughly proportional to vehicle kilometer-
age, use of gasoline-powered vehicles (mainly passenger cars and taxis)
increased by 29% p.a. while diesel-powered vehicles (mostly trucks and
buses) increased by 32% during 1975-78. Thus fuel consumption statistics
are in line with the rate of growth of the vehicle fleet (para 2.06).
2.09      Other than spot traffic counts manually carried out on some of
the federal trunk roads by the state ministries of works on behalf of FMW,
traffic statistics have not been collected and updated since 1966. Hence
it is difficult to estimate the traffic growth on the national network
accurately. Nevertheless, a comparison of average daily traffic figures for
1966 and 1977 (see Map 2) shows that traffic has increased multi-fold over
this period. Most of the growth in traffic, however, has taken place since
1973. Available data from sample surveys suggest that traffic growth on rural
highways has averaged between 15-35% p.a. during 1973-78; this is in conso-
nance with the average growth in vehicle population (33%) and fuel consumption
(30%). The increase in traffic has been accompanied by a shift in traffic
distribution in favor of passenger cars and taxis, reflecting a propensity for
personal travel which has been encouraged by the general improvement of the
road network and increase in paved mileage. Traffic volumes vary widely over
the Federal trunk road network, ranging from about 20,000 vehicles per day
(vpd) in the Lagos-lbadan corridor to under 500 vpd on many of the Trunk F
roads.

C.   The Road Transport Industry
2.10      Except for a few large specialized firms working on long-term
haulage contracts for products such as petroleum, refrigerated goods, steel
and construction equipment requiring special vehicles, the road transport
industry in the private sector is characterized by diffusion of ownership and
relatively small firm size. The reasons for this situation include free
market entry (no common carrier regulations), small capital requirements,
no formal specialization in the freight transport market, and the narrow
technological and business entrepreneurial gap between trucking and traditional
trading practices. In addition, farm-to-market transport of passengers and
goods rests almost entirely on individually-owned vans and dual-purpose
freight and passenger vehicles (mammy-wagons). With free entry into the
industry and the absence of regulations concerning routes or rates, trucks and
vans are free to ply wherever business takes them, carrying whatever goods and
passengers are available at freely negotiated rates. In practice, however,
there is some natural specialization with respect to local or long-distance
markets, particular types of commodities, routes and clients. Furthermore
private bus lines tend to operate within a given state or region. In the
past, foreign entrepreneurs controlled most of the large cargo and passenger
transport companies but with the enactment of the Nigerian Enterprises Promo-
tion Decrees, all commercial transport of passengers and goods (including
fuel) has been reserved exclusively for Nigerian citizens. The indigenization
decrees coupled with the rapidly growing transport demand has led to some
increase in the average size of firms. As with vehicle population statistics,
information on road transport industry operations is scarce and not readily
available.
2.11      In the public sector a number of State Governments have set up
state-owned transport services (such as Bendel Line Company Limited, Plateau
Bus Service, Lagos City Transport Service, Kano State Transport Corporation
and River States Transport Corporation) while the Federal Government owns the
National Freight Company Limited. Some states operate only bus lines while
others provide cargo service as well. The bus lines generally operate beyond
the boundaries of their home states and virtually all have terminals in Lagos.
The National Freight Company (NFC), a statutory corporation under the jurisdic-
tion of the Federal Ministry of Transport, was acquired by the Federal Govern-
ment from the Northern States Interim Common Services Agency in 1976 to
expedite the flow of freight (primarily goods destined for Government agencies)
from Lagos up-country as part of port decongestion efforts. NFC operates
as a commercial entity with headquarters at Kaduna and provides freight
transport services to both Government agencies and private concerns.
2.12      In the absence of regulated tariffs, freight haulage rates are
set in the marketplace through negotiations between shippers and truckers.
However, some of the larger road transport firms, particularly the state-
owned companies, have fixed tariff schedules. Road freight transport rates
vary with length of haul, availability of back haul and service area. The
economic cost of freight transport by road, net of taxes, profits and over-
heads, in 1978 prices, is estimated in the order of 1N 0.03-0.05 per ton-km
depending on the size of the truck. Applying about 10% taxes and 20% over-
heads, the corresponding financial cost is estimated at N 0.04-0.07 per



- 1 7 -
ton-km. The rates (1978) charged by the road transport companies (0.03-0.07
per ton-km for haul distances greater than 500 km) appear to be commensurate
with the estimated costs.  Railway freight rates, by comparison, range from
N 0.01-0.05 per ton-km for similar haulage characteristics; typical rates
(1979) quoted for haulage of fertilizer from Lagos to Kano (1,187 km) by road
were about N 64 per ton compared to N 21 per ton by railway. Passenger
fares by bus on long-distance journeys (N 16 from Lagos to Kano) are about
the same as second class train fares and are one-fourth of economy class air
fares. The passenger fare structure appears reasonable and with growing
reliability and safety of railway operations, competition from road transport
should not be an issue.
2.13      Subject to annual vehicle inspection and payment of appropriate
licensing fees there are no Government restrictions on entry into the road
transport industry. Procedures for training and testing of commercial
drivers are inadequate and due to scarcity of established driving schools,
would-be drivers learn through ad-hoc apprenticeship with more experienced
drivers.  Lax vehicle inspection procedures coupled with poorly trained
drivers have increased the risk of accidents and delays through breakdowns
(see para. 2.16-2.20). Public transport and freight regulation are dealt with
at state level and there are considerable differences between the States in
the thoroughness and interest with which public transport policies are pursued.
D.   Traffic Regulations
2.14      Traffic regulations are promulgated at federal level but the appli-
cation of regulations is delegated to state and local government levels. The
road traffic regulations in general use date from 1957. Maximum authorized
gross vehicle weight limit is 32 tons with maximum axle loads specified at 10
tons for single axles and 16 tons for tandem axles on primary roads and 8 tons
for single axles on secondary roads. Speed limits are set at 48 km/hr within
city limits and 80 km/hr outside city limits although the draft Federal
Highway Regulations issued in 1974 prescribe additional speed limits for
specified types of vehicles and for expressways. Enforcement of traffic
regulations falls under the purview of Nigeria Police in collaboration with
FlAW and the state ministries of works.
2.15      Enforcement is not very strict.  On load restrictions for instance
it has been hampered by difficulties in installing and operating weigh-
bridges. Although evidence is scanty it is apparent that the axle loads
of some vehicles moving on Nigerian roads are very heavy. On one of the
project roads, Trunk Road A3 between Maiduguri and Gambaru, for example, there
are tankers carrying oil to Chad with single axle loads of 20t. The surround-
ing francophone countries have regulations permitting single axle loads up to
13 tons and there is a recognized need to move towards unifying regulations
concerning international traffic. But such regulations must be enforce-
able. There is growing concern within FMW that excessively heavy axle loads
have resulted in premature pavement distress on many of the trunk roads.
FMW's traffic unit has completed location studies and site surveys for instal-
lation of three weighbridges on roads in the heavily trafficked Lagos-Ibadan
corridor. The weighbridges are expected to be in operation by end-1980.
Twenty additional weighbridges are also being procured for installation on



- 18 -
major federal trunk roads. As they come into use it will be possible to
decide in what manner and how quickly the further installation of weighbridges
and enforcement should proceed. The Government, however, has agreed to
prepare revised vehicle and axle load regulations by December 31, 1982.
E.   Road Safety
2.16      The toll of road accidents in Nigeria is very heavy indeed.
Damaged vehicles litter the road sides, and on cross-country journeys, it
is common to come upon at least one, often several accidents that have
just happened. Some basic road accident data, summarized fron accident
statistics compiled by the Planning Department of FIW's Highways Division, are
given below.

2.17      These figures suggest some major inconsistencies between the
numbers of accidents reported and the nurabers which actually occur. It
seems likely that the level of accident reporting has been improving parti-
cularly in tlhe remoter areas. The most reliable among these statistics are
those for fatalities; even these are likely to underrate the actual situation
recalling that the definition of a fatality in general use is death within 30
days of the accident. Some general conclusions can be inferred:
(1) In relation to population and road use, the number of road
fatalities in Nigeria is high in comparison with other
developing countries, probably about twice the norm.



- 19 -
(2) The accident rate is increasing rapidly, but probably not so
fast as the increase in road use, since road fatalities are
increasing at 20% per year compared with increases of about
30% in road use.
(3) The proportion of fatalities to injuries reported is unusually
high, about 1 to 4 against the normal 1 to 10 or more in
most developing countries.
2.18      Concern about road safety has increased in recent years.  A federal
interdepartmental standing committee on road safety was formed in 1968 which
in 1974 issued a report on road safety devices on motor vehicles and on the
establishing of driving schools. Implementation of road safety measures lies
at state level and in 1972 the National Road Safety Commission (NRSC) on road
safety was established with the objective of coordinating road safety activi-
ties at national level. NRSC is under the chairmanship of the Minister of
Works; states are represented by their Commissioners of Works and there is
representation from the Nigeria Police, the Nigeria Army, the Red Cross, the
Motor Transport Owners Union and the universities. Each state has a road
safety committee under the chairmanship of the Commissioner of Works. The
federal government provides an annual appropriation of funds for road safety
activities which are channelled through NRSC to the State Road Safety Commit-
tees.  These funds are employed mainly in road safety propaganda activities,
e.g., road safety weeks with lectures, seminars and film shows, and increas-
ingly in assisting in the provision of physical facilities such as ambulances
and other road safety equipment and training schools for drivers. The level
of implementation of road safety measures, the training of road users, the
enforcement of regulations on road use and vehicle inspection practices vary
considerably from state to state.
2.19      New model traffic regulations were issued in 1974, but were adopted
only in Kano, Kaduna and Kwara States. A metric version is now being prepared.
Vehicle inspection and testing is done by state ministries of works. Driving
licenses are issued at local government level with written and oral tests and
road tests of driving ability. Special road safety measures have been employed,
notable amongst which are:
(1) the Federal Highway Patrol operated by the Nigeria Police
with 82 mobile units operating from 48 centers and providing
assistance in first aid and in restoring normal traffic at
accidents sites;
(2) mobile traffic courts in operation in Kwara and Bendel
States; and
(3) Road Safety Corps, initiated in Lagos in July 1979, with
powers to issue warrants or on-the-spot fines for specific
offenses. The fines are heavy and the most noticeable immediate
effect was a considerable reduction in the number of vehicles
on the road in the city.
2.20      The overall picture which emerges is of considerable concern at
high levels in federal and state governments coupled with frustration at the



- 20 -
apparent lack of success in containing the problem. Undoubtedly the problem
has been exacerbated by the road building program. There are now many lengths
of federal trunk road built to high standards of layout and with good surfac-
ings on which high speeds are possible. These often feed into narrow and
tortuous poorly-surfaced minor roads. The two main lines of attack on the
problem lie through improved education of road users and enforcement of
legislation on road use; easy to say, but difficult to achieve.
F.   Administration and Organization
2.21      In the federal, state and local government system of administering
road and road transport matters in Nigeria, there are many approximate
analogies with the United States, but with the Federal Government assuming a
larger share of responsibility for finance and execution. FMW is responsible
for the design, construction and maintenance of Trunk Roads A and F. State
governments are entirely responsible for the planning, construction and
maintenance of their roads. Local governments are, in theory, responsible for
planning, constructing and maintaining their own roads, but as yet are rarely
able to accomplish very much because of their limited engineering resources.
In some states the ministries of works are avoiding involvement with local
government roads; in others the ministries of works are providing assistance
in building local government roads and less frequently in maintaining them.
2.22      The organization of FMW and of the Highways Division (FHD) withi-
RFW are shown in the chart below.

- 21 -
Within FHD, the Construction Department is the largest and most influential
group; it is through this group that most of the funds of the Directorate are
dispersed. 'The Planning Department is increasing in importance as the need
becomes increasingly recognized for a factual basis for road planning decisions.
The Maintenance Department is struggling with enormous problems, which have
been compounded by the changes over the last few years in allocating respon-
sibility for the execution of maintenance of federal roads between FUWl and the
state ministries of works. A new Department of Progress and Coordination was
created in 1979 to rmionitor the progress of FHD's work program and to coordi-
nate its various functions. FHD's present organization is not well-suited to
cope effectively with the large highway construction and maintenance program
involving expenditures of over $1 billion annually. Virtually all decision-
making is centralized at the headquarters in Lagos and many key functions such
as technical support services, land acquisition for road projects, and provi-
sion of plant and vehicles for road maintenance fall outside FID's direct
control.  FMW's Civil Engineering Division (CED) provides support technical
services to the other divisions of FMW.  It contains FHW's Materials Testing
Laboratory; the Pavement Evaluation Unit to be provided under the proposed
highway project will be based in CED (para 3.16).
2.23      FHD has an authorized establishment of 295 engineers and 120 trainee
engineers but only one-half of the engineer posts are currently filled,
including a large number of expatriate staff from Third World countries. Ilith
respect to technicians, almost 30% of the posts are vacant. The staffing
situation at the professional level is a reflection of the overall shortage of
manpower resources in Nigeria combined with the competitive advantage of the
private sector. These shortages go a long way to explain FHID's concentration
of available staff on the inmediate problems of designing and supervising
major works, leaving few resources available for duties with a longer-term
impact such as planning and road maintenance. In the proposed project the
main thrust of the technical assistance component is towards remedying some of
the critical deficiencies, with most of the effort concentrated on improving
FIID's planning and maintenance capacity (para. 3.11 to 3.14). This will
provide a necessary, albeit small and transient improvement in FHD's capacity
and it seems likely that more radical measures will be necessary to build up
the strength of this arm of Government which is responsible for the execution
of a vital part of Nligeria's infrastructure development program, involving
about 11% of the total capital development expenditures during the Third Plan
period. Such measures are presaged in the guidelines to the Government's
Fourth Development Plan in which it is proposed to consider the formation of a
Federal Highway Authority.
C.   Financing
2.24      Funds for federal, state and local authority roads are allocated
out of the general budgets of the authorities concerned. The Federal Govern-
ment provides subsidies to State Governments for the construction of state
roads but provides no assistance for their maintenance. The Federal Govern-
ment also provides financial assistance for the construction of local govern-
ment roads through block grants to the state ministries of local government.
2.25      The Third Plan provided 14 5.5 billion in capital expenditures for
federal highways and about 1 1.6 billion for state roads. The federal
program included 284 projects -- 205 for engineering studies and construction,



- 22 -
20 for road strengthening, 6 for capital expenditures related to road mainte-
nance and the remaining for miscellaneous projects. The federal construction
projects completed or under implementation as part of the Third Plan cover a
network of about 13,000 km. Maintenance expenditures for Trunk A and F roads
are financed from FMW's annual recurrent budget, while states and local govern-
ment authorities provide for maintenance of roads under the! jurisdiction
from their respective budgets. Federal expenditures on road maintenance aver-
aged N 46 million per year between 1975/76-1978/79, while maintenance expen-
diture on state roads is estimated at N 30-40 million per annum. A summary
of federal expenditures on roads during the Third Plan period (actual for
1975/76-1977/78 and budget estimates for the remaining years) is given below:

2.26      The slackening of capital investment since 1977/78 has come at a
time when about three-quarters of the rehabilitation of the Trunk Roads A
system has been completed. Ahead, there is the formidable task of restoring
the Trunk Road F system, and with the increases in road traffic, there will
be a continuing demand for expenditure on pavement strengthening over the
whole system. Judged in this context, there is likely to be a need to sustain
capital investment in federal roads at a level at least comparable with
the average over recent years.
2.27      Since 1977/78, allocations for road maintenance have been reduced in
line with overall reductions in Government expenditure. With a Federal trunk
road system totalling some 29,000 km, the allocation for road maintenance has
averaged about N 1,600 (US$2,900) per km per year. This sum might well be
adequate for the routine maintenance of a road system which was in reasonably
good condition throughout. But there is a considerable backlog of periodic
maintenance and rehabilitation necessary on much of the trunk road system. A
rehabilitation program has been initiated under the capital budget (para. 2.40)
and increased appropriations would enable this program to proceed more
quickly. The current federal budget (April-December 1980) provides for an
expenditure of N 90 million for road maintenance, more than doubling the
equivalent annual allocation for road maintenance to N 4,000 (US$7,500) per
km. Sustained road maintenance allocations at this level in real terms should
help to eliminate the large backlog in periodic maintenance.
2.28      Road user taxes include import duties (which are higher for cars
than for other vehicles), annual license fees for vehicles (which, for both
private and commercial vehicles, increase progressively as a function of
gross vehicle weight), driver license fees and taxes on fuel, tires and other
vehicle accessories. There is a graduated import duty on cars ranging from
50-500% of CIF value with engine capacity varying from 1.8 liters to over 2.5
liters. The import duty on trucks and vans is 20% while the duty on buses is
15-20% depending on seating capacity. Duties on CKD components for local
assembly range from 5-10% for trucks and 15-50% for cars depending on location
of assembly plant and engine size. Fuel taxes are a uniform 3.43 kobo per
liter, corresponding to a 22% tax on regular gasoline, 19% on premium and
31% on diesel in terms of the price at the pump, which is uniform all over
Nigeria.  Identifiable road user taxes increased rapidly from less than N 30
million in 1971-72 to about N 300 million in 1978-79. Tolls have been
charged at some of the major road bridges; the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, opened
in 1978, is the first toll road. Currently revenue from road user taxes,
though still increasing, falls considerably short of total expenditure
on roads. It has averaged between two and three times the amounts spent in
strengthening and maintaining roads.
H.   Planning
2.29      Road planning in Nigeria is carried out at three levels:  FMNP
assesses federal and state highway needs in relation to other sectors with
respect to resource allocation; FMW initiates federal programs for Trunk
A and F roads based on engineering needs and establishes construction priori-
ties; and the state ministries of works/transport perform similar tasks



- 24 -
for the state roads. A fourth level of planning, although not readily
recognizable, exists at the local government level where decisions concerning
local roads (farm-to-market roads) are made. The coordination among federal,
state and local government agencies is not very effective as reflected in the
periodic transfer of road maintenance responsibilities between federal and
state ministries of works, the lack of a coherent policy on financing, con-
struction and maintenance of rural feeder roads, absence of uniform road
regulations, and uncoordinated phasina of federal and state road development
prograrms. The transport coordination responsibilities of NTCC include review
and monitoring of road development plans in relation to other transport modes
but NTCC has not been able to carry out this function (para. 1.34).  Road
planning at all levels is handicapped by the dearth of reliable data, particu-
larly on the extent and condition of the network and on road traffic flows.
Such data are needed before planning for roads can become more effective. The
project provides financing of a federal trunk road study that would help to
rectify some of these deficiencies (para. 3.08 and 3.09).
2.30       In F21U highway planning is the responsibility of an Assistant
Director assisted by a staff of highway and traffic engineers. The planning
staff is divided into two streams--development and planning -- each under a
chief engineer. The highway development staff performs functions related to
technical evaluation and programming of projects while the planning staff,
responsible for the physical planning of the highway network, carries out
traffic and other studies to make an assessment of highway needs. The planning
section also has responsibility for road safety.
2.31      FT1WI views highway planning as the art of providing highway facili-
ties at pre-determined technical standards to meet existing and future
traffic needs.   Economic analyses have not explicitly entered investment
decisions for two reasons: first, financial resources for highway development
until recently were virtually unconstrained and secondly, most investments in
the rural highway network had prima facie economic value in view of the
rapidly growing traffic.  FIW's highway planning efforts, however, do not
manifestly reflect the need to relate highway development to the requirements
of productive sectors such as agriculture and industry, to coordinate program-
ming of road investments with other transport modes and to develop a balanced
road system that reflects the relative needs for trunk, collector and local
service roads.
2.32      FI'1,1 is cognizant of some of these limitations but has been unable
to rectify them due to insufficient staff at all levels, particularly the
middle-grade professionals who form the backbone of any professional organiza-
tion. As a first step in strengthening its planning organization, FMfW has
established a traffic unit to organize a systematic traffic census on the
federal trunk road network. The first national traffic census was scheduled
to take place in January 1980 with simultaneous traffic counts carried out at
selected stations throughout the country. The traffic unit plans to routinely
organize nationwide traffic counts twice a year in January and July as well as
detailed supplementary counts at some selected stations four times a year.
The professional staff of the traffic unit includes two trained traffic
engineers but additional professional staff is needed to permit the traffic
unit to function effectively. The project provides four technical assistance



- 25 -
positions for highway planning, including a traffic engineer to strengthen the
traffic unit and a transport economist to assist the planning department in
project preparation and evaluation and in establishing the basic principles of
road planning (para. 3.13).
I.   DesIgn and Construction
2.33      Technical standards for the design of Federal Trunk Roads are
prescribed in FMW's "Highway Manual Part I". The general policy under which
FMW has been working places emphasis on geometric design features, as these
may be difficult and expensive to change, while it is easier and less expen-
sive to strengthen pavements when required. The aim is to provide comfortable
driving at speeds of 100 km per hour and the geometric design features con-
comitant with this design speed are, in general, derived from U.S. practice
as described in the AASHTO publication, "A Policy on Geometric Design of
Rural Highways". Typically, the aim on two-lane roads is to produce pavement
widths of 7.3 meters with shoulders 2.75 meters wide. Ruling gradients and
sight distances are adjusted according to the nature of the terrain thus
implicitly accepting lower design speeds than 100 km/hour in more difficult
terrain.
2.34      On roads with average daily traffic (ADT) exceeding 300 vehicles,
a bituminous surfaced pavement is regarded as desirable. Beyond 5,000
ADT, a four-lane divided highway is recommended and for flows exceeding
9,000 ADT, an expressway with controlled access is recommended. The thres-
holds for upgrading to a higher level highway are somewhat extravagant in
comparison with general world practice, especially as the ADTs used are those
expected 20 years after the road improvement is effected. Although these
standards remain officially in force, a more flexible attitude now prevails,
with geometric standards adapted to meet local circumstances; for instance, on
the roads to be strengthened as part of the project, shoulder treatment and
carriageway width have been varied to produce the least cost solution with no
alteration of the geometric layout of the roads.
2.35      Pavement design practice is based on British practice as outlined
in Road Note 31, "A guide to the structural design of bituminous roads in
tropical and sub-tropical countries," with one important qualification:
designs are based on the assumption that axle-loads do not exceed 10 tons
for single axles or 16 tons for twin axles. On Nigerian roads, these axle
limits are frequently exceeded (para. 2.15). This is certainly one cause of
early pavement failures. FMW wants to develop improved methods of determining
the in-situ strength of road pavements in order to refine their design methods
and to plan road strengthening programs in the most economic way. Such
methods have been used in designing the strengthening of the six project roads
(para. 3.04), and one feature of the technical assistance provided under the
project is to extend the use of these methods over the whole trunk road system
(para. 3.13 and 3.16).
2.36      Construction, improvement and strengthening works are invariably
undertaken by contract. Detailed engineering and the preparation of con-
tract documents are undertaken by FHD's Design Department normally employ-
ing consultants on specified terms of reference. Supervision of construc-
tion is undertaken by the Construction Department of FHD, frequently



- 26 -
assisted by consultant staff. There is a large and fairly well-equipped road
contracting industry. RFW maintains a list of approved and registered con-
tractors. In building and civil engineering, there are four categories of
contractors, their classification depending on the size of the contract they
are assessed as competent to undertake:
Category         Value of Works (Naira)
A               Up to 20,000
B            20,001 to 200,000
C           200,001 to 2 million
D               Over 2 million
Source: Federal Ministry of Works
During the early years of the Third Development Plan, use was made of con-
tractor financing. This and the urge for rapid investment encouraged high
prices. FII has ceased to employ contractor financing amongst other measures
taken during the past two years to promote more effective cost control, which
is also one of the main objectives of technical assistance to be provided for
the Construction Department of FDH under the project (para. 3.13).
2.37      Consultancy practice is regulated by the Council of Registered
Engineers of Nigeria and all consultants are required to register with the
Council.  In both consultancy and contracting, there are regulations stipu-
lating a minimum level of Nigerian financial participation, normally 60% for
contractors and 40% for consultants. These regulations, together with
controls over the proportion of contract fees which can be exported, have
resulted in a high and increasing proportion of Nigerian participation in both
consulting and contracting.
J.   Maintenance
2.38      Road maintenance in Nigeria is beset by many problems.  Since
1978 state ministries of works acting as agent authorities for FMW have been
responsible for the maintenance of federal trunk roads. On asphalted roads
which now make up almost 60% of the federal network some state ministries of
works have been able to undertake routine maintenance and some periodic
maintenance quite well. Many have not. No state has been able to maintain
the gravel and earth roads in the federal network satisfactorily. There are
two main reasons for this, one the acute shortage of technical staff at all
levels in most states and the other the widely varying condition of the roads
in the federal network.
2.39      The length of asphalted road in the federal network now approaches
17,000 km. Of these some 11,000 have been constructed or reconstructed in
the past 10 years. Although on these relatively new roads naintenance is



- 27 -
usually neither difficult nor expensive, some have quite light pavements and
under the increasingly heavy traffic the task of keeping the pavements under
repair can become onerous. Much of the remaining 6,000 km of asphalted roads
is in poor condition and needs to be rehabilitated and improved before it can
be put under effective regular maintenance. There are about 13,000 km of
gravel and earth roads, all in the Trunk Roads F network; possibly between 20
and 30% of them are in a condition that they can be kept in adequate order by
the normal operations of routine and periodic maintenance. The remainder is
in need of rehabilitation or often complete reconstruction. Thus about half
the total federal road network has not yet been improved to a standard at
which regular maintenance can be effective.
2.40      This situation is recognized by FMW and it is presently implementing
an emergency program to rehabilitate some 2,100 km of federal trunk roads,
mostly part of the Trunk F network. The work consists of the minimum necessary
to make the roads serviceable. Minimum specifications are being employed and
there is no doubt that when the work is completed, good maintenance will be
needed to keep the roads open and it is likely that substantial strengthening
will be required within 4-5 years to ensure continued use of these roads. The
Fourth Development Plan is expected to feature a component to continue the
rehabilitation of the remaining defective sections of the federal trunk road
network. There is considerable economic waste implicit in short-term emergency
road improvement measures as demonstrated in the evaluation of the strengthen-
ing of the six project roads. It is expected that as the proposed pavement
evaluation unit under the project becomes functional, FMW will increasingly
use rational engineering methods in the design of its pavement rehabilitation
and strengthening work to obtain economically optimal solutions.
2.41      During negotiations the Government informed the Bank of a further
recent development; it is now proposed to use contractors for the routine and
periodic maintenance of about 10,000 km of the Federal Trunk Road system. In
order to account for this development, the scope of the training program under
the project will be modified to allow for training or a larger number of
supervisory rather than operational road maintenance staff (para 2.44). The
Bank will follow the proposed maintenance program, to be implemented under
contract, with considerable interest and will offer such assistance as is
possible in the context of the useful technical cooperation which has devel-
oped between FMW and the Bank.
K.   Training
2.42      Nigeria is acutely short of trained and experienced professional
and sub-professional staff in highway engineering. Further, the building up
of effective highway organizations in the new state and local government
organizations has been handicapped by the greater opportunities in private
industry. It seems likely that significant improvements will have to await
the maturing of the large numbers of the Nigerians now passing through the
country's technical education system. FMW has been developing its own
facilities for training road maintenance technicians. As part of the Fifth
Highway Project (Loan 838-UJNI) Danish consultants Kampsax were engaged to
advise on road maintenance. Their report issued in 1974 contained two series



- 28 -
of recommendations, one aiming to establish an effective federal road mainte-
nance organization and the other to build up a training organization to remedy
the acute shortage of road foremen, machinery operators and mechanics in the
public service. FMW continued to employ the consultants on yearly contracts
to implement their recommendations.
2.43      The consultants' direct concern with the organization and execution
of road maintenance ceased when responsibility for the execution of mainte-
nance on federal roads passed to the states in 1978. But the Federal Govern-
ment retained responsibility for training and the consultants were retained
for this purpose. A training center for foremen, mechanics and plant operators
was established at Ugoneki in Bendel State and started operations in November
1976. The original concept was to train instructors but short-term needs
became pressing and the center turned to the training of technicians who
could be put to useful work as soon as their training was complete. Currently,
the output is about 200 trainees per year. Plans were also made for a
training center for instructors at Kaduna. There were delays in obtaining
accommodation, and this center did not become operational until February
1978, using the consultants offices supplemented by mobile offices. A third
training center, again in mobile accommodation, came into operation in Lagos
in December 1978. Almost all trainees now come from the state ministries of
works.
2.44      A survey undertaken in 1979 by FHD's Maintenance Division assisted
by the consultants showed a large unfulfilled demand for training in all
states (para 3.11), and that all states except Kaduna expressed a strong
desire to continue to use the federal training facilities for road maintenance
technicians. The consultants' contract for training road technicians has
been renewed for the financial year 1979/80 under the Fifth Highway Project.
A further extension of the contract from April to September 1980 will be made
under the Fifth Highway Project to ensure continuity of operations until the
start of the proposed project. The Sixth Highway Project contains provision
for this training to be continued and expanded. The proposal to undertake the
maintenance of about a third of the Federal Trunk Roads by contract (para.
2.41) affects the demand for training in two ways:
(a) it intensifies the need for road superintendents to overlook the
work of contractors, and diminishes the demand for mechanics and
machinery operators for work on federal roads, and
(b) it makes possible a more rapid move towards establishing training
schools at the state level to train technicians for maintenance
of state and local government council roads.
L.   Project Performance Audit Reports
2.45      OED Audit Reports prepared for the Apapa Road, Western Road, and
Highway and Transport Rehabilitation projects (Reports No. 1229, 1639, 1410
and 2092) offer a number of lessons that are relevant to this project:
that considerable skill and judgment are required in predicting traffic growth
in Nigeria (Loans 426, 427, and 640-UNI); that there is little purpose in
providing equipment for road maintenance unless there are adequate resources



- 29 -
of trained staff to put the machinery to good use (Loan 427-UNI), and that
particular care is necessary in reconciling the Bank's rules on procurement
and the use of consultants with Nigerian practice (Loan 640-UNI). In prepar-
ing this project, considerable effort has been put into studying existing
traffic c the project roads and the factors likely to influence future
traffic growth; and in road maintenance the main effort lies in building up
the stock of trained technicians and supervisory staff. Procurement matters
have been the subject of considerable discussion with FUWJ during preparation
of this project; the understandings reached are expected to reduce possible
disagreements during project implementation.
2.46      There are three other issues highlighted by the audit reports; these
relate to arrangements for construction supervision, reflecting the Nigerian
preference to use their own staff rather than consultants (Apapa Road Project),
recruitment of specialist staff on terms and conditions corresponding to those
of the civil service (Western Road Project), and the slow pace of loan dis-
bursements.  The first two are the subject of loan covenants (para 5.02); in
case of loan disbursements, significant progress has been achieved in the last
two years as FIMW has increasingly become familiar with Bank disbursement
procedures.
M.   Context of the Proposed Loan
2.47      The Third Development Plan came into operation in 1975 with the
intention to move quickly in building up an adequate main road network.
Detailed planning of investment priorities in the transport sector and careful
cost control were subordinated to this objective and the results were impres-
sive. In the first three years of the plan, some 60% of the 13,000 km of
Trunk Road A had been reconstructed or improved at a cost of N 1,860 mil-
lion. At the same time, road traffic had been increasing at the phenomenal
rate of 30% per year and there can be no doubt that this road building programv
was timely.
2.48      By late 1977, it was becoming clear that revenues were not suffi-
cient to continue the plan as originally conceived.  Capital expenditure on
federal roads was cut from N 958 million in 1977/78 to N 580 million in
1978/79.  There were other doubts.  Road building prices had spiralled; though
many of the new roads were built to adequate geometric standards, their
pavements were often ueak, and there were signs on these and on many of the
older roads that the pavements were inadequate in strength to support the
increasing traffic. Road maintenance was not being effectively done.
The resources provided by the Federal Government to state ministries of
works for the maintenance of federal trunk roads have fallen short of the
need. But the effective constraint in most of the 19 states is that the state
ministries of works lack the trained and experienced staff necessary to
undertake effective maintenance on the roads in their care. The shortage of
staff is acute at Federal, State and Local Government levels and it consti-
tutes the main handicap to the effective execution of road planning, construc-
tion and maintenance at all levels. When investment funds are available, the
natural trend has been to concentrate the available effort on construction to
the neglect of planning and maintenance.



- 30 -
2.49      It was in this atmosphere that contact was renewed between the Bank
and the Federal Ministry of Works in December 1977 to plan the Sixth Hlighway
Project in Nigeria. FlHW had a lingering distrust of the Bank's procedures and
methods, particularly the use of economic criteria in project evaluation, but
project preparation proceeded, building on FHW's manifest desire to improve
its road planning and maintenance operations. The renewed dialogue between
the Bank and FMW has paralleled a number of important developments: a serious
interest on the part of FMW to reduce the cost of highway construction;
preparation of a nationwide traffic census; a renewed emphasis on the training
program for road maintenance personnel; a start in controlling vehicle axle
loads; and a gradual understanding and acceptance of Bank procedures in
general. A better grasp of economic criteria in project evaluation has
emerged, particularly in its use in selecting optimal engineering designs, but
FMW officials remain concerned that detailed investment planning in their
context of constrained personnel resources consumes an inordinate amount of
time and delays progress in achieving concrete results.
2.50      These developments, although limited in scope, are auspicious
beginnings in tackling the major problems constraining the orderly development
of the highway sector, in which much remains to be done:
-    the federal highway organization needs to be restructured in order
to provide for effective management of the federal road development
program;
-    there is an acute shortage of trained technical manpower and
executive capacity needs to be almost doubled to effectively
manage the ongoing highway construction and maintenance programs;
-    the maintenance infrastructure necessary to cope with an extended
network carrying increasingly heavier traffic exists only at an
embryonic stage;
-    the planning capacity is only a fraction of what is required to
deal with the volume of work currently underway;
-    the trunk road network is still inadequate both in terms of
coverage and in terms of condition, particularly the Trunk F
roads which link regional agricultural and commercial centers
with the major Trunk A roads; and
-    the secondary road system (the state network) is virtually
nonexistent.
2.51      The primary motive of the proposed project is to assist FHW in
maximizing the economic benefits from its investments in highway infra-
structure. The main financial component provides for strengthening of weak
pavements on Federal trunk roads; this would help preserve the serviceability
of these roads and avoid expensive reconstruction. The planning and design of
the road strenghtening component has provided the opportunity to introduce
into Nigeria techniques of optimizing pavement strengthening, through the
establishment of a pavement evaluation unit within FH1W that will not only



- 31 -
extend the use of rational pavement strengthening methods to the entire road
network but will set up a system geared at anticipating strengthening needs
long before the critical point is reached where nothing short of reconstruc-
tion would help to restore road serviceability. Other elements of the
project combine to provide a concerted approach to strengt' en FMW's institu-
tional capacity. A study of the possible need to upgrade a major link in the
main trunk road network between Calabar and the North and East of the country
provides opportunity to stimulate the use of careful engineering and economic
studies as a preliminary to investment. A federal trunk roads study would
help to establish improvement priorities for the further restoration of
the federal trunk road system, based on appropriate economic and engineering
criteria. A training consultancy for road maintenance technicians will,
within a period of three years, almost be meeting the needs of state minis-
tries of works for such technicians. The project also provides for specialist
staff to fill critical line-management posts in PHD in the areas of road
planning, design, construction and maintenance. There is, in addition, a
small component aimed to assist in improving road safety.

III. THE PROJECT
A.   Oblectives
3.01      The project is predicated on the primary objective to assist the
Federal Ministry of Works in augmenting its capacity for road planning,
design, construction and maintenance. It would provide assistance in intro-
ducing systematic highway planning at the federal level, in building up the
stock of road maintenance technicians, and in relieving the heavy toll of road
accidents. The road works component provides for the strengthening of six
sections of the federal trunk road system; the planning of this work has
provided the opportunity to introduce into Nigeria improved techniques of
assessing road strengthening requirements.
B.   Project Description
3.02      The project components are as follows:
A.   Road Works
Strengthening of about 520 km of Federal Trunk roads;
B.   Studies
(i)  Economic and engineering studies for the improvement
of Trunk Road A4-2 between Calabar and Ikom via Ekang;
(ii) Economic and technical studies to establish improvement
priorities for the further restoration of the Federal trunk
road system, particularly the trunk F roads.
C.   Technical Assistance
(i)     The continuation and extension of a training program for
road maintenance technicians;
(ii)    The provision of specialist professional staff to fill
important posts in FMW concerned with planning,
design, construction and maintenance of roads and to
establish a pavement evaluation unit, together with
assistance in providing housing for such staff in Lagos.
D.   Equipment
(i)     Highway safety equipment for the National Road Safety
Commission;
(ii)    Pavement evaluation equipment for FMW's Civil Engineering
Division.

Road Works
3.03      The six roads to be strengthened were selected on the following
basis:
(a) ihey form important links in the federal network.
(b) The pavements are in such a deteriorated condition that early
strengthening is imperative.
(c) They represent a spectrum of pavement types and of topographical and
climatic characteristics so that the experience gained in design and
construction will be of considerable value in refining techniques of
road strengthening in Nigeria.
(d)  They form part of FMW's continuing program for the strengthening
of trunk roads.
3.04      The location of the six roads is shown on Map I.  They are:
Location              State             Designation       Length (km)
Mlaiduguri-Gambaru        Borno          Trunk Road A-3            137
Maiduguri-Bama            Borno          Trunk Road A-4             73
Gombe-Biu             Bauchi/Borno       Trunk Road F-129          127
Ilorin-Omu Aran           Kwara          Trunk Road A-123           80
Ore-Ondo                  Ondo           Trunk Road F-209           43
Ondo-Ife                 Ondo/Oyo        Trunk Road F-207           61
Each scheme was the subject of a detailed study undertaken by consultants
between April and November 1979, financed under the Fifth Highway Project.
The studies have included measurements of the axle load spectra on the roads
and detailed assessments of the strength of the existing pavements and designs
have been made using this data and careful assessments of likely traffic
growth. The strengthening works have been designed to be adequate for the
expected traffic loading over the next ten years. The major component of the
works consists of adding a strengthening layer of asphaltic concrete. On some
of the contracts, short lengths of pavement will require reconstruction.
There are some ancillary works in widening pavements where necessary, restoring
shoulders and in repairing and improving drainage facilities. No work on
realignment is involved. Details of the engineering history and proposed
works on each road are included in Annex 1.
Studies
3.05      Calabar-Ikom road (Trunk Road A-4-2).  The existing Trunk Road A-4
provides an effective link between the port of Calabar and its western hinter-
land. But in linking with the trunk road system which serves the north and
the east of the country, it turns in a wide circle covering some 220 km to
reach Ikom, which on a direct line is some 135 km from Calabar. A more direct



- 34 -
route exists between Calabar and Ikom in Trunk Road A-4-2, which runs north-
south paralleling and close to the border with Cameroon. This route is open
to traffic only for a short distance north of Calabar. The Government of
Cross River State has, for some time, wished to bring the whole route back
into service to improve road access to the eastern part of the State. In
addition, the link would considerably shorten the travelling distance to the
north and east of Nigeria from the port of Calabar.
3.06      Over the northern length approaching Ikom, the existing route
descends to an incompleted crossing of the Cross River. This area is being
considered for water conservation works. The river crossing might form a
component of such works. Alternatively, there is the possibility of relocat-
ing the northern section of the route on a more direct line avoiding a river
crossing until the immediate approaches to Ikom. Thus, the studies must
involve a careful assessment of the impact of possible alternative align-
ments on the life of the local people as well as the value of the link and
the alternative possible routes in the communication network of the area.
This is a mountainous area covered in some parts with dense forest.
3.07      It is therefore proposed to undertake the study in two stages.
Stage I will investigate the engineering feasibility of alternative alignments
and examine the economic and social value of each. This should enable deci-
sions to be made on the viability of the whole scheme and on the selection of
the preferred route.  Should Stage I demonstrate that the scheme is viable and
with the prospect of obtaining the necessary funding for construction, Stage
II, involving detailed engineering and the preparation of contract documents,
will be undertaken as part of the project. Consultants will be engaged to
undertake the studies; proposals for Stage 1 have been received from consul-
tants.
3.08      Federal trunk roads.  One of the objectives of the Fourth National
Development Plan is to continue to consolidate the existing network of Federal
Trunk Roads A and F so that it is adequate to meet the continuing increase
in the demand for road transport services. It is expected that road transport
will retain its predominant position in the transport of people and goods for
some time in the future, as plans to improve the efficiency of the railways
come to fruition. The implications on the federal trunk road system are that:
(a)  on some 15,000 km, which have been improved to reasonably adequate
geometric standards, there will be a continued need for pavement
strengthening plus such minor rehabilitation as is necessary so
that they can continue to carry the increasing traffic;
(b) on the remaining 14,000 km of the federal trunk road system the
ongoing program of rehabilitation will be continued, aiming to
develop the system in a way which will best suit the country's
economic and social needs.
In the early stages of the program to rehabilitate the federal trunk road
system, choices and priorities were reasonably obvious; the aim was to develop
the grid of north-south and east-west trunk roads. This task is now approach-
ing completion. On the remaining 14,000 km of the federal trunk road system,



- 35 -
choices and priorities are less obvious and during negotiations the Government
requested that the project include a study to build up a data base on which
the further restoration of the federal trunk road system could be planned in the
most economical way.
3.09      There are broadly three tasks in such a study:
(a) to determine the present traffic demand and estimate the potential
traffic demand over each length of the unimproved Trunk Roads A
and F system on a network-wide basis;
(b) to survey the present condition of each length of the network and
to determine the nature and cost of the remedial works necessary to
bring it up to levels of service concomitant with the expected
traffic; and
(c) to produce a priority program for the rehabilitation of the
unimproved part of the federal trunk road system based on economic
and technical considerations.
3.10      Consultants (about 200 man-months) will be employed to undertake
this study; it is envisaged that they will work closely with the Planning
Department of FHD so that the study produces a methodology which can continue
to be used in adjusting priorities to meet changing needs. The study will be
carried out in two stages. A preliminary study (Stage 1) of six months
duration will be undertaken to review and compile existing data, conceptualize
the main study and produce a first-year construction program for improvements
to the most critical lengths of the unimproved trunk road system. This
will be followed by a detailed main study (Stage 2) which is expected to
consist of four regional sub-studies, each covering one of the four construc-
tion regions of FHD. The regional studies, however, will be carried out in
accordance with the guidelines set forth in the preliminary study and will be
consistent with the scope of work outlined in para 3.09.
Technical Assistance
3.11      Training for road maintenance.  There is an acute shortage of road
maintenance foremen, machinery operators and mechanics in the public services.
A survey has shown that all but one state are eager to avail themselves of
training facilities provided by FMW (para 2.44). It has not been possible to
obtain well-based estimates of the demand for such training, but taking into
account also the growing needs of Local Government Councils, it is likely that
there will be a continuing demand for the training of about 1,500 road mainte-
nance technicians each year.
3.12      Consultants, Kampsax (Nigeria), have instituted training courses at
three centers, Ugoneki, Kaduna, and Lagos (para 2.43). The present training
courses, as exemplified by those at Ugoneki which have been running the long-
est, maintain a good balance between classroom instruction and field training
in real-life maintenance operations. It is intended to engage consultants
for a further three years as part of the project, providing also for expan-
sion of the facilities at Ugoneki and for adequate, more permanent facilities
at Kaduna and Lagos. The planned output of trainees is about 1,600



- 36 -
per year, including both long and short courses, with a total output of about
5,000 trainees over the three-year period. The three centers are fairly
well-situated geographically to serve the needs of the country, but considera-
tion will be given to a fourth center possibly based in the eastern part of
the country if the need is demonstrated. Outline terms of reference for the
consultancy services are given in Annex 2. It is the intention to develop
internal capacity within FMW to take up and continue this training function
with Nigerian staff, and the training consultants will be asked to prepare a
program for the transfer of training staff to the FMW complement with this
in mind. However, it seems unlikely that this objective will be fully
achieved within the span of a single project. To effect an orderly transition
from the consultants to local staff, the Government will (a) designate a chief
engineer, within FHD, responsible for the planning and management of training
programs for road maintenance activities and (b) prepare, by March 31, 1982, a
realistic plan and time schedule for the transfer of training responsibilities
from the consultants to FHD.
3.13      Technical Assistance to FMW.  The acute shortage of professional
staff in FHD is considerably hampering the fields of road planning, traffic
engineering and road maintenance. Until they can be found within Nigeria, the
Government accepts that they will need to draw on foreign sources. The
project provides for 13 such experts; specifications for each post have been
prepared and are given in Annex 3. The experts will fill line management
posts within FMW. At the moment, the staff shortage is such that there is
little prospect of providing Nigerian counterparts for most of the posts. Two
of the thirteen posts (4 man-years) are within CED to establish a Pavement
Evaluation Unit (Annex 3, Part III). The proposed project also provides funds
for the acquisition of equipment for this unit (para. 3.16). The remaining 11
(24 man-years) experts are to fill posts in the headquarters organization of
FHD, three engineers and one transport economist for the Planning Department,
two engineers each for the Design and Construction Departments and three for
the Maintenance Department.
3.14      During project preparation the Bank has been assisting the Govern-
ment in contacting foreign governments and organizations seeking to obtain
these experts. Contacts have been made with the federal governments of
Australia, India and the USA and with national highway authorities in Great
Britain and the Netherlands. As yet these contacts have failed to produce
offers of expertise, one reason being the difficulty in providing attractive
living and working conditions in Lagos. More adequate office accommodation
should be available in the new FMW office block which should be occupied
by the end of 1980. The housing shortage in Lagos is acute; the project,
therefore, includes provision for the construction of 14 housing units for
technical assistance staff. The housing units will remain in the control of
FMW for the duration of the project and technical assistance staff will at all
times have priority in their allocation. Should the present efforts to obtain
technical assistance staff, by direct recruitment or under bilateral assis-
tance fail, then consultants with appropriate qualifications and experience
will be engaged to provide the necessary technical assistance. The



- 37 -
employment of such consultants will be financed under the project and
they will be engaged only if experts are not recruited by other means by
December 31, 1981.
Highway Safety and Pavement Evaluation Equipment
3.15      The National Road Safety Commission (para 2.18) administers funds
for road safety activities at federal and state level. Whilst their prime
concern is with accident prevention they recognize that at this stage it is
also important to improve the arrangements for coping with accidents which
have occurred, to provide prompt medical attention to the injured and, on busy
roads particularly, to restore normal traffic operations as quickly as possi-
ble. Some of these functions are carried out by the highway patrols operated
by the Nigeria Police. Organized at the federal level there are some 80 such
highway patrols now active on federal roads throughout the country, equipped
with patrol cars and ambulances. At state level emergency medical services
for road accidents are operated by the Red Cross in cooperation with the
police, the road safety corps and the state ministries of works. There is a
particular shortage of ambulances and recovery vehicles and equipment to gain
access to the injured and to move damaged vehicles. A list of the equipment
to be acquired under the project is given in Annex 4. This equipment will be
allotted to the various users through the National Road Safety Commission.
FMW will nominate a Road Safety Liaison Officer who will be responsible for
the procurement, allocation and monitoring of the use of the road safety
vehicles and equipment provided under the project. FMW will also prepare and
provide the Bank with quarterly progress reports on the use of the highway
safety equipment.
3.16      The project provides for the establishment of a Pavement Evaluation
Unit (PEU) in CED by December 31, 1981. PEU will require special skills and
equipment in order to undertake its tasks. Technical assistance is provided
under the project to assist in building up these skills (see para 3.13 and
Annex 3, Part III). Pavement evaluation can start using the simple deflection
beams and visual assessment used in the studies on the six project roads. But
such methods are slow and tedious and as the unit becomes effective, it will
be possible to employ more sophisticated equipment (e.g., a deflectograph)
which can produce reliable data more quickly. The requirement is for rapid
means of evaluating the in-situ strength of pavements with ancillary apparatus
to measure surface roughness and other pavement characteristics. The procure-
ment of a deflectograph, however, will be deferred until PEU is fully opera-
tional (para. 3.29).
C.   Project Costs and Financing
3.17      The estimated cost of the project net of taxes is US$170.9 million,
made up of US$62.8 million local costs and US$108.1 million foreign costs.
Taxes are estimated at US$7.1 million. Project costs for individual items are
summarized in the table on the next page. The costs quoted for the road
strengthening works are based on the consultants' estimates. Bids are
expected to be available by August 1980. Costs of housing for technical

assistance staff in Lagos have been estimated by FMW using current building
costs for similar property.
3.18      The maintenance training will require about 780 man-months of
consultant services spread over three years at an estimated cost of US$9.3
million in 1979 prices. The average man-month cost includiing salaries, local
and overseas allowances, travel, medical expenses and the firm's overhead and
profits is expected to be about US$10,300. In addition to these staff costs,
the three-year training consultancy includes a sum of N1.2 million (US$2.2
million) for salaries of local support staff, vehicles and their insurance,
training aids, and other minor items. The consultants expect that there will
be an output of some 5,000 trainees over the project period. If this output
is obtained, the average cost per trainee will be of the order of US$1,860.
The average cost of technical assistance staff for FMW (US$3.1 million for 336
man-months), the consultancy services for supervision of works (US$1.2 million
for 120 man-months) and the Federal Trunk Road Study (US$2.4 million for 200
man-months) is estimated at about US$9,200 per man-month, made up of salaries,
annual leave, international travel, subsistence and overseas allowances and
the firm's overheads and responsibility fee or profits as applicable. The
total estimated cost includes provision for other reimbursable items such
as local travel, provision for the cost of vehicles, equipment and materials.
The preliminary engineering-economic study. and detailed engineering for the
Calabar-Ikom road are estimated to cost about US$0.55 million and US$1.36
million, respectively. The unit rates for 'the preliminary study and detailed
engineering, based on the employment of a consulting firm, are estimated at
about US$4,100 and US$10,000 per km, respectively. The relatively high cost
of this work is attributed to the remoteness and difficult terrain of the
study area.
3.19      Physical contingencies of 10% have been provided on the civil works.
In dealing with price adjustments local prices have been inflated at 15% per
year in accordance with current trends. Price adjustments on foreign costs
have been calculated at 12% for 1980 and 10% for succeeding years. Total
contingencies are estimated at 42% of base cost.
3.20      Of the total project cost of N97.9 million (US$178.0 million), the
Bank would finance N59.5 million (US$108.0 million) at the lending rate
current at the time of the loan approval and for a period of 20 years, includ-
ing a five-year grace period. The Bank loan would cover 61% of total project
costs (or 63% of project costs net of taxes), equivalent to the foreign
exchange cost. The Governiment would finance N38.4 million, representing 39%
of project costs.
D.   Implementation
3.21      FMW will be executing agency for the proposed project.  An action
plan to initiate project implementation is given in Annex 5. The appoint-
ment of a Project Coordinator should facilitate the execution of the project,
particularly the arrangements for the payment of accounts and applications for
disbursement, which on past projects, have been somewhat tardy. His designa-
tion and the continuation of this position during the project implementation
period has been confirmed during negotiations together with the appointment of

a Road Safety Liaison Officer to be responsible for liaison between FMw and
the NRSC in the procurement and distribution of the road safety equipment.
The timing of the different project activities is as shown below.

It is likely that at least a year will be required for the technical
assistance to F1MW to be built up to the level intended. The duration of
this technical assistance has therefore been planned to extend to the latter
half of 1984. Because of this and to meet the possibility of small delays
in other project components, the project will be of four years duration.

3.22      Supervision of the road works contracts will be undertaken by the
FMW assisted by staff hired from consultants while construction of housing
units will be supervised directly by FMW staff. The housing units will be
designed by FMW's Public Buildings Division. The road strengthening contracts
are not comDlicated but special technical skills are needed, for example in
making sure that the asphaltic concrete strengthening provided by the contrac--
tor meets the intentions of the specifications. It has been agreed with the
Government that the supervisory staff provided by FMW will be adequate in
training and experience for the proposed works, and that FMW will provide the'-
Bank with reports every three months on the physical progress and financial
expenditure on each of the road and housing contracts. FMW will also prepare
a final report on project execution to serve as the basis for preparation of a
project completion report.
E.   Procurement
3.23      The six road strengthening contracts, valued at about N78 million
(US$141.8 million), will be undertaken by contractors engaged under interna-
tional competitive bidding.  For contractors already registered in Nigeria,
classification in category D of FMW's list of approved civil engineering
contractors (para 2.36) will be considered adequate prequalification.  Any
international contractor not so registered, provided his bid is responsive,
will be evaluated with local bidders in post-bidding qualification.  Foreign
firms, if awarded such contracts under international competitive bidding
procedures of the Bank, will be exempt from Nigerian laws regarding incorpora-
tion and shareholding. The construction of staff housing in Lagos is to be
arranged in two separate contracts, one for a block of six housing units to
proceed immediately and the other for a block of eight housing units to
proceed on an adjacent site as soon as site preparations are complete. The
total cost of the two contracts is expected to be approximately N2.3 million
(US$4.1 million). In view of the relatively small size of these contracts,
the established competence and competitiveness of the local building contrac-
tors, and the need to have the housing units built expeditiously, the two
housing contracts will be let under local competitive bidding procedures. The
two contracts will be advertised separately in the local press and bidding
will be open to foreign firms registered in Nigeria.
3.24      FMW has prepared a three-year contract, estimated at N7.4 million
(US$13.5 million), to continue and extend the consultancy for training road
maintenance technicians as part of the project. During negotiations Govern-
ment indicated that discussions were currently in progress between consultants
Kampsax (Nigeria) and their associates in the current training program in
Nigeria, consultants ORT, as to which organization should have the primary
role in any future consultancy. The Bank, recognizing ORT's important role in
the current training program, indicated that with appropriate safeguards
either consultant would be acceptable. The new training contract will be
finalized by September 30, 1980. The services of other consultants and
technical assistance staff to be engaged under the project, valued at about
N6.5 million (US$11.8 million), would be obtained on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank.



- 42 -
3.25      Highway safety and pavement evaluation equipment, valued at about
N 3.4 million (US$6.3 million) would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts for less
than US$100,000 would be procured according to local competltive procedures
acceptable to the Bank. For contracts of less than US$30,000, competitive
shopping would be employed. Items for procurement would be bulked to permit
optimum use of competitive bidding. Total purchases under the latter proce-
dures are estimated at N300,000 (US$550,000). Domestically manufactured
goods would be allowed a 15% preference or the applicable import duty, which-
ever is lower, when comparing bids with those of foreign manufacturers.
F.   Project Risks
3.26      The road strengthening program has few technical risks as it is
based on sound pavement engineering principles and involves normal road
construction practice. Construction costs, however, are likely to increase
if the proposed pavement strengthening is delayed beyond the 1980-81 dry
seasons because of additional work resulting from further deterioration
of the roads. Inadequate supervision could adversely affect the quality of
strengthening since special technical skills are necessary to ensure that the
asphalt concrete overlays laid by the contractors meet the intentions of the
specifications.
3.27      In view of the acute need for technical expertise at all levels,
the project has been planned with a heavy involvement in the building up
of Nigerian institutions, specifically in the training of technicians, in
providing expert staff to fill senior executive posts in FMW and in introduc-
ing improved techniques for pavement evaluation.
3.28      There is a possibility that the project may not achieve some of
its institutional objectives. The existing organizational and management
structure of FHD, combined with the difficult living and working conditions in
Lagos could militate against the effective use of specialist staff provided
under the project to augment FMW's highway planning and engineering capabili-
ties.
G.   Disbursements
3.29      The foreign component of the costs of all project items will be
financed from the proposed loan. Disbursements will be distributed as
follows:
(i)  61% of the total costs of the civil works in the strengthening
of the six project roads and of the total costs of the expendi-
ture on housing for technical assistance staff in Lagos:
US$79.4 million;
(ii)  70% of the total expenditure on supervision of the road works:
US$0.7 million;
(iii)  70% of the total expenditure on the studies of the Calabar-
Ikom road and of the federal trunk roads: US$3.5 million;



- 43 -
(iv) 70% of total expenditure on consultancy services for the
road maintenance training program: US$7.4 million;
(v) 70% of total expenditure for the technical assistance
to FMW: US$2.5 million; and
(vi) 100% of foreign expenditures (directly imported items) and 83%
of total expenditures (locally produced items) for equipment
for the National Road Safety Commission and the Pavement
Evaluation Unit: US$3.7 million.
An amount of US$10.8 million will remain unallocated. Disbursement of loan
funds will be made against normal documentation for all items. No loan
funds will be disbursed against expenditures for highway safety equipment
until the appointment of a Road Safety Liaison Officer in FMW (para. 3.21).
The establishment and staffing of a pavement evaluation unit will be a condi-
tion of disbursement of loan funds for purchase of a deflectograph (para.
3.13 and 3.16). A projected schedule of disbursements is given on the next
page, based on the project implementation schedule and assuming a three-month
interval between the time at which expenditures are incurred and the time when
reimbursements are made by the Bank in response to claims from FMW.
3.30      There is a record in Nigeria of considerable delays in the submis-
sion of claims for reimbursement from previous highway loans. During prepara-
tions for this project Bank missions have assisted FMW in building up an
improved organization for the submission of claims for reimbursement.

IV.  ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Project Benefits
4.01      Road transport is the predominant mode for the movement of goods
and passengers in Nigeria, accounting for over 90% of total haulage to
and from the ports. Hence, the maintenance and continued serviceability
of the road network is a basic requirement for the realization of Nigeria's
agricultural and industrial potential.
4.02      The major project benefit would be the extended serviceability of
about 520 km of trunk roads for an additional ten years with minimal routine
maintenance requirements through a pavement strengthening and upgrading
program. A necessary adjunct to the strengthening program is an augmented
road maintenance capability, which the project supports by a training
program for road maintenance personnel and provision of technical assistance.
4.03      By providing equipment for the National Road Safety Commission,
the project would assist in stemming the carnage on the nation's highways and
in reducing the high incidence of roadside fatalities.
4.04      On the institutional side, the project would help improve the
capabilities of the Highways Division of FMW in the areas of planning,
design, construction and maintenance by the provision of expert staff to
fill line positions. One of the more important institutional features of
the project is the development of in-house capability in the Civil Engineering
Division of FMW to undertake pavement deflection surveys, of the type used in
designing the road strengthening program of the project, on a routine basis.
This would eventually help in systematic scheduling of road strengthening
operations on a network-wide basis resulting in optimal use of funds available
for this purpose. A study of the federal trunk roads would assist to build ul?
a data base on which further restoration of the federal trunk road system
would be programmed, based on appropriate economic and engineering criteria.
4.05      Only the road strengthening component of the project has quanti-
fiable benefits; these are expressed in terms of savings in vehicle operating
costs and reduction in maintenance expenditures on the project roads. Costs
and benefits are calculated in Naira, net of taxes, in 1979 prices. The
opportunity cost of capital in Nigeria is estimated at about 11% p.a. The
overall economic rate of return for the road strengthening component of the
project, costing N 55.7 million (US$101.3 million) and accounting for 77% of
project costs, excluding taxes and price contingencies, is estimated at 30%.
B.   Road Strengthening Program
4.06      A summary description of the roads and the areas they serve is
given in Annex 1.

Traffic
4.07      Traffic on the project roads was estimated on the basis of 12-18
hour, 7-day classified counts, adjusted for daily and seasonal variations,
and origin-destination surveys carried out by consultants. As FMlW does not
carry out traffic census on a regular and systematic basis, approximate
traffic growth trends were established by comparison with available traffic
data from past studies of the project roads. The past traffic growth pat-
terns, however, do not provide stable trends that could be used to make
future traffic projections. The period 1975-78 was marked with rapid growth
(20-30% p.a. in some cases) in vehicular traffic, coinciding with the expan-
sion in the vehicle fleet (para. 2.06) and the increase in fuel consumption
(para. 2.08). The more pronounced rates of growth, however, have been asso-
ciated with roads that initially had low traffic volumes (e.g., Maiduguri-
Bama, which had an ADT of 375 in 1973) or were located in areas that.experi-
enced substantial economic expansion (e.g., Gombe-Biu road as a result of the
Gombe Agricultural Development Project and the creation of Bauchi State in
1976). Roads in areas with a well-established economic base and relatively
high initial traffic volumes have experienced more moderate rates of traffic
increase; traffic on Ondo-Ife road increased from about 3300 vpd in 1975 to
5100 vpd in 1979, representing an average growth of about 12% p.a., compared
to 15% p.a. during 1970-75. Traffic forecasts for project roads were made by
adjusting the historical growth rate by a consideration of regional traffic
patterns, local trends of fuel consumption and motorization, and planned
developments in the influence zones of the roads. For years beyond 1984, the
rate of traffic increase was nominally reduced, as it was considered unlikely
that growth rates of 8-13% p.a. in predominantly rural traffic could be
indefinitely sustained once a relatively large traffic base was attained.
Estimates of present and future traffic on project roads are given in the
table on the next page.
Design Life
4.08      The economic analysis period conforms to the 10-year design life
used for pavement strengthening. Although both 10- and 15-year design options
were evaluated in the engineering studies, it was decided to use a 10-year
design because:
(i) at the projected rate of traffic growth, geometric capacity
constraints would arise somewhere between 10-15 years for a
majority of the project roads leading either to upgrading
of the roads to 4-lane divided highways or substantial traffic
diversion to alternate routes; under these circumstances,
strengthening the pavements to provide a service life of 15
years was considered premature; and
(ii)  in the judgment of FMW's planning department, the incremental
investment to provide a 15-year design life for project roads
was not justified, given the competing demands for improvement
of other trunk roads.

Vehicle Operating Costs
4.09      Vehicle operating costs (VOC) utilized in the economic analysis
were estimated by using the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Standards
Model (HDM) and vehicle characteristics and cost data collected by Bank
missions during project preparation. Operating costs (net of taxes) for
six typical vehicles, expressed as a function of road roughness, are given
below:

Road roughness is an index of pavement surface condition, as measured by a
fifth-wheel bump integrator towed at 30 km/hour, and has been shown to be a
significant factor in relating the effect of traffic-induced pavement
deterioration on vehicle-operating costs. Typical roughness values on
paved surfaces range from 1500 (new asphalt-concrete surface) to about
7000 when the pavement would need to be reconstructed. Newly surface-
dressed pavements have an average roughness of 2500 while pavement roughness
values in the order of 3500-4500 suggest the need for remedial measures.
Economic Returns
4.10      The economic evaluation of the pavement strengthening program
compared the costs and benefits associated with pavement management strategies
"with" and "without" the project. The "with project" scenario assumed that
the road pavement would be strengthened, on the basis of pavement condition
and deflection surveys carried out as part of the engineering studies,
to provide continued traffic service for an additional 10 years while reduc-
ing maintenance requirements to a level compatible with FMW's capacity. The



- 49 -
"without project" case assumed minimal routine pavement surface maintenance
applied to existing pavements interspersed by periodic measures (deferred
routine maintenance, i.e., repair of cracked pavement areas not routinely
patched, plus periodic maintenance, i.e., application of a surface treatment
or sand-asphalt seal) to keep the roads open to traffic; a strategy that is
consistent with current FMW maintenance practice. The progre.sion of pavement
cracking and road roughness, as a function of traffic loading, was estimated
by using the statistical relationships developed by the Transport and Road
Research Laboratory (U.K.) after pavement performance studies in Kenya.
Estimated increases in surface roughness were used to compute changes in
vehicle operating costs, and increases in pavement cracking were used to
estimate pavement maintenance requirements. Annex 6 summarizes the statis-
tical relationships and pavement management strategies used in the economic
analysis.
4.11      Project costs include the cost of physical works and related super-
vision while quantified benefits comprise savings in vehicle operating costs
and reduced road maintenance costs.   Economic rates of return range from
20-66% for individual road sections included in the pavement strengthening
programs. First-year benefits for all the roads exceed 11%, indicating that
the timing of the proposed pavement strengthening is not premature. A summary
of the economic analysis is presented in the table on the next page.
Distribution of Benefits
4.12      The roads to be strengthened under the project run through predomi-
nantly rural areas and provide primary access to major agricultural develop-
ment schemes. Nearly all the roads are used to transport agricultural
inputs (seed, fertilizer, fuel, tools, building materials) to farmers living
in the influence zones of the roads and to evacuate agricultural produce to
local and regional markets. Without the strengthening program, the roads
would have to remain under continual repair causing serious disruptions to
the flow of passengers and freight. The road strengthening program would
directly benefit:
(i)     the Federal Government, which would preserve its past
investments and reduce its road maintenanece expenditures;
(ii)    the road transport industry through reduced operating
costs of trucks and passenger vehicles; and
(iii)   in the case of Maiduguri-Gambaru road, the people of
Chad living in the Ndjamena region, who depend on the
continued serviceability of this road for uninterrupted
supply of fuel and other essential consumer goods.

4.13      In the first instance, vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings would
accrue to primary users of the road, i.e., owners of passenger cars and
taxis (comprising 45-50% of all the road users) and commercial truckers.
The road transport industry, however, would claim the major portion of
total VOC savings (about 70%). Since the transport industry in Nigeria, both
for passengers and freight, is fairly competitive, most of the VOC savings
are expected to be passed down to the final consumers of transport services,
in the form of lower passenger fares and freight rates. The rural population
living within the influence areas of the project roads would be the principal
beneficiaries from the expected reduction in transport rates.
4.14      The project will produce tangible and clearly identifiable benefits
for FMW in terms of less stringent maintenance needs for the project roads,
implying reduced maintenance expenditures and lesser strain on FMW's limited
road maintenance capacity.
Sensitivity Analysis
4.15      A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the effect of
changes in design life, construction costs and benefits on the economic rates
of return of project roads. The effect of these variables on the economic
return was evaluated in terms of switching values. The switching or cross-
over value is defined as the percent change in the magnitude of the variable
tested that reduces the economic rate of return to the opportunity cost of
capital (in this case 11%), and is a measure of how far a variable can differ
from its most likely value before the economic rate of return becomes
unacceptable. The two components of project benefits (savings in vehicle
operating costs and reduction in road maintenance costs) had to be treated
jointly as they are significantly correlated and vary symptomatically with
traffic. The results of the sensitivity analysis are given below.

4.16      The pavement strengthening is designed for a 10-year life but
a number of factors--initial under-design, poor workmanship and inadequate
quality control during construction, traffic loads in excess of design values
and insufficient routine maintenance--could shorten the actual service life.
The switching values for design life vary from -3 to -8 years for individual
strengthening items indicating that only a substantially reduced service
life, ranging from 2-7 years, would make the proposed investments uneconomi-
cal. Construction costs increases on individual strengthening items that
would render the project economically unacceptable vary from 51% to 323%, but
cost overruns of this magnitude are considered quite unlikely for the type of
work envisaged. Benefits would have to decline in the range of 32-77% on
individual items before the proposed investments would become uneconomical.
Traffic growth rates, approximately corresponding to the switching values for
benefits, vary from -3.6% p.a. to +4.5% p.a.   The negative growth rates
indicate that traffic would have to decline from the existing levels before
the proposed investment would lose its economic justification. Even for
strengthening components where positive traffic growth rates are indicated at
the switching value of benefits, the likelihood that traffic growth would drop
to these levels is quite low, given that traffic projections for project roads
were made on a very conservative basis. In the more likely event that traffic
growth will exceed the projected increase, the strengthening program would
still retain its economic value but additional pavement strengthening would
be required earlier than 10 years; in the extreme case, if the actual increase
in traffic were double the projected growth, the life of strengthening would
be reduced from the expected 10 years to 6-7 years.

NIGERIA
SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Description of Project Roads
1.        These notes provide descriptive data on the six roads which are
to be strengthened as part of the project. On each road a description is
given of the economic activity associated with the road, followed by an
engineering history of the road and an outline of the proposed works. The
Ife-Ondo and Ondo-Ore roads are treated together as they are contiguous.
A.   Maiduguri-Gambaru (137 km)
2.        The most northerly section of Trunk Road A-3, it links Maiduguri
(population 183,000), the Borno State capital, with Gambaru, the Nigerian
border town on the international route to Chad. Virtually all economic
activity (livestock, agriculture, and agro-industries) in the quadrant of the
state lying northeast of Maiduguri is dependent on the Maiduguri-Gambaru road
which serves as the primary transport route connecting the Lake Chad Basin to
the railhead at Maiduguri, with onward access to the ports of Lagos and Port
Harcourt. With completion of the Trunk Road A-4 between Maiduguri and the new
port of Calabar, the Maiduguri-Gambaru road would connect Chad with the least
time/cost access route to sea involving no intermediate trans-shipment
points. Commodity flows from Nigeria to Chad have consisted of petroleum
products (about 88,000 tons in 1978) from Port Harcourt and Lagos and general
merchandise (averaging over 50,000 tons p.a.) from the regional market at
Maiduguri. Using the increase in regional vehicle population as a surrogate
for traffic growth, it is estimated that local traffic on the road has
increased in the order of 15-20% p.a. during 1974-78. A review of the on-
going and proposed agricultural and agro-industry schemes in the area of
influence of the road (e.g., the Chad Basic Development Project which includes
a 35 MW power generating facility at New Marte to run a major pump irrigation
scheme, a rice mill, a wheat processing plant and related facilities), indi-
cates that traffic growth is likely to average about 8% p.a. from 1979-84 and
5% p.a. thereafter.
3.        The road traverses a gently undulating plain, the relict bed of
Lake Chad. The soils are lacrustine, sandy clays with montmorillonitic clays
(black cotton soil) in the low lying areas. The whole area is subject to
flooding in the wet season. Reconstruction of the road was completed between
1974 and 1978. It provides an extreme example of FMW's policy of reconstruct-
ing to good geometric standards with relatively weak pavements. The road
pavement and shoulders were built of locally occurring sandy clay stabilized
with bitumen and the pavement was surfaced with a bituminous surface dressing.
Signs of pavement distress became evident shortly after each new length was
open to traffic. Such early failure was to be expected particularly as the



- 55 -                            ANITEX 1
Page 2
road carries very heavy vehicles with axle loads up to 20 tons. What is
surprising with this very light construction is that the pavement, though
extensively cracked, is still substantially intact without extensive pot-
holes. In this context, the deflection survey has been particularly useful in
indicating the in-situ pavement strength and the amount of strengthening
required length by length.
4.        Work is already in progress to strengthen the pavement from Mlaiduguri
to Dikwa, about 87 km with a 4 cm asphalt overlay. ihe work proposed under the
project consists of strengthening the remaining 50 km of road with appropriate
thicknesses of overlay, reconstructing short lengths over black cotton soil
and repairing the shoulders and improving the drainage facilities over the
whole length of the road.
B.  Itaiduguri-Bama (73 km)
5.        Part of Trunk Road A-4, this road connects Maiduguri with Bama
(population 36,000), the headquarters of Dikwa Division of Borno State and an
important market and agricultural center, and forms part of the international
road from lIaiduguri to Maroua in Cameroon.  The road provides access to many
villages and towns situated in close proximity to the road. International
traffic to Cameroon is negligible. The major economic activity in the area of
influence of the road is agriculture, the principal crops being guinea corn,
ground nuts, beans, millet and cassava. Close to Bama, vegetables are also
produced. Surplus produce from the villages is transported to lIaiduguri,
Bama, and to weekly markets held at a number of towns along the road. Other
land uses include small mechanized farming units and tree nurseries. The
University of Borno campus on the outskirts of 1iaiduguri is an important
traffic generator. The road is used to haul stone from quarries at Gwoza, 50
km from Bama, for construction works in Maiduguri. Traffic growth on the road
averaged some 35% p.a. between 1973 and 1977 and about 18% between 1977 and
1979.  As no major developments are envisaged during the next five years in
the influence area of the road, the average traffic growth is estimated at
about 8% p.a. during 1979-84 and 5% p.a. in the following years.
6.         The road follows an old shore line of Lake Chad, running along
a slight ridge which consists of sandy soils with low or negligible clay
content. Originally constructed between 1959 and 1961, the road provides an
example of the early and successful use of bitumen-stabilized sand pavement
with a bituminous surface dressing. The road has a 6.15 m wide pavement with
a flush sand-cement curb and with narrow shoulders of natural soils. The
riding quality is still good except for some short lengths, originally trial
sections, where the pavement is deformed, and other occasional potholes. But
the pavement is extensively cracked and in need of remedial treatment.
Deflection measurements show that the pavement structure is still quite
strong. The remedial treatment proposed therefore is a 5-cm overlay after
patching and repair of defective areas and widening of the pavement to 6.7 m,
through provision of two concrete curbs. Since the road was originally
constructed there has been extensive planting of decorative trees immediately
outside the roadside drain. These are now well grown and care will be taken
not to disturb them.

C.   Gombe-Biu (126 km)
7.        Part of Trunk Road F-129, it serves a predominantly agricultural
area with some agro-based industries ranging from the storage and processing
of cotton-seed and groundnuts to the production of tinned tomatoes. Other
than Gombe (about 80,000 population) and Biu (about 30,000 population), there
are no large population centers in the area of influence of the road. The
majority of the population served by the road lives in small farming villages.
The 40 km section of the road between Gombe and Dadinkowa runs roughly along
the northern boundary of the Bank-financed Gombe Agricultural Development
Project (GADP). Main crops grown are sorghum and millet as foodgrains,
(occupying about 25% of agricultural land) beans, cowpeas, maize and a range
of vegetables. Most of these crops are grown for home consumption or for sale
at local markets. Main cash crops are cotton and groundnuts; their production
generates a good proportion of commercial traffic along the road. The major
industries include cotton ginneries and storage facilities at Gombe and Biu,
an oil seed processing factory and a tomato processing plant with its own
7,000 acre farm at Gombe. The proposed construction of a dam on the Gongola
River upstream of Dadinkawa as well as the proposed Bank-financed Bauchi State
Agricultural Development Project are expected to give further impetus to
agricultural production in the area served by the road. Gombe is emerging as
a major regional transport center at the crossroads of major trunk roads
leading to Bauchi to the west, Yola to the southeast, Potiskum to the north
and Maiduguri to the northeast. Traffic has grown at an average rate of
15-20% p.a. during 1975-79; but is estimated to stabilize at an average rate
of about 10% p.a. during 1980-84 and 7% p.a. in the following years. This
is a conservative estimate as the area served by the road has considerable
growth potential particularly in agriculture.
8.        The road was constructed in 1967-69 as a component of the First
Highway Project (Credit 73-UNI). The road traverses undulating country with a
wide variety of residual and transported soils. The road layout and cross
section are good, conforming with FMW standards. During the initial construc-
tion, there were difficulties in the supplies of crushed rock and some parts
of the road were built with bases of natural gravel and of cement-stabilized
soil. Riding quality of the pavement is generally poor. There is extensive
cracking, particularly on the stabilized soil lengths. There are signs of
maintenance in the repair of some potholes and areas of surface treatment.
The deflection survey has been useful in indicating how the thickness of
overlay should be varied to take account of the considerable variations in
strength of the existing pavement. Some lengths of pavement have deteriorated
to the extent that they need to be reconstructed. In addition, it is proposed
to repair some of the drainage structures that are not functioning adequately.
D.   Ilorin-Omu Aran (80 km)
9.        Part of Trunk Road A-123, this road provides primary access to
the eastern half of the Bank-financed Ilorin Agricultural Development Project.
About 63% of the traffic on the road is of a local character with origins and
destination between Ilorin and Omu Aran; heavy commercial traffic is long-haul
with at least one trip-end outside the zone of the influence of the road.
Principal economic activity in the influence area of the road is small-holder



- 57 -                            ANNEX 1
Page 4
agriculture (maize, guinea corn, yams, cassava, vegetables, rice, tobacco and
tree crops and forestry.) Major commodity flows on the road consist of
agricultural produce (20%), industrial goods (20%), building materials (15%),
timber (7%) and fuel (3%). Traffic growth has averaged about 10-15% p.a.
during 197o-79. With the opening of a regional fuel-distribution depot at
Ilorin, some 30,000 tons of fuel will be transported on the road annually
increasing to about 140,000 tons by 1990. The completion of a new road
between Ajasse-Ipo and Oshogbo in late 1980 will provide a more direct route
from the area north of Ilorin to Ondo and Bendel States resulting in the
diversion of about 300 vpd from the Ilorin-Ibadan road to the Ilorin-Omu Aran
road. Traffic is projected to grow at a rate of 11% p.a. during 1979-84 and
8% p.a. in 1985 and subsequent years for the Ilorin-Ajasse Ipo section; the
corresponding growth rates for the Ajasse Ipo-Omu Aran section are estimated
at 13% and 10% respectively. The higher growth for the latter section is
predicated by the expected increase of timber traffic from the southeastern
part of Kwara state to Ilorin and the pulp and paper mill at Jebba.
10.       The road runs through undulating country in the broad savannah
transition separating the rain forests from the semi-arid Sudan zone. It
follows an old alignment, improved when the present road was constructed in
1975-77. Geometric characteristics are adequate though not fully up to FMW's
standards for trunk roads. The pavement consists of a lateritic gravel base
laid either on the old road or on imported gravel sub-base, with a bituminous
surface dressing. It is badly pot-holed and rutted with some lengths of
totally failed pavement. There are other lengths still in fairly good condi-
tion. This is typical evidence of considerable variations in the quality of
the lateritic gravels used in the construction. Also typical is that where
good quality gravels were used and the road well drained, the pavement
strengths as recorded by the deflection survey are quite high. On this road,
therefore, the proposed works consist of replacing the pavement over lengths
of total failure, repairing the remainder and providing an overlay of varying
thicknesses according to the in-situ pavement strength determined by the
deflection measurements. The unsurfaced gravel shoulder will be repaired and
widened where necessary; through villages and at lay-bys, the shoulders will
be given a thin asphalt concrete surface. Culverts and roadside drains will
be repaired and improved where necessary.
E.   Ife-Ondo (61 km) and Ondo-Ore (43 km)
11.       These roads are part of the Federal Trunk F road system (F-209 and
F-207, respectively). The area of influence of these roads includes a sub-
stantial part of the cocoa belt; other agricultural activities include produc-
tion of cassava, maize, plantain, yam, kolanuts, and citrus fruits for local
consumption, and oil palm and some rubber for export. The roads provide
primary access from the timber producing areas of Ekiti and Ondo with the
sawmills in the Ife-Ondo area. Principal cargo moved on these roads include
industrial and consumer goods (30%), cocoa and other agricultural products
(13%), lumber (12%), building materials (9%), and petrol (6%). Traffic
growth, during 1975-79, has averaged about 12% p.a. on Ondo-Ife road and 35%
p.a. on Ondo-Ore road. These roads presently carry a substantial amount of
through traffic from Lagos and Ondo State to Benin and eastern Nigeria because
of the poor condition of the main Lagos-Benin highway between Ore and Shagamu.



- 58 -                            ANNEX 1
Page 5
With the expected opening of the Benin-Shagamu expressway in 1982, a signifi-
cant realignment of traffic is expected to take place on the regional road
network, reducing the traffic on Ondo-Ife and Ondo-Ore roads by an estimated
40% and 23% respectively. The importance of these roads, however, will
increase with the opening of a regional petroleum distribution depot at Ore
and the construction of a steel rolling mill and a machine tools plant at
Oshogbo. The Ore depot will supply initially some 200,000 tons of petroleum
products to the entire Ondo State and the eastern part of Oyo State. Growth
on these roads is estimated to average about 11% p.a. from 1979-84 and 8% p.a.
from 1985 onwards.
12.       These roads run through undulating country in the rain forest belt.
They were constructed following an old alignment as part of the Third Highway
Project (Loan 427-UNI). Construction was completed in early 1970. The
existing pavement consists of a two-course dense-bitumen macadam surface 6
cm thick on a 20 cm base of crushed rock, laid on a sub-base of lateritic
gravel of thickness which was varied according to the strength of the sub-
grade soil. The riding quality of both roads is fair. The pavements are
extensively cracked; there are very few potholes and small areas of complete
pavement failure. There is evidence of impeded drainage in the road structure
because of the use of impermeable shoulders. MIeasured pavement deflections
are quite high, reflecting weaknesses in the pavement associated with the poor
drainage. The works proposed include improving the drainage of the road
structure, replacement of failed areas of pavement, patching where necessary
and providing overlays of asphaltic concrete in thicknesses varying according
to the indications of the deflection measurements.

Technical Assistance to the Federal Ifinistry of Works
1.        The technical assistance to the Federal lIinistry of Works provides
for 13 technical assistance posts to be filled under the Project. Eleven of
the posts are in F1IW's Highways Division (FHD). Described in Part I of this

Pavement Evaluation Posts in the Federal Ministry
of Works - Civil Engineering Division
Outline Terms of Reference
1.        A vital component of the proposed Sixth Highway project is to
establish within the Federal Ministry of Works the capacity to establish in
numerate terms, a program for the strengthening of pavements to indicate which
roads need to be strengthened, when, and by how much.
2.        Over the past 15 years, techniques have emerged to make such
numerate evaluations. They employ pavement condition surveys, including
methods of determining the existing strength of pavements in situ, usually
by determining the deflection of the pavements under standard load. The
intention is to establish a Pavement Evaluation Unit. Its overall objectives
will be to develop and put into use a system of assessing pavements appropriate
to the size of the federal road network (approximately 27,000 km).
3.        It is intended to provide two experts under the proposed project
to assist in establishing and building up this Pavement Evaluation Unit.
Outline terms of reference for the two experts are as follows:
(1) prepare a strategy and program for the evaluation of the
condition, including surface roughness, and structural adequacy
of pavements of Federal roads which will provide the Federal
Ministry of Works and Housing with the data necessary to plan
their annual programs of road strengthening;
(2) review and report on the training needs for the staff of the
Civil Engineering Division as well as the need for engaging
additional staff to build up a Pavement Evaluation Unit and
implement the necessary training for the staff of the Unit;
(3) review and report on the equipment needed by the Pavement
Evaluation Unit and assist the Federal Ministry of Works
in procuring the necessary equipment, and in training staff in
its use;
(4) assist the Pavement Evaluation Unit in implementing the
pavement testing program, in interpreting the results and with
assistance from FHD's planning and maintenance departments,
formulating annual programs and budgets for the strengthening
of pavements on Federal roads;



- 73 -                               ANNEX 3
Page 10
(5) consolidate the work of the Pavement Evaluation Unit in
technical memoranda and one or several manuals on procedures
for carrying out non-destructive and destructive testing of
pavements, laboratory testing of pavement materials, interpre-
tation of test results and determination of required road
strengthening (improvement to drainage, overlays, rehabilita-
tion, etc.). The manuals should not repeat existing manuals
elaborated elsewhere, but rather modify or supplement them
where warranted by Nigerian conditions.
4.        The proposed team will consist of:
(1) Project Leader:
Qualified civil engineer with comprehensive experience of the
techniques of pavement evaluation. Primarily responsible for
organizing the pavement evaluation unit, planning the work of
the unit, the execution of field testing and the interpretation
of results and its inputs into the work of the Federal Ministry
of Works.
(2) Civil Engineer/Technologist:
Qualified civil engineer/technologist with comprehensive
experience in operation and maintenance of pavement testing
equipment (e.g., Benkelman beam, deflectograph, pavement
profilometer, roughometer, etc.).

= bx( R1- R2)                                      (17)
where: BVOC = savings in vehicle operating costs (N/1000 km/veh, x);
R    = road roughness "without" project;
R2   = road roughness "with" project;
ax   = intercept of roughness equation for vehicle type, x;
b x = slone of roucnhness eouation for vehicle type, x.
Notes: 1. Use of an average bx, weighted by the proportion of different
vehicles in the traffic stream would result in one composite
equation for estimating Bvoc for all vehicles.
2. Where directional distribution of traffic axle load is
significantly different, roughness should be estimated
separately for the different lanes and then averaged to
calculate BVOC.
D. Estimation of Routine Pavement Maintenance Requirements
Normal Routine Maintenance
AP = (Pf - Pi)F                             (18)
where:   Ap    cracked pavement area to be patched during one
maintenance period, normally 1 year;(m2/lane/km);
Pf = total cracked or patched pavement area at end of
maintenance period (m2/lane/km);
Pi= total cracked or patched pavement area at start of
maintenance period (m2/lane/km);
F   = proportion of incremental cracked pavement area Cpt
patched during one maintenance period.

during one maintenance period (N/lane/km);
(AP)1 = pavement area patched during one maintenance
period in the "without project" case (m2/lane/km);
CAP)2 = pavement area patched during one maintenance
period in the "with project" case (m2/lane/km);
CP1 = cost of patching in "without project" case
(N/m2);
CP2 = cost of patching in "with project" case (N/m2).
Note: 1. Results obtained by using equations 18-20 apply to one
pavement lane and should be multiplied by 2 to obtain
estimates for a 2-lane road.
2. Where directional distribution of traffic axle loads
is significantly different, normal and deferred mainte-
nance needs should be estimated separately for each
traffic lane.

(ii)   Total cracked and patched pavement area    P
Total pavement area                Pt
exceeds the maximum allowable Limit (threshold).

maintenance) first repaired before application of periodic maintenance.
4.  Pavement roughness reduced to:
(i)    1,800 after application of a bituminous concrete overlay;
(ii)   2,500 after appLication of a bituminous surface dressing
or seal coat if roughness before periodic maintenance
exceeded 2,500.
5. Cracked and patched pavement area, P, set to zero after application
of overlay, surface dressing or seal coat.
H.  Pavement Management Strategies
Except for Maiduguri-Bama road, it was assumed that the "without
project" maintenance strategy would entail a minimum amount of normal
maintenance interspersed with maintenance measures (deferred routine
maintenance and periodic maintenance) to keep the roads open to traffic.
The "without project" alternative for Maiduguri-Bama road assumed no
maintenance until the road reached a stage where complete reconstruction
of the base would be required. Pavement strengthening requirements in the
"with project" case were obtained after detailed pavement deflection surveys.
All alternatives assume routine pavement maintenance as prescribed in th,e
preceding section. Overlay construction to be accompanied by appropriate
treatment of shoulders and drainage works. All unrepaired pavement are to
be patched before application of a surface dressing or seal coat as
periodic maintenance.
