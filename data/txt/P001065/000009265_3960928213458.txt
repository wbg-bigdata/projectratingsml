MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE nRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A NATIONAL RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to
the Republic of Guinea for SDR 31.3 million (US$40.0 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval.  The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and would assist in financing a project to strengthen
national rural infrastructure.
2.      Background.  The rural sector is the mainstay of Guinea's economy,
providing a livelihood to 752 of the population and generating about 302 of
GDP. The favorable climate and ecological diversity of Gu`nea offer a wide
range of development possibilities for the rural sector.   However, the
economy was mismanaged during nearly 30 years, and as a -esult, development
did not materialize.
3.      Since 1985, under its structural adjustment program, the Government
has shifted toward sounder economic development policies whose main elements
are:   (a) withdrawal of the state from directly productive sectors and
restructuring of the public sector through a comprehensive administrative and
public enterprise reform; (b) resource allocation policies consistent with
the establishment of a flexible, liberal economy through, inter alia,
realistic exchange rate, interest rate, price and trade policies; and (c)
macroeconomic policies consistent with long-term fiscal and balance of
payments equilibria.   These policies provide a favorable environment for
agricultural development.   The dilapidated infrastructure, however, still
constrains such development.
4.      The Government, the Bank, and the other main donors agree that future
programs  in the agricultural sector should,  in priority:   (a) provide
agricultural services to the farming community, in particular applied
research, credit, extension, and animal health services; (b) improve the
efficiency of the entities providing services to the rural sector (Government
Departments, and to the extent possible, village level organizations, and
private services); and (c) rehabilitate rural infrastructure, particularly
feeder roads, bottomlands, and rural water supply.
5.      Proiect Objectives and Description.  The project would assist the
Government in implementing policies in rural infrastructure by reinforcing
the capacity of institutions involved in the sub-sector, implementing a
specific rural infrastructure investment program, carrying out studies, and
implementing pilot actions to test new methods of construction and
maintenance of rural infrastructure.



-2-
6.      To reach these objectives the project would (a) strengthen the
planning and supervision capacity of DNGR (Rural Engineering Directorate)
and SNAPE (Rural Water Supply Agency), and provide training; (b) rehabilitate
2.600 km of feeder roads, develop 2,100 ha of small bottomlands, drill 220
boreholes, and establish two small community piped water supply systems with
sanitation components; and (c) prepare studies and launch pilot actions,
including a Feeder Roads Master Plan, a pilot program to develop labor-based
methods for road works and promote the emergence of small and medium scale
contractors, a pilot program to develop bottomlands with the assistance of
a NGO, and studies and pilot schemes to define a national strategy for the
development of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS).
7.      The project would be implemented by DNGR and SNAPE services, both at
the national and regional levels. Project activities would take place in all
four natural regions of the country, but would support in priority zones with
ongoing agricultural development activities in 16 of the 33 prefectures of
the country, including but not limited to, the areas covered by the recently
approved   IDA-financed   National   Research   and   Extension   Project.
Implementation would follow annual work plans approved by IDA. The detailed
work plan for the first year was agreed at negotiations and is available in
the Project Implementation File.
8.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Rural infrastructure rehabilitation
requires support of a scope and nature that IDA is in a position to provide.
The project would complement other IDA-financed projects (National Research
and Extension, Transport Sector, and IVth Highway) in stimulating
agricultural production and income, and therefore, fits into IDA's overall
assistance strategy for Guinea. The RWSS component would benefit from the
regional UNDP/World Bank Water and Sanitation program, of which Guinea is
envisaged to be part. Through the project, IDA would play a catalytic role
in enabling the Government to coordinate the activities of the many donors
involved in the rural infrastructure sub-sector. The project would assist
the Government in integrating all externally financed projects  into a
national  strategy  for  rural  infrastructure  development.    IDA  has  a
significant comparative advantage in providing this kind of support.  Its
leadership role would ensure that adequate attention is paid to policy
issues, including institutional strengthening, private sector development,
and cost recovery.
9.      Agreed Actions.   The project design, objectives, and costs were
agreed at negotiations.   Assurances were obtained on the existence of
satisfactory arrangements to ensure the timely availability of funds for road
maintenance.   In this respect,  it was agreed that the implementation
arrangements for the recently created Roads Fund would be made effective.
Standard legal conditions of credit effectiveness would apply.   Credit
effectiveness would also be conditional on submission of the official
statutes defining the organization and management of thie project implementing
agencies and the autonomous entities under their tutelage.

10.     Benefits.  The following tangible benefits are expected under the
project. Institution-Building: Strengthened institutions responsible for
rural roads, bottomlands development, and RWSS operations, as well as private
enterprises working under contract on rural infrastructure development.
Rural Roads: Acceleration of economic growth, reduction of transportation
costs, and expansion of commercial services through better communications.
Bottomlands:   Increased food production, larger farmer incomes, and land
conservation.  Water Supply:  Improvement of sanitary conditions and living
standards, benefiting directly the rural population, including women,
children and the poor. Benefits with respect to roads and bottomlands were
quantified at appraisal,  and the cost-benefit analysis  resulted in an
Economic Rate of Return of 15.72 for the feeder roads, and 23.2Z for
bottomlands and rural tracks.
11.     Risks.   The main risk of the project lies in the fragility of
government institutions following the changes in structures carried out
recently. The Government reorganization of ministries could result in a lack
of commitment of those civil servants in charge of implementing these
reforms. These risks are being addressed as part of the establishment, under
the Government's overall administrative reform program, of adequate
incentives for civil servants.
12.     Technical risks due to shortages of trained staff are minimized
through training programs, technical assistance, and a minimal use of force
account in carrying out the works. The project was designed to explicitly
address the issue of maintenance of the rural infrastructure to ensure its
sustainability. Concerning the RUSS component, boreholes would be drilled
only in villages which would make a substantial financial contributions
toward the purchase of handpumps.   The risk is that villages may not be
willing, or able, to make such substantial contributions, thereby undermining
the establishment of a viable maintenance system.  This risk is minimized by
the sensitization program to be undertaken as part of the project.
13.     A final risk concerns the timely availability of counterpart funding.
This risk is minimized, however, through the drastic steps taken by the
Government to improve public finance management under the Structural
Adjustment Program and through the participation of beneficiaries, thereby
decreasing the Government's share of local funding.
14.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
