                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         To deliver direct environmental and economic benefits from the integration of biogas in farming and cooking in rural households. In addition, the project aims to reduce
                         greenhouse gas emissions through methane combustion and reduced burning of coal and firewood in the project areas.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reports the implementation progress after the eleventh/last supervision mission.

                         With the leadership, commitment and hard work from five provincial governments and project management offices, the project can be fully implemented and closed on June 30, 2014.
                         It was reported that 113% of the overall revised PAD investment cost and 98% of the Bank’s loan amount has been completed and a disbursement rate of about 94 % achieved. The

                         total number of beneficiary households amounts to 458,679, accounting for 103% of the target after restructuring. The overall implementation quality of works continues to be
                         satisfactory and the project households and communities are benefiting from the establishment of biogas system, household and village infrastructure improvements, as well as the
                         extension and biogas service systems. While the formal Implementation Completion Report (ICR) analysis is still under preparation, we have witnessed in the field significant
                         achievements and very positive outcomes of the project.

                         CDM Biogas Operation Transfer. An ICR review for the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Biogas Subproject has been done separately. It was confirmed that the objective of
                         this pilot program has been reached. The project implementation target has been successfully completed with 33,000 household-based biogas digesters being installed and put into
                         stable operation. As of the end of 2013 the system has been credited with certified emission reductions (CER) of 162,078 tCO2e CERs. US$2.2 million (RMB 12,919,000) have been
                         received from the system, which has been used to offset the cost of maintenance and support, as well as provide some payment to participating households. The task team
                         recommended transferring the responsibility for on-going monitoring of this activity to ENVCF to ensure monitoring continues following the completion of the implementation phase of
                         the Eco-farming project .
