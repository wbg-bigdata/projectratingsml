                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      The proposed restructuring follows a request from the Office National de
l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE) on October 17, 2012 to reflect the merger
(regroupement) of the Office National de l’Eau Potable (ONEP) with the Office National
de l’Electricité (ONE) in the Loan and Guarantee Agreements. The Office National de
l’Eau Potable (ONEP), the original Borrower, has been merged (regroupé) with the
Office National de l’Electricité (ONE) as provided by Law 40-09, promulgated on
September 29, 2011 and made effective on April 24, 2012. The new legal entity resulting
from the merger of ONEP and ONE is named the Office National de l’Electricité et de
l’Eau potable (ONEE). It is the proposed new Borrower. The purpose of the restructuring
is to reflect this change of Borrower in the Project’s Loan Agreement and Guarantee
Agreement (Loan No. 7351-MOR) dated January 9, 2006 (the Loan Agreement and the
Guarantee Agreement, respectively).

B. PROPOSED CHANGES

2.       The Bank will enter into: (i) a Loan Assumption Agreement with ONEE, under
which ONEE, as new Borrower, will confirm that it accepts the rights and benefits, and
assumes the obligation of ONEP, set forth or referred to in the Loan Agreement; and (ii)
an Amended Guarantee Agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco (the Guarantor) to
reflect the change of Borrower in the Guarantee Agreement.

3.      After the merger of the ONEP with the ONE to form the ONEE, ONEE kept a
Water Department (“ONEE-Branche Eau?) and an Electricity Department (“ONEE-
Branche Electricité?). Changes induced by the merger were limited to creating in ONEE
four overarching units dealing with transversal activities such as finance or operations. It
did not entail any change in the organization or structure of Project implementation.

4.      As a result, the change of Borrower will not have any impact on its capacity to
handle the fiduciary functions (procurement and financial management), as the staff in
charge will remain the same as it was at the time of Project appraisal. In addition, the
Project’s objectives, activities, financing and implementation arrangements will remain
the same. This change is therefore not expected to have any implication on Project
implementation, which has been rated satisfactory since January 2012.
