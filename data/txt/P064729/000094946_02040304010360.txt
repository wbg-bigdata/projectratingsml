A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The project objective is to ensure that viable, participatory, and locally-managed system for conservation,
management, and sustainable use of forest resources and associated biodiversity are developed and adopted
in project sites to promote sustainable development and management of forest resources and protect the
natural environment. These practices developed and applied for the protection and sustainable management
of natural forest resources in pilot areas in China would provide models for wider replication under the
government's Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP).
2. Global objective: (see Annex 1)
The global environmental objective is to foster improved conservation and sustainable management of
biodiversity in remaining natural forest areas by ensuring effective in situ protection of threatened and
globally important forest habitats and rare and endemic species. Monitorable indicators to measure
achievement of the global environment objective are: (a) over 1 million hectares of important biodiversity
areas brought under improved management; (b) substantial involvement and participation of local
communities in nature reserve management planning and implementation; (c) reduction of community
reliance on forest resources inside biodiversity important zones; and (d) increase in local government's
capacity to supervise, monitor, and implement conservation and sustainable resource use activities.
3. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
Achievement of the project development objective would be monitored by four key perfornance indicators:
(a) 6 natural forest management areas under effective management on-the-ground by end of Project; (b) 13
nature reserves under active and effective management by end of Project; (c) 6900 villages benefiting from
participation in project activities by end of Project; and (d) project generates 13.3 million m of timber and
2.73 million metric tons of bamboo by December 31, 2025, and RMB 1.1 billion net income from tree crop
production by December 31, 2022.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: R98-107   Date of latest CAS discussion: 05/28/1998
CAS goal supported by SFDP
The proposed Project is consistent with the China CAS, which identifies protecting the environment as an
overarching objective for support by the World Bank Group. The Project would help address one specific
objective set out in the CAS: preserving productive natural forest reserves and biodiversity by promoting
sustainable natural resources management.
la. Global Operational strategy/Program objective addressed by the project:
China ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in January 1993. The Project is consistent
with the GEF Operational Strategy, which emphasized in situ conservation of globally significant
biodiversity, and aims at consolidating conservation efforts in tropical and sub-tropical forests (OP 3) and
in monotone ecosystems (OP 4). It responds to Conference of Parties 3 (or COP 3) and COP 4 guidance
by promoting conservation and sustainable use through adaptive management of forest ecosystems;
capacity building; and integrating biodiversity conservation into improved management of the forestry
sector. The GEF-fmanced activities will address the incremental costs of protecting globally significant
- 2 -



biodiversity, while the overall SFDP will address the root causes of biodiversity loss by implementing a
comprehensive approach to promote sustainable forestry development to meet China's growing timber
needs.
The Project is also consistent with the national Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan (1994) which was
prepared with support from the GEF Pre-Investment Facility during the GEF Pilot Phase and the China's
Biodiversity - A Country Study (1998). The Action Plan identified the project regions as centers of China's
biodiversity. In addition, the Project's proposed interventions are consistent with other planning exercises
regarding the significance of Chinese biodiversity; the priorities for its protection and management; and the
specific areas targeted for development and implementation as described in the national Forestry Action
Plan for China's Agenda 21, WWF-supported Biodiversity Review of China (1996), and the national
Forest Nature Reserves Conservation Plan under preparation with funds from the GEF-fmanced Nature
Reserves Management Project.
The three key Project provinces, Sichuan, Hainan, and Hunan each represent a different forest type and
contain high biodiversity. Sichuan Province is in the transition zone from sub-tropical to cold temperate
conifer forests. The province contains the third highest number of endangered plant species, second in
terrns of mammal species richness, and second in terms of richness of bird species in China. This province
also contains large tracts of remaining Giant Panda habitat. Hainan Province is biologically very rich
containing evergreen tropical rainforests and monsoon forests with mangroves scattered intermittently along
the coast around river inlets. The flora is estimated at 4,200 species, 630 of which are said to be endemic to
the island. The bird and mammal lists are also very rich for an island and a total of 98 mammal and 291
bird species have been recorded. The island has several important species found nowhere else in China or
that are nationally or internationally endangered. Hunan Province contains broad-leaved evergreen forests
and high diversity of plant species. Flora is estimated at 5,000 species of which 51 plant species are
endangered.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The forestry sector plays a critical role not only in protecting biodiversity and watersheds but also in the
Chinese economy, providing 40 percent of rural household energy, almost all of the lumber and panel
products for the large construction sector, and raw material for the large domestic pulp and paper industry.
The resource base is small. Forest cover amounts to only 0.13 hectares per capita which is significantly
below the world average of 0.6 hectares per capita. Forest land is divided into two categories: natural
forests (about 106.9 million hectares), which are located in isolated areas in the northeast and southwest
and account for 92 percent of standing wood volume; and plantations (about 46.7 million hectares), which
account for only 10 percent of standing volume, since most are newly established. China is the third largest
consumer of timber in the world and faces a widening imbalance between supply and demand for wood
products. The present consumption level (about 300 million cubic meters of standing stock) exceeds the
annual growth of the forests. This deficit is being made up by imports and over-cutting, contributing
substantially to the loss of 500,00 hectares of natural forest area per year. This situation has been allowed
to persist because logging enterprises do not bear the full cost of over-harvesting, are not efficiently
regulated, and lack knowledge of sustainable natural forest management.
Although the Govenmment of China (GOC) has taken steps to address the widening wood deficit by
investing in plantations until recently, it had not tackled the fundamental imbalances in the sector.
Triggered by the devastating flooding that occurred in the Yangtze Basin and northeast China during the
summer of 1998, GOC recently took bold actions to restructure the forest sector.
- 3 -



*   First, the State Council issued an emergency circular in August 1998 announcing the following
immediate policy changes: ban on logging in natural forests; no opening up of new lands at the
expense of forests; freezing of all construction projects on forest land for one year; and a new
requirement for direct cabinet approval for any occupation of forest land.  Supplemental
regulations have been issued by the provinces that provide detailed guidelines for implementation at
the local level.
*   Second, GOC launched an ambitious new investment program (Natural Forest Protection Program
- NFPP) in 17 provinces. NFPP supports increased protection of natural forests, establishment of
timber plantations, and the transfer of state loggers to more enviromnentally sustainable
employment. More specifically, NFPP covers (a) protection of 61.2 million hectares of forests
along upper reach of the Yangtze River and upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River by
banning commercial logging in natural forests and establishing plantations; (b) protection of 39.4
million hectares of forests (of which 34.4 million are natural forests) in state-owned forest
enterprises in Northeastem provinces including Inner Mongolia by reducing annual timber
production of 7.5 million cubic meters and restructuring the enterprises; and (c) protection of
natural forests outside of the key program areas by the provincial governments. The plan is being
implemented in two phases (1998-2000 and 2001-2010), at a total cost of 106.3 billion yuan,
financed in part by budgetary allocations and subsidized loans from central and local governments.
*   Third, the govenmment enacted additional legislation, such as a new land use law in September
1998, to promote more efficient use of land and increased reforestation.
*   Fourth, GOC launched another program in 1999 to convert around 3.6 million ha of steep lands
(over 25 percent slope) in the upper reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers from agriculture
back to forest (and grasslands). The program was piloted in 1999-2000 in 17 provinces and being
implemented from 2001 to 2010.
The environmental impact of these reforms could be enormously positive both locally and globally: an
additional 30 million hectares of remaining natural forests will be brought under legal protection as nature
reserves, forest parks, or watershed protection forests according to their biodiversity and watershed
protection values, and 40 million hectares under sustainable management, which will strengthen forest
cover, biodiversity conservation, watershed management, and other important environmental benefits.
However, the transitional social and economic costs will be extremely high, and there may be an ongoing
justification and  need for targeted intemational and domestic subsidies to support provision of
environmental services. These include the following:
*   Since a significant share of the natural forests are located in poverty areas and are an important
source of fuelwood and non-timber forest products for poor upland households, the ban could
reduce their income and consumption levels;
*   About 65 large state-owned harvesting enterprises are being closed down and another 70 scaled
back operations, resulting in a loss of approximately one million jobs by 2000; a comparable
number of non-state workers, mostly people from the local communities, have also lost their jobs;
*   About 200 counties lost more than one-half of their fiscal revenues as a result of lower tax
payments from the forestry sector, the major impacts of which will not be felt until 2001 and
beyond;
*   Prices of domestic and imported raw materials are likely to increase, which will be passed through
- 4 -



in higher prices for building materials, furniture, and other products, adding further stress on the
relatively inefficient wood processing sector; and
* Timber imports are expected to increase which will draw down foreign exchange reserves and
create new pressures for (illegal) harvesting of forests elsewhere, particularly Russia, East Asia,
and Africa.
Effective implementation of this new investment program is the biggest challenge facing the forest sector.
Successful implementation will require (a) developing comprehensive integrated management plans for
forest resources, particularly for natural forests, that maximize economic and environmental benefits for
local communities; (b) improving the efficiency of the wood processing sector through continued reform of
the policy framework for state-owned enterprises; (c) expanding forestry resources to support continued
growth of construction and agro-processing sectors, with an emphasis on productivity gains through
improvements in silvicultural technologies, particularly planting stock development and silvicultural
management; and (d) developing more participatory approaches for the design and implementation of
natural forest management and afforestation programs to strengthen incentives for sustainable resource
management by local communities.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Creation of new resources, through afforestation, and rehabilitation of forest fire affected areas has been
the major thrust of previous Bank involvement and has been largely successful within the established policy
and institutional framework. While considerable effort has been given to strengthening the technical basis
of plantation forestry, previous projects have had limited impact on technical approaches to the
management of natural forest areas, with the exception of the GEF-funded Nature Reserves Management
Project (NRMP) which has introduced a more scientific basis for nature reserve management. GOC's new
policy provides an opportunity to also focus on natural forests. Among the specific issues to be addressed
are the appropriateness of incentives facing resource users and producers including small-holders;
arrangements for governance and effective management and co-management of forest resources; land use
planning within production forest areas; resource assessment methods; and rationalization of harvest
calculations.
Several strategic choices were made in the design of the Project:
*   First, although the restructuring of forestry logging enterprises and redeployment of redundant
workers remains a critical task for govermment, the project would not tackle these difficult issues,
for the following reasons: (a) Central Government is already providing a significant amount of
funding for the restructuring of logging enterprises under NFPP, so there is less need for additional
Bank financing; (b) the Bank's policy is to support diversification of enterprise ownership and not
new SOE establishment, as SOEs absorb a disproportionate share of resources in China, have
inadequate systems of governance, and are still insufficiently subject to market discipline; (c) the
previous experience of Bank support for enterprise restructuring in China is poor, as many SOEs
have encountered operational difficulties and failed to repay their loans; and (d) enterprise
restructuring is extremely complex and time-consuming to prepare and supervise, and the project
design is already quite complicated. Instead, the Project has a much stronger emphasis on
community-based management of natural resources, and will support a wider range of social and
economic activities for rural households affected by NFPP, including household loans, vocational
training, and small-scale village infrastructure.
*   Second, the emphasis will be on introducing much more participatory, community driven, and
bottom-up approaches to forest resources planning and management by involving local
- 5-



governments and communities much earlier on in forest resource assessment and management plan
development. This will lead to more ownership by local governments and communities leading to
better adherence to management prescriptions and resource use zoning; greater likelihood that local
government poverty alleviation programs can be directed to areas to reduce the reliance on
unsustainable forest exploitation; and, this will also facilitate discussions of trade-off in the
planning phase and building of consensus on how to protect and manage the remaining forest
resources and associated biodiversity sustainability.
*   Third, there will be stronger linkages between conservation and sustainable income generation at
all levels, including local governments. Oftentimes, conservation objectives are forgotten in the
interest of local economic development needs. Therefore, the focus will be placed on community
protection and sustainable use without losing the incentives for community participation.
Community development projects identified as part of the co-management process, to the extent
possible, would be linked to long-term and sustainable management of the forest resources.
Community extension programs need to find alternative and diversified agroforestry and cultivation
approaches to replace revenues lost from shrinking supplies of non-timber forest products (NTFP).
Conservation education and awareness program under the Project would target specific groups of
rural community households whose actions are adversely impacting the biodiversity.
C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The Project will finance, over a period of seven years, the following main components and activities:
(a) Natural Forest Management Component (NFM) would support the development and dissemination
of new sustainable management techniques in natural forest areas protected under the Government's NFPP
and community development and livelihood enhancement activities targeting selected rural communities.
The latter targets the most forest dependent rural communities in the project areas who would potentially be
most affected by the NFPP restrictions. The component includes the following subcomponents and key
activities: (i) natural forest management including development of forest management plans through
resource assessment, zoning, and forest classification; yield regulation and control; policy studies relating
to opportunities for forest ecological benefit compensation systems, marketing, and market intelligence
systems; implementation of forest management plan through demonstrations, non-timber forest products
(NTFP) domestication, establishment of yield plots to model growth and yield and assessment of
biodiversity change; and monitoring and evaluation; (ii) forest management training to employees and
vocational training to laid-off workers of State Forest Enterprises in the project areas; (iii) community
development activities including small household loans, household training, implementation of small village
infrastructure based on village development plans developed by the project communities and associated
technical studies (e.g., rural energy, animal grazing, and so on); and (iv) training directed at forest
administration staff, and dissemination beyond the project area using mass media and in-country
workshops. The EU is expected to finance this component in its entirety.
(b) Protected Areas Management Component (PAM-Global Component) would support conservation
and improved management of biodiversity of global importance in selected, high priority nature reserves in
natural forest areas.  The subcomponents and key activities include: (i) participatory nature reserves
planning and management including management plan development and implementation, strengthening of
field-level management and targeted applied research; (ii) community-based nature conservation including
co-management activities that link biodiversity conservation with sustainable income generation, energy
- 6 -



conservation demonstration, wildlife management to reduce damage to local community livelihoods,
community conservation education and awareness, and delivery of sustainable alternatives and
enhancement of community skills; (iii) training and capacity building to strengthen institutions responsible
for biodiversity conservation and management at the provincial and nature reserve levels; and (iv) project
management, monitoring and evaluation including key policy studies. The Global Environment Facility is
expected to finance this component in its entirety.
(c) Plantation Establishment Component (PE) would support increasing the production of wood to meet
the growing gap between domestic supply and demand, generate new employment and income for forestry
farms and rural households and improve environmental management. It will be implemented in the three
key provinces plus eight more and will include the following subcomponents and key activities: (i)
establishment of commercial wood plantations for fiber, pulp, plywood, bamboo, and construction timber;
(ii) establishment of economic forest crops, including fruit, nut and medicinal trees, and rattan; (iii)
pre-commercial thinning of existing plantations to demonstrate increase productivity and financial gains
from proper thinning and tending; and (iv) provision of related technical support services such as planting
stock development and nursery management, training and extension, small-scale rural infrastructure
required for afforestation and post-harvest treatment and marketing of horticultural crops, and monitoring
and evaluation including environmental and social parameters.

Project Areas and Beneficiaries
All project activities would be implemented in three key provinces: Sichuan, Hainan, and Hunan. These
three key provinces were selected based on their interest and willingness to participate in the Project,
natural forest resources, biodiversity value, and commitment to natural forest protection. Within these
provinces, several representative natural forest areas were selected for inclusion under the Natural Forest
Management component based on agreed selection criteria and through an extensive consultation process.
The selected counties include three in Sichuan, two in Hunan, and one in Hainan covering approximately
203,000 ha of natural forest and representing major ecological forest types in their respective provinces.
Within the six project counties, 59 villages in 13 townships have been selected for the community
development sub-component. These villages were chosen based on their relative relationship to and
dependence on the selected natural forest areas. Approximately 29,000 beneficiaries would be supported
by this component of which 40 percent are ethnic minorities. In addition to the three key provinces, the
Protected Areas Management component would be implemented in four adjacent provinces of Gansu,
Hubei, Yunnan and Guizhou in order to strengthen transboundary biodiversity protection and exchanges
between these adjoining provinces. These provinces are also included under the NFPP and this provides
opportunity to strengthen and mainstream biodiversity conservation into the program at the
- 7-



provincial-level, where the impact will be greatest. Approximately 57,200 individuals would directly
benefit from this component with over 71 percent belonging to an ethnic minority group. The Plantation
Establishment component would be extended to a larger number of provinces with suitable conditions for
high yield commercial plantations to meet the increasing demand for wood and other forest products as a
result of the logging ban. The provinces of Shanxi, Liaoning, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Hubei,
Hunan, Hainan, Sichuan, and Gansu are included in this component. Participation is voluntary based on
technical, institutional, and economic/financial criteria. This component would support approximately 2.67
million beneficiaries of which less than 1 percent are ethnic minorities.
Co-Financing Arrangements
Co-financing have been sought for two of the three components-Protected Areas Management and
Natural Forest Management. The GEF has approved the inclusion of the Protected Area Management
component into the March 2001 GEF work program for the amount of US$16 million. Final endorsement
by the GEF Council was obtained in March 7, 2002. The newly-established European Aid Agency of the
European Union convened a technical review in late March 2001 of the Natural Forest Management
component. It recommended that the proposal be submitted to the European Union Asia and Latin America
Committee (ALAC) which is equivalent to the World Bank Executive Directors in June 2001. The ALAC
gave its approval in September 2001. The EU will co-finance in parallel and will be responsible for
processing, management, and supervision of its own technical assistance package. GEF financing would be
implemented by the World Bank, and therefore the Bank is responsible for processing, management, and
supervision. Where possible, joint supervision and mid-tern reviews will be carnied out with the EU for
effective review of cross-cutting issues.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The Project supports China's efforts to: (a) develop more integrated and participatory approaches to
sustainable forest management thus fostering better local ownership and commitment; (b) ensure a more
rational and standardized scientific approach to forest land (including nature reserves) classification and
use zoning; and (c) devolve more responsibilities to the provinces for implementation, supervision, and
monitoring. Although not explicitly linked to specific investment operations, the Bank recently assisted in
the establishment of a Forestry/Grasslands Task Force under the China Council for International
Environment and Development Council which will focus on development of key policy-related
recommendations for consideration by the State Council. Various other donors/NGOs such as CIDA,
Ford, UNDP, AusAid, and WWF-China Program are also providing support for studies which will identify
additional reform steps needed to effectively implement the NFPP and to address inefficiencies in forest
resource use.

3. Benefits and target population:
The Project would generate the following benefits: (a) environmental--1.2 million ha of natural forests
would be protected and managed sustainably for multiple benefits and 0.17 million ha of trees planted thus
reducing soil and water erosion, flooding and river sedimentation, preserving globally important
biodiversity, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration; (b) economic--an
increase in supply of forest products that would support the continued growth of the construction and
agro-processing sectors including approximately 13.3 million cubic meters of commercial timber, 4.2
million tons of bamboo, fruit, and nut, and miscellaneous forest production amounting to RMB 1.89 billion
net income at current financial prices at full development; (c) social--sustainable resource use and
improved income generating opportunities for rural households living within the project areas; and (d)
institutional--improvement in the administrative and implementation capacity particularly of the local and
provincial govemments and strengthening coordination and collaboration between units, departments, and
communities.
The total number of beneficiaries is estimated at 687,500 households or approximately 2.75 million
individuals. The beneficiary groups include a large share of women and ethnic minorities. Of the 55
recognized ethnic minority groups in China, a total of 18 (Li, Tibetan, Qiang, Tujia, Miao, She, Dong,
Dulong, Hui, Mongols, Manchus, Yao, Bai, Lisu, Nu, Yi, Pumi and Naxi) reside in SFDP project counties
and sites. Project activities and benefits would accrue to collective forest farms and local communities in
proportion to the social and economic dependency on natural resource extraction (for example, in Hunan
province where approximately 95 percent of the natural forests are managed by collectives and local
communities, the vast share of project benefits would accrue to them).
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Project Management. Project management would build upon the successful implementation structure
developed under earlier Bank forestry projects. Leading Groups at the central, provincial, and county levels
would be established to provide general policies and guidelines, review work programs, and ensure
coordination, linkages, and sharing of experiences between the three components. Project entities at the
national, provincial, county, and nature-reserve levels would be responsible for day-to-day implementation,
supervision, and monitoring.
National-Level. The Leading Group at the national-level would be chaired by the Administrator of the
State Forestry Administration (SFA) with membership from the Project Management Center (PMC),
Natural Forest Protection Center (NFPC), Department of Wildlife and Plant Protection (DWPP),
Department of Planning and Finance, and other relevant departments in SFA. Within SFA, the existing
NFPC will be responsible for overseeing the EU-financed Natural Forest Management component since it
is directly responsible for the implementation of the NFPP. The PMC will be responsible for the
Plantations Establishment component based on its successful implementation track record of three previous
World Bank-financed plantation projects. Management of the PAM component would be carried out and
supervised by a central Project Office (PO). PO would work closely with the Division of Nature Reserves
(DNR) in the DWPP and would be staffed with appropriate technical expertise in required fields, including
a full-time Protected Areas Management officer, a full-time Community-based Conservation officer, and a
full time Nature Reserve Training Coordinator who will also be responsible for coordinating the M&E.
Provincial-Level: Overall implementation would be overseen by the provincial Leading Group chaired by
the Director of the Provincial Forestry Department (PFD) and would be carried out by existing
organizations under the PFD to ensure institutionalization of project activities. The Natural Forest
Protection Office (NFPO), the Project Management Office (PMO), and Office of Wildlife and Plant
Protection (OWPP) would be responsible for the NFM, PE, and PAM components, respectively. The
-9-



NFPOs, PMOs, and OWPPs in each of the three key provinces will meet on a semi-annual basis to ensure
complementarity of activities, identify concrete areas for collaboration particularly between NFM and
PAM components, and share implementation experiences. The results of the meetings will be included in
the semi-annual progress reports. In addition, an annual workshop would be convened in each of the three
key provinces to disseminate lessons learned with participation from project staff, non-project, staff,
relevant NGOs, and staff from relevant donor-funded projects.
Local-Levels: For NFM component, 6 county PMOs and thirteen township working groups would be
established to oversee implementation. For PAM component, each nature reserve would create a Project
Management Group (PMG), directly under the nature reserve director. The PMG would be responsible for
supervision of all aspects of project activities in that reserve. For PE component, county PMOs in the
County Forestry Bureaus would manage the work and provide technical support while individual
households, groups of households, share-holding forest farms, village or township collective forest farms
and state forest fanns will carry out the plantation activities.
An assurance was obtained at negotiations that: (a) all implementation units would be established and
maintained in forestry agencies, staffing, functions, and responsibilities acceptable to the Bank; and (b)
annual work and financing plans for the PAM and PE components for the next calendar year would be
furnished to the Bank for review by December 31 of each year.
Production Arrangements. All plantation activities are organized as follows: First, households would
receive use rights for a term of not less than thirty years for land directly under their responsibility and
management under the Project. Second, the Project would not introduce any changes in existing land use
that would inadvertently create tenure insecurity in project villages, such as the revocation of existing
land-use contracts in order to develop "easier" production arrangements for project activities. Third. the
relative priority for land tenure and organizational arrangements for plantations during selection are:  (a)
land directly under the responsibility and management of beneficiary households or groups of beneficiary
households; (b) households or groups of households participating in a shareholding arrangement with
another party, such as a village committee, village/township collective farm, a township extension station,
or a state farm; (c) village or township collective forest farms; and (d) state forest farms. Fourth,
production arrangements based on a shareholding structure would ensure all the stakeholders will receive
satisfactory and equitable profits from production outputs. Fifth, since production arrangements vary
widely throughout the project areas, the structure for shareholding farms will be clearly described including
the specific input, expected output (rights and responsibilities) for each partner and governance structure of
the farms. Sixth, all loan recipients including individual households would sign a loan contract with the
relevant on-lending agency. Seventh, all production arrangements including different parties (such as
share-holding arrangements, large household arrangements with other households, or land renting for
nursery development) would require the signature of a joint co-operation contract ensuring transparency
and fair distribution of benefits. Each household participating in such co-operative productive arrangement
would sign an individual copy of this documents, and each participant would keep a copy of the signed
document. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that all afforestation activities would be organized in
accordance with guidelines in the Project Implementation Manual.
On-Lending Arrangements: The NFM and PAM components are grant financed. Project funds for the
PE component would be on-lent as follows. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) would on-lend the Loan to the
provincial finance departments on the same terms and conditions as received from the Barik (7 years grace
and 16 years maturity). Modification of IBRD loan terms from 5 to 7 years of grace corresponds with
timing of the fruiting of economic trees and the first thinning of timber trees, and the corresponding
reduction in the repayment period to 16 years coincides with the average of various harvesting data of the
tree species. Foreign exchange risk between US dollars and the local currency would be borne by the
- 10-



provinces.  The provinces would ensure the on-lending terms and conditions for the final project
beneficiaries are at the same terms and conditions as received by the provinces, with the establishment of an
appropriate foreign exchange rate risk mechanism which may include the option of an additional exchange
rate risk fee of up to two percent per annum for any loan on-lend in the Borrower's currency. No foreign
exchange risk would be passed onto the final project beneficiaries who eam all of their income in local
currency and have no capacity to hedge against exchange rate movement. The PMC would manage the
portion of funds used for intemational procurement, consultancy services, overseas training and study
tours, and other central government training and extension activities, although the provinces would assume
the debt responsibility for these services. An assurance was obtained at negotiations with respect to these
on-lending termns and conditions
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements: Monitoring will be done at three levels--delivery of inputs by
the project activities, outputs including the use of project goods/services by beneficiaries, and the extent to
which project objectives have been achieved (outcome/impact). The detailed M&E plan for PE component
was reviewed at appraisal and found satisfactory. However, the detailed overall M&E plan for PAM
component will be further revised during the first year of implementation with full participation of the
nature reserves and submitted to the Bank for review and approval by December 31, 2002. It is critical
that staff who will be implementing the M&E plan participate fully in its design; otherwise, there is little
ownership, understanding and conmuitment to its implementation.  During implementation, project
performance, including the achievement of project outputs and progress toward the attainment of
development objectives, would be monitored through the use of semi-annual progress reports prepared by
the PMC and PO. The first such monitoring report would be submitted by March 31, 2003 for both PE
and PAM components.
Financial Management and Auditing Requirements: An assessment of the adequacy of the project
financial management system was conducted at pre-appraisal and concluded that this Project meets
minimum Bank financial management requirements (see Annex 17). All previous forestry projects have
been in full compliance with audit and accounting covenants. The project entities would produce project
financial management reports in line with the format and content agreed to between the Bank and China. In
addition, traditional disbursement methods would be used as opposed to the PMR-based disbursement
systems. As with other Bank Group-financed projects in China, the Foreign Investment Audit Bureau of
China National Audit Office (CNAO) would have overall responsibility for auditing the accounts of the
Project. Audits of the financial statements of implementing agencies and of the Special Accounts would be
submitted to the Bank within six months after the end of the financial year. An assurance was obtained at
negotiations with respect to this auditing arrangement.
Supervision and Reporting Arrangements: The Project will be supervised through Bank missions
scheduled for twice a year consisting of both Field Office and Headquarters staff. A project launch
workshop will be arranged soon after Board approval which will focus on (a) project concept and
objectives; (b) project management activities including procurement, financial management, implementation
arrangements; and (c) project environmental protection guidelines and resettlement policy framework. A
joint mid-term review will be undertaken with the EU by July 31, 2005. Prior to that, a mid-term report
will be prepared by the PMC, NFPC and PO summarizing the results of monitoring and evaluation,
identify problems encountered during implementation, revise project costs, and discuss measures to
complete the Project as scheduled. In addition, an implementation completion report, reviewing the planned
objectives and achievements of the Project, including costs and benefits derived and performance and
contribution of all parties associated with project execution, would be prepared by the PMC and submitted
to the Bank within six months of the project completion date of February 28, 2009.

D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The following different design options were considered and rejected in agreement between GOC and the
Bank:
*   Splitting the overall Project into three smaller projects (natural forest protection and management,
plantation establishment, and wood processing) to reduce complexity and simplify institutional
arrangements. This was rejected because of the critical importance of taking an integrated approach to
sustainable natural forest management that ensures strong linkages and synergy across all land use
activities, as emphasized in the Lessons Leamed Section below. In this context, each of the Project's
components has been designed with complementary objectives and activities which will be linked
during implementation in the three key Project provinces.
*   Supporting the redeployment of redundant state enterprise loggers to new jobs. This was rejected
because (a) the Central Government is already providing a significant amount of funding for the
restructuring of logging enterprises under NFPP and therefore less critical need for additional Bank
financing; (b) the Bank's policy is to support diversification of enterprise ownership and not new SOE
establishment, as SOEs absorb a disproportionate share of resources in China, have inadequate
systems of govemance, and are still insufficiently subject to market discipline; and (c) previous Bank
experience for enterprise restructuring in China is poor, as many SOEs have encountered operational
difficulties and failed to repay their loans.
*   Developing a much larger program of income generating activities for households potentially adversely
affected by the logging ban, many of which are located in nationally or provincially designated poverty
counties. This was scaled back because government is insisting on full cost recovery of project loans
from project beneficiaries and IBRD lending terms are not suitable for many of these household
activities.
*   Piloting natural forest management activities in a larger number of provinces to increase the
development impact of the Project. This was rejected because of the complexity of project activities,
the limited familiarity of implementing agencies with sustainable forest management, and the need for
extensive capacity building and technical assistance--which highlight the importance of a phased, pilot
approach in a small number of closely monitored project areas.
*   Including a much smaller number of nature reserves to simplify implementation. This was rejected
because of (a) the urgency of strengthen protection of these globally important areas; (b) the
opportunity presented by the logging ban to strengthen protection and management of more areas (this
ban can be lifted in the near future); and (c) the demonstrated satisfactory implementation of the
on-going GEF-financed Nature Reserves Management Project by SFA.
*   Including a separate Planning, Monitoring, and Policy Development Component which was originally
envisioned to address project-specific, provincial-wide, and national-level requirements. Instead, the
critical planning, monitoring, and policy issues necessary for effective implementation of specific
project activities (natural forest management, protected area management, and commercial
afforestation) will be picked up and incorporated in each of the three separate components). A more
ambitious agenda to support the development of improved inventory assessment and monitoring at the
provincial and national levels, and development of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation program
to review the environmental, biological, social, financial, and economic impacts of NFPP at the
national level has been rejected in view of the limited availability of donor grant support and the need to
reduce the overall complexity of the Project.

*   Structuring the Project as an Adaptable Program Loan to support the phased implementation of the
government's long-term NFPP. This was rejected because of the difficulty in developing a standard
menu of investment activities for all 17 provinces participating in NFPP and specific performance
indicators to trigger subsequent projects (extensive preparation work and stakeholder consultant has to
be done in each project area to identify the appropriate mix of activities and performance indicators).

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The main lessons are summarized below, which come from project work (including the 1998 QAG/AGR
review of the forest portfolio and GEF supported projects in the Bank), analytic and advisory activities
(including the 1999 draft China Case Study for the OED Review of the 1991 Forest Policy and Its
Implementation, the 1999 Strategic Framework for Natural Resource Management in East Asia, and the
1994 ENV/AGR review of implementation of the Bank's forestry policy), and the Bank's knowledge
management system (including the 1998 workshop on sustaining tropical forests), and donor/NGO
consultations (including the background documents for the WWF-World Bank Alliance).
Key issues for effective natural forest management:
*   Forestry cannot be considered in isolation from other land uses and must be fully integrated into
land use planning;
*   Successful management is only possible with a defined and enforced permanent forest area;
*   Accurate inventory of multiple forest resources are needed to guide forest planning;
*   Management objectives need to be tailored to the potential of specific sites and the demands of
local communities and linkages between conservation and development should be explicit;
*   The interests of all stakeholders must be taken into account in decisions on forest management;
*   All management options for forests -- even total protection -- incur financial and economic costs;
consequently, the options selected must have long-term financial and economic sustainability;
*   Commercial timber plantations and trees in farming systems must play a role in securing
sustainable management of natural forests and need to be planned and monitored to appropriate
standards; and
*   Institutions and agencies charged with forest management must raise technical standards and
provide structures that are conducive to the outputs sought.
Key recommendations for Bank-financed natural forest management projects:
*   Support modemization and implementation of more appropriate legislation, regulation, and
resource rights;
*   Support altemative resource control systems, such as deconcentration, decentralization, and
co-management with government agencies, local communities, the private sector, NGOs, and
others;
*   Closely coordinate technical training with the timing and needs of institutional change and
development for locally responsible resource management agencies;
*   Give priority to effective policy analysis and development, since policy and market failures have
been more serious than technical problems of forest management, silviculture, and conservation;
*   Support investments in boundary demarcation, resource assessment and inventories and growth
and yield studies; and
*   Strengthen systems for monitoring resource management and audit of institutional performance.
Key recommendations for the China forestry program:
*   Mobilize concessional cofinancing to soften IBRD terms, as IBRD funding alone may be too costly
for poor households and lead to their exclusion from project activities;
*   Strengthen data collection and monitoring and evaluation (particularly of socio-economic factors)
at project, provincial, and national levels, as it is currently difficult to evaluate the impact of
- 15-



project loans, management innovations, and forest policies on overall sector performance and Bank
projects;
* Deepen policy dialogue and support sectoral reforms, particularly in the areas of SOE
restructuring, private sector development, and land tenure, and resource taxation;
* Continue to support commercial plantation development, which will reduce pressure on natural
forests, expand domestic wood supply, and generate environmental benefits;
* Expand GEF program, as China's global biodiversity resources warrant a larger share of
international support than is presently received; and
*   Diversify participants in sector dialogue by reaching out to the wider academic community, a
broader range of institutions, and NGOs in the forest sector.
4. Indications of borrower and recipient commitment and ownership:
GOC has shown its commitment to the protection of remaining natural forests by launching the NFPP and
allocating substantial funds for its implementation. This Project will be assisting SFA and pilot provinces
in the design and implementation of the NFPP and its goal of conserving and managing the remaining
natural forests and its biodiversity. SFA, 13 participating provinces, and a cross-section of county and
township governments have shown strong commitment and ownership through their high level of
preparedness throughout the complicated project preparation process. The final design has been developed
and shaped by inputs and participation from these major stakeholders.
5. Value added of Bank and Global support in this project:
The Bank and GEF involvement in the Project and NFPP would provide the following contributions:
*   The Project would introduce and disseminate the latest scientific management approaches (i.e.
intemational best practices) in natural forest planning and management, management of nature
reserves, community participation in co-management, and monitoring and evaluation. Previous
Bank projects have proven to be very effective vehicles to transfer technology and knowledge.
*   The NFPP's main focus is on reforming state forest enterprises and redeploying redundant workers.
The Project would seek to redress the potential loss of income to rural forest communities which
the NFPP has not been able to fully address. There are a number of small-scale pilot initiatives
supported by bilateral donors and NGOs (especially GTZ, Ford Foundation, WWF, The Bridge
Fund) from which lessons for larger scale replication can be learned, particularly with regard to
participatory community planning and development. The Bank is in a good position to facilitate
this process, which will involve not only project initiatives but also the resolution of key policy
issues that are systemic in nature.
*   The Bank has been involved in biodiversity conservation in China since the initiation of the
Biodiversity Action Plan and assisted China with the preparation and implementation of the first
GEF-supported biodiversity project--NRMP. Through this and other activities, the Bank has
gained a comprehensive understanding of and experiences on the key biodiversity conservation
issues facing China. The Bank can facilitate integration of experiences and results into its policy
dialogue on environment and development.
*   The Project will require multiple sources of financing. The Bank's experience in coordinating
multiple donors in financing a range of sub-projects is an area of distinct comparative advantage.
- 16 -



*   The Social Assessment process has driven the design and re-design of specific sub-components of
the Project. As a result, specific project activities are more aligned with the needs of local
communities. Moreover, areas of possible conflict (between community demands and natural
resources protection objectives, between participating and non-participating communities in the
project area, and between communities and government agencies) have been identified and
appropriate instruments have been designed to safeguard against any potential risk to community
livelihoods. The Project will continue to conduct social assessments and use this instrument in
strengthening design and implementation of the Project.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
O Cost benefit    NPV=US$2 16 million; ERR = 25 % (see Annex 4)
0 Cost effectiveness
0 Incremental Cost
* Other (specify)
Standard benefit-cost analysis has been used to evaluate the IBRD-financed PE component,
cost-effectiveness analysis was used to assess the EU-financed NFM component (see EU Brief in project
files), and incremental cost analysis for the GEF-financed PAM component (see Annex 11).
Economic cost-benefit analysis has been carried out for each timber and economic tree crop species, other
income generating components such as pre-commercial thinning, and for the Project as a whole (the
analysis is based on direct costs and benefits, and does not reflect any indirect environmental benefits such
as reduced soil erosion or carbon sequestration). The results are sumnmarized below and presented in
greater detail in Annex 4, along with detailed assumptions about production levels, markets, prices, and
methodological assumptions.
The overall ERR for the entire Project is 25%. The economic rate of return (ERR) for demonstrations of
pre-commercial thinning is estimated at 22%. The ERR for most timber species range from 16 to 20
percent, reflecting their long gestation period and the moderate price levels for non-speciality timber used in
the construction and paper making industries in China; however, several species generate particularly high
returns, including poplar, moso bamboo and casuarina, as a result of their shorter rotations and higher
market values. The overall ERR for the timber component is 30 percent. The ERRs for the economic tree
crops are higher, generally ranging from 15 to 37 percent, and reaching as high as 48 percent for a
specialty prickly-ash variety. The overall ERR of the economic tree crop component is 26 percent.
Sensitivity analysis indicates that these findings are relatively robust to wide changes in key parameters.
2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ 153 million; FRR = 22 % (see Annex 4)
The results of the financial analysis and detailed assumptions about production levels, input and output
prices, and methodology are presented in Annex 4. The overall financial rate of return (FRR) for the
plantation establishment component is 22%. The FRRs for timber and economic tree crop species are 21
and 29 percent, respectively. Pre-commercial thinning yields a FRR of approximately 19%.
Market Risks. Changing domestic market conditions have heavily undermined the profitability of past
investments in commercial wood plantations, economic tree crops, and forest-sector enterprises in China.
While NFPP, and particularly the logging ban, is expected to contribute to a decrease in domestic timber
supply and thereby an increase in domestic wood prices (at least in the short- to medium-term), careful
- 17-



attention has been paid to locating plantation sites near commercial wood markets and large-scale industrial
consumers. Similarly, the selection of appropriate tree crops is based on market studies evaluating the
potential market for various tree-crops.
Fiscal Impact:
The Project is not expected to generate negative fiscal impacts since beneficiaries of the PE component
would assume full responsibility for repayment of the IBRD loan. Moreover, the projected fees and taxes
under the Project would cover the government's counterpart funding contribution, and beneficiaries would
be responsible for financing almost all recurrent operating costs. However, the likely negative budgetary
impact of the logging ban on local governnent finances will likely squeeze local government reserves which
may adversely affect the Project in its ability to generate the necessary counterpart funds and in a timely
way. In order to better assess the fiscal impacts of the logging ban on local government reserves, a study
was conducted in one of the project counties, Pingwu County in Sichuan Province.
Overall, the impact of the logging and timber transport bans on County government finances are broad and
severe, covering four dimensions: budgetary, extra-budgetary, financial and enterprise-related. Public (and
quasi-public) revenues and expenditures are shrinking significantly because of the bans, although the
overall impact will not be clear until much later when the full impact of ban on log transport is felt. Local
tax revenues in 1999 were 34 percent below what they would have been without the bans, and in 2000, they
were approximately 58 percent below what they otherwise would have been. Budgetary expenditures were
down 10 percent in 1999 and declined by approximately 45 percent in 2000. In addition to tax revenues,
extra-budgetary income is also severely affected by the bans. The loss of logging and timber processing
fees traditionally paid to the county Forestry Bureau appears itself to be a loss of a fifth of overall county
extra-budgetary income. Other fee sources were reduced 15 to 25 percent from normal levels in 1999. The
impact on extra-budgetary revenue in 2000 was greater, and trends in 1999 show that required
extra-budgetary outlays are increasing, such as payments for pensions, unemployment compensation, and
basic subsistence assistance. In addition to budgetary and extra-budgetary funds, local governments rely to
some degree on the lending of local financial institutions to implement public programs.
Available data show that deposit growth in most county financial institutions has slowed dramatically since
the bans, and for the Agricultural Bank of China, net deposit growth is expected to become net
withdrawals. The provincial forestry bureau has made an appeal to provincial and central governments for
assistance in repaying the bank debts of logging and timber-related enterprises, which have become
non-repayable since the logging and transport bans. Finally, enterprises themselves are required by law to
make public expenditures and investments, and available data show that some of these expenditures in
Pingwu County were greatly reduced in 1999 and are expected to decline even more between 2000-2004.
The impact of the bans is even more severe at the township level. For one project township (Wuzuo
Township, Sichuan Province), revenues from fees and other extra-budgetary sources declined by
approximately 60 percent in 2000.
Overall, local government finances in project counties are already severely affected by the bans. However,
the overall level of economic activity in the county was also reduced, and it is not clear to what degree the
need for government finance may adjust downward in the medium-to-long run. For the near future, at least,
as costs of adjusting the formerly logging- and timber-related labor force to other employment patterns goes
forward, there is if anything a greater need for local government resources than there has been in the past.
SFDP, through the PE component will help to generate revenue and thereby reduce the overall negative
fiscal impact of the logging ban.

3. Technical:
Forest land use zoning. The existing forest zoning and nature reserve zoning systems embody some
weaknesses, such as lack of standardization, subjective and inconsistent application, and lack of grounding
in sound ecological principles. A rational zoning system that is technically sound, easily understood and
simply applied in practice, will be essential to meet the objective of the Project. Zoning issues are
addressed up-front in both the NFM and PAM components.
Nature reserve management plans. At present it is not possible to obtain official approval by SFA of
management plans as envisioned under the Project. This is because the current official approval process
means commitment to fund all activities specified under the plan. To overcome this constraint, the Project
will produce management plans in 2 separate volumes. Volume 1 will include details of the baseline
conditions, management objectives, and proposed zonation and management activities for the target site.
Volume 2 will include a detailed budget specifying those expenditures which are one-time investments (civil
works and equipment) and those which are recurrent costs (e.g. salaries, fuel, supplies and spare parts).
Although both volumes of each management plan produced by the Project will be submitted jointly to the
appropriate authorities for review purposes, only the technical aspects of the plan (i.e. Volume 1) will
require official endorsement (from DNR) that recognize this document as the overall plan for the nature
reserve. Volume 2 will be used (with cross referencing to Volume 1) by the nature reserve authorities as
the basis for soliciting funds from local, provincial, national, and intemational sources as and when
required.
Pre-commercial thinning of plantations. In China, there are large areas of existing plantations which are
densely stocked and have not been thinned due in part to a lack of financing. This has led to less than
optimal growth, a loss in overall productivity and subsequent loss in yield. Therefore, pre-commercial
thinning is considered an investment cost not a routine recurrent cost since the investment will lead to net
productivity gains at harvesting time. Experiences in China and elsewhere have shown that it is
particularly important to thin between ages 8-12 years after which the productivity gains decline. Thinning
models under a broad range of plantation conditions have been developed based on available research
results. The Project will finance pre-thinning on a demonstration basis and monitor the results carefully.
4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
SFA and the provincial forestry departments have demonstrated excellent institutional capacity in the
management of five previous Bank-supported forestry projects and one GEF-financed biodiversity project
over the past decade, reflecting effective govemance mechanisms, extremely competent and committed
staff, and well developed rules and procedures for management and supervision of Bank-financed project
activities. Because the Project involves the participation of several different units within SFA at the
central-level and within the Department of Forestry at the provincial-level, mechanisms have been designed
through the project Leading Groups and project management offices to ensure more effective coordination.
In addition, funds have been set aside to facilitate exchanges of information among the components and
stakeholders, particularly with regard to annual work planning and management.
4.2 Project management:
Although SFA and all project provincial forestry departments with the exception of Gansu Province are
familiar with Bank procedures, grassroots forestry staff at the county, township and nature reserve levels,
particularly in remote areas, have either no or very little experience with Bank operating procedures, and
consequently will need significant training to support implementation. The Project includes comprehensive
training and extension programs for project staff as well as communities and households, including project
- 19-



management skills such as computer, finance, and procurement training; technical skills such as planting
materials development, non-timber forest products domestication, and improved cultivation; both domestic
and intemational technical assistance; study tours such as farmer-to-farmer exchanges; and demonstrations
to pilot activities.
4.3 Procurement issues:
The procurement assessment (see Annex 6 and Project File) found no concerns of substance, since most
Project provinces have implemented Bank-financed forestry projects. However, the lack of experience with
undertaking procurement in accordance with Bank guidelines by provincial OWPPs and Gansu PMO will
be addressed as follows: First, procurement training will be provided to such staff handling procurement.
The training will be overseen by PMC of SFA and will start during the Project Launch Workshop. Second,
the provincial PMOs will work closely with the OWPPs during the first two years of implementation to
develop capacity. Third, a strict Bank review of procurement procedures will be in place during the early
stages of project implementation which would include Bank prior review of all ICB contracts, the first two
NCB contracts for works, all NCB contracts for goods irrespective of contract values, and first two
contracts for shopping for each province.
4.4 Financial management issues:
The financial management system will be similar to those for earlier loans in the forestry sector in China.
The Project will have in place an adequate financial management system that can provide, with reasonable
assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the Project in the reporting format needed by
the Bank. Training will be provided to project financial staff on an annual basis.
5. Environmental:                  Environmental Category: A (Full Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
The SFDP has been assigned an EA category "A" in the Bank's classification system.
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (reviewing the Project's likely positive and negative
environmental and social impacts) and an Environmental Management Plan (covering mitigation measures,
monitoring, and institutional strengthening) have been prepared given the broad scope of coverage of the
Project. The report incorporated the findings and recommendations of the Social Assessment (SA) which
was conducted separately.
Overall, the Project focuses on high-priority natural resource management issues and is expected to
generate significant environmental benefits. The NFM and PAM components are expected to have positive
environmental impacts, both directly, by protecting some of the most important remaining natural forests
and associated biodiversity in China, and indirectly, through protecting key watersheds and thus lowering
the risk of downstream flooding. Any negative environmental issues arising from these components are
expected to be insignificant and easily mitigated. Simple environmental guidelines will be formulated for
village-level small-scale infrastructure once they are identified through the community assessment and
planning process under the NFM component. Guidelines for infrastructure development proposed for
nature reserves would be included in the reserve management plan.
The PE component should also have positive environment impacts through the reduction of pressures on the
natural forest as well as decreased demand for imports of forest resources from outside of China, and
contributions to local community income. Negative environmental issues arising from this component are
expected to be limited in scope and easily mitigated. Nonetheless, these will require an in-depth process to
be followed, principally due to the wide geographic coverage of the component. An objectively verifiable
process of screening of sites identified for conversion to plantation under the component has been developed
- 20 -



to ensure that the component sites are outside of intact forest, will not convert or degrade natural habitats,
or adversely affect cultural property. In addition, a pest management plan as well as a set of environmental
protection guidelines for plantations establishment (revised from an earlier version developed under
previous Bank-financed plantations projects) providing plantation planning, establishment and operations
protocols will be applied to ensure that unintended environmental impacts are avoided, with special
attention to issues of pest management.
5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?
See 5.1 and Annex 12
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:
Date of receipt of final draft: April 2001 (submitted to Infoshop on
May 7, 2001) along with an Etlmic
Minority Development Plan detailing a
policy and process framework to deal
with potential involuntary resettlement
issues (see Section 7.2 and Annexes 12,
14, and 15).
5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
A three-phase on-going consultation process well integrated into the SA process has been followed.
Project information leaflets and brochures describing the proposed project concept were developed,
distributed and explained on two occasions--December 16, 1999 and March 6, 2000--in each of the
proposed project sites and prior to the SA consultations The distribution of leaflets was followed up during
the pilot phase of the SA from January 3, 2000 to February 15, 2000, where afirst round of consultations
with potential project affected peoples was conducted. A second round of consultations occurred during
the wider SA process.  The SA included semi-structured interviews of over 1,500 households in
approximately 242 project villages across thirteen Project provinces and over 70 focus group discussions
involving some 8,000 community residents. Of those consulted, 900 households belonged to one of the 18
ethnic minority groups (i.e. Li, Tibetan, Qiang, Tujia, Miao, She, Dong, Dulong, Hui, Mongols, Manchus,
Yao, Bai, Lisu, Nu, Yi, Pumi and Naxi) that may participate in the Project. In addition, dozens of
institutional stakeholder meetings (with administrative village leaders, township, county and provincial
government officials) were held.
During the pilot SA work in Hainan province, the issue of no written language for the Li people was
addressed by discussing the material in the local spoken language and providing the materials for the
consultations in pictorial form. Sichuan provincial SA teams also used drawings in order to communicate
with village communities (many whom are illiterate) during the SA process. Similarly, for other ethnic
minority areas or in areas with a relatively low level of literacy, care was taken to ensure that the materials
for the consultations were provided in a form and a language that are accessible to the groups being
consulted. The general rule for the Project has been that if standard Chinese is not widely understood by
the groups being consulted, the materials for the consultations would be provided in a language suitable to
the locality and/or in pictorial form.
- 21 -



The third round of formal consultations discussed the draft ESIA. As part of this consultation, all project
affected people were informed of the ESIA findings and more than one hundred villages were randomly
selected for village meetings. Leaflets of the ESIA findings and recommendations were distributed and
posted in each village at least 10 days prior to a meeting. The village representative assigned a responsible
person to keep minutes and summarize the discussion. Particularly, (a) the number of men and women who
attend the meeting will be disclosed, (b) who they are (villager, village leader, township/county officials,
PMO staff, and so on), and (c) a summary of the questions, comments, and concerns raised at the meeting.
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
Refer to the Environmental Protection Guidelines and Pest Management Plan for PE component which
contains monitoring indicators which are included in the project monitoring and evaluation plans.
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
Areas of remaining natural forest and natural habitat in China are located in relatively remote, steeply
sloping areas. These areas are also home to significant ethnic minority populations. As both the NFM and
the PAM components focus on remaining areas of natural forest and natural habitat, the project areas for
these two components include large populations of relatively poor ethnic minorities.
These local communities, many of which are impoverished, are typically forest-dependent in that they
derive substantial portions of their income from the use of non-timber forest products, rely on firewood as a
major energy source, and use forest areas for other subsistence and economic activities such as farming
staple grains, grazing livestock, and medicinal herb production. In some areas, these activities increasingly
exceed sustainable levels, undermining already meager livelihoods. Moreover, coupled with widespread
wildlife hunting and illegal extraction of timber products, excessive levels of forest-resource use can
adversely affect the sustainability of natural forests and the biological integrity of nature reserves.
The significant forest dependence of the local communities presents a three-fold challenge to protecting the
China's natural forests and nature reserves from overuse and other threats. The first facet of the challenge
is how to engage local people in management, during the Project and over the long-term? The second is
what are the appropriate incentives for local people to use forest resources sustainably? And, the third is
what types of alternatives could be developed to forest-resource-dependent activities which would both
support more sustainable livelihoods and maintain the integrity of the natural forests and nature reserves?
The Project aims to address these challenges by: (a) increasing the participation of communities in nature
conservation and the sustainable management of forest resources; and (b) providing assistance to local
communities for identification of appropriate measures to enhance the sustainability of natural
resource-based activities, as well as identification of alternatives to forest-dependent livelihood activities.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
SFA prepared the Project with extensive inputs from the thirteen provincial forestry departments, some 113
county forestry bureaus and 13 nature reserves with assistance from a team of domestic and international
experts. The SA process enabled high levels of consultations with and participation of diverse stakeholder
groups during project design. The SA provided useful information about the existing social conditions,
flagged any potential negative impacts, assisted in improving the social design particularly the community
- 22 -



development planning process, and served as baseline for future monitoring. The summary of the findings
of the Social Assessment is presented in Annex 13.
Consultations and participation will be continued throughout implementation. The PE component has a
formal transparent applications process to encourage wider participation by households. The management
planning process in both the NFM and PAM components give considerable emphasis to participatory
approaches to addressing current pressures and dependencies on the natural forests or nature reserves.
Under these two components, the planning process would provide an opportunity for structured
consultation and participation of local people during the management plan development process. Meetings
and informal village level consultations would provide an opportunity to improve public participation in
this process. The principal objective of these meetings/consultations would be to find mutually agreed
solutions to mitigate negative mutual impacts--either through directly decreasing these impacts or through
finding compensatory mechanisms.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
Preparation process included formal and informal consultations and briefings with international NGOs
working in China including WWF, the Nature Conservancy, Conservation International, the Bridge Fund,
KhamAid, and the Zoo community. WWF and The Nature Conservancy provided valuable inputs in the SA
for Yunnan nature reserves and are expected to be partners during implementation. Other donors involved
in forestry in China have either participated on Bank missions (e.g., EU, GTZ, and Finland) or have been
consulted separately (e.g., AusAid CIDA, and UNDP) and at briefing meetings convened during the
identification, preparation, and pre-appraisal missions by SFA.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
In the PAM component, a community development officer will be designated at central, provincial, and
nature reserves levels and be responsible for working with local communities to ensure that the Process
Framework developed by the Government to ensure participation of local communities in co-management
of the nature reserves are implemented effectively. Regular reporting will be provided through the M&E
system, reviewed by the provincial OWPP and central PO and during regular Bank supervision missions.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
In addition to regular semi-annual progress reports, regular Bank supervision and mid-term review, for
NFM component, household case studies will be carried out of small samples of villager groups and annual
updates will be carried out for the same sample to provide information on impact of both improved forest
management and community development. For PAM component, several PRA surveys will be carried out
by nature reserve staff and villagers to study impact of community-based nature conservation on the
various stakeholder groups. For PE component, impact monitoring will include random selection of
counties, townships, and villages during supervision to review applications and loan contracts and client
satisfaction survey among a representative sample.

6.6 Gender
During the three-phase consultation process, the views of women have specifically been sought. To
overcome illiteracy among women and especially those from minority groups, pictorial leaflets and other
documentations were produced to seek their inputs on project design components and activities as well as
monitoring and evaluation. The SA problem ranking surveys revealed that men and women have different
development priorities. The activities identified by women that would yield higher benefits for them,
particularly women of poorer households, include access to drinking water facilities, education and health
facilities, village roads, small animal raising and sustainable NTFP uses. Unemployed women in State
Forest Enterprises requested specific vocational training courses and basic education retraining. The SA
conducted in many nature reserves identified the need for project activities that support training in literacy,
accounting and farm management. Moreover, women of the Li ethnic minority tend to be in a more
vulnerable position as compared to women of other ethnic groups. As a result, greater attention would be
placed on incorporating their needs into specific activities planned under the Project.
7. Safeguard Policies:

7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies.
Environmental Assessment. A comprehensive ESIA was conducted, incorporating the results of the SA,
a summary of which is provided in Annex 12. The ESIA is based on three major field missions in which
the EIA team of international and national consultants traveled parallel to, but independent of, the project
preparation team. The ESIA incorporated the findings and recommendations of the SA and included an
Environmental and Social Impact Management Plan which includes the following: Environmental
Protection Guidelines for PE component, Pest Management Plan for PE component, Resettlement Policy
Framework for PE and NFM components and Process Framework for PAM component.
Forestry. The Project fully complies with the Bank's Forest Policy. As evidenced by the imposition of the
logging ban and the initiation of the NFPP, GOC has made a commitment to move toward sustainable
management of its natural forests, and to retain as much effective forest cover as possible. The Project
focuses on development, pilot implementation and dissemination of innovative management approaches to
better manage the last remaining forested areas in China and to establish plantations to relieve pressures on
those forest resources. The site screening process undertaken as part of the ESIA (see annex 12), and
continued during implementation, will confirm that plantations would be established on sites outside areas
of intact forest.
-24 -



Natural Habitats. No conversion or degradation of critical or other natural habitats will occur as a result
of the Project. The government's own laws and regulations prohibit plantation established in such areas
and the supplementary site screening procedures included in the Project will provide an additional level of
assurance that this will be the case.
Pest Management. Increasing the area of timber forest and economic tree crops could increase the
incidence of pests and disease which, in turn, could increase the use of pesticides. The SFA advocates and
follows an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, which promotes the use of non-chemical methods
of pest and disease control as a first option and use of chemicals as last resort based on objective
monitoring of pest and disease levels. These procedures have been institutionalized within the Project in the
form of a Pest Management Plan. The pest management plan includes a substantial training program for
both participating households and forestry bureau staff responsible for project implementation. A review
of the specific pests and diseases and proposed chemicals to be used was carried out at appraisal. All
chemicals fall within the WHO's hazard categories II (moderately hazardous) and III (slightly hazardous)
or are listed in Table 5 (chemicals unlikely to present acute hazard in normal use).
Cultural Property. No adverse impacts to cultural property are envisaged as a result of the Project. The
site process undertaken as part of the ESIA, and continued during implementation, will confirm that
cultural property will not be adversely affected by the PE component. The NFM and PAM components,
through protection of natural forests and natural habitats in selected nature reserves, may also indirectly
protect any cultural property in these areas.
Indigenous Peoples. Of the 55 recognized nationalities in China, a total of 18 reside in the project area.
As part of the SA process, ethnic profiles/briefs were prepared highlighting (i) the location and population
of the ethnic minorities; (ii) different sub-groups, specific language types and levels of literacy; and (iii) key
measures being taken under the Project to ensure cultural and location-specific appropriateness. In total
over 900 ethnic minority households were interviewed and over 50 focus group discussion were held in
ethnic minority areas and the results contributed to the development of a separate Ethnic Minorities
Development Plan (see Annex 16 for a summary).
Involuntary Resettlement. No involuntary physical relocation or land acquisition is envisaged under the
Project. However, a Policy Framework for Resettlement and Land Acquisition has been prepared in
accordance to Bank's Operational Directive 4.30 (see Annex 14 for details) in the event that the
development of small-scale infrastructure (e.g., village roads, storage sheds, fruit storage facilities, and so
on) under the NFM and PE components require taking of land or assets. The exact site of this small
infrastructure will not be known until implementation when the communities themselves determine what
they need.  The PAM   component will have no involuntary physical relocation, and therefore the
requirement of OD 4.30 for a resettlement policy framework or resettlement action plan is not triggered.
Nonetheless, to achieve the objectives of the policy and to adequately address possible adverse impacts on
peoples' livelihoods arising from new restrictions on access to resources inside the nature reserves, a
Process Framework for Mitigation Potential Adverse Livelihood Impacts has been prepared by the
Borrower in accordance with the new OP 4.12 (which replaces OD 4.30). This Process Framework reflects
good practice in the implementation of this type of project component and fulfills the objectives of OD
4.30. The Process Framework will ensure that the implementation of the project component includes a
participatory process which would be used during project implementation to avoid significant adverse
impacts on peoples' livelihoods, select and agree on measures to mitigate those impacts which cannot be
avoided, as well as resolve any conflicts which may arise (see Annex 15 for details).

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Experience from earlier Bank involvement in Chinese forestry strongly supports the expectation of
sustainable impact. Forest resources established under earlier projects have demonstrated good technical
performance in terms of growth rates, survival, preliminary economic returns, and environmental impact.
Similarly, the ongoing GEF-NRMP is demonstrating good outcomes in terms of not only raising the quality
of staff and management but also institutionalizing project activities into the SFA system. Institutional
sustainability will be addressed through a comprehensive program of technical assistance, training, and
study tours to strengthen existing capacity and ensure development of long-term management skills in
project management units, extension institutions, and beneficiaries. In addition, the Project is relying on
existing administrative and organizational structures especially at the local levels to implement activities.
Financial sustainability will be addressed through a cost recovery program for the PE component and
through self-managed community development funds for the NFM and PAM components. These funds will
be designed during the first year of implementation and will build on the experiences of
micro-financing/revolving fund schemes. Demanding cost sharing arrangements have proven to be an
effective way of ensuring adherence to high operational standards and have resulted in high levels of cost
recovery. Furthermore, partnerships with NGOs and other donors for PAM component at the reserve-level
will ensure continuation of incremental field activities beyond the life of the Project. Staff and routine
operating expenses are already and will continue to be provided by the Government. Environmental
sustainability will be addressed through the introduction of environmentally sound forest management
(including co-management) plans and detailed environmental protection and monitoring guidelines for the
Plantation Establishment component. Social and cultural sustainability at the village level will be
addressed by ensuring representation of all groups including ethnic minorities and women and, in the
Tibetan areas, the involvement of monks in developing the community plans.
2. Critical Risks (reflecting the failure of critical assumptions found in the fourth column of Annex 1):

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Some project sites in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Gansu provinces are inhabited by ethnic Tibetans, and three
project areas are in areas that have special status as Tibetan autonomous areas. In the Natural Forest
Management component, Songpan County, Aba Tibetan-Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province
was included because of its rich natural forests and biodiversity.  Similarly, the Protected Area
Management component includes Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture
in Yunnan Province, because of the condition of the natural forest and globally significant biodiversity
found there. In addition, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, a part of western Sichuan, is the focus of
a biodiversity survey. Local consultations undertaken as part of the Social Assessment confirmed interest
and willingness on the part of Tibetan communities and their leaders to participate in the Project. Feedback
from international (environmental) NGOs working in China, and Bridge Fund and KhamAid working
specifically with Tibetans in China thus far have indicated that the Project should not avoid Tibetan areas.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
CHINA: Sustainable Forestry Development Project
By Component:
Project Component I - US$20.00 million
(total cost)
Natural Forest Management (NFM)
1.1    The Natural Forest Management (NFM) component would support: development, pilot
implementation and dissemination of new sustainable management techniques in approximately 203,000
hectares of natural forest areas within six counties across the three key provinces of Sichuan, Hunan and
Hainan; community development and livelihood enhancement activities targeting 59 villages within 13
townships most severely affected by the Government's NFPP; training of forest administration staff and
dissemination of results beyond the project areas using focused workshops and mass media; and forest
management training for SFE employees and vocational training for laid-off SFE workers. EU funds are
being sought to finance this component in its entirety. Co-financing would be implemented in parallel.
1.2    The component comprises the following sub-components and activities:
(a)    Natural Forest Manag-ement to develop viable natural forest management models, and
test and introduce them in pilot areas.
Resource assessment, zoning and forest classification comprising: (i) acquisition and interpretation of
satellite imagery, and associated forest mapping to quantify and assess changes in vegetation and
landscape; (ii) establishment of locally relevant and objectively verifiable criteria for zoning and
classification of forests, based on the national NFPP classification criteria; (iii) development and testing of
new inventory systems involving sampling of multiple forest resources, building on existing forest resource
survey manuals and instructions as well as best intemational examples; (iv) development of a resource
management data base; and (iv) re-zoning and reclassification of forest areas based on updated field
information including the analysis of biophysical land use and forest management options, and provincial
workshops to promote the revised classifications and land use/forest management zoning.
Yield regulation and control activities for timber, fuelwood and NTFPs comprising: (i) review of the
current regulatory framework with particular attention to legislation and yield regulation instructions,
proposal for revision of these, and development of a revised yield prediction manual; (ii) formulation of
economic rationale for sustainable use of natural forests, based on valuation of project biophysical yields
from sustainable production as well as valuation of ecological benefits of natural forests; (iii) survey and
designation of operable harvest areas based on field work on topographic, hydrological, geological and soil
distributions, cross-related to possible harvesting systems under a sustainability regime; (iv) assessment of
operable harvest and commercialization options, based on field observations incorporating (ii) and (iii)
above, to develop operational yield forecasts and associated marketing plans.
Policy studies comprising: (i) economic valuation of forest products and services; (ii) appropriate
mechanisms to charge consumers for benefits derived from forests (forest ecological benefit compensation
systems); and (iii) market development and marketing of forest goods and services, as well as market
intelligence systems.
Forest management planning and implementation comprising: (i) revision of SFA manual on forest
management planning as basis for training SFA staff on forest management planning; (ii) compilation of a
- 39 -



participatory forest management plans based on: (a) development of a co-management process including
mechanisms for joint management of forest resources by government, enterprise and communities based on
joint forest management and co-management experiences in China and relevant experience elsewhere, (b)
development of detailed harvesting plans based on detailed field surveys following the identification of
operable areas above, (c) diagnosis of status of secondary forest areas after logging and/or farm fallow, as
well as of land proposed for "conversion" and mountain closure, (d) development and pilot field testing of
detailed land use options including the ecologically and economically sound options for land use and
silviculture for secondary forest, fann fallow, and land proposed for "conversion" and mountain closure to
confirm the socio-economic appropriateness of proposed options; (iii) formalization of co-management
arrangements and legal contracts among stakeholders; and (iv) implementation of forest management plans.
Monitoring and evaluation comprising: (i) a check on delivery of inputs against milestones in project
work plans; (ii) review of effectiveness of inputs and consequent outputs based on criteria and indicators
for sustainable forest management; (iii) implementation monitoring of forestry policies related to the
planning and implementation of land conversion, hill closure and logging restrictions policies will be
assessed with respect to their relevance and impact on the Project and its expected results; and (iv)
recording of changes in co-management arrangements.
(b)    Community Development to enable local communities to improve their livelihoods and to develop
land-use practice compatible with sustainable forest management. Funding would be provided to support
the following key activities:
Establishment of village development plans. During project preparation, PRA surveys identified and
prioritized menus of community development options in each of the 11 township participating in the
component. These cover village infrastructure, the diversified productive activities likely to be undertaken
through small household loans, and household training needs. During project implementation, townships
and administrative villages will form NFM component working groups, and local PRA teams will work
with them to prepare village development plans comprising: (i) a draft map showing boundaries of village
groups and of forest management units, and locations of existing and proposed infrastructure; (ii) basic
population and agricultural data per village group; (iii) menu of microcredit options, and prioritization of
training and infrastructure needs; and (iv) estimate the number of participating households for each
activity. These plans will be established at administrative village level to ensure community ownership and
will be updated annually. County Project offices will review village plans annually to take into account
arising needs and opportunities, and ensure they become increasingly integrated with forest management
activities as community capacity in forest co-management builds.  Implementation of the village
development plans will be funded under the component.
Small-scale village infrastructure. As part of village development plans, communities will identify and
prioritize the small-scale infrastructure they propose to be constructed under the component. Given limited
resources, not all infrastructure identified under the village development plan would be financed by the
component. Priority would be given to, for example, construction of community drinking water systems,
and construction or upgrading of village schools. Infrastructure needs specific to Hainan include upgrading
and expanding an irrigation system. The rehabilitation of degraded roads and electricity networks would not
be eligible for funding under the component, but the component will finance studies to analyze the rural
energy sector in Sichuan, with a focus on electricity and on fuelwood balance, and assess the feasibility of
township-to-village roads, village paths and bridges development and rehabilitation under the supervision of
the Project and within the concept of NFM. County Project offices will carefully organize technical design,
based on representative designs, and carry out quality control and monitoring to ensure quality of all works,
based on procedures established under the Project. They will transfer ownership of the infrastructure to
- 40 -



communities and train them in maintenance. Investments in schools or health stations will be coupled with
sending school teachers or village health workers to existing retraining courses.
Micro-credit to households and informal groups comprising: (i) establishment of township microcredit
institutions and of village microcredit boards; (ii) development of simple guidelines for the micro-credit
application and approval, based on technical appropriateness, technical capabilities of the applicant and
need for training, and environmental acceptability; and (iii) small household loans from RMB 500 to a
ceiling of RMB 3,000 to individual households or informal groups to fund productive activities, such as
animal production, cash crops and tree crops including cultivation of NTFPs, small processing,
transportation and service activities including tourism.
Household Training comprising: (i) training in basic farming skills; (ii) household training focused on the
main microcredit activities, household cash flow management and forest management; and (iii) functional
literacy courses will in low-literacy areas, including Songpan County in Sichuan Province, and in Hainan.
Specific technical studies comprising: (i) a rural energy study to assess fuelwood usage and trends
consumption, rural electricity usage and future prospects for energy savings; and (ii) an animal carrying
capacity study in those areas where livestock are important for ethnic minorities (especially in Sichuan).
Monitoring comprising: (i) project monitoring with key implementation and output indicators; (ii) external
social impact monitoring to asses the social risks not fully mitigated by the social assessment process; and
(iii) project Impact Monitoring to document the impact of both improved forest management and
community development on individual households and communities.
(c)    Trainin2 and Dissemination to draw lessons from local-level experience and support their broader
dissemination. Funding would be provided to support the following key activities:
Training activities would be directed at forest administration staff including NFPC, NFPOs, and
provincial and county staff involved in the planning, organization, supervision and monitoring of natural
forest management related activities and in co-management; as well as staff of other organizations involved
in co-management, mainly management staff and those involved in policy and planning. In-country training
through organized training and seminars is directed to the introduction of skills required for NFM and
co-management. An important task of this training provision is the production of training modules and
blueprints for the introduction of NFM in other areas of China, through the NFPP structures and the SFA
and regional forest administrations. Key trainers will further undergo training in activities related to the
multiplication of project concepts and will participate in training abroad in countries with proven
experience in natural forest management and co-management, like Nepal, and Europe.
Dissemination activities would be directed at a broader public not immediately involved in the Project,
such as Press and Media; stakeholders and decision makers of other similar areas/ecosystems in China,
both in the Project provinces and beyond. The benefits from improved natural forest management and
co-management will be emphasized and promoted through dissemination beyond the Project's scope. Press
releases and invitations to journalists would be used to present information to a wide audience. Experience
elsewhere suggests that such mass media publicity can encourage rapid changes in policies and legislation.
In addition, study tours will be arranged to project communities in order to demonstrate natural forest
management techniques to others. These visits will be targeted towards staff of the government agencies
(PFBs, CFBs, TWUs) as well as village committees and forest-user groups.
- 41 -



(d)    Trainine of laid-off workers of State Forest Enterprises (SFEs) to upgrade their skills and
thereby assist them in their efforts to find alternative employment, possibly in the area of forestry
management. Funding would be provided for the following key activities
Planning of an overall training plan for SFE employees comprising: (i) forest management in enterprise by
project foresters; (ii) vocational courses in enterprise by outside trainers; and (iii) joining existing
vocational courses in prefecture cities.
Training and Monitoring comprising: (i) subcontracting training courses : (ii) supervision of training
implementation; (iii) monitoring and evaluation of training performance; and (iv) ex-post training impact
assessment.
Project Component 2 - US$22.85 million
(total cost)
Protected Areas Management
2.1    In addition to Sichuan, Hainan, and Hunan, this component would also be implemented in four
adjacent provinces of Gansu, Hubei, Guizhou and Yunnan to strengthen trans-boundary protection and
exchanges between these adjoining provinces. These provinces are also included under the Government's
NFPP and provides opportunity to strengthen and mainstream biodiversity conservation into the
Government's program at the provincial-level, where the impact will be greatest. The component would
support conservation and improved management of biodiversity of global importance in selected, high
priority clusters of nature reserves in natural forest areas. The Project sites comprise 13 areas of
international biodiversity significance that have been identified as priorities in the China Biodiversity
Conservation Action Plan located in the three key provinces of Sichuan (5 sites), Hunan (2 sites) and
Hainan (I site), as well as four adjacent provinces of Gansu (1 site), Guizhou (1 site), Hubei (I sites), and
Yunnan (2 sites). GEF funds have been sought to finance the incremental costs of this component. The
principal features of the sites are shown in the following tables.

preparing a regional
conservation plan for NW
Yunnan
2.2    The component includes the following key sub-components and activities:
(a)    Participatory Nature Reserves Plannins- and Management (US$7.3 million of which GEF
US$5.4 million). This sub-component is closely linked to the strategy proposed for the Community-Based
Nature Conservation sub-component and gives considerable emphasis to developing participatory
approaches to addressing current pressures and dependencies on Project nature reserve resources. To this
end, nature reserve planners would employ structured consultations with and participation of local people
and other key stakeholders during the management plan development process for the Project's reserves.
Funding would be provided for the following key activities:
Management plan development comprising further development of feasibility studies for 12 nature
reserves into full management plans. As part of the Project's preparation process, management feasibility
studies were drafted by local nature reserve personnel for each of the Project's target sites in Gansu,
Guizhou, Hainan, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan (I I sites). Of these, the feasibility studies for the Minshan
cluster of nature reserves (4 contiguous sites in Sichuan) will be integrated to form a single plan based on
ecological rather than administrative considerations (but with each nature reserve having a separate action
plan describing implementation activities). In addition, a management feasibility study for the Nujiang
Nature Reserve in Yunnan was prepared under the auspices of the ongoing GEF-supported Nature
Reserves Management Project (NRMP). The Project would provide support for these 12 feasibility studies
to be further developed into full management plans. No project funding is needed plan development for the
other project site in Yunnan (Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve), as a management plan is already under
preparation under the auspices of the WWF China Program and NRMP.
Baseline ecosystems maps comprising preparation of seven baseline ecosystems maps for (i) the Minshan
Nature Reserve Cluster (4 sites) and for the Baodinggou NR (which adjoins the southern edge of this
cluster); (ii) the Motianling Nature Reserve cluster (2 sites); (iii) the Wulingshan Nature Reserve Cluster (3
sites); (iv) the Fanjingshan NR (I site); (v) the Jianfengling NR (I site); (vi) the Nujiang NR (I site); and
(vii) the Baimaxueshan NR (I site). These maps would include information on the distribution and diversity
of ecosystems within the project sites, along with other information such as management zones, the local
road network and the location of villages. They would be developed using existing baseline data and
information collected during the project's nature reserve management plan development process. Such
maps would be useful for not only site planning but also regional planning purposes for the Natural Forest
Protection Program.

Strengthening of Field-level management systems comprising, based on the specific recommendations in
the nature reserve management plans of the 13 nature reserves: (i) participatory nature reserve boundary
survey and demarcation; (ii) equipment for field protection staff; (iii) improved communications technology
and equipment to facilitate reserve administration; and (iv) selected small-scale infrastructure (e.g. guard
posts). Civil works would only be supported in cases where there is an unambiguous link to demonstrable
biodiversity conservation benefits in line with the nature reserve.
Applied research comprising development and implementation of one research activity at each nature
reserve which addresses either long-terrn or short-term information requirements for more effective nature
reserve management. Based on the research needs identified in the management plans, a research proposal
for each site would be developed and implemented under the component. These proposals would follow a
standard format used under the ongoing GEF-supported NRMP, and they would be developed by the
reserve personnel themselves or by the reserve working in collaboration with a local research institution or
NGO The emphasis would be on applied research to solve practical management problems related to three
broad themes: (a) nature reserve/people interactions (e.g. impacts of legal or customary human uses such as
grazing and non-timber forest product harvesting on reserve resources); (b) nature reserve management
(e.g. zonation and nature reserve boundary definition with reference to the types and extent of various
ecosystems and animal ranges; impacts and control of forest fire; tourism); and (c) nature reserve
community development (e.g. sustainable income generating opportunities from NTFPs). Panda and panda
habitat-related monitoring projects would not be supported as funding for investigations of this type is
available from other sources in China.
Biodiversity surveys of Western Sichuan comprising collection of biophysical and socioeconomic
information in the Ganzi and Liangshan Autonomous Regions of western Sichuan. Survey areas have not
been confirmed but may include Gonggashan, Hanzhishan, Chaqingsongduo and Luguhu. The biophysical
and socioeconomic information obtained would be used by the province and autonomous regions as they
develop activities under the NFPP including establishing new nature reserves, forest parks, and watershed
protection areas. It could also be used by environmental protection bureau in its effort to ensure that
proposed development activities for that area do not compromise the biodiversity. The Southwest China
Temperate Forests, consisting of a complex of forests in the upper reach of the Yangtze, Mekong
(Lancang) and Salween (Nujiang) rivers, is one of the 200 globally important ecoregions most
representative of the world's major habitat types. Northwestern Yunnan and Western Sichuan forms this
ecoregion, but the distribution and conservation status of the fauna and flora in this part of China is poorly
understood. With support from The Nature Conservancy, work is already being undertaken to gather
biophysical and socioeconomic information about NW Yunnan in support of a regional planning exercise.
GEF funds would be used to carry-out similar surveys in Western Sichuan. The surveys would complement
ecoregional/hot spot planning activities to be initiated by WWF China Program and Conservation
Intemational.
(b)    Community-Based Nature Conservation (US$5.8 million of which GEF US$5.1 million). Based
upon lessons learned from past experience of NGO- and Bank-ftnanced co-management activities in China,
the sub-component would deepen the interactions with communities by increasing opportunities for direct
participation of communities in nature conservation and the management of natural resources with the
objective of enhancing local levels of sustainable and economically viable development. Financing would
be provided to support the following key activities:
Co-management comprising development and implementation of Community Resource Management Plans
(CRMP) describing activities linking biodiversity conservation with sustainable income generation and
-47 -



thereby reducing the pressures on resources inside the nature reserve. Each province, and their respective
nature reserves, will develop co-management approaches unique to their own conditions. Nonetheless, all
co-management activities under the SFDP will follow the Process Framework found in Annex 15.
Selection of villages eligible to participate in the co-management activities would be made during project
implementation based on the results of the participatory rural assessments as well as analyses of the
sources of major threats to the nature reserves conducted a part of the nature reserve management planning
process. All "critical" villages (i.e., those which are dependent on the nature reserve, pose a threat to the
nature resere, and would be adversely affected by proposed use restrictions) would be eligible to
participate in co-management activities. The participation of a minimum of 26 villages (two per nature
reserve) would be funded by the component. Funding for the participation of "critical" villages in excess of
the first two per nature reserve will be covered by an increased level of local government counterpart
funding.  Eligible activities in the CRMP would be financed by grants through the Community
Conservation Funds (CCF) established by the component The CCF would finance small sub-projects
identified within the community to solve problems identified in the CRMP. Fifty percent of the CCF
moneys should be spent on community sub-projects that directly mitigate threats to the nature reserve while
the other fifty percent can be used for household sub-projects for altemative livelihood. Infrastructure such
as hydropower stations or roads would be ineligible for funding under the CCF. The grants will be
approved by the provincial OWPP, and each grant will be made under a contract between beneficiary
individual or group and the NR administration. The approval of the CRMPs by the Bank is a condition of
disbursement of CCF.
Community conservation education and public awareness comprising development and implementation
of community conservation education and public awareness plan aimed at increasing target community and
local government stakeholders' understanding of the functions, ecology, regulations, and problems of
nature reserves and relationship and conflicts of people and nature reserves. The plans would incorporate
experiences gained in the ongoing GEF NRMP. Nature reserves and provincial Office of Wildlife and
Plant Protection (OWPP) community affairs staff would be trained, using technical assistance and
field-based courses, to prepare and implement community conservation education strategies and funds
would be provided for each nature reserve to implement their plans within their own communities.
Based on guidelines prepared under the GEF NRMP, each nature reserve would be provided technical
assistance to prepare a Community Conservation Education (CCE) plan, which would identify its goals and
objectives, determine target audiences and their characteristics, arrange messages and themes, determine
methods of delivery, and provide action plans. The Project would provide each nature reserve with funds to
implement their CCE plans. Provincial OWPP and nature reserve staff would be trained in materials
development and delivery of CCE. Training will be extended to local government technicians, as well as
members of community groups, such as schools and management forums. Exchange visits would be
arranged for community members and nature reserve staff to view other school-based and community
education programs in China.
Energy conservation comprising an assessment of forest-based household fuel demand and targeted
demonstrations of appropriate, practical, culturally appropriate, and cost-effective energy conservation
approaches to decrease the threats from over-use of forest resources for energy in remote areas Funds
would be provided for nature reserve staff to conduct nature reserve energy surveys as part of community
PRA. Energy efficient technologies would be demonstrated for households in the co-management
communities and other representative communities surrounding the nature reserve.
Wildlife management methods for the mitigation of the negative impacts of nature reserves on local
communities to include the demonstration of wildlife management systems to reduce crop depredation to
reduce conflicts between people and wildlife. The problem of wildlife-related crop damage is most acute at
-48 -



the project sites in Sichuan (5 sites), Gansu (1 site), Guizhou (1 site) and Yunnan (2 sites). In order to
address this issue, the Project would in the first instance sponsor a workshop at which the lessons learned
from other donor-supported initiatives to address this problem would be discussed. Possible workshop
participants include WWF which is active in Sichuan and the Wildlife Conservation Society in Tibet. An
assessment of the nature and extent of the damage caused to crops by taking bears, wild pigs and macaques
at the project nature reserves in these provinces would then be conducted. The assessment would be carried
out as part of the PRA activities. The assessment exercise would (i) identify sites in each of the project
nature reserves in Sichuan, Gansu, Guizhou and Yunnan where wildlife-related crop damage is most acute;
and (ii) find mutually agreed solutions to mitigate negative mutual impacts - either through directly
decreasing negative impacts or through the definition of compensatory mechanisms. Potential solutions
include the development of a system of community patrols, the use of chemical repellents, and digging
trenches. The Project would support the costs of the assessment exercises (part of PRA) and the
development and implementation of a plan to mitigate wildlife damage at one demonstration site in each of
the project nature reserves in Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan (i.e., a total of nine sites).
Improving the delivery of sustainable technologies and enhancing community skills to include training
and technical assistance for the identification and demonstration of alternative income generating
techniques as alternatives to the use of critical forest resources. Coordinated with the community
conservation education and public awareness activities, training of both township technicians and rural
households in specialized cultivation techniques for medicinal plants, fungi, and other forest products
would be supported. Sources of techniques and trainers would be identified and appropriate courses
implemented. In order to extend the impact of the project specific demonstrations in both co-management
pilot villages and other representative communities would be provided. Training courses for improving the
capacity of households and village committees to manage community projects or household economic
activities would be developed and delivered in the co-management villages and other selected demonstration
communities.
(c)    Training and Capacity Buildingi (US$2.8 million of which GEF US$2.1 million). The training
program is designed to improve the capacity of all reserve staff for routine nature reserve management.
Management planning and community-based nature conservation in demonstration villages would provide
intensive learning opportunities for staff in nature reserves and provincial OWPP.  Existing and
newly-recruited staff would participate in an integrated program of eight in-service training courses
designed to cover different job responsibilities. The training would be organized locally by local Training
Coordinators and would be delivered by local expert trainers who themselves would be trained. Funding
would support the following key activities:
General staff training comprising a training program for all nature reserve staff tailored to the needs and
levels of different job positions, with separate courses targeting decision makers, middle-level managers,
scientific staff, community affairs staff, patrol staff, enforcement staff and administrative staff. Training
would be based largely on existing Chinese curricula particularly those developed by ongoing
GEF-supported NRMP supplemented with additional materials prepared during the management planning
and community co-management processes. Most courses would be delivered locally, in the nature reserve,
to provide opportunities for practical demonstrations and experiential learning. In addition, the Nature
Reserve Planning and Management and the Community-based Nature Conservation sub-components would
be supported by a series of workshops for on-the-job training, facilitated by international and national
technical experts. This training would be implemented sequentially, linked to the progress of the process.
Each workshop would introduce the set of skills needed for the next step and also provide an opportunity to
discuss experiences and issues arising from implementation of the previous step in the process. These
workshops would be used to generate guidelines and procedures for most of the routine work of nature
reserve management, which would eventually be revised and submitted to the Department of Wildlife and
- 49 -



Plant Protection (DWPP) of SFA for approval as a National Procedures Manual for nature reserves and
distributed to other nature reserves for their use.
Building local capacity for training delivery comprising training of trainers by experts recruited from
local institutions, such as the Sichuan Forestry School and Mianyang Nonnal College in Sichuan, the
Southwest Forestry College in Yunnan, and the South-central Forestry Academy in Hunan. For reserves in
Guizhou, Hunan and Hubei, the Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou PRA-Networks can provide appropriate
sources of experienced local trainers for community affairs staff. Where local educational institutions
cannot provide appropriate trainers, local research institutes such as the Institutes of Forest Sciences and
Social Sciences in Sichuan, and the Kunming Institutes of Zoology, of Botany and of Social Sciences in
Yunnan would be used. Wherever appropriate, partnerships would be formed with other programns
providing relevant technical assistance and training such as those sponsored by (i) WWF in Sichuan,
Hunan and Yunnan; (ii) GTZ in Hainan; and (iii) TNC and the Sino-Dutch project in Yunnan.
Institutional capacity building. In line with government policy of decentralization of implementation, the
main focus of PAM will be on building the capacity of the province and the nature reserves. The principal
purpose of this activity set is to assist with the development of appropriate organizational management
structures in support of enhanced nature reserve management. Several of the project nature reserves are
new or have been recently extended. In these cases, they will be actively recruiting new staff to fill their
quotas, and assigning them to newly created positions. Other project reserves already have full staffing,
but are still constrained by inefficient organizational structure and personnel management. The Project
would assist the reserves to increase their institutional capacity with technical assistance and training in
management methods. The Project would also facilitate the establishment of a fully-staffed and equipped
OWPP of each Provincial Forestry Department in the Project. These OWPPs would have staff designated
as responsible for (a) nature reserve planning; (b) community-based nature conservation; and (c) training
co-ordination. The OWPPs would take the lead in identifying local experts and local trainers to support
nature reserve management activities.
(d)    Proiect Management, Monitorin! and Evaluation (US$7.0 million of which GEF
US$3.4 million). Funding would be provided to support the following key activities:
Training in support of project implementation comprising training in project management procedures,
English, clerical skills, computer use and maintenance, accounting and financial management, and training
program coordination.
Policy studies comprising topics such as (i) review and development of protected areas classification
system including watershed protection forests and forest parks ; (ii) evaluation and revision of specific
regulations for nature reserve management zones including definition and regulation of buffer zone ; and
(iii) development of a standardized methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of nature reserve
management. These policy studies will be implemented by the DWPP, the agency responsible for nature
reserve management and biodiversity conservation policies, and will provide useful input to designation of
new protected areas under the NFPP. These studies will be closely coordinated with the policy studies
under the Natural Forest Management component focused on valuation of environmental services provided
by upstream protection and compensation to those communities.
Monitoring and evaluation comprising development and implementation of a simple, inexpensive and
sustainable plan for monitoring and evaluation project impacts on (i) biodiversity ; and (ii) the
socio-economic state of communities that have an impact on nature reserve resources, and that are in turn
impacted by the reserve. The measurement of these indicators would rely principally on direct survey
methods such as patrolling forms compiled during routine patrolling for biodiversity indicators, and annual
PRAs in selected villages for socio-economic indicators. Based on the agreed project performance
- 50 -



indicators, a detailed PAM Monitoring and Evaluation Plan would be prepared in year one with the
assistance of an international TA, with full participation of the nature reserves. This work would be guided
by the outline and terms of reference provided in the Project Implementation Plan and would build on the
M&E of ongoing GEF NRMP. The key lesson leamed from NRMP is that it is critical that staff who will
be implementing the M&E Plan participate fully in its design otherwise there is very little ownership,
understanding, and commitment to its implementation. Monitoring and evaluation data for indicators of
project impacts would be collated and analyzed by the scientific and community affairs staff in each
reserve. They would produce semi-annual summary reports that would be submitted to the nature reserve's
decision-makers and to the reserve's Project Management Group. These reports would also be provided to
the provincial OWPP which would be responsible for: (a) providing assistance and supervision; and (b)
submitting the summary reports to SFA's Department of Nature Reserves (DNR) with comments. DNR
would review these reports before submitting them to the World Bank. In addition, each nature reserve
would organize an annual review meeting to assess the implementation of the management plan, and a final
evaluation of the progress in the last year of the Project. Final evaluation reports will serve as a basis for
overall project evaluation.
Project Component 3 - US$ 186.79 million
(Total Cost)
Plantations Establishment
3.1    The Plantation Establishrnent component would support increasing production of wood to meet the
growing gap between domestic supply and demand, to generate new employment and income for forestry
farms and rural households affected by the logging ban and other restrictions on forest land use, and to
improve environmental management. The Plantation Establishment Component will be implemented in 107
counties in 11 provinces: Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan, Henan Shanxi, Hebei, Hubei, Anhui, Shandong,
Liaoning and Gansu. IBRD funds are being sought to finance this component in its entirety.
3.2    The key sub-components and activities are: (a) establishment of timber plantations; (b)
establishment of economic tree crops; (c) pre-commercial thinning of existing timber plantations in Anhui,
Shanxi, and Hunan provinces as a demonstration; and (d) provision of related technical support services
such as planting stock development and nursery management, training and extension, small-scale rural
infrastructure required for afforestation and post-harvest, and marketing of horticultural crops, and
monitoring and evaluation including environmental and social parameters.
(a)    Establishment of Timber Plantations (US$48.71 million). Some 115,090 ha of commercial
wood plantations for fiber and pulp, plywood,, and construction timber would be established in nine
provinces to meet forecast national and local shortages of wood. The main afforestation beneficiaries would
be individual households, shareholding cooperative forest farms, village-township collective forest farms
and state forest farms. Species, planting sites and project areas have been selected on the basis of
guidelines agreed during project preparation. The 20 species were selected on the basis of farmer
preferences, growth potential, climatic and ecological suitability to specific site conditions, technical
experience and acceptance in China, environmental objectives, and product marketability. The sites were
selected on the basis of soil fertility, rainfall, temperature, erosion hazard, and access to end-use markets.
All project sites have been identified and detailed technical design plans for the first year plantations will be
completed by October 2002. All plantations would be established in accordance with afforestation models
for each species agreed with the Bank, which cover technical silvicultural prescriptions, growth targets,
establishment costs, and financial and economic rates of return These models draw on the implementation
experience of NAP, FRDPP, and FDPA, and incorporate changes to traditional silvicultural management in
china that are expected to improve yields and reduce costs. These include lower planting densities in order
- 51 -



to promote shorter production cycles, faster income generation, and agricultural intercropping; revised
fertilizer application rates that reflect the specific nutrient requirements of the sites; less intensive site
preparation, smaller planting holes, and reduction in tending times, in order to decrease labor requirements
and minimize environmental damage on steep sites; and greater reliance on clonal planting stock and other
improved planting materials in order to promote faster tree growth. Due to variable conditions in the
project areas, the generic afforestation models may be adjusted based on local site conditions and market
opportunities but subject to review and approval by PMC.
Financing would cover: (i) all labor requirements for site preparation and planting in the first year and
tending in the first to third years; (ii) materials and equipment, including seedlings, and fertilizer; and (iii)
indirect costs related to survey and design, and project and environmental/social management and
monitoring.
(b)    Establishment of Economic Tree Crops (US$63.95 million). Some 57,940 ha of economic forest
crops, including fruit, nut and medicinal trees would be established in eleven provinces. The tree crops
include chestnut, walnut, ginkgo, eucommia, apricot, jujube, apple, pear, prickly ash, pomogranate,
Chinese yew, and so on. Those participating in this sub-component would include individual households,
shareholding cooperative forest farms, village/township forest farms and state forest farms. Varieties and
planting sites have been selected on the basis of guidelines agreed during project preparation. The varieties
were selected on the basis of farmer preference, market demand, climatic and ecological suitability to
specific site conditions, and technical experience and acceptance in China. The sites were selected on the
basis of soil fertility, rainfall, temperature, erosion hazard and access to end-use markets. All planting sites
have been identified and detailed technical design plans for first year tree crop planting areas will be
completed by October 2002. All tree crops would be established in accordance with horticultural models
for each variety. Diversified varieties will be planted to minimize economic and biological risks,
particularly in view of the over-supply problems experienced by earlier horticultural projects in China that
developed large-scale plantings of only one or two varieties.
Detailed market studies have been prepared at the provincial level for all main horticultural crops to assess
likely future demand and prices. While demand will likely increase at least at the pace of supply in the
short-term, softening of prices of some economic tree crops should be expected over the mid-and long-term
due to cumulative increase in production areas and related latent supply which will come onto the market
over the next 10 years. To mitigate the risks to significant financial viability of economic tree crops due to
market and price uncertainties, the following was agreed: First, participating project households and forest
farms will be allowed flexibility, rather than rigid adherence to the current models, in choice of inputs and
outputs which are consistent with sound technical standards, financial returns and medium term market
opportunities. However, major changes over 1,000 ha at the provincial-level of the area planted of any
single economic tree crop species would require a revised market analysis as well as revised
financial/economic analyses and be reviewed and approved by the Bank. Second, prices for the main
economic tree species computed from roadside prices will be compiled annually by the Project provinces
and reported to the Bank to ensure more closer monitoring of price fluctuations. Third, PMC would
prepare and furnish to the Bank a report summarizing marketing issues and marketing facility
arrangements for project horticultural production for the final two years of the Project based on individual
marketing reports to be prepared by the county PMOs interested in participating in the sub-loans for
market infrastructure. The receipt of the report satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of
disbursement for the marketing infrastructure sub-loans, described under paragraph 3.2 (d) - Rural
Infrastructure Program, Annex 2.
The Project would finance the following costs: (i) all labor requirements for site preparation and planting
in the first year (and tending in the first to fourth years); (ii) materials and equipment, including seedlings
(and related containers and potting media), organic and chemical fertilizer, and simple agricultural tools;
- 52 -



and (iii) indirect costs related to survey and design at the start of the Project and environmental/social
management and monitoring.
(c)    Pre-Commercial Thinning (US$13.33 million). Some 70 percent of China's plantations are young
and middle-aged stands that need pre-commercial thinning, but have not been thinned due in part to lack of
finances. The sub-component will finance the thinning of 61,330 ha of existing plantations in three
provinces consisting of Chinese fir, masson pine, slash pine, loblolly pine, and larch to demonstrate the
productivity and ultimately financial gains from proper thinning/tending. Thinning sites have been selected
on the basis of guidelines agreed during project preparation. All project sites have been identified and
detailed technical design plans for first year thinning areas will be completed by October 2002. All thinning
would be carried out in accordance with detailed site selection criteria and thinning models for each species,
and relevant technical and management regulations and monitoring/inspection system. The plantations
would be between ages 8 and 12, where the greatest productivity gain can be achieved and would exclude
previous Bank-financed plantations and natural forests, and closed hillsides. Given the demonstration
status of the areas to be thinned, the models would be applied flexibly rather than prescriptively based on
the site characteristics. In terms of intensity, if a greater proportion of large diameter logs to respond to
higher prices for large diameter timber, more intensive thinning would be required. To facilitate effective
dissemination of the results of thinning, comprehensive data on stand densities before and after thinning,
growth response to thinning, diameter increases and revenue increases as well as the cost of thinning would
be gathered and documented.
Financing would be provided for: (i) all labor requirements for thinning; (ii) access trails; and (iii) indirect
costs related to survey and design, training and extension, and project and environmental/social
management and monitoring.
(d)    Technical Support Services (US$60.80 million) would strengthen technical support programs for
project afforestation activities in four areas as follows:
Planting Stock Development Program (US$43.04 million) comprising the introduction of improved
genetic materials and nursery management technologies, and support the production of the 265 million
seedlings required under the Project. The total project seedling requirement would be grown by existing
nurseries operated by state forest farms, collective forest farms, or specialized households under contract
with forest farms or county project management offices. Every participating county would have one central
nursery and several smaller nurseries located near planting sites, in order to minimize transport distance
and handling of seedlings prior to planting. All seedlings would conform to detailed growth standards for
each species, including collar diameter, seedling height, and root system configuration.
To simplify disbursement and accounting procedures, the Project would finance the nursery-gate
production cost of the final seedling, which would be added into the unit cost for afforestation. In addition,
financing would be provided for nursery upgrading and extension including nursery equipment, on-site
irrigation system (sublateral or smaller ditches), small-scale on-site civil work such as storage sheds and
offices no larger than 150 square meters, and training. The detailed design will be reviewed and approved
by the provincial PMOs. However, the provincial PMOs will provide summary reports with short
description of the design and list of items and budget for each nursery to the PMC as part of following
year's work plan. Procurement arrangement (including civil work) would be incorporated into the annual
procurement plan.
Training and Extension Program (US$2.65 million) comprising dissemination of key research findings
and technical silvicultural guidelines to project staff (at the national, provincial, county, and township
levels) and to project beneficiaries mainly using existing forestry and agriculture extension networks at the
county and township levels. The Project would also encourage developing "non-state" extension channels,
- 53 -



such as farmers growers associations and local technical experts at the village level. The program would
support: (i) preparation of new training and extension materials; (ii) development and implementation of
domestic training programs for project staff and farmers; (iii) overseas training and study tours for project
staff; and (iv) local and intemational technical assistance.
Rural Infrastructure Program (US$13.89 million) comprising: (i) the construction of forest trails and
small guard/storage sheds by local communities, and well drilling; and (ii) the provision of small sub-loans
for post-harvest treatment and marketing of horticultural crops to local marketing groups. For (i), it was
agreed that trails would be dirt paths no wider than one meter, generally constructed along the contour;
sheds would be no larger than 60 square meters, constructed of brick and concrete in line with local
standards for similar construction, and detail design and budget for well drilling would be developed during
implementation and reviewed and approved by PMC. To simplify disbursement and accounting
procedures, disbursements for forest trails is included in agreed schedule of plantation establishment unit
costs and the disbursement for storage/guard sheds also base on the unit cost; the schedule for the first year
of the Project is included in the Project Implementation Manual, and thereafter it would be revised yearly
on the basis of actual cost experience recorded in audited statements of expenditure and monitored by
supervision missions.
For (ii) above, sub-loans on commercial terms would finance small-scale equipment and facilities for the
grading, packing, storage/cold storage, and transportation of project horticultural production. It is designed
to strengthen the marketing infrastructure at the village and township levels, where the marketing links are
the weakest, and promote the development of a competitive, multi-channel marketing system that allows
local communities to capture the economic benefits of faster and higher quality delivery of production to
county and provincial markets. The sub-loans would be implemented in the last two years of the Project,
when the economic tree plantations begin fruiting and county PMOs have completed an analysis of project
marketing requirements.
The following screening criteria will be used to ensure that all proposed investments will: (i) be subject to
a feasibility study conducted in line with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank to ensure that the
investments are financially viable, commercially and technically feasible; (ii) be identified as priority
investnents for strengthening grassroots marketing infrastructure in the marketing studies to be prepare by
the county PMOs under the Project; (iii) not exceed a maximum of US$150,000 per investment; (iv) use
Bank funds to finance no more than 50 percent of the total investment cost of each investment; (v) include
equity contributions from the sub-borrower equivalent to at least 25% of the total estimated cost of the
sub-project; (vi) be appraised by the county PMO and approved by the provincial PMO, before the
summary report prepared by each province has been reviewed and approved by the PMC and the Bank; and
(vii) support the preparation and implementation of a resettlement action plan acceptable to the Bank,
based on the Project resettlement policy framework, if any involuntary resettlement is involved. The TOR
for the feasibility study will be agreed and 25% equity contribution requirement will be reviewed at the
project's mid-term review when there is a better idea of demand for the sub-loan.
Monitoring and Evaluation Program (US$1.22 million) comprising measurement of: (i) implementation
progress; (ii) growth and quality of established and thinned plantations to evaluate the achievement of the
production objectives of the Project; and (iii) environmental and social parameters such as incidence of
pests and diseases and participation rate of households to mitigate any adverse impacts and ensure the
households benefits are adequately considered. Key performance indicators to facilitate monitoring and
evaluation during implementation are in Annex 1. All of these M & E activities would be funded by
counterpart funding.

Annex 4: Financial and Economic Analysis Summary
CHINA: Sustainable Forestry Development Project
I.    Introduction
The Sustainable Forestry Development Project (SFDP) includes three major components: natural forest
management, protected areas management, and plantation establishment. The first two components would
introduce modem management programs for sustainable development in natural forest areas, and for
biodiversity conservation in designated natural protected areas. The plantation establishment component
would establish timber and economic tree crop plantations, and would demonstrate pre-commercial
thinning. In general, investments in natural forest management and protected areas are not revenue
generating.  However, these components would produce non-quantifiable economic benefits locally,
regionally, and globally. The plantation establishment component would generate revenue as a result of
producing commercial timber, fruit, nuts, leaves, and other such forest products.
The following analysis includes four sections: (a) assessment of the economic benefit derived from each
component; (b) major assumptions for the analysis including the model and prices employed; (c) economic
analysis including method, results, and sensitivity analysis; and (d) financial analysis including method and
results.
II.    Benefit
This section analyzes the qualitative economic benefit generated from preserving and managing biodiversity
under the natural forest management and protected areas management components, and analyzes the
quantitative economic benefit generated from the plantation establishment component. The economic
benefit derived from the first two components would be generated locally, regionally and globally. Another
significant impact of the components is its introduction and dissemination function, which would
demonstrate the management model beyond the project areas. The plantation establishment component
would benefit local people in generating income and in narrowing the gap between supply and demand.
The direct economic revenue would be assessed in terms of the value of tree products and the direct income
enjoyed by farmers.
A.     Natural Forest Management Component
Local Project Areas. With the component of natural forest management, the Project would support the
development and dissemination of new sustainable management techniques in approximately 203,000 ha of
natural forest areas protected under the government's Natural Forestry Protection Program (NFPP).
The 1998 Yangtze River basin floods, which devastated the downstream areas of the basin's stream bed,
resulted from extensive upstream ecological deterioration, which had resulted from over-logging. Following
the flood, the government issued a logging ban to prevent further environment degradation. The ban's
impact has both positive and negative consequences. On one hand, it would assist natural forestry recovery
in upstream areas by stopping of planned logging. On the other hand, the ban would negatively affect on
the local economy, which heavily relied on the logging industry, and on the livelihood of local people, many
of them depend on forestry. The ban has resulted in the loss of an estimated one million jobs for State
Forest Enterprise workers.
- 56 -



To mitigate the negative impact of the ban, the Project would assist the govemment by developing models
to find alternative approaches, with which to sustain the local economy. Under the community development
subcomponent, the Project would support the establishment of small-scale village infrastructure such as the
construction of drinking water systems, the building or upgrading of village schools, and similar needs,
depending on each village's development plan. The Project would also provide a micro-credit program
targeted to households and informal groups, while simultaneously providing training in basic farming skills
and financial management for households and small-scale enterprises. Specifically, the micro-credit
scheme would provide the necessary seed money to allow villagers to engage in alternative, non-forestry
production activities. Training for laid-off workers of State Forest Enterprises (SFEs) would be also
provided under the Project to retain SFE workers in skills that would enable them to find altemative
employment opportunities. This altemative employment model can be introduced and implemented on a
pilot scale, and experience gained from its results can be disseminated to non-project areas.
Downstream Benefits. The project areas in Sichuan province are located in designated natural protected
areas. Under the Natural Forestry Protection Program, which was developed following the 1998 Yangtze
basin flood, these natural forest protected areas were designated for recovery of ecological environment.
The Project aims to assist the govemment's effort by developing and disseminating management techniques,
which would be employed under the Program. It would be difficult to quantify the direct project benefits to
the downstream Yangtze River valley. These benefits could be estimated in two ways. First, the
opportunity cost of the recovery of the ecological environment resulting from the logging ban, as well as the
recovering vegetation that would reduce downstream flood risk, can be estimated. The direct and indirect
damage are estimated at Y158 billion (close to US$20 billion). However, the logging ban has reduced local
revenues from logging and other forest production activities for which the government has to compensate.
Secondly, there is a cost trade-off. Continued logging would protect the local economy, albeit at the risk of
further downstream flood damage. Therefore, investments will have to be made in these downstream areas
in the form of flood protection, such as embankments along the Yangtze River. This estimation would be
based on a flood occurrence rate over the next ten years, and the project benefits to the Yangtze River
downstream can be economically justified.
B.     Protected Area Management Component
The Project would support conservation and improve the management ecological biodiversity of global
importance in selected, high priority nature reserves in natural forest areas. The biodiversity protection
regions in China have been designated by the government. Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan issued in
1994 developed strategy and designated priority natural reserve areas. However, the existing biodiversity
management programs need to be imnproved. The management techniques introduced under the Project
would include resource surveying, nature reserve planning and management, and community-based nature
conservation. Special funds would be provided by the Project for environmental education to the public.
Training and capacity building would strengthen all reserve staff in management. The economic benefits of
these interventions would be derived from improvements in biodiversity, which contributes to global
biodiversity resources, and in a reduction of ecological damage to local community livelihood. It is,
however, rather difficult to quantify the intrinsic benefit values related to the impact by biodiversity. An
incremental cost analysis was carried out for this component. Since the project sites are identified as
priority areas under China Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan, the non-project areas could adopt the
management program tested under the Project.
- 57 -



C.     Plantation Establishment Component
The Project aims to increase the production of timber to meet the growing gap between domestic supply
and demand, thereby generating new employment and income for forestry farms and rural households
affected by the logging ban. The Project's economic benefits from this component would be derived from:
(i) establishment of 115,090 hectares of timber plantation, which would in part help to meet demand for
projected future wood deficits in the construction, pulp and paper making industries; (ii) the establishment
of 57,940 hectares of economic tree crop plantations, which would generate an increase in high-value fruit
and nut production; and (iii) pre-commercial thinning of 61,330 ha of existing plantation to demonstrate
increased productivity and financial gains from proper thinning and tending technologies.
At full development, project timber plantations would produce 13.31 million m of timber, 1.24 million tons
of fuel wood, and 24.3 million tons of resin. Tree crop plantations would produce 28,023 tons of dry fruit
(walnuts, chestnuts, etc.), 414,654 tons of fresh fruit (apples, pears, peaches, etc.), and 10,005 tons of
leaves and other products (Chinese herb, rubber, willow branches for use in handicraft weaving, etc.). The
net incremental benefit would be RMB 734 million from timber production, RMB 58 million from thinning,
and RMB 1.1 billion from tree crop production.
The component would provide alternative employment opportunities to former forest workers, shareholding
cooperative forest farms, village-township collective forest farms, and state forest farms, for a total
beneficiary number reaching 2.67 million people.
III.   Main Assumptions
This section covers main assumptions for economic/financial analysis for plantation component. The
assumptions include: (a) models employed in analyzing financial/economic viability of all species of timber
and tree crops; and (b) prices of inputs and outputs used in the cash flow.
The Production Models
A one-hectare model for each of the 42 species planted underpins the financial and economic analysis, and
ultimately the internal rate of return calculations. Incremental cost and benefit analysis (focusing on with-
and without-project scenarios) was used to assess investments in plantation rehabilitation; full cost-benefit
analysis was used to assess new construction. The models do not include the benefits derived from
inter-cropping, and any such benefits would directly increase the income of beneficiary farmers. The rates
of return calculations for individual timber and economic tree crop species include: (i) the costs of materials
and equipment such as seeds and seedlings, fertilizers and pesticides, manure, equipment hire and tools; (ii)
labor costs for site clearing, preparation, planting, tending, road maintenance, guardhouse construction, and
harvesting; (iii) indirect costs such as site surveying and design work, management and quality monitoring,
training and extension; (iv) accompanying irrigation costs for relevant tree species; and (v) all relevant
provincial and national taxes and fees. A discount rate of 12% is used for estimation.
The cost-benefit analysis for all timber species is based on: (i) a single rotation, which implies that none of
the costs and benefits of replanting a site has been considered; (ii) a 20-year time period, which captures
the full rotation of all timber species financed under the Project; (iii) complete production and harvesting
costs, including the costs of extraction trails, logging and skidding to the roadside; (iv) complete investment
costs including physical contingencies; and (v) thinning and tending assumptions for all relevant species
and the revenue generated from the sale of thinned wood.
- 58 -



The cost-benefit analysis for all economic tree crops is based on (i) a single planting cycle which assumes
natural attrition, (ii) a 16 year time period which directly corresponds to the loan period and includes the
7-year grace period; (iii) complete production and harvesting costs; (iv) complete investment costs,
including physical contingencies; and (v) pruning assumptions for all relevant species.
Input and Output Prices
The input and output prices used in the financial and economic analysis are summarized below. The
financial prices for seeds, fertilizers, etc. are based on the actual import prices from the recent procurement
of such goods under previous Bank funded projects. The financial price of labor used is an estimated
shadow wage and based on the weighted average of the various daily wage rates currently prevailing in the
project areas, which amounts to approximately Y 15 per day. The financial output prices are prevailing
average roadside prices for timber products (which incorporate the costs of cutting and skidding) and
average market prices for tree crop production (which incorporate the cost of harvesting and marketing).
Standard economic conversion factors are used in the economic analysis to convert the financial cost of
specific investments to economic costs, and to covert financial prices of key inputs to economic prices. The
economic output prices are based on actual border prices for comparable imported timber, fruits and nuts,
and are adjusted for transport and processing costs. The economic input prices of seedlings, pesticides,
manure, fertilizers, equipment and tools were assumed the same as the financial prices. The farm gate
output price for thinned wood (in terns of the timber crops) and fruit and nuts (in terms of the economic
tree crops) were calculated on the basis of the most recent World Bank commodity price projections, with
adjustments made to transport and handling costs to reflect local situations. Variations between financial
and economic output prices are not exceeding 10 percent. Moreover, a shadow wage of Y 12 per day was
used in the economic analysis to reflect the surplus of agricultural workers with little alternative
employment opportunities in the project areas, leading to a marginal product of labor below the prevailing
market wage.
IV.    Economic Analysis
Economic analysis was carried out for each crop species and for the plantation establishment component as
a whole. Investment costs include all investment costs that would be incurred under the Project including
costs for institutional strengthening, training, and technical extension. Operating costs include all physical
inputs and labor. All costs are valued at constant 1999 border prices and are adjusted for physical
contingencies. Taxes, fees and interest payment are excluded, which are, however, reflected in the financial
analysis.
World Bank price projections of export prices actually realized by China were used to estimate farm gate
economic prices for traded goods in constant 1999 terms. Economic prices for non-traded goods were
estimated using conversion factors. These conversion factors were estimated on an analysis of the
deviation of social opportunity costs from the actual financial prices prevailing in China caused by tax and
price distortions in non-traded goods. All economic values were converted to local currency at the
prevailing official exchange rate of Y8.28 to US $1.
Economic Rate of Return
Various timber species have different growth periods, which result in the generation of revenues at different
periods of time. Under the Project, the maturity period varies from 6 to 25 years. For timber species with
a long growth period, the first and second thinning would generate minor income from small-diameter
timber and fuel wood.
- 59 -



For tree crops, revenue generation would start in different years. Most would begin generating revenues
from year 3 to 5 and reach full production in Year 7 for fresh fruit and Year 14 for nuts. During the initial
growth years 1-4, income would be derived from intercrops. The model has not included, however. For
rehabilitated plantations, calculated revenues are only incremental segments.
The Project would support pre-commercial thinning. This practice would promote forning timber in terms
of shortening mature time. The Project would develop a model to demonstrate the practice useful. The
benefit from thinning is not high-value products. The economic rate of return is estimated at 22% for the
subcomponent.
The results of the analysis show that the component and each species has an acceptable economic rate of
return, ranging from 16 percent to 46 percent for timber, and from 15 percent to 37 percent for tree crops.
In general, timber plantations have lower rates of return because of the extended time (20-25 years) that
timber trees require to generate useful timber. However, there are several tree species, such as Casuarina,
W.Poplar F, Abrus etc., with a high economic rate of return. These species are early maturing (full
harvesting reached in year 6-8), which reduces maintenance costs as compared to tree species with a
20-year maturity. For economic tree crops, the species are either of high value (Pomegranate) or of high
yield jujube, apricot, apple), or special use and local specialty (prickly ash).
Overall, the proposed component yields an economic rate of return (ERR) of 25 percent, and a net present
value of $216 million (using a discount rate of 12 percent), over a 20-year period of analysis. At the
subcomponent level, investments in timber species yield an ERR of 30 percent; the proposed investment in
economic tree crops yields an ERR of 26 percent; and thinning yields an ERR of 22 percent.
Sensitivity Analysis
Analysis was carried out to evaluate the sensitivity of the component's ERR to price and cost variations.
The component overall is neither very sensitive to an increase in investment costs and operating costs, nor
to a drop in sale prices since the revenue generated at least in year 4 or 5. An increase in investrnent costs
or an increase in operating costs would reduce the ERR to 26 percent. A 10 percent drop in sales price,
would reduce the ERR to 25 percent. The analysis of switching values shows that the ERR for the
component is robust. It would take a reduction in total benefits of 49 percent or an increase in total costs
of 98 percent to bring the ERR down to 12 percent. However, there are a few economic tree crop species
that are sensitive to small (e.g. 10%) downward changes in output prices. Market prices for Walnut,
Winghackenberry, Chestnut, Eucommia, Chinese Yew, Willow, Citrus and Peach should be monitored
closely during implementation. The ERR results for each species is found in the table below and detailed
analysis can be found in the project files.
V.     Financial Analysis
Financial analysis on plantation establishment is based on a one-hectare model. There are 22 species of
timber, and 20 species of tree crops under the Project, and the one-hectare model is developed for each of
these species. The assumptions on model above is applied in financial analysis. Benefits would be derived
from the plantation itself as well as from its by-products such as fuel wood. Incremental costs and benefits
were used for rehabilitated plantation, and full costs and benefits were used for newly developed plantation.
The models employ farm gate prices. Investment costs and operating costs are valued at 1999 prices.
Farm labor is valued at Y 15.00/person-day.
- 60 -



The investment period for timber would be three years and four years for tree crops. Maintenance costs
include thinning, irrigation water charges, fertilizer for some species, and harvesting. Environmental
monitoring would be carried out through the life of the plantation. Forest products and fruit (dry and fresh)
are subject to the special product tax (8%), payable by project farmers. A reforestation and forest
maintenance fee of 2 percent for tree crops and 20 percent for timber is included in the model.
The financial analysis for the timber plantation subcomponent indicates FRRs for species ranging from 12
to 30 percent. For tree crops, the FRRs ranges from 11.3 to 37 percent. The low financial rate of return
for some economic tree crop species (ranging 12 to 16 percent) indicate that monitoring market variation
would have to be closely carried out. Necessary adjustment in species planted has to be made according to
market variation. Moreover, intercropping would help to supplement income in early years when timber
plantations are still not mature. The overall financial rate of return for this component is 22 percent.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
CHINA: Sustainable Forestry Development Project
Procurement
A. General
1.    All Bank-financed Plantations Establishment Component and GEF-fmanced Protected Areas
Management Component procurement under this Project will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines (January 1995, revised January and August 1996, September 1997 and
January 1999) and the Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants (January 1997, revised
September 1997 and January 1999). The Bank-approved Chinese Model Bidding Documents (MBD)
will be adopted for all International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
for goods and works. In the case where no model docurnents exist, the relevant Bank Standard Documents
(SBD) will be used. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) to advertise all ICB contracts and major
consulting assignments will be published and will be updated annually until all the major contracts have
been awarded. Staff of the Project Management Center (PMC) who are in charge of the overall
administration of the Project have had adequate experience of Bank financed procurement procedures
since 1985 under the following Bank-financed projects: (a) Forest Development Project; (b) Daxinganling
Forest Fire Rehabilitation Project; (c) National Afforestation Project; (d) Forest Resources Development
and Protection Project; (e) Natural Reserve Management Project; and (f) Forestry Development in Poor
Areas Project. An assessment of its present capability is provided below. A procurement plan has been
prepared which outlines the first year procurement activities. The detailed procurement plan is referred to
in the Project Implementation Manuals. Details of procurement arrangements, procurement methods, prior
review thresholds are provided below and are also shown in Table A (GEF-financed Protected Areas
Management component) and Table B (IBRD-fmanced Plantation Establishment component).
2. A margin of preference would be allowed for goods manufactured in China under ICB procedures
subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2.54 and 2.55 of the Procurement Guidelines and appendix 2
thereto.
B. Implementing Agency Procurement Capacity Assessment
3. A procurement assessment of the implementing agencies, which focused on reviewing the capacity of
the PMC and selected provincial PMOs' organization structure and functions, staff skills, quality and
adequacy of supporting and control systems, legal and regulatory framework and past experience, was
carried out. The assessment concluded that the organization structure, staff skills and support and control
system for procurement at both central- and provincial-levels are generally adequate, and past
performances of the PMC and PMOs on other Bank-financed forestry projects have been satisfactory. An
action plan to address the identified weaknesses has been agreed in the Procurement Capacity Assessment
Report. Due to scattered locations, distances between provinces, and different implementation schedules,
each participating province would manage its own plantation establishment, procurement for civil works,
and shopping. PMC would manage goods under ICB, NCB, and some shopping which are more suitable
for centralized procurement. CMC International Tendering Company and INSTRIMPEX International
Tendering Company were selected to provide assistance in this regard. PMC would also provide
cross-provincial services to coordinate procurement planning, monitoring, and reporting as well as
providing training to provincial PMOs. Common incompatibilities of local procurement procedures are
highlighted as follows: (a) invitation for bids can be advertised through newspaper, information network or
- 64 -



other media; (b) cost estimate is mandatory; (c) bracketing is used for evaluation; (d) the merit point system
(scoring system) is used for bid evaluation; and (e) time for preparation of bids can be 20 days which is
shorter than 30 days required for NCB; and (f) the whole contract with less than three bidders should be
rejected and needs re-bidding. Those incompatibilities are addressed in a side letter.
4.     The assessment raised an issue relating to fertilizers and pesticides which was procured through
ICB in past Bank-financed forestry projects. However, past experiences have shown that (a) the cost of
fertilizers purchased is much higher using ICB than if procured locally; and (b) centralized procurement
and time consuming bidding process led to prolonged delays in delivery to the farmers which had a
significant negative impact on the quality of the plantations. Similarly, pesticide is needed only during
infestation period. It is difficult to predict when and if ever the infestations will occur and the type of
infestations and therefore it is difficult to plan in advance the necessary purchases. Due to scattered project
locations within eleven provinces with diverse geography and different planting seasons and 6 years for
establishing the plantations, all fertilizer procurement would be decentralized to the provinces. Pesticides
would be purchased by Project provinces out of counterpart funds.
C. Procurement of Civil Works
5. Protected Areas Management Component. Neither ICB nor NCB contracts are foreseen because of the
scattered nature and small sizes of the civil works contracts. Civil works under this component such as
nature reserve management stations, remote check/guard posts and boundary markers whose contract value
is estimated to be less than US$30,000 arnounting to US$1.87 million in aggregate would be carried out
through force account with Bank's prior agreement under supervision of forestry bureau or nature reserve
staff because they are widely scattered in 13 nature reserves in remote and difficult to access areas and
across 7 provinces. Disbursements will be made on agreed amounts per unit of output which is specified in
the financial management manual.
6. Plantation Establishment Component. Establishment of plantations costing a total of US$149.24
million comprises of land clearance, land preparation, planting of seedlings, thinning, tending and rural
infrastructure construction such as forest trails and small guard or storage sheds. These plantations would
not be suitable for competitive bidding, as the works are small, widely scattered, and scheduled according
to the time of the year and availability of seedlings, and would be procured under community participation
procedures. Under community participation, casual labor will be hired for that purpose and will be
paid on a piece-work basis. Plantation will also be implemented   in accordance with agreed
plantation/models which specify the work to be performed and the rate to be paid per species per hectare
and agreed annual plantation plan with each province. The organization and method of payment including
unit rate for plantation for each species and province were agreed at appraisal and will be reviewed
annually. Implementation and quality of plantation establishment will be periodically supervised by
established technical teams led by county forestry bureaus and remedial measures taken when and if
necessary.
7. Well drilling for small-scale irrigation in Hebei Province estimated to cost US$100,000 equivalent or
more per contract with an aggregate of US$1 million will be carried out under NCB procedures acceptable
to the Bank. A few contracts expected to cost less than US$100,000 per contract and US$1.26 million in
aggregate would be procured on the basis of three quotations obtained from at least three qualified domestic
contractors and contracted on a lump sum/fixed price basis.
8. Other civil works for new nursery establishment, small buildings and rural infrastructure including
rural marketing infrastructure under sub-loans would be procured on the basis of three quotations obtained
- 65 -



from at least three qualified domestic contractors and contracted on a lump sum/fixed price basis in view of
the small size of the civil works (on average less than US$100,000 per contract) and their scattered and
remote location with a total cost of US$8.33 million.
D. Procurement of Goods
9. Protected Areas Management Component. Vehicles excluding motorcycles will be procured through
ICB procedures. Motorcycles, field survey equipment and office equipment (e.g., GPS, computers and
printers, photocopying machines, projector, and so on ) costing less than US$250,000 per contract for a
total of US$990,000 will be awarded under NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank because the goods are
small in quantity and available competitively on the local market and in which no foreign bidders are
interested. The smaller purchase of goods for field protection and field kits (e.g., binoculars, tents,
sleeping bags, compasses and so on) worth about US$580,000 in total which is already available
off-the-shelf, expected to cost less than US$50,000 per contract, would be procured through national
shopping in accordance with the procedures set out in Paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of the Procurement
Guidelines. All shopping contracts will require at least three valid quotations.
10. Plantation Establishment Component. Vehicles will be procured through ICB procedures. Contracts
for goods consisting of fertilizer, office equipment, and small agricultural, water supply, nursery, and
laboratory equipment estimated to cost in total US$8.40 million which cannot be packaged for ICB in view
of small quantities required in scattered locations throughout the 11 provinces and also available
competitively on the local market, and costing less than US$250,000 per contract will be awarded under
NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. The small purchase of goods consisting of production tools,
small quantity of office equipment, nursery equipment and equipment for rural marketing infrastructure
under sub-loans, small quantity of fertilizer purchase, with value of less than US$50,000 per contract and
aggregate of US$9.57 million would be procured through national shopping in accordance with procedures
set out in Paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of the Procurement Guidelines. All shopping contracts will require at
least three valid quotations.  With regard to fertilizer purchase, experiences from  two previous
Bank-financed forestry projects have shown that (a) centralized procurement led to prolonged delays in
delivery to the farmers thus affecting yields; and (b) no foreign bidders were interested in bidding for the
small quantities. Only domestic bidders participated and local prices area quite competitive.
E. Technical Assistance, Consultant Services, and Training
11. Protected Areas Management Component. A total of about US$2.57 million of technical assistance
would be required for project and technical support in the areas of nature reserve management planning,
community-based natural conservation, wildlife surveys, monitoring and evaluation, training program
development, and interpretation/translation services. All assignments under this component will be carried
out by individual consultants, due to the nature of the assignments where the consultants do not need to
work together as a team, no additional outside home office support is required, and the experience and
qualification of the individuals are the paramount requirement. In particular, two long-term individual
consultants--one international (30 person-months) and one national (36 person-months)--will be recruited to
assist the Project on community-based nature conservation sub-component.
12. Services worth about US$9.34 million would be required for the Project comprising research, training
implementation, surveys, and development of management and other plans and would be procured in
accordance with a program agreed during appraisal. Total cost of training activities will be US$4.78
million, including domestic training, workshops and camp for children. The rest (US$4.56 million) will be
used for field survey, management plans, mapping, and research activities. Consultant services will be
- 66 -



carried out in accordance with Bank Consultants Guidelines. The research, management plans, and
mapping will require the involvement of research institutes and universities. There will be no large
consultant contracts because of the nature of the work. Contracts will be small and are not expected to
exceed US$25,000 per assignment up to US$2 million total, and will be procured under Consultants
Qualifications (CQ) procedures. There will be cases where only a particular research institute is available;
in this case, sole source selection whose cost is not expected to exceed US$100,000 per assignment
(US$1.52 million total) would be used. Those other services (US$3.61 million total) which do not require
a team and will be carried out by individual consultants.
13. Plantation Establishment Component. A total of about US$60,000 equivalent of consultants services
would be required to support economic tree crops cultivation, timber plantations design, preparation of
extension materials, and pest and disease control. All assignments will be carried out by individual
consultants.
14. A total of about US$3.16 million for training and study tours would be required, of which, about
US$600,000 for overseas training, domestic training and study tours will be financed by the Bank loan and
the consultants services required under training will be procured in accordance with the selection methods
of Consultant Qualification and sole source for firms as described in paragraph 12 above. Similarly,
individual consultants will also be recruited when teams are not required. About US$2.56 million for
domestic training will be financed out of counterpart funds and will be carried out in accordance with
domestic procedures and agreed training programs. Detailed training and study tour arrangements are
referred to in Annex 2 of the PAD and the Project Implementation Manual.
F. Prior Review and Post Review (both Protected Areas Management and Plantations Establishment)
16. Prior Review. All ICB contracts and all NCB contracts for goods would be subject to prior review by
the Bank. The first two NCB contracts for civil works and the first two shopping contracts for goods for
each province are also subject to prior review. Consultant contracts valued above US$35,000 for
individuals and firms would also be subject to prior review. All TOR for consultants and single source
selection should be subject to prior review by the Bank. Overseas training and study tours would not be
subject to prior review. This is considered appropriate in view of PMC staffis excellent management of
procurement in the four previous projects and their continuing participation in Bank-sponsored courses on
national and intemational procurement.
17. Post Review. All other contracts would be subject to ex-post review by supervision missions.
G. Procurement Reporting and Supervision
18. Procurement Reporting and Filing. A procurement filing system will be established by the project
implementing agencies. Procurement reporting will be provided to the Bank on semi-annual basis in a
format satisfactory to the Bank.
19. Procurement Supervision. Frequency of procurement supervision missions is proposed as one every 6
months including special procurement supervision for post review/audits.
H. Items not Financed by the Bank Group
20.    Natural Forest Management component will be financed by European Union (EU) and its own
rules will be followed in the procurement process.

Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
21.    Allocation of Loan! GEF Grant Proceeds (Table CID). Under IBRD Loan, disbursement for
category of civil works would cover three items: irrigation civil works, and guard/storage shed civil works,
and other civil works excluding plantations. Irrigation civil works would include all labor, materials, and
survey and design costs, but no equipment. Guard/storage sheds civil works would include all labor and
material costs. Category of plantations would include: (a) all labor requirements for site clearing,
preparation, planting, tending and thinning; (b) seedlings; (c) construction of forest trails; and (d) indirect
cost related to survey and design, project and environment management. Disbursement for plantation and
guard/storage sheds would be based on an agreed schedule of unit cost. The unit cost schedule for the first
year of the project was agreed during appraisal, and thereafter it would be revised yearly on the basis of
actual cost experience recorded in audited statements of expenditure and monitored by supervision
missions. Disbursement for civil works would be made after county PMOs have inspected afforestation
sites and certified that all work complied with the social, technical and environment guidelines agreed with
the Bank. No withdrawal shall be made for the expenditures prior to the date of Loan Agreement, except
that withdrawals, in an aggregate amount not exceeding US$8,000,000, may be made in respect of
Category (1)(a) and (2) on account of payments made for expenditures before that date but after August 1,
2001.
22.    For GEF Grant, civil works include management stations, guard posts, and boundary markers for
the nature reserves. Goods include equipment, vehicles and materials. Incremental operating costs include
salaries of additional project management staff on contract, travel costs, and allowances; office rent,
consumable, and communication charges; and costs associated with project management, monitoring and
evaluation.
23.    Disbursement profile (Table C). The project disbursement schedule is consistent with the general
disbursement profile for forestry investment loans in China.

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
24.    Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Disbursement would be made against statements of
expenditures (SOEs) for expenditures related to: (a) plantation establishment; (b) field surveys,
management plans, and mapping; (c) training and study tours; (d) incremental operating costs; (e) contracts
for goods and works not exceeding US$200,000 equivalent; (f) contracts for individual consultants and
firms not exceeding US$35,000 equivalent for Plantation Establishment component and US$50,000 or less
for individual consultants and firms for the Protected Areas Management component; (g) sub-loans; and (h)
community conservation grants. The supporting documents for SOEs would be retained by county or
provincial PMOs for Plantation Establishment component and by provincial OWPPs for Protected Areas
component, and central PMC/PO would retrieve them as required for on-site supervision by the Bank staff
and inspection by auditors. In the case of contracts for goods, works and services above these thresholds,
disbursement would be made against the full documentation with contracts themselves and other supporting
documents.
Special account:
25.    Special Accounts. In order to disburse the Loan and GEF Grant efficiently, Special Accounts
would be opened. For IBRD Loan, a Special Account would be opened and managed by Ministry of
Finance in US Dollars in a bank acceptable to the Bank with an authorized allocation of $9 million,
equivalent to the loan's financing of average expenditures for four months. For GEF Grant, a Special
Account would be opened and managed by central PO of SFA with authorized allocation of $1.8 million,
equivalent to the Grant's financing of average expenditures for four months.  Applications for
replenishment of these two accounts would be submitted monthly, or whenever the accounts are drawn
down by 50 percent, whichever comes first.
26.    Reimbursement procedures. For IBRD Loan, both finance and forestry staff at every level would
be involved in reviewing the reimbursement applications from entities for work financed under IBRD loan
and counterpart funds, in order to ensure sound financial and technical management of project activities.
The procedures would be as follows: reimbursement documentation would be prepared by the county
PMO, with the countersignature of the county finance bureau, and sent to the provincial PMO; the
documentation would be reviewed and approved by the provincial PMO, with countersignature of the
provincial finance bureau, and sent simultaneously to MOF and PMC; PMC would have a seven-day time
period to review the application and raise an objection if the application is not consistent with the technical
guidelines of the Project; if MOF does not hear back from PMC within the time period, it would
automatically process the application; if PMC raises an objection within the tirne period, MOF would not
process the application until the PMC objection is resolved.
27.    For GEF grant, finance bureau at every level would not be involved in reviewing and processing
the reimbursement applications since the Special Account would be managed by the central PO in SFA.
Reimbursement documentation would be prepared by the nature reserve, and sent to the provincial OWPP;
the documentation would be reviewed and approved by the provincial OWPP, and sent to PO; and PO
would review and approve the application, then make payment from the Special Account.

Incremental Cost Analysis
China: Sustainable Forestry Development Project
Overview
The main objective of the Sustainable Forest Development Project (SFDP) is the development and adoption
of innovative management approaches in selected natural forests, protected areas and plantations to relieve
pressures on forest resources and protect the natural environment. The SFDP has three components: (a)
Natural Forest Management; (b) Protected Areas Management (PAM); and (c) Plantation Establishment.
The Protected Areas Management Component is expected to be co-financed by the Global Environment
Facility (GEF).
The global environmental objective of the protected areas management component is to foster improved
conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity by ensuring effective in situ protection of
threatened and globally important forest habitats and rare and endemic species. This will be achieved by:
(a) enhancing the management systems of 13 nature reserves which are of global significance for
biodiversity conservation purposes; (b) collecting biodiversity information for the development of future
management strategies in one of the key global eco-regions located in China and an important area for the
Government's NFPP-Westem Sichuan; (c) increasing opportunities for the participation of communities
in nature conservation and the sustainable management of natural resources; (d) enhancing the capacity of
institutions responsible for nature reserve management and biodiversity conservation in forest areas; (e)
supporting key protected area-related policy studies; and (f) strengthen monitoring and evaluation.
Context and Broad Development Goals
Context
Much of China's biodiversity is under threat from a rapidly growing human population which has doubled
in size since 1949 and is now estimated to comprise at least 1.2 billion people. The combination of a large
population and limited arable land resources has led to extensive loss of natural habitats to agricultural
production, logging, fuelwood collection and livestock grazing. Other associated factors which have had a
negative impact on the status of China's biological resources include forest fires, hunting, harvesting and
trade in particular species of wild animals and plants, water pollution, construction of dams and the use of
pesticides. The introduction of exotic weeds such as Lantana camara and Eupatorium odorata which have
become established in some areas, outcompeting native species and preventing natural regeneration of
secondary vegetation is also a serious problem. In the context of these factors it is estimated that about 200
plant species have become extinct and 5,000 species have become endangered in China in recent years.
A significant proportion of China's remaining biodiversity is located in an extensive network of nature
reserves. At the end of 1999 China had 1,118 national and provincial level nature reserves and these
covered an area of approximately 864,100 km or 8.62 percent of the country's total land area. However,
the size and distribution of many of these reserves has not been determined in accordance with established
biogeographical considerations or sound scientific principles. Many are either too small and of limited
value for biodiversity conservation purposes. Furthermore, few nature reserves are protected or managed
- 90 -



efficiently. Most reserves lack long-term strategic plans for biodiversity conservation, and staffing levels
and management budgets are generally inadequate. Many of the personnel responsible for managing
China's protected areas are untrained and unqualified. In this context, the biodiversity in China's nature
reserves faces increasing pressure from the human communities which either live within or in close
proximity to their boundaries. Hunting and other illegal and unsustainable extractive activities are
widespread. A major challenge is to develop ways of encouraging local people to either use nature reserve
resources sustainably or to protect them if they must be conserved.
Development Goals
China has sustained an impressive growth performance since 1978. The principal factors which have
contributed to the country's high growth rate include the relative stability of the economy, a high literacy
rate, the industriousness of the labor force and the support of a wealthy Chinese Diaspora. However, these
positive features of Chinese society are confronted by an array of challenges that could hinder overall
progress. These challenges and a strategy to address them are articulated in China's Ninth Five Year Plan
and the Fifteen Year Perspective Plan that were approved in 1996 by the National People's Congress. The
five key areas of concem are: (a) Ensuring macro-economic stability and maintaining the momentum of
structural reforms; (b) reducing infrastructure bottlenecks; (c) enhancing human development; (d)
sustaining stable growth in agriculture and ensuring food security; and (e) protecting the environment. Each
of these concems is actively being addressed by GOC with the support of multilateral and bilateral donor
agencies. The Tenth Five Year Plan is under preparation and features environmentally sustainable
development as its major theme.
The need to provide adequate protection for China's diminishing biodiversity in the context of these overall
development goals is recognized in several important policy documents which include the China
Conservation Strategy 1991-2000 and a national Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan. China also
became the first developing country to issue a national Agenda 21 which is used to guide the reconciliation
of environmental protection and economic development. Within the framework provided by these policy
documents, specific GEF-supported biodiversity conservation initiatives include (a) the Nature Reserves
Management Project; and (b) the Wetland Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use in China Project.
Through the implementation of these projects GOC has demonstrated its commitment to preserving the
country's rich biodiversity and natural resource base for future generations.
Baseline Scenario
Scope
Following the widespread damage which occurred following the floods of June-August 1998 GOC took far
reaching action to strengthen environmental management and reduce levels of deforestation and soil erosion
in sensitive upland watershed areas of 18 provinces which drain the middle and upper reaches of the
Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, northeast Inner Mongolia and Hainan Island. Several important policy
measures including a ban on logging in natural forests were introduced within the framework of a national
Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP).
The overall goal of the NFPP is to improve natural forest management over a total of about 95 million
hectares of forests. Approximately 31 million hectares of these natural forests will be afforded legal
protection as nature reserves, forest parks or watershed protection forests according to their biological and
watershed protection values. Specifically, the NFPP recognizes that protected areas can be an important
building block in the country's overall development strategy when they (a) conserve water and soils in zones
- 91 -



that are highly erodible if the original vegetation is removed, notably the steep slopes of upper catchments;
(b) regulate and purify water flow, notably by protecting wetlands and forests; (c) shield people from
natural disasters, such as floods and storm surges, by protecting watershed forests and riverine wetlands;
(d) maintain natural vegetation on soils of inherently low productivity that would, if transformed, yield little
of value to human communities; (e) protect species and populations that are highly sensitive to human
disturbance; (f) provide habitat that is critical to migratory or threatened species for breeding or resting;
and (g) provide income and employment, notably from tourism.
China's protected areas face significant challenges. Few areas are protected or managed effectively, and if
current trends continue, the biological diversity in many critical reserves will diminish dramatically.
However, given the policy orientation of the NFPP, it is reasonable to expect that GOC will pursue a
relatively active program of protected areas management at the Project's target sites to meet domestic
development objectives, even in the absence of GEF assistance. To ensure that a complete range of
potential impacts and benefits has been captured, the Baseline has been defined to include a broad spectrum
of activities that are either directly or indirectly intended to support these protected areas. Conceptually, the
Baseline can be considered as four separate components. These are (a) Nature Reserves Planning and
Management which includes management plan development and implementation, field level management
systems (such as patrolling), investment (civil works, equipment, vehicles), and applied research and
surveys; (b) Communitm-based Nature Cornservation which includes co-management and community
conservation education and public awareness, alternative livelihood skills development, and demonstration
of wildlife management to reduce human/wildlife conflicts; (c) Training and Capacity Building, which
involves general staff training and institutional capacity building; and (d) Project Management. Monitoring
and Evaluation, which includes strengthening of management capacity, monitoring and evaluation, and
policy studies.
Costs
Under the Baseline Scenario it is expected that GOC expenditures related to forest ecosystem conservation
to be delivered through SFA and Provincial Forestry Departments in the project sites over the period
(2001-2007) of the Project will be US$38.98 million. In addition, a number of biodiversity conservation
activities in the project sites will be financed by international NGOs, which are estimated to total $0.67
million. These NGO inputs, plus the GOC contributions, are summarized in the table below. The total
cost of the Baseline Scenario is $39.65 million.

Benefits
Under the Baseline Scenario, approximately 80 percent of proposed GOC expenditure is related to
capital-intensive infrastructure development. In addition, implementation of the Baseline Scenario will
result in (a) development of basic planning tools for improved nature reserve management in the project
area; (b) limited level of community work; and (c) limited short-term protection of biodiversity of global
significance. The efforts of NGOs and other international donors will serve to (a) increase public
awareness of the physical, biological and social values of the target nature reserves; (b) assist with the
development of comprehensive management plans for some of these areas (e.g. Baimaxueshan); and (c)
train nature reserve personnel in contemporary protected area management techniques. However, due to
the extensive investments needed to stabilize the status of biodiversity in the project areas, existing
government resources and international financing initiatives are not sufficient to guarantee long-term
protection of globally significant biodiversity.

Global Environmental Objective
China's land area encompasses a huge range of natural ecosystems which range from the grasslands,
deserts and coniferous forests of central Asia through the mountains of the Himalayan Plateau and Tibet to
the temperate, sub-tropical and tropical lowlands in the east and south of the country. These ecosystems
provide a great diversity of habitats for numerous forms of wildlife. Although incomplete, existing species
inventories indicate that China probably contains over ten percent of all living species on Earth.

China. The development of enhanced management systems at the proposed project sites will (a) conserve a
significant proportion of the country's biodiversity and (b) maintain ecological and evolutionary processes
of unique global importance. In the context of the convention on Biological Diversity (which China ratified
in January 1993), the project design is consistent with guidance from the Conference of the Parties as it
promotes conservation and sustainable use through adaptive management of forest ecosystems; capacity
building; and integrating biodiversity conservation into improved management of the forestry sector.
GEF Alternative
Scope
With GEF assistance for addressing the global biodiversity objective identified above, GOC would be able
- 94 -



to undertake a more effective program of protected area management that would generate both national and
global benefits. Under the Baseline Scenario outlined above, the principal GOC emphasis (80 percent of
total expenditure) is on capital intensive infrastructure development. The major thrust of the incremental
activities would be to emphasize the ecological and social aspects of protected area planning. The GEF
Altemative would set the basis for a more integrated approach to management of the project sites which
specifically addresses issues related to the impact which (a) local communities have on biodiversity and (b)
wildlife has on local communities. Specific interventions would include:
Project sub-component                               Interventions
Nature Reserve Planning and  (a) Participatory  nature reserve  management plan  development and
Management          implementation; (b) preparation of ecological baseline maps, (c) improvement of
field level management systems, (d) provision of equipment and a small amount
of civil works, (e) applied research aimed at management problems, and (f)
biodiversity surveys
Community-based Nature    (a) Preparation and implementation of co-management structures in 26 villages
Conservation        in 13 nature reserves; (b) increasing target community and local government
stakeholders' understanding of biodiversity conservation and the threats it faces
from their actions by assisting nature reserves to develop and implement a
community conservation education strategy; (c) demonstrating wildlife
management systems to reduce crop depredation; (d) decreasing the threats from
overuse of forest resources for energy through targeted demonstrations of
appropriate, practical, and cost-effective energy conservation approaches; and
(e) providing training and technical assistance for the identification and
demonstration of alternative income generating techniques as alternatives to the
use of critical forest resources.
Training and Capacity   (a) Delivery of in-service training courses particularly at the reserve level; and
Building           (b) institutional capacity building particularly at the provincial-level to influence
management of other biologically important areas in the provinces.
Project Management,    (a) Program for the monitoring and evaluation of project process and impacts;
Monitoring and Evaluation  (b) project management and administration; and (c) selected, key policy studies.
Costs
Total expenditures under the GEF Altemative Scenario are estimated at US$62.15 million, detailed as
follows:
Project sub-component                                   Cost

Benefits
The Project would (a) have a positive global benefit by conserving biodiversity in 13 nature reserve sites
which are of acknowledged international significance for biodiversity conservation purposes; (b) provide
models for improved nature reserve management, human resource development and resolution of land-use
conflicts that could be replicated in other parts of China where local biodiversity is threatened; (c)
strengthen the capacity of human resources and biodiversity conservation sector institutions; and (d) benefit
local communities living in and around the Project's nature reserves through the development of
co-management conservation mechanisms.
Incremental Costs
The difference between the cost of the Baseline Scenario (US$ 39.65 million) and the cost of the GEF
Alternative (US$62.55 million) is estimated at US$ 22.9 million, of which US$16.0 million would be
supplied by GEF financing and US$ 6.5 million from the Government of China. This represents the
incremental cost for achieving sustainable global enviromnental benefits.

Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Summary
China: Sustainable Forestry Development Project
A. Background
1.     The environmental and social assessment (ESIA) was prepared by a team from the Institute of
Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection, Chinese Academy of Forestry (certified by the State
Environmental Protection Agency to carry-out EIAs) and Sustainable Visions of Victoria B.C., which are
independent institutions for the purposes of Operational Policy 4.01. The ESIA is based on: (a) three
major field missions in which the EIA team traveled parallel to, but independent of, the project preparation
team; and (b) a series of project design documents prepared for the three project components by the project
preparation team during the period May to September 2000; and (c) for the Plantation Establishment
Component, site visits were supplemented with photos documenting a sample of sites proposed to be
converted in the first year of implementation. The social aspects of the ESIA are based on the results of an
extensive Social Assessment process which was conducted separately during project preparation.  The
draft ESIA Report and Executive Sununary were transmitted to the State Forestry Administration (SFA)
for submission to the World Bank in November 2000.
2.     The ESIA comprises a "sectoral" environmental and social review of SFDP which: (a) describes
project design, undertakes an analysis of alternatives and identifies potential environmental and social risks;
(b) assesses the effectiveness of proposed environmental and social impact management and monitoring
strategies; and (c) identifies any residual, outstanding environmental and social issues and recommends
measures to deal with these. It also prescribes more detailed assessment procedures for specific activities
during implementation; proposing the application of environmental and social guidelines for simpler
activities; and more detailed enviromnental and social assessment requirements for proposals of greater
complexity.
3.     Development of the ESIA has been guided both by laws and policies of the People's Republic of
China, and by operational policies of the World Bank. Specific Chinese laws and policies consulted
include: The Law on Environmental Protection (PRC 1989); The Forestry Law (PRC 1984, modified
1998); Circular on Strengthening Environmental Impact Assessment Management for Construction
Projects Financed by International Financial Organizations (NEPA 1993); and Regulations on the
Management of Environmental Protection in Construction Projects (NEPA  1998).  World Bank
Operational Policies consulted include: OP. 4.01 Environmental Assessment and Environmental
Management Plan; OP. 4.04 Natural Habitats; OP. 4.09 Pest Management; OP. 4.11 Cultural Property;
OP. 4.20 Indigenous Peoples; OD 4.30 Involuntary Resettlement; OP. 4.36 Forestry; and BP. 17.50
Disclosure of Operational Information.
4.     During the past decade, serious questions have been raised in many countries about the application
of "traditional" ESIA processes to broad-scale renewable natural resource planning. Most of these
processes have been designed to deal with complex "construction" projects with relatively clearly defined
geographical locations and some degree of certainty in impact prediction and quantification. The focus of
these processes is on impact identification and analysis to influence operational project design, planning
and implementation. Such processes have little practical application to broad-scale natural resource
planning projects such as SFDP due to: (a) the complexity of natural systems across large geographical
areas and the difficulties of impact prediction; (b) the extensive and long-term nature of most natural
- 98 -



resource management planning; and (c) the fact that many operational activities are small-scale and
repetitive and thus more effectively dealt with by sectoral assessments and operational guidelines than by
traditional ESIA techniques. On the basis of these considerations, and with the concurrence of the Bank
task team, the ESIA focused on determining whether the design of SFDP: (a) establishes clear and
appropriate goals, objectives and principles for management activities; (b) ensures that the management
activities directed at natural ecosystems are as consistent as possible with the ecological processes that
created and maintain those systems; (c) ensures that management activities directed at man-made
ecosystems "mimic" natural ecological structures and processes to the extent possible so as to increase
their stability and resilience; (d) limits site disturbance and soil degradation; (e) minimizes environmental
contamination; (f) incorporates participatory community planning and development programs; (g) provides
potential beneficiaries with the skills and information necessary to participate effectively in the Project; and
(h) establishes well-conceived environmental and social monitoring programs.
B. Brief Project Description
5.     The Project proposed for IBRD, GEF, and EU financing would contribute significantly to
Government efforts within the broader framework and objectives of the Natural Forest Protection Program
(NFPP).  SFDP comprises three components: (a) a Natural Forest Management and Community
Development (NFM) Component (the focus of proposed European Commission grant funding); (b) a
Protected Areas Management (PAM) Component (proposed to be funded from the Global Environment
Facility [GEF]); and (c) a Plantation Establishment (PE) Component (proposed to be funded by IBRD
loan). NFM will focus on three key NFPP provinces - Sichuan, Hunan and Hainan; PAM will include
these three provinces and the adjacent provinces of Gansu, Guizhou, Hubei and Yunnan; and PE will
include the three key provinces plus Hebei, Liaoning, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Shanxi, and Gansu.
6.     The NFM component has two sub-components, one focused on management of the natural forest
and the other on community development. The purpose of the natural forest management sub-component is
to test and demonstrate an increased range of options for sustainable management of forest resources for a
variety of beneficiaries, and to develop multi-stakeholder resource planning and co-management
mechanisms for broader application to natural forest areas throughout China. The objective of the
community development sub-component is to improve and diversify the livelihood and welfare of local
communities impacted by the logging ban and by NFPP resource use restrictions.
7.     The PAM component supports conservation and improved management of 13 selected nature
reserves containing natural biodiversity of global importance.  PAM  will comprise four key
sub-components: (a) nature reserve planning and management (up-grading existing management plans with
community participation, ecological baseline surveys and mapping, strengthening field management, and
enhancement of reserve infrastructure); (b) community-based nature conservation programs (preparation
and implementation of natural resource co-management demonstrations, community education and public
awareness programs in nature conservation, energy (fuelwood) conservation demonstrations, wildlife
crop-damage control demonstrations, and community training and extension on sustainable livelihood
activities); (c) training and capacity building of government institutions; and (d) project management,
monitoring and evaluation (training in support of project implementation, policy studies and development of
a monitoring and evaluation plan).
8.     The objectives of the PE component are to: (a) increase production of wood to meet the growing
deficit between domestic supply and demand; (b) reduce harvest pressures on the natural forest; (c) enhance
employment and income for forest farms and rural households affected by the logging ban and other use
restrictions; and (d) improve environmental management. PE would comprise four sub-components spread
- 99 -



over 107 counties in 11 Provinces: (a) Timber plantations establishment of approximately 115,090 ha; (b)
economic tree-crop establishment of approximately 57,940 ha of fruit, nut and medicinal trees; (c)
pre-commercial thinning of 61,330 ha of existing timber plantations on a demonstration basis; and (d)
technical support services including planting stock development and improved nursery management,
training and extension services, storage and marketing facilities, small-scale rural infrastructure, and
monitoring and evaluation). The size of individual plantations will vary site-to-site and from province to
province but on average is 15 ha. Timber plantations tend to be larger (around 15 ha on average) while
economic tree crop plantations are much smaller. The provincial averages range from 7 ha in Shanxi to 250
ha in Shandong reflecting the criteria to establish plantations on degraded agricultural land. These sites
include poor quality and harvested plantation areas; agricultural lands suitable for plantations; barren hills
and wastelands; weedy or shrubby land; and lightly stocked woods with a low canopy density (<20%).
Guidelines have been developed to guide site selection and procedures have been put in place to ensure that
sites are suitable for the intended purpose but also to avoid adverse environmental effects due, for example,
to conversion of sites which might have significant ecological or other environmental value.
9.     A major element of project design was a Social Assessment (SA) of affected and participating
comnmunities. The SA provided a method for integrating community participation and social analysis into
project design and preparation. SA was conducted to ensure that project preparation and implementation
considered the needs, wishes, concems and capacities of people affected or influenced by project activities.
SA collected information from communities with the objectives of ensuring that positive social impacts
were enhanced and adverse impacts avoided or reduced, especially for potentially vulnerable groups, such
as ethnic minorities, poorer socioeconomic groups and women. See Annex 13 of PAD for a summary of
the SA.
C. Environmental and Social Baseline Description
10.    Natural Environment. The thirteen provinces that are proposed for inclusion in SFDP occupy
five major physiographic regions of China: the Eastern Lowlands (Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui and
the eastern portions of Henan, Hubei and Shanxi); the Southern Mountains and Hills (Hunan and
Guizhou); the Southwestern Mountains and Plateaus (Sichuan and Yunnan); the Loess Mountains and
Ordos Plateau (eastern Gansu and the western portions of Shanxi, Henan and Hubei), and the South China
Insular Mountains (Hainan). These five regions contain six of the seven major forest zones of China. A
little over 40 percent of China was originally forested. The remainder, primarily in the west and north,
consists of desert vegetation, grasslands, sub-alpine scrub and alpine tundra. Major forest communities
occupied a roughly triangular area in eastern China, about 1600 km along its base in the wann, moist
tropical south and less than 400 km wide at its apex in the cooler, drier temperate north. The pattern of
forest zonation that repeats with both increasing latitude and elevation is: (a) evergreen tropical hardwoods;
(b) evergreen sub-tropical hardwoods mixed with tropical or sub-tropical conifers at higher elevations; (c)
mixed temperate mesophytic hardwoods; (d) temperate dry deciduous hardwoods; (e) montane temperate
deciduous hardwoods; (f) montane temperate conifers; and (g) sub-boreal conifers. Only the last zone is
not included in the Project. Much of the coastal plain of eastern China and many interior river valleys and
basins were converted from forest to agriculture centuries ago. Nevertheless, as recently as the early
1960's China still possessed, in its hill and mountain systems, one of the richest and most diverse natural
forest estates in the world. This remarkable natural forest heritage has been significantly depleted in only
four decades by inappropriate silvicultural practices and unsustainable harvesting quotas. One of the
primary objectives of the Project is to demonstrate and disseminate methods for reversing this trend of
natural forest degradation.
- 100 -



11.    Social Environment. A particular concern in World Bank projects is protecting the rights, and
improving the welfare of ethnic minority and poorer communities. Much of the Project's emphasis is on
remaining areas of natural forest and areas suitable for plantation establishment. Since such areas will
almost invariably be in steeper lands and upper watersheds, many of the affected and participating
communities are likely to be ethnic minority or poor, or both. Project areas contain communities belonging
to eighteen ethnic minorities. Five of the twenty-two participating counties in the NFM and PAM
components are designated as provincial-level poor counties and twelve as national-level poor. There is a
total of 17 national-level poor and 8 provincial-level poor counties in the 107 participating in the plantation
component. These communities are amongst the most affected by the logging ban and NFPP restrictions in
terms of loss of income, croplands and access to forest products such as fuelwood, non-timber forest
products and local construction timber. For many of these peoples, the natural forest also holds significant
cultural and religious values. Generally these communities have limited access to primary education, basic
health care and safe drinking water. It has, therefore, been a major design principle of the Project that these
communities are equitably represented in the beneficiaries of the Project and that project activities are
adapted to their specific needs.
D. Environmental and Social Opportunities, Risks and Mitigation Measures
The Natural Forest Management (NFM) Component
12.    The NFM Component, if well planned and carefully implemented, should lead to a very substantial
improvement in the condition and extent of natural forests through enhanced forest protection,
rehabilitation and sustainable management practices. Local communities will be given a significant
incentive to protect and sustain forest resources through their involvement in co-management arrangements.
Access to community development services, training and household credit could, over the longer term,
reduce village dependence, and thus the pressures, on natural forest resources.
13.    Environmental Issues. The NFM component is expected to be implemented by the European
Commission (EC) which has a different processing procedure than the World Bank. Whereas the World
Bank requires feasibility-level design information prior to project approval, the EC requires only a
conceptual project design for funding approval and final project approval is based on a feasibility design at
project inception. Thus the design information available to this point for the component is very general
compared to that provided for the other two components. Therefore, the recommendations in the ESIA are
meant to provide guidance to the inception phase. Current project documents for NFM place great stress
on co-management agreements developed through "participatory, bottom-up planning processes". Such
processes are extremely valuable tools in natural resource planning, however, they work best when placed
in the context of broader management goals, objectives, and policies that set the bounds for what is possible
and desirable within a given time frame. The present project design prescribes no such broader context.
Major activities in this component include forest resource assessment and forest function zonation,
sustained yield calculation for a range of forest products and co-management plan preparation and
implementation. Operational activities emphasize focus primarily on aspects of harvesting such as yield
determination, harvest control, low-impact logging, and access construction. Without a broader context for
forest management, it is difficult to place these activities in perspective.
14.   It is recommended that NFM, as further designed and implemented, places less emphasis over the
short- to medium-term on immediate harvesting of forest products, and more on forest protection,
regeneration, and rehabilitation. Stand management objectives should be developed for each major forest
type reflecting a desired future state of stand composition and structure to guide forest regeneration and
rehabilitation. Activities should focus on succession management to meet these objectives through
- 101 -



reduced-impact selection cutting, thinning, enrichment planting, enhanced natural regeneration, the gradual
elimination of non-indigenous plantings, and the use of temporary "nurse crops" (plantations or early seral
communities) to provide an optimum enviromnent for regeneration and early growth of the predominant
native hardwood types. In order to further reduce pressures on the natural forest, horticultural research and
technical assistance should be provided to promote the farming, rather than the wild collection, of
non-timber forest products. Management objectives would stress forest rehabilitation in moist tropical,
sub-tropical and temperate forests where growth rates are likely to justify such silvicultural activities, and
forest protection and low-intensity, low-impact harvesting in dry hardwood and subalpine forests where
rotation periods may be measured in centuries.
15.    Social Issues. This project component stresses multi-stakeholder participatory forest management
planning and management, and community development proposals that have emerged through the social
assessment process. Thus the risk of serious social impacts should be minimiized, and probably more than
compensated by potential project opportunities.  Appeal and conflict resolution mechanisms are
incorporated in the participatory planning process to deal with grievances that might arise in plan
development. There is a remote possibility that community infrastructure development might result in
individual loss of assets. A Policy Framework for Involuntary Loss of Assets, prepared to World Bank
specifications, has been developed to establish principles and procedures for fair compensation (see Annex
14 for more details).
The Protected Areas Management (PAM) Component
16.    If carefully implemented, the PAM component has the potential to greatly improve protection and
management of thirteen nature reserves of global importance. Local communities will be encouraged to
participate in reserve protection and management activities through co-management demonstrations.
17.    Environmental Issues. The majority of environmental impacts associated with this component are
expected to be positive. Technical assistance and training programs are expected to substantially improve
levels of management of the protected areas themselves, and participatory planning with local communities
provides a real opportunity to deal with many of the major environmental threats, i.e. unsustainable
fuelwood and NTFP collection, wildlife poaching, fire, overgrazing and illegal logging. Minor negative
environmental impacts associated with reserve infrastructure improvement and increased recreation/tourism
will be dealt with through appropriate environmental prescriptions in reserve management plans.
18.    Social Issues. The most significant potential social impacts relate to community use of forest
resources within reserve areas where use restrictions may be deemed to be necessary in order to ensure
environmental sustainability.  These issues should be capable of resolution through natural resource
co-management planning processes, with necessary mitigation measures implemented through community
conservation funds and local livelihood programs. Grievance and appeal mechanisms have been built into
PAM administrative arrangements to ensure fair treatment of local communities.
The Plantation Establishment (PE) Component
19.    The PE Component has the potential to contribute to closing the gap between domestic demand and
supply of wood products, and thus reduce pressures on the natural forest, and to lead to real improvements
in the welfare of local communities affected by resource use restrictions associated with the logging ban
and NFPP.
- 102-



20.    Environmental Issues. The most significant potential environmental impacts associated with the
PE component are related to three main issues: (a) site selection, in particular the possible conversion of
important native ecosystems; (b) aspects of plantation establishment and management; and (c) pest
management. As part of the environmental assessment, a plantation site screening process has been
established to "flag" native ecosystems and to evaluate their ecological importance before a decision on
conversion to plantation. During project preparation, SFA developed both draft Environmental Protection
Guidelines for Plantation Management and a draft Plantation Pest Management Plan. The environmental
protection guidelines prescribe acceptable practice in such areas as genetic, species and structural diversity
in project design, soil and water conservation, watershed protection, and harvesting. The Pest Management
Plan lists existing insect and disease pests of forestry and economic tree species in China and the main
methods of pest control. The plan reviews problems with implementing pest management policy in the
complex organizational structure of national, provincial, county, and township bureaucracies and
independent research institutions. The plan concentrates its management recommendations on pesticide
safety training and prescribes the content and budget for courses to train about 8,500 people. All
chemicals to be used under the project fall within the WHO's hazard categories II (moderately hazardous)
and III (slightly hazardous) or Class U which means that the relevant chemical is listed in Table 5 of the
WHO guidelines (chemicals unlikely to present acute hazard in normal use).
21.    Social Issues. Early in project design the following principles were established to minimize social
impacts in the PE component: (a) participation must voluntary; (b) all relevant households must have equal
opportunity to participate; (c) there must be no changes to land tenure or resource access that will
disadvantage local communities; and (d) production arrangements must be fair and equitable. The SA
process carried out during the design of the PE component has had success in ensuring compliance with the
first three principles and subsequent follow up investigations by the SA specialist have determined that the
risk of unfair production arrangements in PE has been minimized. As an additional safeguard, however,
mechanisms have been established in the implementation procedures to allow systematic monitoring by
SFA and World Bank supervision missions. A second area of social concem relates to the potential
sustainability and financial viability of new orchard areas (particularly in the fruit sector), which will
depend on new high-producing varieties, a high product quality, low environmental impact and low
production costs. Achieving these will require an effective quality technical extension program in areas
such as appropriate varieties, tree shape and canopy management, crop loading, fertilizer and irrigation
requirements, pest and disease control (IPM), proper harvesting, post harvest handling and marketing. The
PE component contains provision for technical extension services to ensure that participating farmers
receive the training and information necessary to make technically and financially appropriate decisions.
G. Environmental Management and Monitoring
22.    Environmental Management. The major environmental management issues arise in connection
with the PE component. As previously discussed, the three main environmental issues relate to site
selection, adoption of environmental best practice in plantation establishment and management, and pest
management. Separate procedures have been developed to deal with each issue.
* Regarding site selection, the SFA already had site selection criteria which had been developed as a
result of experience on previously Bank-funded plantation establishment projects. The ESIA team
reviewed these guidelines and developed additional screening procedures to ensure that sites of high
ecological significance were excluded from the program. The screening process was applied to a
sample of sites provisionally proposed for inclusion in the first year of the program and the
experience gained has been used to adapt the process for application during subsequent years in the
- 103 -



program. It was agreed that the screening procedure would follow a flow chart of a series of
questions designed to elicit pertinent information on site characteristics as they relate to natural
habitat and cultural heritage values, and to document what decisions were made in light of those
characteristics. This screening chart, as well as any photos called for by the screening process,
would be attached to the 'sub-compartment' cards which Forestry Bureau staff fill out for all sites
being considered for inclusion under the Project.  The chart is included as part of the
Environmental Protection Guidelines.
*   Regarding plantation establishment, technical as well as environmental protection guidelines have
also been developed by the SFA. These were reviewed by the ESIA team and have been updated
to reflect latest thinking on plantation management procedures. Revisions made covered areas such
as plantation design (stream protection prescriptions, and increased structural and genetic diversity
to enhance plantation health), plantation establishment (site preparation), tending (weeding and
thinning), soil and watershed protection, integrated pest control, fire prevention/control, harvesting,
and monitoring and evaluation (both compliance and effectiveness monitoring programs). These
guidelines will provide a basis for preparation of individual plantation design plans, plan approval
and compliance monitoring by PMOs and county forestry bureaus.
*   Regarding pest management, a draft pest management plan has been prepared which outlines an
integrated pest management strategy involving application of a variety of non-chemical approaches
to pest control (quarantine, physical and mechanical methods, agronomic techniques, biological
control), application of pest monitoring procedures, and use of approved agrochemicals
(principally pesticides) only when other methods have failed (i.e. pest monitoring data suggest that
pest levels may exceed economic threshold levels). The draft identifies chemicals which would be
applied to control the main pests which are risks for the various economic tree crops to be
supported under the Project and these all fall within the FAO's Hazard Categories II or III. The
pest management plan also includes a comprehensive training plan which provides for training of
approximately 8,500 technicians who will be responsible for project implementation. The general
training plan for participating households includes instructions on pest management, pesticide
application and storage procedures, and other related matters.
23.    Monitoring. The fundamental objectives of the Project are: (a) to improve the quality and extent
of natural forests through enhanced management, rehabilitation and protection; (b) to assist in the economic
transition of forest dependent communities impacted by the logging ban and NFPP use restrictions; and (c)
improve environmental quality in project areas. Within this broad intent of the Project, three general types
of monitoring are relevant: (a)  implementation monitoring determines the progress in program
implementation against established "benchmarks" (i.e. number of activities undertaken, number of plans
completed, areas treated, number of clients served, cost of delivery, number of people trained, etc. (b)
compliance monitoring measures performance against environmental standards, regulations, permit
conditions or plan commitments; and (c) condition monitoring measures environmental or social condition
in relation to long-term management goals/objectives. Implementation monitoring prescriptions are
currently the most fully developed in project design, and the need to develop compliance monitoring
programs during project implementation has been acknowledged by all three project components.
Condition monitoring programs are presently described only in conceptual terms in the NFM and PAM
components and will be more fully developed during project implementation. Condition monitoring
programs are likely to include the following parameters by project component and sub-component: (a) SA
aspects of all components - project participation and measures of beneficiary satisfaction; (b) the natural
resource management aspects of the NFM and PAM components - indicators of forest ecosystem condition
and diversity, and GIS-based land use/land condition mapping; and (c) the PE component - fertilizer and
pesticide use, indicators of plantation diversity, and simple indicators of ecosystem health.

F. Institutional Arrangements and Training
24.    The Project is a very complex and its implementation will involve many different government
agencies at many different levels (central, province, county, township, communities, nature reserves),
independent institutions, and large numbers of individual project participants and beneficiaries. An
emphasis of the Project is on strengthening of existing institutional arrangements and the Project contains
provision for major training, on-the-job, and extension programs for relevant governnent agencies,
institutions and participating communities.
H. Alternatives
25.   The Project was conceived and designed within the context of the Government's overall objectives
under the NFPP and took into account lessons learned from relevant project work in China and elsewhere in
the world and the findings and recommendations of; independent analytical studies of the Bank's previous
forest projects in China; analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of the Bank's natural resources
management programs in the East Asia and Pacific region; and, a Bank-wide review of implementation of
the Bank's forest policy. As part of this process, a wide variety of project alternatives were considered,
many of which are outlined in Section D of the PAD. From an environmental point of view, the key
alternatives available relate to the PE component and include: (a) whether to include this component at all
(i.e. the "no development" option); (b) whether to restrict support for timber species only or to widen the
scope to include "economic" tree crops (i.e. horticultural species); (c) whether to finance pesticides as part
of the Project; and, if so, (d) whether to procure these pesticides on a centralized or decentralized basis.
Factors taken into account in each case are outlined below:
(a)    Should the PE component be included at all? If there is no PE component, there would be no
IBRD participation in the Project. This would restrict the Bank's capacity to support the government's
social and environmental objectives for forestry and natural resources management sectors which were high
priorities under the Government's 9th Five Year Plan and will continue to be so under the forthcoming I 0th
Five Year Plan. A recent review of the Bank's environmental portfolio in China identified natural resources
management as a significant gap in the overall program and recommended, amongst other things, that its
participation should be strengthened and that consideration should be given to more diversified approaches
to achieve this objective including diversifying funding sources to provide a better match between
development needs and financial terms and conditions. The multi-component approach and diversified
funding structure inherent in SFDP is consistent with this recommendation.  In addition, previous
Bank-financed plantation projects in China have performed extremely well and have introduced more
scientific, technical, financial, and environmental management of plantations.
(b)    Timber species or timber plus "economic" tree crops. The problems of land degradation in
China are closely associated with the problems of rural poverty and many local and international experts
are of the view that the key to promoting sustainable natural resources management is to address the
underlying problem of poverty; strategies intended to promote sustainable natural resources management
need to take account of the income creation potentials and to structure economic returns in ways which
meet the needs of the participant communities. Timber species offer potentially significant returns in the
long term and farmer groups in China have a very good track record of managing timber plantations.
However, many poor farmers lack the financial capacity to cope with the medium to long term nature of
timber production and they need access to alternative or supplementary forns of production which generate
cash flows more closely attuned to their needs while still satisfying environmental objectives. Economic
- 105-



tree crops offer a good option in terms of financial returns, cash flow, and land rehabilitation benefits. The
environmental downside is that horticultural crops are more susceptible than timber plantations to insect
and microbiological attack and support for horticultural trees could increase the propensity of project
participants to apply biocides including pesticides, fungicides, and so on. Overall, and taking account of
the factors discussed further in (c) and (d) below, it was concluded that the balance favored supporting
development of horticultural tree species provided that a diversity of species would be offered, that species
selection would take account of farmer preferences, site conditions and market prospects, and that
particular efforts would be made to design a pest management plan which supported integrated pest
management approaches already being promoted by the SFA (all these criteria are satisfied by the project
design);
(c)    Should Bank funds be used to finance pesticide procurement? The need for procurement of
pesticides under the Project is uncertain although project design includes provision for such procurement if
the need arises. The need is determined on the basis of a pest monitoring and forecasting system which is
maintained by the forestry agencies; where pest numbers exceed pre-determined Economic Threshold
Levels (ETLs) prescribed pesticides are procured by the local forestry bureaus and applied by trained
technicians and farmers. If the Bank does not finance pesticides, the forestry bureau and possibly even the
farmers themselves will purchase them when an outbreak occurs. Even if no IBRD funds are used, a pest
management plan acceptable to the Bank is required. Given this, there are basically two considerations in
favor of IBRD financing: (a) it would provide an element of assurance that pesticides procured through the
Project would fall within FAO Hazard Categories II or III, as is required by the Bank's pesticide policy
hence contributing to minimizing adverse impacts on farmer health It should be noted however, that there
is no way that the Project can prevent individual farmers from procuring prescribed chemicals using their
own funds nor is there any practicable way of monitoring such purchases; and (b) it would represent a form
of short-term production credit that may not otherwise be available and, under some circumstances, could
make a major contribution to the long term viability of the farmers investment in orchard development (e.g.
if there was a particularly heavy pest attack during the initial establishment years of the orchard).
(d)    If pesticides are to be financed by IBRD, should procurement be centralized of decentralized?
As previously mentioned, pesticide procurement would be undertaken on a needs basis as determined by
pest monitoring and pest forecasting systems which are already operated by the Forestry Administration.
There are two options available for carrying out procurement: (i) centralized procurement, under which all
pesticide demand schedules prepared by the Forestry Bureaus in each of the 107 counties participating in
the Project would be collated by the Project Management Center (PMC) in Beijing, advertised
intemationally following Intemational Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, procured, and then
distributed back down to the relevant county Project Management Offices for distribution to the infested
areas. The advantage of this option is that it provides the Bank and PMC with a very effective method of
monitoring the types of pesticides actually procured to ensure compliance with Bank pesticide procurement
policies. The disadvantage is that the process would be so slow as to be of no practical value; a period of 6
to 12 months could elapse between the pesticide needs assessment and delivery, by which time, the pest
outbreak generally would have already occurred. Pesticides would then have to be stored for possible use
in a subsequent season (creating hazards associated with leakage, etc.) and it is possible that some procured
chemicals might never be used, creating an additional disposal problem; and (ii) decentralized procurement,
under which the individual counties procure their own supplies. The advantage of this approach is that it
would expedite delivery of pesticides. The disadvantage is that it would make compliance (and fiduciary)
monitoring much more difficult, probably requiring reliance on random audits during supervision missions.
On balance, and assuming that pesticides would be financed by IBRD, option (ii) would be preferable from
an environmental point of view but random spot checks would be required as a normal part of Bank
supervision.

I. Public Consultation and Information Disclosure
26.    Public Consultation. Both the NFM and PAM project components place considerable emphasis
on the development of a "bottom-up" community driven resource planning processes involving substantive
community consultation and participation. The PE component is based on voluntary participation elicited
through community consultation during project preparation. The public consultation mechanisms and
procedures developed through the Social Assessment process for all three components established a solid
basis for ongoing public consultation activities during project implementation, and occurred as follows:
27.    During the pilot phase of the SA from January 3, 2000 to February 15, 2000, the first round of
formal consultations with potential project beneficiaries was conducted. A second round of consultations
occurred during the wider SA process in areas proposed for the Project from March to September 2000.
Project information leaflets were distributed at two periods, first on December 16, 1999 and again on
March 6, 2000 in each of the proposed project sites prior to the SA consultations. The project leaflets
describe (a) the objectives and activities of the overall project and for each of the Project's three
components, (b) the principles and criteria used to select project areas, including the application process for
participation in the PE component of the Project, (c) the potential environmental impacts of the Project and
the approach used to mitigate these impacts, (d) the source of the funds and the terms and conditions of the
loan, and (e) the unit and contact address of persons in charge of receiving inquiries.
28.    During the pilot SA work in Hainan province, the issue of no written language for the Li people
was addressed by discussing the material in the local spoken language and providing the materials for the
consultations in pictorial form. Sichuan provincial SA teams also used drawings in order to communicate
with village communities (many whom are illiterate) during the SA process. Similarly, for other ethnic
minority areas or in areas with a relatively low level of literacy, care was taken to ensure that the materials
for the consultations were provided in a form and a language that are accessible to the groups being
consulted. The general rule for the Project has been that if standard Chinese is not widely understood by
the groups being consulted, the materials for the consultations would be provided in a language suitable to
the locality and/or in pictorial form.
29.    The third round of formal consultations was held in January 2001 to coincide with the release of
the Project's draft Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (EA). As part of this consultation, all
project affected peoples were informed of the ESIA findings and more than one hundred villages were
randomly selected for village meetings to discuss the EA findings (which have been summarized on a leaflet
and posted in each natural village normally 10 days prior to the meeting). The village representative
assigned a responsible person to keep minutes and summarize the discussion of the EA findings.
Particularly, (i) the number of men and women who attend the meeting will be disclosed, (ii) who they are
(villager, village leader, township/county officials, PMO staff, etc., and (iii) a summary of the questions,
comments, and concems raised at the meeting. The amount of formal written feedback differed by project
component.
30.   In the Plantation Establishment component, a random selection of two villages each in two
randomly selected townships in at least 10% of the 107 project counties were initially consulted. This
means that feedback had been solicited from 56 randomly selected villages participating in this component.
In the Protected Areas Management component, formal feedback was elicited from 2 potential project
villages located adjacent to each of the 13 nature reserves. This amounts to formal feedback from 26
villages. In the Natural Forest Management component, formal feedback was elicited from a random
- 107-



selection of 2 potential project villages in 11 project townships totally 22 villages. In addition, a village in
a township adjacent to the forest management area in Hunan was consulted since it is likely that this
township will be included under the Project. Lastly, one consultation meeting was held in a forestry
enterprise.
31.   Information Disclosure. World Bank directives on disclosure of the environmental and social
impact assessment require that the borrower provide a summary of the draft ESIA report for public review
and comment in a form and language that are understandable by affected peoples and in appropriate public
places accessible to affected groups. During the third round of consultation, a very simple summary of the
ESIA findings and recommendations was made public locally in the project areas and its availability widely
publicized. Where appropriate, the summary was translated into local languages. In villages where
illiteracy was found to be prevalent or where there was no written language for a given ethnic minority
(e.g., Li in Hainan, Dulong in Yunnan), project information was disclosed orally.
32.    The disclosure package includes: (a) a three page leaflet summarizing the key conclusions of the
draft ESIA and specifying the location of the full ESIA report and other important project documentation,
and the name and contact details of the responsible project manager; (b) 10-page Executive Summary of
the ESIA; (c) draft Environment Protection Guidelines for Plantations Establishment; (d) draft Pest
Management Plan for Plantations Establishment; (e) draft Resettlement Policy Framework; (f) draft
Process Framework for Mitigating Adverse Livelihood Impacts; and (g) draft summary Ethnic Minorities
Development Plan. All documents were distributed under each component and are available for public
viewing at the following location:

Social Assessment Summary
China: Sustainable Forestry Development Project
Introduction & Background
1.     The Social Assessment (SA) is an on-going process being undertaken by provincial teams guided
by provincial, national, and international consultants to assess the existing social conditions, to determine
potential negative impacts of the Project, if any, to assist in improving the social design of the Project, to
serve as a baseline for future monitoring, and to serve as a mechanism for community consultations on the
Project as required by the World Bank consultation and disclosure procedures. The SA work carried out
between June 1999 and March 2000 includes semi-structured interviews of over 1,500 households in
approximately 242 project villages across thirteen Project provinces and over 70 focus group discussions
involving some 8,000 community residents. In addition, dozens of institutional stakeholder meetings (with
administrative village leaders, township, county and provincial government officials) were held. The
process to date has generated over 70 different individual site specific SA reports which have been
consolidated into the Social Assessment Report, available in the SFDP Project Files.
2.     Due to the relative complexity of the Project, with each of the three components covering different
geographic areas and project implementation for each component proposed to be carried out by separate
entities, three different SA teams were set-up at the provincial level and linked to each of the components.
The Natural Forest Management (NFM) SA team, Protected Areas Management (PAM) SA team, and
Plantation Establishment (PE) Community Forestry Assessment (CFA) team have been responsible for
conducting the social assessment process in villages falling within the jurisdiction of their respective
component. An estimated 400 individuals (local project staff who would be involved in the community
development sub-components during project implementation, provincial social forestry experts, national
and international social assessment experts) have participated in SA training and/or as a member of one of
the three SA field work teams set up to carry out a representative sample of participatory rural appraisals,
individual household interviews, and focus group discussions across the approximately 687,500 beneficiary
households of the Project.
Methodology
3.     The following steps were taken to set up each SA team, to ensure they had appropriate training in
SA methods, and to generally strengthen the quality of the social assessment process and output: (a) a
provincial social science expert with knowledge of participatory rural appraisal methods and sensitivity of
ethnic minority issues was hired in each of the three key provinces, Hainan, Hunan and Sichuan; (b)
following a Bank-approved TOR, two social science experts were hired at the national level to support the
work of the provinces; (c) all experts received orientation and initial training in donor project preparation
from specialists from Sichuan, a province which has had experience from involvement in several
donor-funded projects; (d) social assessment teams were identified at the provincial level for each of the
three components; (e) the team leader for each component and corresponding provincial expert were trained
at a national workshop after which each trained teanm leader along with the provincial expert trained the
staff of each provincial team; (f) SA pilots were undertaken by provincial teams and reviewed by a team of
national and international experts during the Bank's February 2000 mission; and (g) Social Assessments
were then extended to other sites, and SA Reports were completed for each of the proposed sites for the
NFM and PAM components, and for one county per province considered under the PE component of the
Project.
- 117-



4.     The SA results to date have provided necessary insights into (a) the existing socio-economic
conditions and livelihoods of rural peoples living adjacent to areas proposed for either natural forest
management, protected areas management or plantation establishment; (b) the laws and policies (i.e. 1998
logging ban, closure of steep slopes/conversion policy) governing these communities' access to and use of
the natural resource base; (c) relationships between stakeholders; (d) the negative and positive impacts of
the proposed Project with recommendations to mitigate any negative impacts; (e) any additional restriction
to existing access to the natural resource base as a result of the Project; and (f) ethnic minority nationalities
living in the project area. The results of the SA work conducted across each of the three components
continues to be fed back into the project's design in order to better meet the objectives of each component,
especially opportunities for community development activities.
5.     During the pilot phase of the SA from January 3, 2000 to February 15, 2000, a first round of
consultations with potential project beneficiaries was conducted. A second round of consultations occurred
during the wider SA process in areas proposed for the Project. Project information leaflets were distributed
at two periods, first on December 16, 1999 and again on March 6, 2000 in each of the proposed project
sites prior to the SA consultations. The project leaflets describe (a) the objectives and activities of the
overall Project and for each of the Project's three components, (b) the principles and criteria used to select
project areas, including the application process for participation in the PE component of the Project, (c) the
potential environmental impacts of the Project and the approach used to mitigate these impacts, (d) the
source of the funds and the terms and conditions of the loan, and (e) the unit and contact address of persons
in charge of receiving inquiries.
6.     During the pilot SA work in Hainan province, the issue of no written language for the Li people
was addressed by discussing the material in the local spoken language and providing the materials for the
consultations in pictorial form. Sichuan provincial SA teams also used drawings in order to communicate
with village communities (many whom are illiterate) during the SA process. Similarly, for other ethnic
minority areas or in areas with a relatively low level of literacy, care was taken to ensure that the materials
for the consultations were provided in a form and a language that are accessible to the groups being
consulted. The general rule for the Project has been that if standard Chinese is not widely understood by
the groups being consulted, the materials for the consultations would be provided in a language suitable to
the locality and/or in pictorial form.
Socio-Economic Conditions
7.     Rural Livelihoods. Rural communities living in NFM and PAM project areas have varied land use
systems but they all cultivate staple grains (upland corn, rice and barley) and raise livestock. Despite the
logging ban, the forest remains a critical livelihood resource. Forest areas are used for grazing, fuel-wood
collection (as high as 10 tons/household for those living in Westem Sichuan), and collection of non-timber
forest products (NTFP). Moreover, illegal poaching continues to occur in certain project sites. Damage to
crops and domestic animals caused by wildlife also adversely affects household income, as losses can be
substantial. One village reported an annual loss of 30 kg of grain per household as a result of wildlife of
which they were compensated less than 1 kg of rice per person by the local govemment.
8.     The SA has revealed that the logging ban of 1998 has affected village communities living in
different project component areas differently. Before the logging ban, income derived from the forest (wage
labor from logging and hauling, and imputed income from collection of non-timber forest products)
consisted of approximately 30-80% of household income in NFM project areas. With the logging ban,
household incomes in the NFM component project area have been found to have declined by 59% on
average. As a result, household incomes are becoming more diversified, as people are being forced away
from past income generating opportunities based on higher levels of income from logging. Off-farm
- 118 -



incomes were found to be a major income source in predominantly Han and Tujia project areas. In
communities falling under the PAM component and living in the experimental zones of nature reserves,
subsistence income generating opportunities (fuelwood collection, felling for housing construction, land for
grazing, NTFP collection, and swiddening) while technically restricted activities in the Nature Reserve are
tolerated by reserve staff. In communities located in areas under the PE component of the Project, both the
sale and subsistence use of timber extracted from natural and secondary forests has been banned. As a
result, incomes have dropped and unemployment has risen sharply.
9.     Gender. The SA problem ranking surveys revealed men and women have different development
priorities. The activities identified by women that would yield higher benefits for them, particularly women
of poorer households, include access to drinking water facilities, education and health facilities, village
roads, small animal raising and sustainable NTFP uses. Unemployed women in State Forest Enterprises
requested specific vocational training courses and basic education retraining. The SA conducted in many
nature reserves identified the need for project activities that support training in literacy, accounting and
farm management. Moreover, women of the Li ethnic minority tend to be in a more vulnerable position as
compared to women of other ethnic groups. As a result, greater attention would be placed on incorporating
their needs into specific activities planned under the Project.
10.    Poor vs. Less Poor Households. Poor households indicated that the activities that they would like
to have under the Project include pig, goat, and sheep production, bee keeping, drinking water
improvements, education and health and small infrastructure such as village paths and bridges. Poorer
households also requested training in cultivating fuelwood tree species and NTFPs. Conversely, richer
households in the sample suggested yak raising, tourist guest-houses and irrigation infrastructure as
possible project activities.
11.    Ethnic Minority Nationalities. Of the 55 recognized minzu ("nationalities" or ethnic minority
groups) in China, a total of 18 of them, Li, Tibetan, Qiang, Tujia, Miao, She, Dong, Dulong, Hui,
Mongols, Manchus, Yao, Bai, Lisu, Nu, Yi, Pumi and Naxi reside in SFDP project counties and sites.
Specific ethnic minority profiles have been prepared for four main ethnic groups living in SFDP project
areas (Li, Tibetan, Qiang and Tujia). Shorter briefs were prepared for those ethnic minority groups that
are less populous in the project area. Each profile is based on information collected during the social
assessment process (i.e. household interviews and village wide focus group discussions) and highlights (i)
the location and population of the minority nationality; (ii) different sub-groups, specific language type and
levels of literacy; (iii) their use of land and means of livelihood; and (iv) key measures being taken under
the Project to ensure cultural and location specific appropriateness. In total, over 900 ethnic minority
households were interviewed and over 50 focus group discussions held in ethnic minority areas. The
self-standing Ethnic Minorities Development Plan (EMDP) can be found in the project files. For a
summary of the EMDP, refer to Annex 16.

Project Social Impact, Risks & Opportunities
12.    The SA teams identified the potential risks and opportunities of the Project by component, and as
perceived by beneficiaries during focus group discussions. In the NFM component, possible negative social
risks arise from conflicting land use between forestry regeneration and livestock grazing/pasture; conflicts
over unclear land use rights; lack of coordination with new forest policies; possible loss of assets from
small scale infrastructure development to be identified during implementation through a community driven
planning process. The potential positive impacts arise from community participation in decision-making,
capacity building of village and township institutions, development of skills in sustainable forestry and
agriculture, improved land use planning, secure access to fuel-wood supplies, NTFP, and pasture,
diversified income generation opportunities, participation of women and poorer households, improved
village infrastructure, improvements in health and education services.
13.   In the Protected Areas Management component, possible negative social risks to communities arise
from recent extensions of nature reserve boundaries with possible additional restrictions to natural resource
uses; conflicts between communities, local government and NR staff with respect to resource use; and
conflicts between participating villages and non-participating villages. Positive social impacts envisaged
include equal participation of all households in participating villages; local capacity building in resource
management and rural development, pilots developed to reduce crop damage from wildlife, the introduction
and support of sustainable livelihood opportunities, fostering partnerships between NR staff, communities
and local government, and the development of a mutually agreed conflict resolution mechanism.
14.   In the Plantations Establishment component of the Project, possible negative social risks that could
arise include limited participation of communities in plantation planning, unclear production arrangements,
and conflicting land use between plantation establishment, pasture land for grazing and fuelwood for
heating and cooking. Moreover, the SA revealed that the government's land conversion program is also of
concem to local populations in SFDP project sites. These concems have been taken into consideration in
the re-designing of this component. The opportunities for positive social impacts of this component as
identified by communities surveyed include the voluntary nature of this component, and the Project's
perceived ability to deliver quality inputs and services such as training, technical support, and financial
services.
Conclusions & Recommendations
15.    The SA carried out under SFDP is perhaps one of the most comprehensive of its kind for a Bank
assisted project in China. While consultations with communities revealed that the Project would provide
some relief to recent government policies that have banned logging and restricted agriculture activity on
sloped land, it also identified potential negative social impacts of the Project itself. As a result, each of the
potential negative social impacts raised by communities and SA experts through the SA process have been
acknowledged and steps have been taken to improve the Project's design, thereby significantly reducing, if
not elimninating, these concerns.
16.    Through the SA process, it has been recommended that (a) the Natural Forest Management
component's co-management process would (i) address tourism development concerns and opportunities in
Songpan county, Sichuan province, (ii) resolve conflicts over land use, and (iii) ensure coordination with
respect to the implementation of new forestry policies; (b) the development of a Process Framework for
Mitigating Potential Adverse Livelihood Impacts would provide a means to provide a way to mitigate any
sub-optimal effects as a result of restricting access to protected areas; (c) the development of a Policy
Framework for Resettlement and Land Acquisition that protects village inhabitants from the unlikely event
that project activities would involve the taking of some portion of their land; and (d) adjustments to the
fornal Plantation Establishment component's application process.

Annex 14
Policy Framework for Resettlement and Land Acquisition
China: Sustainable Forestry Development Project
A. Introduction
l.     The proposed Sustainable Forestry Development Project promotes innovative approaches to
improve management of forest resources and to protect the natural environment. A key aspect in project
design is provision of incentives so as to enlist the voluntary participation in resource management. Neither
project agencies nor other governmental units are expected to undertake civil works or otherwise identify or
undertake activities requiring taking of land. Accordingly, neither land acquisition nor involuntary
relocation is expected to occur in any of the three project components:
The Protected Area Management component supports conservation and improved forest management.
Because this component involves existing forest reserve areas, land acquisition will not occur. Effective
management, however, may require additional restrictions on forest use. The Project views community
co-management of forest reserves as essential to sustainable management. This means that
communities now relying on access to forest resources will participate in allocation of resource use and
in design of remedial measures for lost resource access, if any (Potential impacts resulting from
restriction of access to nature reserves are covered in a separate Process Framework as described in OP
4.12 (See Annex 15).
The Plantation Establishment component promotes increased production of wood to meet growing
consumer demand and to provide sources of employment and income for persons already affected by
logging bans and other restrictions on use. Participants receive various forms of support to develop
wood or tree-crop production. Most recipients are likely to be individual or collective plantation
owners, selected from among voluntary applicants meeting specified eligibility criteria. This may
involve voluntary conversion of participants' existing land to plantation purposes, but no involuntary
land acquisition or other resettlement-related issues are likely to arise. It is possible that township
governments may be among recipients, but eligibility criteria require that any govemment recipients
utilize existing government land for eligible activities, or obtain additional land through voluntary
negotiations with present land owners or users.
The Natural Forest Management component supports development and testing of new management
techniques of potential use in the government's Natural Forest Protection Program. Among various
activities in this component, the European Union would provide small grants or credits in rural villages
already affected by the logging ban. Villages meeting counterpart funding requirements would be
eligible for small village improvement grants. These small-scale activities would be identified through
community planning processes. Some may involve physical improvements (e.g., road widening or
construction of sheds or other facilities), but it expected that all such improvements would be sited
within the village itself. Because land is collectively owned within villages, there is very little likelihood
of land acquisition or resettlement-related impacts. Use of unallocated collective land for community
improvements identified by the community itself is not considered land acquisition. Use of land allotted
to individual households on a lease basis by the collective would be covered by this framework unless
obtained through voluntary negotiations with the leaseholder.
- 121 -



2.     As part of project agreements, the Borrower will attest that no activities requiring involuntary
taking of land will be undertaken in this Project without prior acceptance by the Bank of appropriate
planning remedies. The European Union, as the source of grant support, also will attest that it will not
provide support for any activities requiring involuntary taking of land, or activities imposed by government
agencies on villages receiving grant support.
3.     At the time of project preparation and appraisal, no land acquisition or other resettlement-related
impacts could be identified. However, since the site of small-scale infrastructure that may be undertaken in
the Plantation Establishment and the Natural Forest Management components is not yet known,
resettlement-related impacts cannot be ruled out completely. This Policy Framework has been prepared for
the purpose of establishing principles and procedures to be applied in the event that involuntary loss of land
or other fixed assets would arise as a result of project implementation. The policy framework has been
developed based on World Bank Operational Directive 4.30 on involuntary resettlement and relevant
Chinese laws and regulations, and will form the basis for resettlement planning.
B. General Principles
4.     Basic principles guiding any necessary actions related to involuntary loss of land or other assets
are as follows:
(a)    Taking of land or other assets, as well as other resettlement-related impacts, should be avoided or
minimized;
(b)    Project activities causing any such losses will not be approved for financing until
remedial measures have been prepared and found by the Bank to be consistent with this
framework;
(c)    As relevant, remedial measures should provide project-affected persons with: (i) compensation for
land or other lost assets at full replacement cost without depreciation, (ii) compensation for
damaged crops at full market value, (iii) provision of an altemative house plot (as necessary), and
(iv) land redistribution, alternative employment or other measures necessary to improve, or at least
restore, incomes following loss of land or other productive assets;
(d)    Absence of legal title to, or formal ownership of, affected assets is not a barrier to compensation
or other forms of assistance;
(e)    Adequate supervision and monitoring should be in place to identify any issues associated with
involuntary losses in a timely manner;
(f)    Institutional responsibilities to implement the rehabilitation measures need to be clearly delineated;
(g)    For the purposes of this framework, "affected persons" are defined as persons who, as a result of
works carried out or to be carried out under the Project, would incur involuntary loss, temporarily
or permanently, of land, shelter, productive assets or access to productive assets, or of incom
or means of livelihood and, as a consequence, have their living standards or production levels
adversely affected; and
- 122 -



(h)    No grant assistance will be provided for any activities requiring involuntary relocation
of residence.
C. Identification of Impacts and Planning Procedures
5.     As stated above, project design emphasizes voluntary participation, including selection of activities
by villagers themselves. If involuntary taking of land or other assets (including involuntary taking by
collectives of land leased to collective members) arises during project implementation, remedial plans are to
be prepared in keeping with the general principles listed above. As regarding compensation for lost assets,
and conversion of agricultural land for other purposes, remedial plans also will be consistent with the Law
of the PRC on Land Management (1999), the Implementation Regulations of the Law of the PRC on Land
Management, and related provincial laws and regulations.
6.     Given the nature of the proposed project components, any activity that may cause taking of land or
other assets is likely to affect relatively few people (e.g., less than 200 people), and impacts are likely to be
relatively minor (e.g., not requiring changes in occupation or relocation of residence). Under such
circumstances, a relatively brief remedial plan can be prepared. Even under these circumstances, however,
the remedial plan should briefly review: (i) description of the project activity necessitating land acquisition;
(ii) basic legal or regulatory provisions regarding land acquisition and compensation; (iii) basic data
enumerating and identifying impacts and the persons to be affected by them; (iv) compensation rates; (v)
timetable; (vi) organizational and financial arrangements; and (vii) consultative arrangements (including
grievance procedures).
7.     In the unlikely event that any project activity is to affect more than 200 persons, more detailed
presentation of planning elements is required. In the event that any project activity would result in the
necessity for arrangements to promote the economic rehabilitation of any affected persons, detailed review
of arrangements (e.g., land redistribution, provision of employment, or other alternative measures to restore
incomes) must be provided prior to Bank acceptance.
D. Management Organizations and Responsibilities
8.     At the time that the necessity of land acquisition (or taking of other assets) is recognized, the
provincial Project Management Office should assign responsibility for consultations with project-affected
persons, preparation of remedial plans, and resettlement implementation. Specific responsibilities to be
assigned include, at a minimum:
(a) identification of impacts and project-affected persons;
(b) establishment of remedial measures consistent with the general principles stated above;
(c) consultations with project-affected persons, and dissemination of relevant information to them
in a timely manner;
(d) prior consultations with the Bank (or other donor agencies, as relevant) in selection of activities
necessitating land acquisition or resettlement, and in formulation of remedial plans;
(e) coordination with any local government units sharing responsibility for any aspects of resettlement
preparation or implementation;
- 123 -



(f) timely payment of compensation, and provision for delivery of any other forms of assistance;
(g) monitoring of effectiveness of resettlement implementation; and
(h) responding to grievances presented by project-affected persons.
E. Consultation and Grievance Procedures
9.      The taking of land or other assets, and the preparation of remedial plans require consultation with
project-affected persons. Prior to taking of land or other assets, the responsible governmental unit will visit
affected villages or households to discuss the location and quantity of assets to be acquired, and
compensation rates and any other rehabilitation measures to be provided. Following consultations, any
remedial plans will be disseminated to the project-affected persons in a manner accessible to them.
Information disseminated to the project-affected persons will include: (i) compensation rates for all
categories of affected assets; (ii) eligibility criteria for all other forms of assistance that may be provided;
and (iii) grievance procedures (including specific contact information for initiating, or following up on,
grievances).
10.    If project-affected persons are not satisfied with proposed resettlement arrangements, or if they are
dissatisfied with actual resettlement implementation, they can first seek satisfaction through village councils
(or other local leaders). If this does not result in resolution of issues, project-affected persons can also make
grievance verbally or in written form to authorities as specified in the remedial plan. Specified authorities
should record receipt of grievances and reply to the project-affected person or persons within ten days after
receiving the grievances. If the grievances or disputes cannot be resolved through administrative action, the
project-affected person can initiate legal proceedings, in accordance with provincial and national law.

Annex 15
Process Framework for Mitigating Potential Adverse Livelihood Impacts
China: Sustainable Forestry Development Project
1.     Project Description.  The Sustainable Forest Development Project (SFDP) proposes the
development and implementation of innovative management approaches in selected natural forests, nature
reserves and forest plantations to relieve pressures on China's remaining natural forest resources, as well as
to protect selected important forest ecosystems and associated biodiversity.  The SFDP has three
components: (a) Natural Forest Management (NFM); (b) Protected Areas Management (PAM); and (c)
Plantation Establishment (PE).
2.     PAM Component Description. The SFDP's PAM Component would support more effective in
situ protection of threatened and globally important forest ecosystems and habitats, and associated rare and
endemic species in selected Nature Reserves (NR) in China. China's NRs face increasing pressure from the
human communities inside or in close proximity to them. These local communities, many of which are
impoverished, are typically forest-dependent in that they derive substantial portions of their income from
the use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), rely on firewood as a major energy source (annual
fuelwood consumption can be as high as 10 tons/household in the Western Sichuan mountains), and use
forest areas for other subsistence and economic activities such as farming staple grains, grazing livestock,
and medicinal herb production. In some areas these activities increasingly exceed sustainable levels,
undermining already meager livelihoods. Moreover, coupled with widespread wildlife hunting and illegal
extraction of timber products, excessive levels of forest-resource use adversely affect the biological
integrity and sustainability of the NRs.
3.     The significant forest dependence of the local communities presents a three-fold challenge to
protecting the China's NRs from overuse and other threats. Ihe first facet of the challenge is how to
engage local people in NR management, during the Project and over the long-term. The second is what are
appropriate encouragement and incentives for local people to use nature reserve resources sustainably.
And, the third is what types of alternatives could be developed to forest-resource-dependent activities which
would both support more sustainable livelihoods and maintain the integrity of the nature reserves. The
PAM component takes a multi-pronged approach to addressing these challenges through three
sub-components and key activities: (a) Nature Reserves Planning and Managemenit including (i) revision of
initial management plans, (ii) preparation of ecological baseline maps, (iii) implementation of wildlife
damage control demonstration, (iv) strengthen field management, research, and monitoring, and (v)
improvement of reserve infrastructure; (b) Community-Based Nature Conservation including (i)
preparation and implementation of co-management demonstration activities, (ii) community conservation
education/public awareness, (iii) energy conservation demonstrations, and (iv) technical extension and
community training on sustainable livelihood activities; (c) Training and Capacity Building with emphasis
on provincial and nature reserve levels; and (d) Monitoring and Evaluation.
4.     Policy Trigger. This Process Framework will be implemented in accordance with World Bank
policy on involuntary resettlement. It covers restrictions of access to legally designated parks and protected
areas which result in adverse impacts on livelihoods of the affected persons. Good practice has
demonstrated that the objectives of the policy can be better achieved through a participatory process and
rehabilitation interventions along the lines outlined in this Process Framework.  To determine the
appropriate coverage of the Process Framework, a review was undertaken of the PAM component design
and the results of the Social Assessment (SA) to confirm if any involuntary restrictions of resource access
- 125 -



are anticipated, as well as to evaluate the potential impacts on peoples' livelihoods of any restriction of
access likely to be imposed as a result of the PAM component.
5.     In general logging, grazing, hunting, fishing, herbal plant collection, mining, burning of grasses or
other vegetation, and farming of crops are all forbidden by law within NRs in China, with some exceptions
for limited subsistence uses. China's NRs are typically sub-divided in to a core zone, where no use for any
purpose other than approved research is allowed, and an experimental zone, where subsistence and income
generating uses are allowed on a limited level as long as the uses do not conflict with the operation of the
nature reserve. The imposition of China's "logging ban" in 1998, effectively extended the prohibition of
logging, collection of forest products and other extractive uses of forest resources to all natural forests.
6.     In order to enhance the management systems of NRs, the PAM component would support, inter
alia, development and implementation of management plans for selected NR, which would focus on key
management activities to enhance conservation, such as habitat restoration, increased monitoring and
working with forest-dependent households and communities to develop and implement regulations and other
measures to ensure sustainable utilization of natural resources. The PAM component design would not
require involuntary physical displacement or relocation of people. Furthermore, to the extent feasible, the
NR management plans would avoid including new restrictions or stricter enforcement of current restrictions
of use of NR resources by local communities which would adversely affect their livelihoods, beyond those
needed to ensure the sustainability of the NRs.
7.     Nonetheless, new or increased restrictions of access to natural resources in the NRs, such as
changes in zoning between experimental and core zone, or introduction of a new, buffer zone with increased
restrictions from the experimental zone, may be needed to ensure sustainability of the NRs. In some cases,
changes in zoning may adversely impact livelihoods. In other cases, zoning changes may actually increase
opportunities for communities, as in the case of some of the NR in Hunan Province, where re-zoning of the
core zone may actually open up more collective forests for sustainable use of fuelwood and selective
collection of NTFPs. However, increased restriction of access cannot be ruled out until the management
plans for the NR are developed during implementation, at which time the nature of any proposed
restrictions, as well as the type of measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts of those restrictions,
would be determined in consultation with the project-affected groups.
8.     Process Framework. This Process Framework outlines the criteria and procedures as described in
OP 4.12, which will be followed as part of the Project, in cases where project-induced involuntary
restriction of access to NR resources results in adverse livelihood impacts, to ensure that eligible, affected
persons are assisted in their efforts to restore or improve their livelihoods in a manner which maintains the
environmental sustainability of the nature reserve in question.  More specifically, it describes the
participatory process by which: (a) specific components of the Project were prepared and will be
implemented; (b) the criteria for eligibility of affected persons will be determined; (c) measures to assist the
affected persons in their efforts to improve or restore, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels, their
livelihoods (e.g., as appropriate, altemative grazing areas, cultivation of unique non-timber forest products
such as mushrooms, or of other crops, or investments in community infrastructure) while maintaining the
sustainability of the park or protected area will be identified; and (d) potential conflicts involving affected
persons will be resolved. It also provides a description of the arrangements for implementing and
monitoring the process.
9.     Process Followed During Preparation. A full SA process was conducted during component
preparation by provincial teams guided by provincial, national and intemational experts. A representative
sample of rural village households in selected "critical" communities in and adjacent to the 13 nature
- 126-



reserves included under the Project were interviewed. The objective of the SA was to: (a) assess the
existing social conditions; (b) determine the potential negative impacts of the component, if any; (c) serve
as a vehicle for community consultations on the component; and (d) inform the ongoing component design.
10.    The SA found that the likely overall impact of the proposed PAM component would be positive
since participation of local communities in preparation and management of nature reserves would be
increased, alternative methods for reducing crop damage from wildlife would be introduced, awareness of
potential nature reserve benefits on local economies would be enhanced, and alternative livelihood and
energy efficiency activities would be supported. The results of the SA were used to refine the design of the
PAM component, enhancing positive impacts and mitigating likely adverse effects. Nonetheless, it is
possible that some component activities could inadvertently affect adversely the livelihoods of persons
living in or adjacent to the NRs.
11.    Preparation or revision of management plans (MPs) for the NRs would follow a participatory
approach, in which the roles of local communities in the management of NRs would be strengthened, and
appropriate measures would be identified with local communities to enhance the sustainability of NR
resource-based livelihood activities and manage pressures on the NRs. In addition, a community-based
nature conservation sub-component would assist the 13 NRs participating in the Project develop their
community-based approach to conservation through support to: (a) the establishment of county-level
organizational structures, as well as strengthening of village institutions, for the development and
implementation of co-management activities in the NRs; (b) decreasing the threats from overuse of forest
resources for energy through targeted demonstrations of appropriate, practical, and cost-effective energy
conservation approaches; and (c) providing training and technical assistance for the identification and
demonstration of alternative income generating techniques as alternatives to the use of critical forest
resources.
12.    Process to be Followed During Implementation. The process to be followed during project
implementation would consist of the following seven key steps: (a) conduct participatory rural assessment
(PRA) surveys to determine community use of natural resources and critical threats, conflicts and
community issues; (b) establish and train leading groups; (c) select co-management demonstration sites; (d)
establish Management Forum in communities; (e) prepare Community Resource Management Plans; (f)
establish and implement Community Conservation Fund; and (g) monitor and evaluate implementation.
13.    Participatory Rural Assessments.  Following-up on the SAs conducted during preparation,
additional work on social assessment through Participatory Rural Assessment (PRA) surveys would lead
off the implementation of the component. The PRAs would focus on developing a more in-depth
understand of: (a) the social and geographic setting of the communities in the component areas, including
their economic and social problems; (b) the types and extent of community use of natural resources, and the
existing dejure and defacto rules and institutions for the use and management of natural resources; (c) the
communities' threats to and impacts on the NRs; (d) the potential livelihood impacts of new or more strictly
enforced restrictions on use of resources in the NRs; (e) communities' suggestions and/or view on possible
mitigation measures; and (f) potential conflicts over the use of natural resources, and methods for solving
potential conflicts. The results of the PRAs will be an input to the development or revision of the MPs
under the nature reserves planning and management sub-component, as well as to the development of the
Community Resource Management Plans (CRMPs) under the community based conservation
sub-component.
14.    Leading Groups. Leading groups for each of the NRs, comprised of officials from local county
government, staff from the nature reserves, and representatives of the local commnunities participating in the
- 127 -



co-management activities will be formed under the component. The leading groups will be charged with
overseeing the co-management process, with key tasks and responsibilities including: (a) preparing
selection criteria for the co-management demonstration sites; (b) coordinating technical advice, programs
and cooperation among various local government departments; (c) reviewing and approving CRMPs and
community contracts; and (d) resolving conflicts arising out of the co-management process.
15.    Determination of criteria for eligibility of affected persons, and identification of measures to
assist affected persons. Selection of the villages to participate in the Community-Based Conservation
sub-component would not be made until the first year of project implementation, and would be based on the
results of the participatory rural assessments (PRAs) as well as the threats analysis, to identify the sources
of the major threats to the nature reserves, conducted as part of the nature reserve management planning
process. Participating villages would be identified based on their level of dependency on the forest
resources inside the nature reserve, the degree of threat that these uses pose to the NR, and the anticipated
severity of adverse impact to livelihoods from imposition of any proposed use restrictions. The results of
the PRA and the threats analysis will be used to ensure that the Project provides benefits to eligible
forest-dependent household in the project areas adversely affected by the Project, and to help define project
activities that will assist them in improving their livelihoods, both by enhancing and improving the
sustainability of the natural resource base and by identifying alternative sources of income (e.g., skills
training, small grants, technical extension, etc.).
16.    Based on the results of the PRA surveys and the threats analysis, the Leading Groups will
determine the eligibility of villages as well as confirm the eligibility of households in the eligible villages,
and select co-management sites in or around each of the NRs on the basis of severity of impacts. Critical
communities (i.e., those which are dependent on the nature reserve, pose a threat to the nature reserve, and
would be adversely affected by proposed use restriction), as identified in the management planning process,
will get priority for project activities under the Community Resource Management Plans (see paras 18 -
20). Other communities, either less impacted or exerting less pressure on nature reserve natural resources,
may not be able to participate. A minimum of twenty-six villages (two per NR) will be selected to
participate in co-management activities, including alternative livelihood measures. For NRs in which
project activities would adversely affect the livelihoods of local people in more than two villages, the other
villages would be deemed eligible and would be included, and an increased level of local government
counterpart funding would be in place to cover the costs of the additional villages. Another 39 villages will
be selected to participate in fuelwood management and/or technical training activities. In addition, 7
villages will be supported in community-based wildlife management demonstrations.
17.   Management Forum. A Management Forum (MF) for the co-management process would be
comprised of representatives are the various stakeholders groups, including the village committee, village
groups, special groups, and nature reserve staff. The exact composition of the MF would be determined by
the results of the PRA, which would clarify the traditional power structures and their relationship to the
official power structures. Where appropriate, the MF would include religious and/or traditional leaders
(e.g., monks, ethnic minority leaders). The MFs would lead the preparation of Community Resource
Management Plans (CRMPs) as well as manage the Community Conservation Fund (CCF). In addition,
the MF would approve community conservation and development project supported by the CCF, enforce
rules and regulations of the CRMP, and adjudicate potential conflicts.
18.    Community Resource Management Plans and Community Conservation Funds. As an incentive
for local communities to participate in the development and implementation of the MPs for the NRs, the
Project will help the communities to prepare CRMPs, outlining the priority management actions that
communities would need to undertake, as well as meeting priority needs of communities. Thus, the
- 128-



CRMPs would provide management programs, or plans and rules agreed to by the community, the nature
reserve and local govemment, that provide for more sustainable use of critical community resources, such
as firewood and wild medicinal plants. In ethnic minority communities these plans would be culturally
appropriate.
19.    The CRMPs would be developed by the village-level MF, a village stakeholder committee built on
the village committee, through participatory mapping exercises and detailed consultations with
stakeholders. All people affected by MPs for the NRs would be given the opportunity to participate in
planning and implementation of CRMPs. The MFs would be provided technical assistance to outline their
respective natural resources management issues, and to develop a plan for solving the most important
conflict or threat facing the nature reserve and the community. Each of the CRMPs would comprise a
community-based NR resource use and protection program, proposals for economic activities that reduce
the overuse of critical NR resources or provide altemative livelihoods for resources lost, and outline the
organizational structure and approach for managing the implementation of the CRMPs. As village capacity
to develop and manage projects is generally low, village leaders and other members of the MF would
receive project management training under the Project.
20.    Eligible activities in the CRMPs would be financed through the Community Conservation Funds
(CCFs), with appropriate counterpart funding from local governments and beneficiaries. Eligible activities
for financial assistance include small-scale enterprises, altemative livelihood activities or small-scale
conservation and rural development activities, such as installing energy conserving technologies in village
households. The CRMPs will also contain negotiated conservation agreements related to the MPs for the
NRs, which will outline in detail the conservation activities to be undertaken by the community as part of
implementation of the management plan. Funding for the CRMPs will be conditioned on commitment by
the community to undertake the agreed conservation measures, as well as on making counterpart
contributions and ensuring maintenance of investments, as appropriate.
21.    The SFDP would provide funds for the establishment of CCFs. Villages can use the CCF to
finance projects identified within the community that solve problems and/or take advantage of opportunities
identified in the CRMPs. The Project would provide technical assistance and training to MFs regarding the
management of the CCFs.
22.    Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements. Baseline information on socio-economic conditions of
the villages and household, in particular the potential livelihood impacts of new or more strictly enforced
restrictions on use of resources in the NRs, will be collected through the PRAs conducted at the initial stage
of implementation. These data will be used as the basis for determining the eligibility of villages and
households for assistance under the process framework, as well as designing measures to assist the affected
persons in their efforts to improve or restore their livelihoods to comprise the CRMPs. Follow-up PRAs,
conducted at the mid-term review and the close of Project, will update these data for the purpose of
monitoring and evaluation of the implementation and impacts of the CRMPs. The specific monitoring
indicators will be outlined in the Plan of Action. Possible indicators include: numbers of eligible villages
and households; the potential livelihood impacts to these villages and households of new or more strictly
enforced restrictions on use of resources in the NRs; livelihood benefits of measures to assist the affected
persons; numbers of villages and households participating in CCFs; and funds provided by CCFs to eligible
villages and households.
23.    Plan of Action. The CRMPs for each of the 13 NRs would together serve as the Plan of Action
required by the Bank's policy on involuntary resettlement to be developed and submitted to the Bank during
project implementation and prior to enforcement of new restrictions of access to resources in the NR,
- 129-



describing the specific measures to assist persons to be adversely affected by the proposed restrictions.
24.    Conflict Resolution Mechanism. The risk of conflicts arising between communities or among NRs,
villages and households during implementation of this process framework are real and must be addressed.
A two-fold mechanism, with both proactive and reactive elements for resolution of conflicts, disputes and
grievances that might arise, would be put in place
25.    Proactive Approach. Recognizing that many conflicts arise due to difference in understanding and
perceptions, a proactive approach would be adopted to avoid conflicts before they start. This approach
would promote a common understanding through a four-pronged approach, including: (a) wide-spread
disclosure of project background information; (b) clarification of the criteria of eligibility for assistance
under the process framework; (c) clarification of the duties and responsibilities of all stakeholders in the
process, and in particular the composition and roles of the leading groups and management forums; and (d)
community conservation education and public awareness regarding values of the NRs, threats to the NRs,
and options for mitigating these threats.
26.    Reactive Approach. Conflict that do arise would be dealt with through the appropriate leading
groups and MFs. The MFs would adjudicate potential conflicts at the village level. If resolution is not
possible at the village level, the MF can seek advice from the county-level Leading Group, who are charged
with overseeing the co-management process.

Annex 16
Ethnic Minorities Development Plan
China: Sustainable Forestry Development Project
Overview
1 .     The objective of the Ethnic Minorities Development Plan (EMDP) is to ensure that the process of
development generated by the Sustainable Forestry Development Project (SFDP) fully respects the dignity
of ethnic minorities, their cultural rights and their cultural identity. The terms "minority nationalities" and
"ethnic minorities" are both officially recognized by the Government of China and are used interchangeably
throughout the EMDP and this summary. In particular, the objective of this strategy is to ensure that the
ethnic minority populations do not suffer negative effects of the Project and that they receive social and
economic benefits compatible with their culture. This is accomplished by a participatory and consultative
process engaging ethnic minority stakeholders to ensure that the concerns of ethnic minorities have been
taken into account in project design. Moreover, specific areas for further investigation flagged by the
Social Assessment (SA) process, the provincial, national, and intemational social assessment experts, and
raised in the full EMDP would serve to hone the Project more toward meeting the development objectives
of peoples classified as ethnic minority nationalities in SFDP project areas. The full Ethnic Minorities
Development Plan is available in the SFDP Project files.
2.      The EMDP presents important demographic and socio-economic information for all SFDP
project counties, townships and villages where ethnic minorities live. Moreover, the SFDP social
assessment has (a) documented the approximate number and type of ethnic minority nationality in each of
the project counties, townships and villages; (b) described their livelihood opportunities; (c) described the
potential threats to their livelihood as a result of the Project; and (d) summarized possible opportunities the
people themselves saw to generate higher incomes through project activities, including more sustainable
livelihood options. This specific investigation has been undertaken to ensure that ethnic minority groups
receive equitable access to project activities and services.
3.     The EMDP provides programmatic recommendations to mitigate possible negative impacts
identified through the SA process. In particular, it has been recommended that (a) the Natural Forest
Management component's co-management process would (i) address tourism development concerns and
opportunities in Songpan county, Sichuan province which were raised by ethnic Tibetans, (ii) resolve
conflicts over land use in all areas, and (iii) ensure coordination with respect to the implementation of new
forestry policies; (b) the development of a Process Framework would provide a means to mitigate any
sub-optimal effects as a result of restricting access to natural resource areas; (c) the development of a
Resettlement Policy Framework that protects village inhabitants from the unlikely event that project
activities would involve the taking of some portion of their land; and, (d) adjustments to the formal
Plantation Establishment component's application process.
Ethnic Minorities in Project Area
4.     Of the 55 recognized ethnic minority groups in China, a total of 18 of them, Li, Tibetan, Qiang,
Tujia, Miao, She, Dong, Dulong, Hui, Mongols, Manchus, Yao, Bai, Lisu, Nu, Yi, Pumi and Naxi reside
in SFDP project counties and sites. The largest number of ethnic minority nationalities that inhabit SFDP
project areas include the Tibetan, Bai, Qiang, Tujia, Li, and Lisu. By far, the Tibetan ethnic minority are
most prevalent overall. There are approximately 25,000 Tibetans (50% of all potential ethnic minority
- 131 -



project beneficiaries and 28% of the total beneficiaries in two of the three components). The Yao, She, Yi,
Nu, Lisu, Pumi, Bai, Dulong and Naxi are found in a very small number of project areas and in small
numbers. Mongols and Manchus are only found in only 3 project counties in Liaoning province. The Hui
people inhabit only a few SFDP project areas in Sichuan and Gansu provinces and tend to be the least
marginal of the ethnic groups in this area. They are mostly traders and live in township and county centers
and are not found in specific project villages. Generally, ethnic minority beneficiaries of SFDP are located
in remote areas where the remaining natural forests are located or adjacent to protected areas such as
nature reserves. As a result, the Project seeks to work with mostly ethnic minority communities in its
attempt to achieve its sustainable development and biodiversity conservation objectives.
5.     Ethnic minority profiles have been prepared for all ethnic groups identified as living in SFDP
project areas. More detailed briefs have been prepared for more represented groups (Tibetan, Bai, Qiang,
Li, Tujia and Lisu). Shorter briefs were prepared for less represented groups (Miao, Yao, Yi, She,
Dulong, Dong, Nu, Naxi, Pumi, Mongols, Manchus and Hui). Each profile is based on information
collected during the social assessment process (i.e. household interviews and village wide focus group
discussions). In total, over 900 ethnic minority households were interviewed and over 50 focus group
discussions held in ethnic minority areas. In addition, an independent expert investigation of Tibetan and
Qiang ethnic groups in Songpan County, Sichuan Province was undertaken as part of the project
preparation process. Each ethnic minority nationality profile highlights (i) the location and population of
the minority nationality; (ii) different sub-groups, specific language type and levels of literacy; (iii) their
use of land and means of livelihood; and, (iv) key measures being taken under the project to ensure cultural
and location specific appropriateness.
6.     Project site profiles were also prepared to illustrate the specific conditions under which ethnic
minorities live in SFDP project sites. These site specific profiles include (i) an overview of the typical
livelihood patterns. of ethnic minorities living in the project site area; (ii) a description of the extent to
which each ethnic minority inhabits the project area; (iii) an overview of how each ethnic minority group
use natural resources, particularly the forests, for subsistence, commercial and other cultural purposes; (iv)
a summary of the problems faced by these populations; and (v) an overview of risks and opportunities that
exist for them under the Project. The table below presents the location (province) of each of these minority
groups and within which component of SFDP each group falls.

7.     The Social Assessment indicates that there would be approximately 687,500 household
beneficiaries (2.75 million individuals) of the Project, of which at least 3% (or 87,800 individuals) belong
to one of the ethnic minority nationalities. The approximate number of ethnic minority beneficiaries are
found to be uneven across each of the three project components as reflected in the table below. This is a
result of the fact that two project components, PAM and NFM, are located in remote natural forest areas
where ethnic minorities reside, while the PE component is located only in areas suitable for commercial
plantation establishment and participants have to be willing to borrow funds at commercial rates.

*   Natural Forest Management (NFM). An approximate total of 13,100 ethnic people inhabit SFDP
NFM component villages of which 29% are Li (living in Hainan province), 34% are Tibetans (living in
Sichuan province), 7% are Qiang (also living in Sichuan province), and 29% are Tujia (living in Hunan
province). There are also She, Yao, and Miao people in very small numbers living in project areas in
- 133 -



Hunan province. The ethnic population account for 54% to 100% of the beneficiary population in 9 out
of the 13 NFM project townships, and only 5% in the remaining four sites (two in Sichuan province
and two in Hunan province).
*   Protected Area Management (PAM). Approximately 191,000 people belonging to one of the officially
recognized ethnic minority/nationality groups reside in one of 78 project townships where thirteen
project Nature Reserves (NR) are located. More than 50 percent of the ethnic minorities live within
and around the two Yunnan province nature reserves, where they account for 81%-i 00% of the project
township population. Most of the remaining ethnic minorities live in and around eight nature reserves
and account on average for approximately 93% of population in 56 townships. A total of 230
administrative villages in these townships, mostly inhabited by ethnic minorities are located within
nature reserve boundaries. However, twenty-six villages will participate in community based
conservation activities, and another 39 villages will join fuelwood management or technical training
activities. An additional 7 villages would be supported in community-based wildlife management
projects. The exact numbers of ethnic minority beneficiaries will become more accurate once each of
the project villages has been selected for this component. This would occur during the first year of
implementation.
*   Plantation Establishment (PE). Only 14 of the 107 PE counties or 13% of them contain ethnic
minority populations (one county in Hainan, Sichuan, and Gansu provinces; two counties in Henan
province; four counties in Hunan province; and, five counties in Liaoning province). In each of these
counties, the overall ethnic minority population in those counties ranges between 5%-97% of the total
county population. A process of formal application to join the Project would continue to be carried out
in each of the 107 project counties to ensure wide participation. A total estimate of 2,667,600
households would take part in the component, of which less than 34,000 (or 1%) would belong to one
of the recognized ethnic minority nationalities.
8.     SFDP would involve the participation of ethnic communities in nature conservation and the
management of natural resources with the objective of enhancing local levels of sustainable and
economically viable development. The principal activities of the Protected Areas Management component
that would specifically benefit ethnic minorities include (a) the preparation and implementation of
community-based economic development activities with a conservation focus in 26 villages in and adjacent
to 13 project nature reserves; (b) increasing target community and local govenmuent stakeholders'
understanding of biodiversity conservation and the threats it faces from their actions by assisting nature
reserves to develop and implement a community conservation education strategy; (c) decreasing the threats
from overuse of forest resources for energy through targeted demonstrations of appropriate, practical,
culturally appropriate and cost-effective energy conservation approaches; and (d) providing training and
technical assistance for the identification and demonstration of altemative income generating techniques as
altematives to the use of critical forest resources.
9.     The Natural Forest Management component activities would be available to all people living in the
project townships and villages (40 % of which are individuals belonging to one of the recognized ethnic
minority groups) to improve their livelihood and to develop land use practices that are environmentally
sustainable. The Community Development sub-component is intended to assist villagers in the project
areas whom are generally exposed to poverty according to poverty standards and have been economically
disadvantaged as a result of the logging ban. Project activities consist of (i) assisting ethnic minorities to
develop economic opportunities that are environmentally sustainable; (ii) developing rural public
infrastructure to facilitate economic activity; and (iii) encouraging the active participation of ethnic
minorities in planning and implementing specific project activities such as a micro-credit program. A

second set of activities designed to retrain unemployed forestry workers would benefit members of ethnic
minority nationalities. Approximately 4% of all forestry enterprise workers belong to one of the recognized
ethnic minority groups and would directly benefit under retraining activities. The specific training
programs would be developed during implementation of the Project.
10.   In order to effectively meet the development objectives of SFDP, ethnic minority nationalities
would be engaged in all aspects of the Project. By providing these communities with an enabling
environment in which to participate in the Project, they would have a better chance at ensuring that project
activities are culturally appropriate and effective.

Financial Management
China: Sustainable Forestry Development Project
A.     Background
1.     This report is the result of a financial management review and analysis of the Project as conducted
by Junxue Chu, Disbursement Specialist, EACCF in October 2000, to deternine whether the Project has in
place an adequate financial management system as required by the Bank OP/BP 10.02. The review was
performed in accordance with the following:
Guide for Review and Design of Accounting and Reporting System for World Bank Projects
(Prepared by Central Operational Services Unit, East Asia and Pacific Region, December 1997);
*      Review of Financial Management System as stipulated in Annex II of LACI Implementation
Handbook; and
Project Financial Management Manual issued by the Loan Department, February 1999.
2.     The review consequently included procedures as were considered necessary and appropriate to
Project's circumstances, including site visit, discussion and observation. Given that the Project covers 13
provinces, it is not possible to visit all project sites; instead, the task team has discussed and reviewed with
Project Management Center (PMC) of State Forestry Administration (SFA), Provincial Finance Bureaus
(FBs) and PMOs of Provincial Forestry Bureaus in Hainan and Hunan province, and Changjiang county
PMO of Hainan province about plans, procedures and guidelines for establishing a sound project financial
management system, inter alia, accounting system, staffing and training, internal controls, project
reporting, auditing and budgeting.
B.     Project Objective, Component, and Costs
3.     The project objective is to ensure that innovative management approaches are widely adopted in
selected natural forests, protected areas and plantation established to relieve pressures on forest resources
and to protect the natural environment. These new approaches developed and applied for the protection and
sustainable management of natural forest resources in pilot areas in China would provide models for wider
replication under the government Natural Forest Protection Program.
4.     The financing of the Project will be supported by IBRD (US$93.9 million) and Government
(US$93.8 million) for a  total  estimated project cost of (US$187.7 million) under  Plantation
Establishment Component; by GEF (US$16 million) and Government (US$6.85 million) for a total
estimated cost (US$22.85 million) under Protected Areas Management Component.
5.     According to Project Appraisal Document, the Project is comprised of the following components:
The Plantation Establishment Component (PE) includes: (a) establishment of commercial wood plantations
for fiber, pulp, plywood, and construction timber; (b) establishment of economic forest crops, including
fruit, nut and medicinal trees, bamboo, and rattan; (c) pre-commercial thinning of existing plantations to
demonstrate increase productivity and financial gains from proper thinning and tending; and (d) provision
of related technical support services such as planting stock development and nursery management, training
and extension, small-scale rural infrastructure required for afforestation and post-harvest treatment and
- 136-



marketing of horticultural crops, and monitoring and evaluation including environmental and social
parameters. The Protected Areas Management Component (PAM) includes: (i) participatory nature
reserves planning and management including management plan development and implementation,
strengthening of field-level management and targeted applied research; (ii) community-based nature
conservation including co-management activities that link biodiversity conservation with sustainable
income generation, energy conservation demonstration, wildlife management to reduce damage to local
community livelihoods, community conservation education and awareness, and delivery of sustainable
altematives and enhancement of community skills; (iii) training and capacity building to strengthen
institutions responsible for biodiversity conservation and management at the provincial and nature reserve
levels; and (iv) project management, monitoring and evaluation including key policy studies. The Natural
Forest Management Component will be financed by the European Union under its own guidelines. The
Project is comprised of the following disbursement categories. For PE--(a) plantation; (b) works; (c) goods
and vehicles, (d) consultant services, training, and study tours; and (e) market infrastructure subloans. For
PAM--(a) works, (b) goods and vehicles, (c) community conservation fund, (d) incremental operating costs,
(e) consultant services, and (f) research, training, plans and surveys.
C.     Organization of Project Financial Management
6.     State Forestry Administration (SFA) will assume overall responsibility for implementing and
monitoring the Project. The existing Project Management Center (PMC) under the SFA will oversee
project implementation for PE component and newly-established Project Office (PO) will oversee
implementation of the PAM component and both would be responsible for coordination between related
departnents of SFA and participating provinces. Project implementation will be undertaken by 13
provinces: Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Hainan, Sichuan, Gansu,
Guizhou, and Yunnan. For the PE component, Project Management Offices (PMOs) of Forestry Bureaus
(FB) at Provincial and County/Township levels will be responsible for overall project management in their
respective jurisdiction. For PAM component, the provincial Office of Wildlife and Plant Protection
(OWPP) and Nature Reserves would be responsible for overall project management under its own
jurisdiction.
7.     At the central level and provincial level, financial management and withdrawal processing for
PAM component will be handled by Central PO and provincial OWPPs. Qualified fmancial/accounting
staff for the PO and OWPPs are in place and have already received training. In addition, annual training
will be provided throughout life of the Project.
8.     Except for Gansu, provincial FB/PMOs have had prior experience with World Bank-financed
forestry projects and are familiar with both the Bank and MOF's requirements in preparation and
processing of withdrawal application and financial management of Bank-financed projects. However,
additional training will need to be provided to project staff at all levels, particularly the OWPPs and Nature
Reserves to enable the staff understand the financial arrangement of this Project.
D.     Loan/ GEF Grant Disbursement Arrangements
9.     The Project will be disbursing on the traditional disbursement techniques and will not be using
PMR-based disbursements, in accordance with the agreement between the Bank and Ministry of Finance
(MOF).
- 137 -



10.   It has been agreed that for the PE component to be financed using IBRD that one Special Accounts
will be set up with Ministry of Finance (MOF) to manage, monitor and maintain Special Account. The
MOF will reconcile the Special Account, check and monitor withdrawal applications and verify payment
requests in accordance with Bank requirements. PMC will review and consolidate reimbursement
applications from participating provinces before sending to MOF. Applications for withdrawal of loan
proceeds and replenishmnent of Special Account will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by MOF.
IBRD funds will flow from MOF to Provincial Finance Bureau, then to County Finance Bureau through
Prefecture Finance Bureau, and then to County PMO or Township Finance Station. The County PMO will
verify the accuracy and validity of expenses submitted, progress reported and prepare requests for
payment. The application will be further reviewed and approved by the County/Township FB before
submitting to a higher PMO for approval. Eventually the requests for payment will be submitted by MOF
to the Bank.
11.    For the PAM component to be financed by GEF Grant, one Special Account will be set up,
managed, monitored and maintained by the PO. PO will reconcile the Special Account, check withdrawal
applications and verify payment requests in line with Bank requirements. Applications for withdrawal of
Grant proceeds and replenishment of Special Account will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by PO.
The GEF funds will flow from PO to local project units--either provincial OWPPs or participating Nature
Reserves. The Nature Reserves will prepare requests for payment, and the requests will be reviewed by
provincial OWPP before submitting to the PO.
12.    Original invoices and supporting documents will be retained at point of initiation. PMC and PO,
and Provincial PMOs and OWPPs will retain copies of withdrawal applications and copies of key
supporting documents.
E. Financial and Accounting System
13.   In line with other Bank-financed projects in the People's Republic of China, the Project will follow
the Construction Accounting Standards issued by MOF as a basis for bookkeeping and preparation of
financial statements and project reports. These standards dictate the format of financial statements, Chart
of Accounts and related instructions which would therefore affect project accounting and reporting
requirements. For detailed reporting and accounting methods, MOF issued Document No. 13 in January
2000. This document was prepared by MOF with input by EACCF and in accordance with the agreement
on financial reporting reached between the Bank and MOF on 1998. Accrual accounting and double entry
basis will be adopted.
14.    Separate project accounts for PE and PAM components will be maintained by the County PMOs
and the participating Nature Reserves respectively, consolidated by provincial PMOs and OWPPs to arrive
at provincial project accounts. PMC/PO then further consolidate respective provincial project accounts to
form final project accounts. The consolidated financial report will be submitted by PMC/PO on a
semi-annual basis to the Bank, by September 30 and March 31, covering the first and second half of the
year, respectively.
F. Internal Controls
15.    A well designed internal control system is one of the key elements critical to the success of a
project. A Financial Management Manual (the Manual) will be prepared by the PMC. It was agreed that
each province will prepare, based on the instructions of PMC, its own manual with detailed financial
- 138 -



management procedures that are tailored to the specific circumstances of the province. The objective of the
Manuals developed by PMC and provinces are to provide operational procedures and guidelines for project
financial management, encompassing all levels of project management, such as:
*      Project financial management structure and staffing;
*      Job description of financial positions in PMO;
*      Identification of the accounting standards to be used by the Project and all the participating
agencies (e.g. tailored Chart of Accounts to project specifics and sample accounting treatments);
*      Key intemal control features such as a system of authorization, verification, reconciliation and
project reporting to provide adequate control over project costs, cash and asset management and
segregation of incompatible duties;
*      Reporting formats tailored to project specifics;
*      Procedures for disbursement and counterpart fund management;
*      Budgetary procedures; and
*      Auditing arrangements
The draft Manuals prepared by PMC was reviewed by the Bank at appraisal and found satisfactory.
G.       Staffing and Training
16.    The financial division with 5 staff is one of the 6 function divisions under PMC. All 5 staff have
strong financial management background and experience in previous and ongoing Bank-financed forestry
projects. The PMOs at provincial level except for Gansu have been in place for many years and the
financial and accounting staff have been working on existing projects and preparation of this Project.
Currently, Gansu provincial PMO has been established with financial staff appointed. In order to have a
sound financial management for the Project, it was agreed that each PMO at Provincial and County levels
and OWPP and Nature Reserve new to Bank project will be staffed with at least one project accountant
responsible for maintaining the project accounts and preparing financial statements, and one cashier
responsible for cash receipts and expenditures. Based on CVs provided prior to appraisal, adequate and
qualified financial/accounting staff have been properly recruited for the new PMO in Gansu, the provincial
OWPPs, the new county PMOs, and the Nature Reserves.
17.    The task team recommended that a well designed and focused training should be provided by PMC
before project effectiveness to ensure that staff understand financial management requirements. It is
suggested that this training should include such features as:
*      Bank procedures and the project financial management requirements on the withdrawal of Bank
funds;
*      Overview of the project financial statement formats;
*      Review of project Financial Management Systems Manual;
*      Procurement procedures;
*      Project audit requirements.; and
*      Accounting software and its applications
A comprehensive training program covering the above-mentioned areas has been developed by the PMC by
appraisal and found satisfactory. In addition, a financial management training session was held in
December 2000 for the PAM component. This provided opportunity for the Bank to evaluate the
qualification of the selected financial/accounting staff. Further training will take place at Project Launch
Workshop or prior to project effectiveness.

H. Project Reporting Requirements
18     The format and content of the following project financial statements represent the standard project
reporting package agreed to between the Bank and MOF, and have been discussed and agreed with all
parties concerned. The project financial statements for PE and PAM components respectively will be
submitted to the Bank on a semi-annual basis and include the following 4 statements:
*      Balance Sheet;
*      Summary of Sources and Uses of Funds by Project Component;
*      Statement of Implementation of Loan and Grant Agreements; and
*      Statement of Special Account
I. Audit Arrangements
19.    The Bank requires the Project financial statements audited in accordance with standards acceptable
to the Bank. In line with other Bank financed projects in China, the Project will be audited in accordance
with Government Auditing Standards of the People's Republic of China (1997 edition). The State Audit
Office has been identified as the auditors for the Project. Audit reports on annual project financial
statements of both PE and PAM components will be submitted to the Bank within 6 months after the end of
each calendar year, with a separate opinion on Statement of Expenditures and Special Account.
J. Budgeting
20.    Project budget will be prepared annually by the PMC and PO based on submissions prepared by
the Provincial PMOs and OWPPs. The budget prepared at each PMO will be submitted to the Finance
Bureau for approval at the same level. PMC and PO will consolidate budgets approved and submit for the
Bank review and approval by December 31 of each year.
K. Conclusion
21.    Pending addressing the issues outlined in the action plan in Attachment 1, the task team has
determined that the Project will satisfy the Bank's fnancial management requirements as required by
OP/BP 10.02. In the team's opinion, the Project will have in place an adequate project financial
management system that can provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the
status of the Project in the reporting format agreed with the project management office and as required by
the Bank.
