                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During the last six months, disbursement rate has increased from 50% to 68% and commitments currently stand at 98%. Based on the current implementation status on the ground,
                         the PDO is likely to be achieved. In spite of this steady progress, the overall project implementation rating has been downgraded from S to MS. This is attributed to (i) the delays
                         incurred in settling the payment of the counterpart funds for the FY 09 and FY 10 which caused suspension of infrastructure works for the first three quarters of the CY 2010, (ii) poor

                         allocated to investment program in their respective sectors and to be implemented through SMEs for the FY09 and FY10. This has led to a second project restructuring in March 2011
                         when funds were reallocated from component 3 (support to the development of local SMEs in the construction industry) to component 1 (community-based infrastructure upgrading in
                         low-income settlements).
                         The March 2011 mission confirmed a high demand of additional sub-project by beneficiaries and municipalities. The client and the Bank have agreed that a beneficiary assessment
                         survey be conducted before a possible additional financing to the current project is envisaged. The work was undertaken and the final report was completed on April 16, 2011. This
                         report has been shared with the client on April 18,2011.
