3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
3.1.1  Background. Pakistan's Irrigation system was originally built without provision for subsurface
drainage. With the expansion of the irrigation system the groundwater table rose graduaLly, and, by the
1950s, waterlogging and salinity became wide spread in the Indus basin. To control these "twin menaces",
the government embarked upon a series of salinity control and reclamation projects (SCARPs), under
which over 12,000 public tubeweLls were instaUled to lower the groundwater table. Besides providing
subsurface drainage relief, in fresh groundwater (FGW) areas, the SCARP tubeweLls (STWs) became an
important source of supplementary irrigation. While the SCARPs were generally successful in alleviating
waterlogging, their performance declined over time due to poor management and inadequate operation and
maintenance (O&M). Because of low cost recovery, the O&M cost became unsustainable for the
Government. The STWs preempted over fifty percent of the Irrigation Department's O&M budget,
resulting in under-funding of the O&M of the surface irrigation system.
While the performance of SCARPs declined, their demonistrative effect resulted in a boom of private
tubewells (PTWs). Encouraged by the growth of PTWs and their contribution to subsurface drainage, in
early 1980s, the government adopted a policy of discontinuing further public sector investments in
SCARPs and dis-investing STWs, in FGW areas. The disinvestment of STWs was termed as "SCARP
Transition". Modes of disinvestment of STWs included: (i) transfer to farmers; and (ii) replacement with
PTWs. A SCARP Transition Pilot Project was initiated in Punjab with IDA assistance in 1986. The pilot
project successfully demonstrated that: (i) it was technicaLly, socially, and politically feasible to close down
the highly subsidized STWs, if appropriate incentives were provided to install PTWs with preference given
to small farmers; and (ii) the water table can be maintained at appropriate levels by PTWs, even though
farmers pump groundwater primarily to meet irrigation requirements. The pilot project was followed by a
Second SCARP Transition Project under which some 1,350 STWs in Punjab and 382 in Sindh were
dis-invested. This project also pilot tested the concept of replacing public tubewells with community
tubewells (CTWs) owned and operated by farmer groups, instead of individually owned private tubewells.
It also highlighted the need for developing a groundwater regulatory framework to curb the emerging
anarchic growth of PTWs and protect FGW resources from saLine intrusion. The objectives and design of
the Punjab Private Sector Groundwater Development Project evolved from the experience gained from
these projects.
3.1.2 Original Objective. The overall project objective was to increase the scope and productivity of
Punjab's irrigation and drainage subsector and increase farmer's incomes. Its specific objectives were to:
(a) redefine Government's role in groundwater development and provide assistance to facilitate change; (b)
develop a monitoring program and regulatory framework to ensure sustainable use of the groundwater
resources; (c) develop sustainable farmer organizations (FOs) which can efficiently operate and maintain
groundwater irrigation, improve surface irrigation and establish a base for participation in the management
of canal systems; (d) increase beneficiaries' incomes and alleviate poverty; (e) rationalize pubLic
expenditure on O&M of the irrigation and drainage systems as weLl as increase the recovery of pubLic
expenditures on irrigation infrastructure; and (f) avoid environmental hazard of saline water intrusion into
FGW aquifers.
3.1.3 The project objectives, while being somewhat ambitious, were clear and in line with Government's
priorities and the Bank's country assistance and sector strategy, that seek to reduce poverty. Although the
objectives were somewhat complex in that they required coordinated efforts by various agencies, they were
within their demonstrated capacity and an effective mechanism for coordination was included in the project
design.

3.2 Revised Objective:
Although, during implementation, modifications were made in the project components and targets, based on
field investigations and environmental assessments, the objectives remained unchanged.
3.3 Original Components:
3.3.1  The main project components were: (a) disinvestment of SCARP tubewells (about 4,233); (b)
development of a groundwater monitoring program and regulatory framework; (c) improvement of
irrigation facilities in FGW areas; (d) prevention of saline groundwater intrusion into fresh aquifers; (e)
monitoring and impact evaluation; and (f) project management, technical assistance and training of staff
and farmers. The project area included SCARPs II, HI (Rangpur Unit), IV, and V (see map). The gross
project area is approximately 1.450 million ha, of which about 1.3 million ha are commanded by canals.
3.4 Revised Components:
Based on implementation experience, the following modifications were made in the project scope & targets:
(i) in addition to STWs in FGW areas, some 600 public irrigation tubewells were also included for
disinvestment; (ii) the scope of the canal rehabilitation component was increased, while the number of
watercourses to be improved was decreased; (iii) the canal lining component was restricted to areas with
relatively high seepage losses; (iv) the scope of productivity enhancement measures was increassed; (v) a
modest gender component was included in the project; and (vi) one of the sub-components for preventing
saline groundwater intrusion in FGW (drainage tubewells) was dropped due to technical, environmental
and sustainability concerns.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
3.5.1  Marginally Satisfactory. The project was consistent with Government priorities and the Bank's
country assistance and sector strategies that seek to reduce poverty through, inter alia, enhancing
productivity, and redefining the roles of public and private sectors in groundwater management. The
project was designed on the basis of experience gained from the earlier SCARP Transition projects.
Alternative approaches to dis-investing STWs were analyzed, including the option of simply closing down
these tubewells and letting the natural growth of private tubewells replace the public tubewells. This "do
nothing" option was however, discarded, because of three reasons: (i) possible political backlash due to
sudden withdrawal of subsidy on groundwater irrigation without providing any compensation; (ii) possible
adverse impact on small farmers who cannot afford to install PTWs on their own. In this context, physical
and social constraints to the development of water market from tubewells, and the failure of institutional
credit systems in targeting smiall farmers were highlighted; and (iii) possible adverse impact on agricultural
production in case the natural growth; of PTWs were to be slower than the pace of closure of STWs. The
main thrust of the project design was on: (a) transferring the responsibility of development of liesh
groundwater resources and the existing stock of public tubewells to local communities, while enhancing
government focus on the sustainability of groundwater use through monitoring and developing a framework
for regulation; (b) mainstreaming the concept of community tubewells by establishing FOs who could more
efficiently utilize groundwater resources, and provide social capital for participating in the management of
the surface irrigation system, as well; (c) increasing incomes through improved and more equitable access
of small farmers to groundwater; (d) rationalizing public sector expenditures in the sector by phasing out
completely capital cost subsidies for individually owned private tubewells, and redirecting resources
released from the public tubewells for improved O&M of the neglected surface irrigation and drainage
system. The project design complied with Bank's safeguard policies.
3.5.2  But for the following shortcomings the quality at entry would have been rated as fully satisfactory.
Firstly, in hindsight, the objective ol developing and implementing a groundwater regulatory framework
- 3-



within the project life was somewhat overly ambitious, considenng the complex issues of: political
economy; the anarchic mushrooming of small capacity PTWs in the past; the high dependence of
agriculture and rural livelihood on groundwater; the absence of sufficient number of effective FOs to
preclude the high administrative cost of groundwater regulation through public sector agencies; and the
time required to pilot test, and, ultimately, enact necessary legislation for groundwater regulation.
Experience elsewhere indicates that the formulation of a Govemment policy on groundwater resources, the
adoption of a legislative instrument giving effect to such policy, and its implementation and administration
on the ground are long-term tasks, exceeding the life span of most projects. While the project succeeded in
developing and initiating pilot testing of a draft regulatory framework, further work on actual legislation
and its mainstreaming had to be passed on to the ongoing National Drainage Program (NDP) project.
Secondly, in the absence of historical data on changes in groundwater levels and quality, and the
interspersed nature of saline-fresh groundwater interface in Punjab, there was insufficient time in the
project to monitor, rigorously design, and implement one of the components for preventing saline
groundwater intrusion that envisaged installation of saline drainage tubewells. Data required for this
purpose would become available after a few years of systematic and intensive monitoring. Finally, the
project was overly ambitious in enhancing the requirement of cost sharing by farmers. Under earlier
projects farmers paid 25% cost of watercourse materials in 4 biannual installments. This project required
farrners- to pay 30% of the cost of materials up-front & an additional 45% in 6 installments over 3 years.
Although the cost sharing levels were rationalized during the mid-term review (MTR), the targets for
watercourse improvement had to be substantially reduced, due to low progress during the first 2 years.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Despite a substantial reduction in civil works, the overall project objective has been largely achieved with
satisfactory results on the ground. The overall project outcome is satisfactory. The status of achievement
of the project's specific objectives is summarized below.
(i)    The objective of redefining Government's role in groundwater development is already largely
achieved. All public tubewells in the project area have been successfully dis-invested. These included over
4,253 dual-purpose irrigation/drainage SCARP Tubewell (STWs) and over 400 irrigation tubewells.
These public tubewells have been replaced by new farmer owned community tubewells (CTWs), or taken
over as such by farmer groups. This is a major land mark for the water sector in Punjab. It represents
successful implementation of government policy of transferring the responsibility of development of fresh
groundwater resources and the existing stock of public tubewells to the private sector. Role of the public
sector is now focussed on the sustainability of groundwater use through monitoring and implementing a
framework for regulation.
(ii)   The objective of preparing a groundwater-monitoring program and a regulatory framework
has already been partially achieved and stage has been set for fully achieving this objective. A province
wide groundwater monitoring program has been developed. Areas requiring "groundwater management",
including "critical areas" have been identified. A network of piezometers (observation points) has been
installed, with a higher density in "critical" areas. A GIS database of Punjab's groundwater resources and
surface irrigation system has been prepared, and mathematical groundwater models have been developed.
A groundwater monitoring cell has been established and is being strengthened. An international workshop
on groundwater regulation held by the project, helped to focus government attention to developing a policy
for groundwater management and regulation. A draft groundwater regulatory framework has been
prepared based on extensive analysis of hydrogeological, political economy and legal aspects of
groundwater regulation. Pilot testing has been initiated in one "critical area" where groundwater table had
-4-



receded below 50 feet. A comprehensive report has been prepared documenting: (i) the outcomes of
groundwater regulation work/analysis completed; (ii) identification of policy and legislative options that
could ultimately form the basis of enacting a groundwater regulatory framework; (iii) assessment of
alternative institutional and implementation arrangements for groundwater regulation; and (iv) a road map
for ultimately introducing a regulatory framework, including further pilot testing to be continued under the
NDP project
(iii)  The objective of developing sustainable farmer organizations (FOs) has been generally met. A
large number of FOs have been established, including about 7,000 community tubewell (CTW) groups,
2,000 water user associations (WUAs) at watercourse level, and 13 federations of WUAs at
distributary/minor canal level. The CTW Groups include primarily small farmers, with holdings less than
5 ha (12.5 acres). A systematic capacity building and after-care program for CTWs Groups has been
completed. Besides being fully responsible for O&M of the CTWs, the CTW Groups are also engaged in
productivity enhancement activities, including land leveling, improved water management and introduction
of higher value crops. In the "critical" groundwater management areas, where pilot testing of groundwater
regulation has been initiated, the CTW Groups are participating in groundwater monitoring as well.
Ultimately they are likely to have an important role in the implementation of groundwater regulation.
Self-monitoring by local communities/FOs and "social recharge" (voluntary reduction in groundwater
pumping) would be important elements of groundwater regulation. Case studies conducted by the project
impact evaluation consultants have classified over 85 percent of the CTW Groups as being "successful" to
varying degrees, with reasonable prospects of sustainability. The quality of FOs generally reflected the
quality of social mobilization and capacity building efforts. The WUAs established at watercourse level
have already played their traditional role of organizing farmer cash and labor contribution for physical
improvements and would continue to be responsible for O&M of watercourses. The FOs at the canal level,
played a similar role in mobilizing farmer cash contribution and supervising canal lining works. While
these latter FOs are, as yet, not mandated to be responsible for canal O&M and water distribution, they
have the potential for taking over this responsibility.
(iv)   The objective of increasing farm incomes and alleviating poverty is being achieved, reflecting
improved access to groundwater, as well as the impact of surface irrigation system improvement. While the
full benefits of project interventions,;particularly those relating to watercourse and canal improvements will
become fully evident over time, cropping intensities, yields and net crop incomes have already shown
substantial increases. Annual cropping intensity has increased by 7.1%, and yields by: 20% for wheat,
4.5% for Basmati paddy, 17% for cotton and 11% for sugarcane as compared to the baseline (1997/98).
Annual incremental production attributable to the project is estimated at 281,000 tons of wheat, 6,000 tons
of cotton, and 150,000 tons of Basrnati paddy at full development. Additional farm employment generated
by the increased agricultural activities is estimated at 11 million work days per year. Net farm incomes are
estimated to have increased by Rs 7,600 to Rs 8,400 for small farms (2.5 ha) and by Rs 25,400 to Rs
30,600 for large farms (10 ha). (See Annex 3).
(v)    The objective of rationalizing pubUc expenditure on O&M and increasing the recovery of
public expenditures on irrigation infrastructure has been largely achieved. With the disinvestment of
STWs, O&M expenditures on SCARPs have declined from Rs 1.6 billion in FY97 to Rs 0.957 billion in
FY02. Had the STWs not been dis-invested, the annual O&M cost of SCARPs in FY02 would have been
more than Rs 2 billion. The actual annual saving in government O&M cost is thus more than Rs I billion.
This saving is available for the O&M of the surface irrigation and drainage system. Further savings of the
order Rs 0.24 billion would accrue once GOPunjab addresses the issue of 5,000 redundant tubewell
operators who are still on the government payroll. GOPunjab has decided to address this issue through
natural attrition. A significant break-through has been made in introducing up-front cost sharing by
-5-



farmers for capital cost of watercourse improvements as well as canal lining. Farmers paid 42% of the
CTWs cost, and 10% of canal lining costs. In addition, they paid up-front, 30% of cost of materials and all
skilled and unskilled labor cost for watercourse improvement. For watercourses, the total contribution by
farmers was over 55% of the cost - up from 45% in the past. For canal lining, it was the first time ever in
Punjab that farmers contributed to capital costs. Overall, farmers contributed about US$7 million
equivalent (or 21%) of the total project cost of US$33.5 million.
(vi)   The objective of preventing intrusion of saline groundwater into FGW areas is likely to be
partially met. While water quality monitoring does not indicate significant changes in water salinity in the
FGW areas adjoining SGW area, more intensive monitoring over a longer period is needed before
conclusions could be drawn. The project interventions for reducing seepage from canals and watercourses
in SGW areas are contributing to this objective, by reducing recharge. The NDP project will identify other
solutions to saline intrusion problems, including balancing groundwater abstraction in FGW and SGW
areas, through biological drainage (tree plantation) and promotion of Halophytes (salt tolerant crops).
4.2 Outputs by components:

and performance of each project component are summarized below.
4.2.2 Disinvestment of SCARP tubewells (STWs). The performance and achievement of this key
project component is highly satisfactory. It comprised disinvestment of 4,233 STWs, through one of the
following three "modes of transition": (a) decommissioning of STWs and replacement by new community
tubewells (CTWs), jointly installed by FOs (farmers groups, consisting of at least 33% of the farmers who
used to receive water from the public tubewells); (b) transfer of STWs bore-holes and electric hookups to
FOs for installation of CTWs; and (c) transfer of operational STWs, as such, to FOs for continued
operation as CTWs. The government provided a grant of Rs 30,000 per CTW for transition under mode
(a) and Rs 20,000 under mode (b). For the transition under mode (c), FOs paid a token price of Rs 10,000
per STW transferred. Altogether some 4,253 STWs and some 400 irrigation tubewells were dis-invested
under these three modes of transition, with 83% under mode (a), 11% under mode (b), and 6% under mode
(c). Transition under mode (a) proved to be the most popular among farmers as a large percentage of the
STWs were non-operational. Mode (b) was impeded by the delays by the Punjab Irrigation Department
(PID) in vacating bore-holes of STWs for installation of CTWs by FOs. Mode (c) was the most
challenging in terms of social mobilization, as larger groups of farmers had to be mobilized to take over
operational STWs. Moreover, there were procedural difficulties in transfer of titles of the electric hook-ups
to FOs. These issues were ultimately overcome and mode (c) became the dominant mode of transition
during the last year of implementation, particularly for the transition of irrigation tubewells.
About 7,000 potentially viable FOs (CTW Groups) have been established through a structured program of
social mobilization. These FOs have established a similar number of CTWs. The CTWs have adequately
substituted for the STWs - more than 50% of the farmers who used to receive water from STWs are the
direct beneficiaries of CTWs, as FO members. Farmers who did not formally join FOs also benefitted
indirectly as they could buy water from CTWs in their vicinity. The main beneficiaries of the CTWs are
small farmers - over 93% of the FO members are small farmers with holdings less than 12.5 acres (5 ha).
An "after-care" (capacity building) program was implemented to train FOs in operation and maintenance
(O&M) of tubewells, book keeping, tubewell water management, productivity enhancement, dispute
resolution, etc.

Staff who were expected to become redundant as a result of the disinvestment of STWs, were to be
re-trained, offered alternative employment in Government or provided incentives/severance benefits to leave
service voluntarily. Approximately 5,000 staff (mostly tubewell operators) became redundant.
Approximately 1,900 staff were trained in various trades. Severance packages, were prepared but
GOPunjab decided not to implement them - because of high cash flow requirements and political
considerations- and to let natural attrition address this issue. Substantial funds (US$ 8 Million) allocated
for severance packages remained unutilized.
4.2.3.1 Development of a Groundwater Monitoring Program. The performance of this project
component is satisfactory. In the past, groundwater monitoring was carried out by the SCARP lMonitoring
Organization (SMO) of WAPDA, focussing on areas with shallow water tables, where SCARPs had been
implemented or were being planned. Besides the SMO, numerous other agencies were involved in
monitoring water table depths and quality. However, there was little coordination in the design of
monitoring programs and data sharing. The project coordinated these monitoring efforts and developed a
monitoring program covering the entire province. Noteworthy features of this monitoring program are:
* Establishment of a Groundwater Monitoring Cell (GMC), in the Irrigation Research Institute, equipped
with necessary hardware and software, and training of staff in groundwater modeling and GIS.
Besides monitoring and forecasting emerging trends in groundwater levels and quality, the cell is
mandated to be the anchor and advocate for future work on the implementation of groundwater
regulation framework (GRF) in Punjab. The GMC is gradually acquiring expertise in various
disciplines, including: Groundwater/hydrogeology, Water Resources Management, Water and Soil
Quality, Environment, Groundwater modeling, Groundwater Regulation, Agricultural Economics and
GIS.
* Coverage of the entire province by a network of piezometers (observation points), with intensive
monitoring of "critical areas".
* Preparation of a GIS database for groundwater as surface water facilities, utilizing available historical
data.
* Notification of a Groundwater Monitoring Coordination Group (GMCG) comprising
representatives of key agencies/entities involved in groundwater monitoring to help coordinate and
promote data sharing amongst agencies.
4.2.3.2 Development of Groundwater Regulatory Framework (GRF). The perfornance of this project
component is satisfactory. Groundwater meets approximately 60% of Punjab's irrigation requirements. As
a consequence of the anarchic growth of private tubewells -whose number now exceeds 500,000 in
Punjab- many areas that were previously waterlogged are now witnessing falling, rather than rising, water
tables, indicating that abstraction is beginning to exceed safe yields of aquifers. The problem is
exacerbated by the uneven and inequitable supplies of canal water. Head reaches of canals draw more than
their share, which results in higher recharge of groundwater and lower demand for groundwater.
Conversely, the tail reaches do not receive their due share, which results in lower recharge and a higher
demand for groundwater in these areas. It was in this complex rural environment that the project set out to
develop and implement a GRF. While a GRF remains to be enacted and operationalized, the building
blocks for achieving that end result have been accomplished. The main achievements of this component to
date include:
(i)    Completion of extensive analysis on the key elements of GRF, including: (a) the institutional
aspects and implementation options, and technical underpinnings of each option, including mathematical
groundwater modeling; (b) the legal and legislative foundations, including draft Groundwater MWanagement
Rules made under the authority of the PIDA Act 1997; (c) the political economy aspects that highlight the
- 7 -



socioeconomic issues, which will need to be addressed in the course of a public policy debate which would
inform and underpin the shape and direction of the eventual GRF opted for by GOPunjab; (d) a
comprehensive report for a future GRF for Punjab that summarizes the analysis, findings and
recommendations of the analytical work and pilot testing carried out so far, and the way forward; and (e)
organization of an international workshop on GRF.
(ii) Pilot testing of GRF, including a public information campaign, intensive monitoring of tubewell
utilization rates, and preparation of inventory of tubewells in one critical area, where the water table was
falling progressively. [Farmers either had to deepen their tubewells or lose access to groundwater. There
were fears that ultimately only the more affluent farmers would be able to maintain access when the water
table goes beyond the reach of simple technology (centrifugal type pumps), requiring more expensive
technology (turbine or submersible type pumps)]. A key finding of pilot testing is that GWR needs to
approached in a holistic manner and the following issues addressed: (a) inequities of surface water
distribution; (b) ownership of local govemments as well as affected conmnunities; (c) need for changing
cropping patterns; (d) altemative means of incomes for communities who would need to reduce their
reliance on groundwater, and (e) targeting poverty alleviation programs to "critical areas".
(iii)  Establishment of a Steering Committee headed by the Planning and Development Board which
would be the "champion" for further work on the GRF to be carried out under the NDP Project. The GRF
Steering Committee is mandated to: (a) ensure continuation of further work on the GRF, including pilot
testing, infornation dissemination and a public debate on GRF; and (b) eventually, to seek adoption by
GOPunjab of a policy for management of Punjab's groundwater resources and promulgation of
Rules/Regulations for groundwater regulation, through amendments to the PIDA Act, or a new legislation.
4.2.4 Improvement of Irrigation Facilities in Fresh Groundwater (FGW) Areas. This comnponent
was designed to mitigate possible impact of disinvestment of STWs on irrigation water availability and
promote conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water. It included : (a) watercourse renovation to
improve conveyance efficiencies; and (ii) rehabilitation of canals to ensure reliable surface supplies. As
summarized below, the performance of this component ranged from marginally satisfactory (watercourse
renovation) to satisfactory (canal rehabilitation). On balance it was marginally satisfactory.
4.2.4.1 Renovation of Watercourses. The original project target was to renovate 1,500
watercourses belonging to those FOs/CrWs Groups who attained a degree of maturity (to be demonstrated
by successfully operating CTWs for one year), and contribute a major portion (77% in real terms) of the
capital cost (30% of cost of materials up-front, 45% in installments over 3 years, and all skilled and
unskilled labor cost). Criteria for prioritizing renovation of watercourses were also specified in terms of
the extent of area served, number of beneficiaries, and willingness to contribute to cost up-front. This was
the first time ever that farmers were required to contribute to cost of materials up-front. In all previous
watercourse irnprovement projects, farmer contribution to cost of materials was far less (25% in 4
installments over two years). The requirements of up-front cost contribution was introduced due to poor
past performance on recoveries in installments and the high cost of the recovery operations. The project's
new requirements, however, proved overly onerous not only for the farmers but also for project staff, who
had to put in extra efforts to mobilize farmer participation. Another factor which adversely affected this
component was the nonuniformiity of cost sharing requirements under various ongoing projects. The
combined effect of all these factors was that little progress was made on this component during the first two
years. The resulting low disbursements and the overall weak project management performance at that
stage, earned the project the flag of being "at risk". The up-front cost sharing requirements were lowered
during the mid-term review (MTR) to 30% of materials cost, but the watercourse improvement target had
to be reduced from 1,500 to 1200 watercourses, reflecting low progress in the first two years. Progress
-8 -



picked up visibly following this change. Subsequently, management performance also improved, bringing
the project out of the risk category. Towards the end of the project other adverse factor came into play.
Staff motivation and morale suffered a major set-back due to uncertainty of GOPunjab's policy regarding
contract staff. Most field staffwere contract employees. They feared that they would be laid offafter
project completion, instead of being absorbed as regular staff. Ultimately the project achieved a target of
935 watercourses renovated, but with a lower percentage of lining than the 15% originally envisaged.
Notwithstanding the design and implementation problems, this component made a breakthrough in
ultimately gaining farmer acceptance of up-front sharing of capital cost.
4.2.4.2 Rehabilitation of Canal Structures. This component was slow to take off but gradually
gained momentum. The PID field offices were slow in identifying and preparing schemes. However,
progress gradually improved and ultimately exceeded original targets. Rehabilitation works were identified
in consultation with local communities after joint walk-throughs. Most works implemented were of a low
cost nature (Rs 200 per acre of canal commanded area, 1996 prices), and included repair of regulator gates
and diversion structures, up-stream and downstream protection of structures, channel side protection, cattle
crossings and cattle ghats (cattle drinking water points), and restoration of weak sections of channel banks
and berms. Restoration of outlets and de-silting were carried out outside the project, with the assistance of
the anny. Good environmental practices were folowed during implementation of works, such as avoiding
cutting of trees on canal banks & berms. Despite the scattered location of works, the quality was generally
satisfactory. Some low quality works were detected during supervision missions and remedial actions
were implemented. Scheme completion reports documented visible improvements in the delivery of water
to tail reaches of canals. Useful lessons are expected to be leamed through continued monitoring of the
cattle ghats which have been consb ucted with the objective of minimizing damage to earthen canals caused
by cattle trespassing. This is a major O&M issue in Punjab.
4.2.5 Prevention of Saline Groumdwater (SGW) Intrusion into Fresh Groundwater (FGCW)
Aquifers. As explained below, the performance of various sub-components of this project intervention is
mixed, but marginally satisfactory on balance. In Punjab, the quality of groundwater is generally good in
areas along the major rivers (salinity levels below 1,000 mg/litre) but salinity levels gradually increase with
increasing distance from the rivers. Areas in the middle of doabs (land between two rivers) generally have
saline groundwater with salt contents exceeding 2,000 mg per litre. Most private tubewells are
concentrated in the FGW areas, although their numbers are gradually increasing in the marginal quality
groundwater areas also. Public tubewells installed in the past for providing subsurface drainage in saline
areas have mostly gone out of operation because of poor management and lack of maintenance.
Consequently, groundwater levels are shallower in SGW areas than the adjoining FGW areas and intrusion
of saline groundwater is occuring. However, because of lack of adequate monitoring in the past, the
interface between SGW areas and FGW areas is not well delineated. Saline and FGW areas are
interspersed/intermingled and the extent and rate of intrusion are not precisely known. The project was to
address the issue of saline intrusion through two types of interventions: (i) installation of about 35 drainage
tubewells, to create a "hydrological cut-off' (or barrier) to stop SGW from entering the adjoining FGW
areas; and (ii) reducing groundwater recharge (or drainable surplus)in SGW areas to help lower the
groundwater table by cutting down seepage losses from canals and watercourses through lining. The
performance of these sub-component§ is discussed below.
4.2.5.1 Drainage Tubewells. During project preparation this sub-component was prepared up to
concept level. Preparation of detailed design was undertaken during project implementation and included
hydrogeological investigations, resistivity surveys and social and environmental assessment. Based on the
findings of this work, this sub-component was dropped because of the following reasons: (i) Impact on the
River Jehlum: The proposed drainage tubwells were to discharge highly saline effluent into existing surface
-9-



drains that fall into the river Jehlum. Environmental assessment of this arrangement demonstrated that the
proposed tubewells would add approximately 180 tons of salt per day to the river that would increase
downstream river water salinity levels by 4%, during the lowest flow periods. While this increase in
salinity would have been tolerable, the cumulative impact of other drainage interventions in the pipeline
under other projects would have been unacceptable from the view point of downstream water users; (ii)
Questionable Efficacy: As the FGW and SGW areas are intermingled, the fresh-saline interface could not
be clearly delineated even through resistivity surveys. The likely efficacy of the tubewells was thus
questionable; (iii) Uncertainties of O&M loomed large: Most public tubewells installed in the past for
drainage in SGW have gradually gone out of operation because of poor management and lack of
maintenance. Farmers had little interest in taking over O&M responsibility of such tubewells, particularly
in areas where the lands were not waterlogged and they did not see immediate benefits of their operation.
Efforts were made to mobilize farmer participation in the O&M, but without success; farmers agreed to
perform a "watch and ward" function, but no more. It was, therefore, feared that the proposed tubewells
would meet the same fate as the other public tubewells installed for drainage in SGW areas, in the past.
While this sub-component was dropped, an important lesson was learned that non-engineering solutions
need to befound to address the problem of intrusion, including saline agriculture and biological
drainage. The issue is being further studied under the NDP project, which is reviewing various options for
meeting drainage needs in saline groundwater areas in an environmentally safe and sustainable manner.
4.2.5.2 Reducing Seepage from Channels in SGW Areas. This included lining of small canals
and watercourses. Performance of both these sub-components is satisfactory, as explained below.
4.2.5.2.1      Canal Improvement/Lining. This sub-component included lining of
distributary and minor caials with discharges less than 100 cusecs, in areas with high seepage rates or
where risks of channel breaches were high (e.g. channels built on earthen embankments across low lying
areas). Seepage tests revealed that far fewer channels, than anticipated at appraisal, would justify lining.
FOs were established, on the channels where seepage rates warranted lining, through an intensive social
mobilization program. Water user associations (WUAs) were established at each watercourse (tertiary
channel) which were then federated into FOs at the distributary/minor level. Initial farmer response was
slow, as the project required substantial contribution to capital cost (5% up-front and an additional 50% in
instalments over 8 years), which was unprecedented in Pakistan. During the MTR, total cost recovery
requirements were lowered (10% of the cost up-front, with no further recovery in installments). The
demand for canal lining witnessed a sharp rise after the completion of the first scheme for lining, when the
benefits of lining became apparent to farners. During the last year of implementation, farmers from
numerous distributary canals deposited their up-front contribution with PID. Many of these channels were
located in areas where seepage rates were not high, but the channels were prone to breaches. Altogether
13 channels were lined under the project, with most of the work taking place during the last year of project
inplementation. The remaining schemes have been earmarked for implementation as part of the NDP
project. Based on estimates of seepage losses curtailed it is estimated that this component will result in
lowering of groundwater table in the vicinity of the channels by about 0.2 feet-0.8 feet annually. This
would contribute to preventing saline intrusion.
4.2.5.2.2       Lining of Watercourses. This sub-component faced the same issues as
the lining of watercourses in FGW areas (para 4.2.4.1). During the MTR, watercourse improvement target
was reduced from 500 to 310. By the end of the project, 280 watercourses were lined, but with lower
percentage of lining than originally envisaged. Project impact evaluation studies observed that water tables
in the areas where watercourses were lined were lower by 1 foot than areas served by unlined watercourses,
providing empirical evidence that this component would contribute to preventing SGW intrusion.

4.2.6 Productivity Enhancement. Demonstration of good on-farm water management and agronomic
practices has been an integral part of watercourse improvement programs in Punjab. The project originally
provided for 12,500 acres of land leveling, and 25 demonstration centers. During the MTR the scope of this
component was expanded. By the end of the project, 65 demonstration centers had been established and
22,246 acres of land were leveled using laser guided levelers. Notable achievement in introducing other
"resource conservation technologies" included introduction of zero tillage for wheat sowing (afler paddy
crop) over more than 60,000 acres at over 2,800 sites. This technology is yielding high returns. Its
adoption is expected to take off as zero tillage drills are now being manufactured in Punjab and availability
is expected to improve as local equipment rental outfits add this equipment to their fleets.
4.2.7  Gender Component. Originally the project did not include an explicit component for addressing
gender issues. During the MTR a modest gender component was included in the project with the following
limited objectives: (i) to identify and understand the areas of irrigation & agriculture related activities in
which women's participation can be made more effective and replicated; and (ii) to enhance the
sustainability of FOs through women's participation. An un-stated, but important objective, of the PMU,
however, was to make a break with the past track record of irrigation and drainage projects in Punjab of
by-passing gender issues in project design. A local NGO with gender experience in rural areas of Punjab
was selected to lead this effort. Female social organizers were added to the, until then, all-male, social
mobilization teams to better integrate women's perspectives in establishment of FOs/CTW Groups. Specific
activities undertaken included efforts to empower women by: raising incomes through skill development
and self-employment; promoting linkages with sources of information and micro-credit; involving women in
decisions regarding location of community tubewells and irrigation structures used primarily by women
(washing and cattle water points); and increasing awareness to environment, particularly local sanitation
and hygiene and pollution problems. Over 160 training sessions were held, including subjects such as
appropriate technology, livestock and poultry, "Effective Micro-organisms"(EM) technology, raushroom
cultivation, etc. By the end of the project, over 100 informal women organizations (WOs), had been
established. Monitoring studies indicated that incomes of members of WOs, who had received training in
poultry and other skills, increased by Rs 200 to Rs 800 per month. Some 6,000 women benefitted from
this training. Another interesting finding was that some of the WOs contributed to conflict resolution
among members of FOs/CTW Groups. While the overall outcome of this component is modest, this was
expected, considering that it had a very limited implementation period. Even though it was agreed to, in
principle, during the MTR, by the time an NGO was selected and fielded, the project was already in its
final year of implementation. Nevertheless, the inclusion of this component has created a goodl precedent
for the future.
4.2.8 Monitoring and Impact Evaluation. The performance of this project component is satisfactory.
Besides monitoring implementation progress, it included monitoring and evaluation of socioeconomic and
agricultural impact. A joint venture of consulting firms was hired for the latter. Besides baseline and
biannual crop surveys, several case studies were undertaken, including performance of FOs, impact of land
leveling, capacity building/after-care; and gender programs. In addition, the "critical groundwater areas"
where pilot testing of groundwater regulation was carried out, were also monitored. The monitoring
program was rigorously designed and efficiently implemented. A computerized database was established
which facilitated retrieval and analysis of data. Use of remote sensing for crop surveys, however, got
bogged down in procurement delays and did not materialize. Overall, this component provided useful
independent feed back to the project implementing agencies as well as Bank missions. For example, based
on monitoring feed back, adjustments were made in the approach to social mobilization and criteria for
targeting land leveling operations on small landholdings.
4.2.9 Technical Assistance. The performance of this component is satisfactory. A joint venture of
-I1 -



consulting firms was selected to provide services for community development and support (social
mobilization and capacity building), engineering services for design, procurement assistance, construction
supervision of canal and watercourse works, developing a groundwater monitoring program and regulatory
framework, and prevention of saline groundwater intrusion. The consultants played a key role in improving
compliance with agreed procurement procedures as well as in contract management.
4.2.10 Training. The performance of this component is satisfactory. Training was carried out in two
broad categories: (i) Farner Training: this included training of FOs/CTW Groups, particularly the
executive members, in tubewell operation and maintenance; book keeping; productivity enhancement
through improved water management, good agronomic practices, new technology; and dispute resolution.
Over 22,000 male farners and 6,000 women were trained by the project consultants and NGO. The
Directorate General of Water Management (DGWM) trained an additional 8,700 farmers and some 400
field staff in similar disciplines; (ii) Training of Redundant SCARP Staff: About 1,900 persons received
training at private training outfits in various vocations, including motor vehicle driving, electricians, vehicle
repair mechanics, and computer hardware and software, etc.
4.2.11 Project Management. The overall performance of this component is satisfactory. Originally the
project management unit (PMU) was placed in the Planning and Development (P&D) Department to
facilitate coordination among the two principal implementing agencies, the Agriculture, and Irrigation
Departments. However, during implementation, at the request of the P&D Department, the PMU was
shifted to the Irrigation Department Even though Agriculture Department had some apprehensions that
this change might affect the "neutral" character of the PMU, the changed arrangement worked without
major issues.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
At appraisal, the overall economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated at 24%. The ERR of project
components were estimated at 19% for tubewell disinvestment, and 26% for surface irrigation system
improvement The re-estimated ERR at completion is 29% for the overall project; 16% for tubewell
disinvestment; and 33.5% for surface irrigation improvemnent (with 27% for canal rehabilitation 14% for
canal lining, and 38% for watercourse improvement). Annex 3 includes further details & sensitivity
analysis.
4.4 Financial rate ofreturn:
The SAR did not estimate retums to farmer equity in CTWs, canal lining and watercourse improvements.
Farmers contributed about 42% of cost of CTWs, 10% of cost of canal lining and 55% of the cost of
watercourse improvement. The financial internal rate of return on farmer's equity is estimated at 62% for
canal lining and 77% for watercourse improvement.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Besides establishing a large number of potentially viable FOs (see pam 4.1), the project also contributed to
institutional development within the implementing agencies. Notable contributions include: (i)
establishment of a Groundwater Monitoring Cell in PID/PIDA and a GIS database for Punjab's
groundwater and surface water resources; (ii) establishment of a forum for coordinating work of various
agencies involved in groundwater monitoring; (iii) establishment of a Steering Committee in the Planning
& Development Department for overseeing further work on GRF; (iv) adoption of the practice of procuring
civil work on basis of Unit Rates through open bidding, instead of the conventional method of procuring on
the basis of "Schedule of Rates" from pre-registered firms, and (v) increased consciousness within the
implementing agencies of environmental and gender issues. Significant examples of increased attention to
environmental concerns are: (i) drainage tubewells were dropped from the project based on environmental
- 12 -



assessments; (ii) cutting of trees along canal banks and berms was avoided during canal rehabilitation; (iii)
a few public tubewells that were serving an artificial irrigated forest reserve were not dis-invested; (iv) the
scope of water quality testing was expanded beyond routine measurement of salinity and sodicity.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control ofgovernment or implementing agency:
This is one of the few projects in the water sector in Pakistan that has been completed within the original
Credit Closing date. While civil works targets for watercourse improvements were substantially reduced,
key project components (disinvestrients of STWs, establishment of FOs, and canal rehabilitation) exceeded
project targets and the project objective was largely achieved. Some factors outside the Goveniment
control did affect project implementation. For example, while GOPunjab remained generally steadfast in
implementing its policy of dis-investing public tubewells, the prevailing drought in the region and the
accompanying canal water shortages caused some delays in project implementation. Disinvestment of
non-SCARP tubewells was deferred for about six months, resulting in some overflow of this component
beyond the closing date. The scope of some canal rehabilitation contracts had to be curtailed due to the
poor perfonnance by local contractors. Finally, it took time both for farmers and the imnplementing
agencies to get accustomed to up-firont capital cost sharing. Physical targets for watercourse
improvements had to be substantially curtailed.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
There were long delays in the approval of the revised project PC-1, prepared after the MTR. These delays
caused uncertainties for the contract staff responsible for watercourse improvements. Some staff did not
receive salaries for several months which affected their morale and motivation. This contributed to the low
achievement of the watercourse improvement component. Similarly there were long delays in deciding on a
policy for redundant staff. The redundant staff still remain on the govemment payroll.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
There was a gap of eight months between Board approval and Credit effectiveness, mainly due to delays in
appointing staff of the PMU and selecting and fielding implementation assistance consultants. Delays in
addressing issues of contract staff responsible for watercourse improvement, led to low staff morale, poor
performance and low achievements. There were start-up delays on the canal rehabilitation component also.
The PID field offices were slow in identifying and preparing schemes for rehabilitation of canals. Further
delays took place at the stage of procurement and award of contracts because of delays in issuance of
technical sanctions by the PED Chief Engineers. Similarly, there were long delays in initiating canal lining
schemes, based on the presumption that farmers would be unwilling to contribute to capital cost. Thanks
to good social mobilization efforts, this component took off after the completion of the first canal lining
scheme, through an innovative conmmunity contract. There were no financial management issues that
affected implementation and outcomes.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The project was closed on the original Credit Closing Date at a cost of US$ 33.5 million (Rs 1,977 million
equivalent) as compared to US$ 104.8 million (Rs 4,138.9 million equivalent) estimated at appraisal.
Farmers contributed 21% of the total project cost. The main reasons for lower cost in terms of Pakistani
Rupees (48% of appraisal estimate) were: (i) curtailment of civil works targets for watercourse
improvement and lower than estimated requirement for canal lining; and (ii) non-utilization of funds (Rs
347 million) allocated for severance package. In US$ terms, the cost at completion was 33% of the
appraisal estimate, reflecting higher than projected devaluation of the Pakistani Rupee against: the SDR,
besides the reduced scope of civil works. SDR 19.5 million were canceled from the IDA Credit at MTR
and a further SDR 3.7 million would be canceled after final disbursement.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The benefits of project investments are likely to be sustained. This assessment is based on the following
considerations:
Community Tubewells (CTWs). There are over 500,000 Private tubewells (PTWs) in Pakistan, installed,
operated and maintained by farmers. The iarge majority of these are shallow tubewells with locally made
centrifugal pumps and diesel fuel based prime movers. Although pump efficiencies are low and routine and
preventive maintenance is often inadequate, farmers in Punjab are well familiar with this technology and
repair/maintenance and drilling facilities are locally available. The after-care/capacity building program
has adequately trained CTW Groups in O&M of tubewells and conjunctive use of canal and groundwater.
The CTWs are thus likely to be sustained.
Community Tubeweli Groups (CTW Groups). The CTW Groups consist of primarily small farmers,
who have joined hands to retain continued access to groundwater, after the closure of govemment
tubewells. These farmers could not afford to install individually owned PTWs. Case studies carried out
under previous tubewell disinvestment projects had indicated that while most of the CTWs Groups function
satisfactorily, some face social and organizational problems: (i) generally CTW Groups tend to follow
taditional methods for maintaining records of tubewell operations and accounts, and few are fully
democratic in making decisions of common interest; and (ii) in some CTW Groups, the executive members
(President and Secretary) tend to dominate. This was particularly evident in those CTW Groups where the
tubewells were located on the land of one of the executive members, and where all the members initially did
not contribute their share of the cost of the tubewell and more affluent farmer(s) contributed on their behalf.
The social mobilization approach under this project was consciously designed to address these issues.
While the CTW Groups established under the project are still young and some of them may suffer from
similar weaknesses, case studies indicate that 85% of them are potentially viable with good prospects of
sustainability. The sustainability of CTW Groups is closely linked to their ability to: (i) operate and
maintain the CTWs efficiently; (ii) generate sufficient resources through sale of water to ultimately replace
the CTWs; and (iii) resolve conflicts that may arise. These aspects were adequately addressed under the
training and after-care program, which was an integral part of the project. Even if some of the CTWs
Groups do not function fully, the investment in CTWs would not be lost as they would continue operating
as private PTWs.
Water User Associations and O&M of Watercourses. There is evidence in Pakistan, that water user
associations (WUAs) at the watercourse level tend to become dormant or inactive after the watercourse has
been improved, primarily because there is no day-to-day business for them to conduct as a WUA.
However, farmers continue to maintain watercourses through traditional and informal arrangements.
Canal Level Farmer Organizations (FOs) and O&M of Lined Channels. The issue of WUAs becoming
dormant is being addressed by establishing FOs at the canal level who, unlike WUAs, have continuing
responsibility of: receiving water at the head of the canal; distributing water equitably among watercourses;
maintaining the canal; and collecting water charges. GOPunjab's strategy for turning over these
responsibilities to FOs is still evolving, and only a few irrigation management transfers have taken place so
far. However, PIDA intends to pilot test a recently proposed strategy, focussing on building the capacity of
the 13 canal level FOs (Federations of WUAs) established'under the project. These FOs have the potential
for taking over responsibility for O&M and collection of water charges after appropriate tuining.

Canal Rehabilitation. This is the most vulnerable component, as far as sustainability is concerned. The
achievements made in improved water deliveries to tail reaches of canals could be gradually lost, as a result
of deferred maintenance or re-assertion by farmers at the head of canals who could again tamper with
outlets and resort to unauthorized withdrawals of water, beyond their shares. However, two factors would
mitigate these risks: (i) the resources freed as a result of the disinvestment of public tubewells are now
available for improving the O&M of canals -the budgetary allocation for O&M of canals was increased
from Rs 1,200 rnillion in FY00 to Rs 1,575 million in FY02; and (ii) the govemment is emphasizing equity
of surface water distribution through various administrative measures, including periodic checks by army
teams.
Groundwater Monitoring and Regulatory Framework (GRF). The achievements made in preparing a
groundwater monitoring program, institutionalizing a groundwater monitoring cell in PID/PIDA, and
preparing a draft regulatory framework are likely to be sustained. The prevailing drought in Pakistan has
focused government attention on improved management of water. Over 60% of the irrigation needs in the
project area are met from groundwater. Therefore, monitoring and management of groundwater are likely
to receive continued high level attention. Funds have been allocated for the Groundwater Cell.
Groundwater regulation is likely to be introduced gradually. Resources for further work on GRF, including
pilot testing are available under the NDP.
Impact on Soils. Monitoring studies carried out under the project have not reported adverse trends in soil
quality. However, use of groundwater for intensive agriculture could lead to accumulation of salts in the
soil and adversely affect productivity in the long term, unless appropriate soil and water management
practices are introduced. Major increases in groundwater abstraction from the FGW areas could also lead
to deterioration of groundwater quality due to intrusion of SGW. Continued inequitable distribution of
canal water could exacerbate this problem. The after-care & capacity building program for FOs included
exposure to good practices for use of tubewell water, including use of soil amendments, subsoiling and
drainage. The issues of saline intrusion are being further studied under the NDP as part of its research
component and non-engineering solutions are being sought. The GRF pilot projects planned under the NDP
would, inter alia, address issues of inequities in surface water distribution. Ultimately, however,
subsurface drainage will be needed to evacuate salts.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
A significant part of the infrastructure established under the project (CTWs, watercourses) would be
operated and rnaintained by FOs. T he following institutional arrangements are in place for the O&M of
various project components:
Community TubeweUs will continue to be operated by FOs (CTW groups) who have receivecl adequate
training in various aspects of O&M. No government liability is involved.
Watercourse improved under the project will continue to be maintained by the WUAs. The Directorate
General of Water Management has handed over "as built" drawing as well as comprehensive charts of
materials used, to WUAs for future use.
Canals rehabilitated under the project would be operated and maintained by the existing PID/E'IDA field
offices. The Executive Engineers will continue to be responsible for operating and maintaining these canals.
Scheme completion reports, including data on physical improvements as well as water distribution
performance, have been prepared for each rehabilitation scheme. These along with "as-built" drawings will
be used for future O&M planning and performance monitoring.
- 15 -



Canal Improvements. Thirteen channels (distributaries and minors) have been lined with close
participation of FOs (Federations of WUAs), who contributed 10% of the capital cost up-front. Initially,
the PID/PIDA field formations will continue to be responsible for operating and maintaining these canals.
However, PIDA intends to gradually turn over increasing responsibility to FOs, after further capacity
building.
6.2.1 Performance Indicators and Monitoring Arrangements. The PMU has identified performance
indicators that would be monitored during the operations phase. These include: groundwater levels and
quality; progress on the pilot testing and operationalization of GRF; progress on developing approaches
for the prevention of SGW intrusion; further rationalization of O&M budgets; performance of FOs, etc.
PIDAIPID will carry out these monitoring activities as part of its Groundwater Monitoring Program and
the M&E program under the NDP Project.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
GOPunjab identified and prepared the project. A feasibility report, prepared through consultants, was the
principal reference document for Bank's appraisal. The Bank's performance during identification,
preparation and appraisal was somewhat mixed but marginally satisfactory on balance. While the project
design incorporated best practices and lessons from past operations in the sector and addressed key sector
policy issues, it had weaknesses: Firstly, like many of the "older generation" projects, the project required
some key actions to be completed as conditions of effectiveness, rather than requiring them up-front before
Board approval. For example, approval of PC-1 by ECNEC, and appointment of key staff and
consultants, were made conditions of effectiveness, rather than conditions of Board approval. Because of
delays in completing these actions, credit effectiveness was delayed by about six months. Secondly, the
project was overly ambitious in enhancing the level of farmer contribution to capital cost, as compared to
previous Bank-assisted operations as well other projects. Farmer contribution to cost of watercourse
renovation materials was increased from 25% (payable in installments over two years) to 30% up-front
with an additional 45% of the cost to be recovered over three years. This enhanced level of cost sharing
was not only high on an absolute scale, but also created disparity with other ongoing programs. Project
targets had to be substantially reduced. In hindsight, the Bank should have required a uniform policy for
cost sharing across the sector. Thirdly, cost of canal improvementlining was overestimated, based on the
assumption in the feasibility report that seepage rates were generally high in the project area. Seepage tests
showed that far fewer channels justified lining. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the project was overly
ambitious in expecting that a GRF could be prepared, pilot tested, legally enacted, and made operational
during the life of the project.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's performance during supervision was satisfactory and, in large part, made up for the weaknesses
of project design. Supervision missions were regular and spent considerable time in the field interacting
with various stake holders. The task team had the required skill mix. Besides core technical skills, it
included social development, procurement, financial management, groundwater regulation and gender
specialists. Supervision missions monitored and facilitated compliance with covenants, and were pro-active
in identifying and addressing project design and implementation issues. Issues were generally addressed in
a timely and diligent manner, except for the issue of farmer contribution to capital cost. In hindsight, this
issue could have been addressed earlier.
7.2.2 Assignment of task management responsibility to the Bank field office further enhanced
effectiveness of Bank's monitoring and follow-up on agreed action plans. Periodic review meetings and
-16-



field visits, including short missions by procurement and financial management staff, were undertaken
in-between full missions. These proved highly effective. Supervision missions regularly reviewed
documentation in support of withdrawals made on the basis of statements of expenditure, the operation of
special accounts, and internal controls. The task team followed up until the issues identified were settled
and required improvements put in place. Relationship and team work with the Borrower and implementing
agencies staff was cordial and effective. Procurement and financial management issues were effectively
addressed. Ex-post procurement reviews were periodically carried out and helped to maintain discipline in
procurement Counter-part funding issues were effectively addressed by raising them in the context of
Country Portfolio Performance Reviews. During the mid-term review, which was carried out in a fully
participatory manner, several imnportant changes were made, based on implementation experience: (i)
farmer contribution requirement wasirationalized; (ii) targets for watercourse improvements were made
more realistic; (iii) emphasis was increased on productivity enhancement measures, (iv) a modest Gender
component was introduced on an experimental basis; and (v) several improvements were introduced in the
national competitive bidding procedures, including not restricting bidding to pre-registered firms only, and
use of market rates instead of standard schedule of rates for soliciting bids and awarding contracts.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Bank's overall performance was satisfactory, thanks to the good performance during supervision.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Government of Pakistan (GOP) had little, if any, involvement in project preparation. The PID played the
lead role and its performance was generally satisfactory. Project preparation was assigned to a consulting
firm. However, participation of the Agricultural Department and PID's own field offices, who were to play
an important role in implementation, was not ensured in the review and supervision of the consultants'
work. This made the subsequent project processing more demanding. Several inter-agency issues,
including the location of the PMU, arose, but were resolved satisfactorily.
7.5 Government implementation perjbrmance:
GOP did not have a direct role in project implementation other than: periodic progress monitoring by the
Projects Wing of the Federal Planning Commission; receiving debriefing from Bank missions; occasional
follow-up by the Economic Affairs Division, with GOPunjab on selected issues, and processing legal
amendments. GOP's overall performance was satisfactory.
GOPunjab's Planning and Development (P&D) Board was responsible for overseeing project
implementation, addressing policy issues, and allocating and releasing provincial resources for the project.
The PMU was initially placed in the P&D Department. GOPunjab performed this role satisfactorily.
GOPunjab's P&D Board and PID remained steadfast in implementing the policy of dis-investing public
tubewells, even during the difficult period of canal water shortages and changes in the political government.
The P&D Board also played a key role in implementing difficult policy decisions such as phasing out
subsidy for individually owned private tubewells in canal commanded areas, and dis-investing irrigation
tubewells, in addition to the STWs. Finally, the Member Engineering of P&D Board, played an effective
role in the development of the draft GRF. However, both P&D and PID, could have played a more
pro-active role in addressing the issue of redundant staff in the early phases of project implementation.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
7.6.1 While the performance of the principal implementing agencies [PMU, PID, Directorate General of
Water management (DGWM)] varied during the project, it was satisfactory overall. During the initial
stages of implementation, PMU's performance was lacking. Delays in procurement of supervisory
- 17 -



consultants and appointment of key staff delayed Credit effectiveness by six months. There was a marked
improvement in overall project management after a new and motivated team (Project Director and core
staff) of PMU took charge. Good team work with the DGWM, consultants and PID's field offices, and
regular progress reviews, enabled completion of targets of disinvestment tubewells within the Credit
Closing date. The PMU fully owned and supported the innovative changes, agreed during the MTR,
including the addition of a gender component. An innovative method of community contracting for canal
lining was successfully implemented on a pilot scale. The Project team was always responsive to, and well
regarded by, FOs and other stakeholders.
7.6.2  PID field offices were initially slow in identifying and preparing canal lining and rehabilitation
schemes. However, diligent follow-up by the PMU and consultants resulted in turning around these project
components. Barring delays in issuance of technical sanctions by the PID Chief Engineers, procurement of
works was generally satisfactory in terms of compliance with agreed procedures, schedules and
maintenance of records. Consultants played a key role in this regard. PID, however, failed to initiate
auction of machinery of closed STWs. In some cases, this prevented FOs from utilizing the STW
bore-holes for installing CTWs.
7.6.3 The DGWNMs perfomiance on watercourse improvement was somewhat lackluster as compared to
its outstanding performance on similar works in the past. Besides the requirement of high farmer
contribution to capital cost, administrative and staff morale issues affected progress and achievements.
The DGWM could have promoted a greater role for the WUAs in procurement of construction materials.
DGWM's performance was, however, satisfactory on the disinvestment of STWs, and highly satisfactory
on the productivity enhancement components. The latter exceeded project targets and helped to introduce
and popularize new technologies (laser-guided land leveling, zero tillage, etc.).
7.6.4 The implementing agencies complied with financial covenants. No major financial management
issues were encountered. Project accounts were generally well maintained. Weaknesses pointed out by
Bank missions were promptly addressed. Annual audits were carried out by Government as well as
commercial auditors. Audited financial statements were received in time and were unqualified, except for
FY01. Auditors' observations were addressed by Departmental Accounts Committees. Financial
Management was generally satisfactory. However, a computerized financial accounting system developed
in-house could not be sustained, due to turn over of contract staff, who had developed it. Senior finance
and accounting staff of PMU could have played a more pro-active role in addressing this issue. In
retrospect, it may have been more appropriate for PMU to outsource the task of developing and
maintaining the software to a professional firm instead of relying on in-house expertise. A new software
was, however, ultimately installed late in the project, and met requirements of financial accounting and
reporting.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
GOP's overall performance was generally satisfactory, although its role in the project was limited.
8. Lessons Learned
Participatory Irrigation Management (Institutional Development) and Cost Recovery
(i)    The quality of social mobilization and after-care/capacity building, determine the quality and
sustainability of FOs, to a large extent.
(ii)   Farmer contribution to capital cost should be detemiined based on social assessment, capacity to
pay, expected benefits, etc; increases in level of cost sharing should be gradual; and cost sharing policy
- 18 -



should be uniform across the sector.
(iii)  Demonstration of successes/benefits of project interventions, in early phases of implementation,
help to build farmer confidence ancl willingness to share cost.
(iv)   Effective micro-credit arrangements should accompany interventions that require substantial
up-front capital cost contributions from farmers. This helps to reduce small farmers reliance on the more
effluent members of FOs and helps them attain a more equitable status within these organizations.
(v)    Women's involvement enhances sustainability of FOs by facilitating conflict resolution and
improving quality of decisions regarding location of irrigation structures.
Project Management
(i)    Key project staff should be on board by project approval.
(ii)   A sound financial management, accounting and reporting system managed by qualified staff is a
key element for good govemance of project implementation.
(iii)  Institutional uncertainties can seriously affect staff motivation, morales and performance, unless
change management issues are addressed effectively and in a timely manner.
(iv)   Difficult and sensitive issues (e.g. redundancies) should be addressed in the early stages of project
implementation.
Groundwater Regulatory Framework (GRF)
(i)    A National Water Policy must guide the preparation of a groundwater regulation framework.
(ii)   A public debate, involving all stake holders, is an essential element for developing an effective
GRF.
(iii)  A public awareness program must precede introduction of groundwater regulation.
(iv)   In a poor rural environment, where groundwater is a significant source of irrigation and livelihood,
an effective GRF must be holistic and address, inter alia, the following issues:
- linkage of groundwater rights with canal water rights and actual deliveries of canal water;
- inequities of surface water distribution;
- involvement of groundwater users in groundwater monitoring and "social recharge" (voluntary
self-regulation); and
- where groundwater abstraction has to be curtailed as a consequence of regulation, poverty
alleviation interventions must accompany regulation, to help identify and create alternative means of
income for affected communities.
Project Design
(i)    Key Borrower actions (e.g. approval of PC-I and selection of TA) should be completed before
Board approval.
(ii)  the procurement process for key works, goods and consultants services required during the first
year of the project should be at an advanced stage by project negotiations, so that disbursement commence
immediately after effectiveness. (This is now a standard requirement for new projects in the Region).
(iii)  Specific improvements in NCB procedures should be agreed and made part of legal agreements.
(This is also now a standard requirement for new projects in the Region).
(iv)   For small works involving community participation, procurement of construction materials and/or
labor should be carried out by the community itself.
(v)    Consideration should be given to out-sourcing certain aspects of financial management to
professional finns, instead of setting up customized software for accounting and financial reporting
-19-



systems, in-house.
(vi) Productivity enhancement interventions must accompany irrigation/drainage investments.
(vii) A well designed and effective M&E program pays dividends in tenns of timely feedback to
implementing agencies and permits mid-course corrections.
(viii) Non-engineering solutions must be sought to address the issue of saline groundwater intrusion.

The draft ICR is found to be very comprehensive which covers almost all the
aspects of the project in a very concise way. This document will prove to be
a valuable source of information for the completed project and continuity of
some of the vital objectives in future. For this the efforts of the team
preparing it are, therefore, commendable.
We appreciate the Bank's revised strategy regarding disclosure of ICR to the
public. This will assist the other implementing agencies to formulate their
projects more objectively.
The contents of the said Implementation Completion Report are found to be in
order and we have no further observations to offer. However, the section-lo
"Lessons Learnt" under Borrower's Evaluation Report can be taken as our
recommendations for more effective project management and implementation.
The Borrower Evaluation Report is being enclosed for its incorporation in

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
A.     Production Impact
1.     At appraisal it was estimated that irrigation system improvements under the project would lead to a
10% increase in cropping intensities. Crop yields were not predicted to increase as a result of project
interventions. Some shift in cropping patterns towards cotton, fruit and Basmati rice was., however, slated
to take place.
2.     The ICR has used actual data collected by the Project Impact Evaluation Studies (PIES), carried
out by the project impact evaluation consultants (a consortium of MM Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd., Mott
MacDonald Ltd., Multi Dimensional Consultants and Hunting Services) to reassess the project's impact on
agricultural production. The PIES were well designed and included sample surveys, controls and case
studies. A multistage stratified and probability proportional selection method was used. Variations of
cropping zones, and groundwater quality (fresh and saline) were taken into account The sample size was
calculated for a 90% confidence level and 4% margin of error. The sample included 202 watercourses,
with 6 respondent farms in each, giving a total of 1212 respondents. The controls were purposively
selected and included 5 watercourses with 6 respondent farms in each. Qualified and well trained
enumerators were employed for data collection and senior researchers maintained quality control. Data was
collected for the baseline and three subsequent crop years. The data has been entered in a computer
database and provide a fairly rigorous and reliable representation of the project area and control farms. The
table below summarizes the SAR projections and actual data collected by the PIES for cropping intensities
and yields.

The above table shows that yields increased for all crops. However, cropping intensity for sugarcane
dropped as farmers moved away from this high water requiring crop due to removal of subsidy on
groundwater. Estimated incrernental crop production at full development is summarized below.

B.     Farm Income Impact
3.     Like the SAR, the ICR has developed separate models for small and large farns for the three
production systems prevalent in the project area: Cotton-Wheat system, representative of SCARP HI;
Sugarcane-Wheat system, representative of SCARPs II and V; and Rice-Wheat system, representative of
SCARP IV. The table below presents the SAR and ICR estimates for incomes of small and large farns in
the three production systems.

The above table shows that increases in incomes are higher than predicted in the SAR. It also shows that
snall farms had a higher percentage increase in incomes in the cotton-wheat zone, while the larger fanns
had a higher increase in sugarcane-wheat zone. The increase in the wheat-rice zone was similar for small
and large farms.
C.     Employment Impact
4.     It is estimated that the project would create 11 million additional work days per year at full
development as compared to without project situation. There are about 234,000 farm families in the
project area with an average size of 8.7 persons per family. It is estimated that CTWs, w,atercourse
improvements and canal lining have directly benefited approximately 150,000 farm families, of which 67%
have small operational holdings of less than 5.3 ha. The benefits of canal rehabilitation cover a higher
number of families.
D.     Non-Quantifiable Benefits
5.     These include (i) release of over 100 mega watts of electricity from STWs for other uses in the
economy; (ii) improved equity of surface water distribution (better delivery to tail-enders); (iii) reduced
investments in private tubewells -had the concept of CTWs not been introduced under the project, farmers
may have installed several PTPWs for each CTW, as one CTW serves about 20 farms; (iv ) improved
- 29 -



availability of funds for O&M of canals and drains due to the disinvestments of STWs; (v) greater
awareness amongst communities of the need for groundwater conservation; (vi) development of social
capital that would enable greater role of farmers in irrigation system management in future; (vii)
acceptance of the principle of up-front cost sharing among farmers; and (viii) progress towards introducing
groundwater regulation to curb anarchic growth of PTWs and conserve groundwater resources.
E.     Economic Costs and Benefits
6.     Costs
o      Investment Costs. Costs in current Rupees were converted to December 2001 prices by applying
the Pakistan consumer price index to local costs and MUV index to foreign costs. The project investment
costs in constant financial prices were then converted into economic prices by applying conversion factors
of 0.8 (composite factor for earth work, unskilled and skilled labor and brick work) for local costs.
O      O&M Costs
-      Tubewells. Updated estimate of long run marginal cost (LRMC) of electricity in Pakistan was
used to compute energy cost of electric tubewells (see Appendix 1). For diesel operated tubewells, the
financial costs of high speed diesel oil and lubricants were converted to economic values by subtracting
taxes and duties and adjusting transportation and other local costs by applying the standard conversion
factor of 0.9.
-      Canal Rehabilitation. Incremental O&M cost assumed equivalent to 5% of capital cost
-      Canal Lining and watercourse improvement. Incremental O&M cost assumed equivalent to
0.8% of capital cost.
Quantifiable Economic Benefits
7.     The ICR has re-estimated the project benefits using a similar approach as in the staff appraisal
report (SAR). Projects benefits fall in two categories: (a) benefits arising from the disinvestments of
SCARP tubewells (STWs), and (b) Agricultural benefits arising from irrigation system improvement
8.     Benefits of Disinvestment of STWs. The benefits of disinvestment of STW accrue from the
lower unit cost of pumping groundwater with diesel based prime movers as compared to electric based
prime movers. Under the project, STWs (which had electric prime movers), have been replaced by
community tubewells (CTWs) which have diesel prime movers. The financial and economic costs of
pumping groundwater with STWs, CTWs and private tubewells (PTWs) is included in Appendix 1 to this
Annex and summarized below.

Source: ICR Mission estimate (see Appendix 1); Economic cost of electricity based on long run marginal cost
The unit economic cost of water pumped by CTWs is lower than that of STWs. It is also lower than that
of PTWs, primarily because of higher utilization factors of CTWs than PTWs. Under the project 4,253
STWs that pumped 2.3 million acre feet (MAF) of water per year, have been replaced by 6,515 CTWs
(each of 1.5 cfs capacity), which are estimated to pump approximately 1.3 MAF of water per year. The
balance pumpage of STWs has been replaced by PTWs installed by farmers on their own. The benefit of
disinvestments of STWs is estimated at Rs 56 million per year.
9.     Agricultural Benefits. These benefits accrue from irrigation system improvements carried out
under the project, including canal rehabilitation, canal lining and watercourse improvements, which resulted
in more reliable and increased water supplies. The switch from public tubewells to community tubewells
also brings the additional benefit of putting tubewell operation directly under the farmers' control making
access to water more timely for meeting crop requirements. However, like the SAR, the ICR has not
attempted to quantify this benefit separately. Benefits of various components of irrigation system
improvement are summarized below.
10.    Canal Rehabilitation. Approximately 145 irrigation channels serving an area of 0.86 million ha
(2.13 million acres) have been rehabilitated. Rehabilitation included various type of works to improve
delivery to tail reaches, reduce risk of breaches, and reduce maintenance requirements. These included
de-silting, repair of regulator gates and diversion structures, up-stream and downstream protection of
structures, channel side protection, cattle crossings and cattle ghats (cattle drinking water points),
restoration of weak sections of banks and berms. The main benefit of this work is improved equity of
deliveries, and maintenance of water supplies at or near designed levels. Empirical results from monitoring
carried out under past irrigation systems rehabilitation projects indicate that without rehabilitation, water
deliveries gradually deteriorate decreasing cropping intensities and increasing risk of breaches and crop
damage. A conservative assumption has been made that without this rehabilitation cropping intensities
would have decreased by total of 5% over a period of 10 years. Aniual benefits at full development arising
from rehabilitation are estimated at approximately Rs 260 million.
11.    Canal Lining. Thirteen canals having a discharge of approximately 115 cusecs and serving an area
of 15,645 ha (38,658 acres), have been lined. Lining has resulted in a 10% increase in water availability at
the head of watercourses. A conservative assumption has been made that his 10% increase in water
availability would increase cropping intensity by 5% over ten years. Annual economic benefits are
estimated at approximately Rs 24 million.
12.    Watercourse Improvement. The project improved 1,215 watercourses; 935 in fresh groundwater
(FGW) areas and 280 in saline groundwater areas. The commanded area of these watercourses is about
153,229 ha (378,630 acres) in FGW and about 48,215 ha (119,140 acres) in SGW areas. There is
- 31 -



empirical evidence from past watercourse improvement projects that watercourse improvements yield water
savings of the order of 25% and result in increases in cropping intensities ranging from 1%-17% and yield
increases of 5% to 60%/o for different crops. Since limited lining was carried out under the project (8% of
length was lined as compared to average of 15% of length lined under past projects) the following
conservative assumptions have been used for estimating benefits: no increase in intensity; yield increases:
Paddy 3%; Wheat 3%; Cotton 3%; Sugarcane 5%; fodders 3%; orchards l%; vegetables 1%). Annual
economic benefits at full development are estimated at approximately Rs 273 million.
F.     Estimates of Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
13.    The ICR has used economic benefits of disinvestment of STWs (para 7) and the incremental
agricultural benefits to estimate the overall ERR of the project For agricultural benefits, the PIES data of
1212 samples in the project area has been used for with-project benefits and data of the control area (30
samples) has been used for the without-project benefits. The data was adjusted to account for the
difference in the project area and control area in the baseline year.

For estimating the overall project ERR, capital and O&M costs of all project components were taken into
account ERRs for individual components were estimated taking into account estimated benefits of each
component (see para 7-11).
14.    Financial and Economic Prices (See Appendix 2). Economic farm gate prices for traded outputs
were valued at import parity for wheat, sugarcane and fertilizer, and at export parity for Rice and Cotton.
Adjustments were made for freight, handling, processing and quality differentials. Prices of non-traded
inputs and outputs and wage rate for labor were expressed in economic tenns by applying a standard
conversion of 0.9. Economic values of canal water charges were assumed to be similar to the financial
value. Economic project life was assumed to be 20 years.

Sensitivity Analysis
15.    The ERR is robust and not sensitive to variation in project costs and benefits. The analysis shows
that the project's performance would be satisfactory as long as the reduction in benefits is less than 40%
(ERR remains more than opportunity cost (12%)). ERR's response to different combinations of changes in
costs and benefits are shown in the following table.

H.     Financial Rate of Return (Return to Farmer Equity)
16.    Farmers invested in canal lining (10% of capital cost) and watercourse improvement (55% of
capital cost). The internal financial rate of return to farmer's equity is estimated at 62 % for canal lining
and 77% for watercourse improvement.

1.     BACKGROUND
Large areas in the Indus Basin became waterlogged, and by 1950's soil salinity also increased
considerably, adversely affecting the agricultural productivity. A number of Salinity Control and
Reclamation Projects (SCARPs) were implemented by GOP to control the twin menace of
waterlogging and salinity for providing drainage. About 13,500 tubewells were installed by the
Government in 36 projects. These tubewells in the public sector greatly helped not only in lowering
the water but also providing timely irrigation water in sweet water areas as a conjunctive use with
surface water irrigation supplies. However, their perfonnance gradually decreased resulting in less
groundwater pumping and excessive expenditure on O&M. Transition of Public tube-wells
commenced under the SCARP Transition Pilot Project (STPP). It was originally envisaged that
SCARP tubewells would be replaced by individually owned private tubewells. It was, however, felt
during the initial two years of SSTP implementation that promotion of PTWs does not ensure
equitable distribution of water amongst the water users, particularly the small farmers.
Accordingly the parameters of the project were modified and installation of the PTWs was
discontinued and it was decided to encourage the installation of the community tubewells (CTWs).
The PPSGDP has been built on the concept developed under STPP and SSTP as well as
experience gained from the implementation of Irrigation System Rehabilitation, Private Tube-well
Development and the On Farm Water Management Projects.
Water from SCARP tubewells had a significant demonstrative effect in promoting private
tubewells (PTWs), particularly in fresh groundwater areas. As a result there are now around
550,000 PTWs in the Province including about 55,000 PTWs in SCARP areas being covered
under the Project The Indus Basin as a whole constitutes a large groundwater reservoir. However,
this is threatened by rapidly growing groundwater pumping. Appropriate groundwater management
is necessary for the sustainability of this important resource.
The Project areas lie in the central and southem parts of the Punjab province and falls within
Gujranwala, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Multan and Lahore administrative divisions. This consists of
fresh groundwater area of SCARP-II including Shahpur, SCARP-III (Rangpur Unit), SCARP-IV
and V (Shorkot, Kamalia Pilot Project). The major project objectives are to:
-43 -



*      Redefine Government's role in groundwater development and provide assistance to facilitate
change.
*      Develop a monitoring programn and regulatory framework to ensure sustainable use of the
groundwater resources.
*      Develop sustainable farmer's organizations (FOs), which can efficiently operate and maintain
groundwater irrigation, improve surface irrigation, and establish a base for participation in the management
of the canal systems.
*      Increase farmers' incomes and alleviate poverty.
*      Rationalize public expenditure of O&M on the inrigation and drainage systems as well as increase
the recovery of public expenditures on irrigation infrastructure.
*      Avoid environmental hazards of saline water intrusion into fresh groundwater aquifers.
The above were to be achieved through the following major components of the five years project
(1997-2001).
*      Disinvestment of SCARP tubewells
Establishment of groundwater management areas by the development of database and
mathematical groundwater models and preparation of a Groundwater Regulatory Framework (GWRF) for
optimal use of groundwater resources.
*      Improvement of irrigation and conveyance facilities and rehabilitation of distributaries and minors.
*      Prevention of saline groundwater intrusion in fresh aquifers through the instalation of tube-wells in
SGW zone.
*      Monitoring and evaluation of the Project's impact.
*      Project management and technical assistance and training of staff and beneficiaries.
2.     ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT CONCEPT AND OBJECTIVES
The basic concept of the PPSGDP was "to evolve public and private sector partnership for the
improvement in the irrigated agriculture and management of the surface and groundwater" through
a process of institution building in the form of
Community Tubewell Groups (CTWG's), WUAs and FOs at the Watercourse and distributary
level. The project objectives for the improvement in the irrigation water availability and
particularly, the water equity have been achieved through the transition of STWs, lining of
watercourses and canals in SGW areas and the rehabilitation of canals and structures. Project
interventions in the SGW areas through the canals and watercourses have helped in the reduction
of the drainable surplus by reducing/minimizing the seepage on one hand and improvement of
conveyance efficiency on the other. Watercourse improvement has been carried out satisfactorily
on the basis of cost sharing with the farmers.
Social mobilization activities through the Project have helped to establish over 6,833 CTW groups,
which are satisfactorily operating their tubewells. The cohesiveness of these farmers' groups has
been strengthened through the aftercare services.
Development of the GWRF under the Project and involvement of the farmer's community (the
largest groundwater user group) in its monitoring and management will be a great statute to ensure
the sustainability of this resource. This need was timely felt by the Government and wisely
included in the Project. However, the task of development and implementation of GWRF within the
project life was somewhat ambitious, considering the complex issues of political economy; the
mushroom growth of small private tubewells in the past; the high dependence of agriculture and
nrual livelihood on groundwater, the time required for pilot testing and ultimately to enact
-44 -



necessary legislation for Groundwater Regulation.
3.     ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT PREPARATION AND DESIGN
The Staff Appraisal Report for the Project by the World Bank was prepared in Jume 1996. The
Project has been diligently prepared and designed by GOPunjab, GOP and World Bank, which
assisted GOPunjab in smooth preparation of the project components. The PC-I form was approved
by ECNEC in December 1996. The Loan Agreement became effective in March 1997.
The initial cost of the Project was Rs 4,144.2 million. However, the Project works have been
completed at a cost of Rs 2,005 million. The savings occurred due to adjustments in some of the
Project components, the devaluation of rupee and better management. The adjustments in the
following components were made at the time of the mid-term review by the World Bankl Mission in
November 1999.
*      Target for the watercourses improvement / lining was reduced;
*      Drainage cum salinity control tubewells to be installed under the Project along Raniwah Drain
were transferred to NDP to be considered as part of overall drainage measures in within Chaj Doab; and
*      Scope of work for GroundwaterRegulatory Framework was increased to strengthen the
institutional set up under I&P department for the establishment of a Groundwater Cell and monitoring in
the Critical Areas.
The gender component was initiated on an experimental basis. Its objective was to identify and
understand irrigation and agriculture related activities in which women's participation can be
effective. It has enhanced. their participation in decision making and strengthening the sustainability
of FOs making it a family activity.
On the decision of GO Punjab, the closure of 616 Non-SCARP tube-wells through the incentive
package of PPSGDP was included in the project on March 2001.
The project design included concerted efforts towards social mobilization for the fornation of
Community Tubewell Groups (CTWGs), WUAs and FOs to take up following activities along
with their financial involvement;
*      FOs to take over the STWs and run them as CTWs or install a new CTWs as a replacement of
public tube-wells
*      The lining of channels in the SGW areas was subject to collection of the up-front contribution by
the farmers.
*      The lining of watercourses was tied to the pre-condition that a CTW should be installed and be
successfully operative for at least one year before the lining of watercourses could be taken up. This
condition was relaxed.
Participation by the beneficiaries has proved to be very useful activity on the project
4.     ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
The implementation started in March 1997. After the initial difficulties the project attained
excellent pace during the later half of its implementation period. This enabled the in-time
completion of almost all the components. Implementation of the Project involved a number of
agencies, headed by PMU initially under P&D Punjab (1996-97) and then under I&P D. The
OFWM component was implemented by the Directorate General of Water Management,
Agriculture Department, Punjab. Project Implementation Assistance (PIA) was provided by the
Punjab Groundwater Consultants (PGC) - a Consortium of ARCADIS-Euroconsult, NESPAK,
NDC and HALCROW. Project Impact Evaluation Studies (PIES) were carried out by M/s Mott
-45 -



MacDonald Pakistan.
The Project components generally kept pace with the envisaged plan except that of the OFWM
component of watercourse lining. The initial set back of some pre-conditions of CTWs i.e.
watercourse construction was tied with successful implementation of CTWs. W/C improvement
was to be started after one year of successful operation of CTWs. This caused delay in the initial
period and higher farmers' share on watercourse lining as compared to the other projects being
implemented, proved to be a drag on the progress in the first two years of implementation: With the
waiver / relaxation from the World Bank on the above pre-conditions some reasonable progress has
been achieved on this component also. Due to inadequate utilization of funds allocated for OFWM
works, the funding was adjusted. Finally under this component 934 watercourses in the FGW area
and 280 watercourses in SGW areas were lined.
Under the STW transition progranune 4,253 SCARP tube-wells have been dis-invested and
replaced with CTWs. Hence, O&M of STWs is no more a burden on the public exchequer.
Implementation of this component has also resulted in saving of electricity. At the earlier stages of
project implementation, the farmers viewed the CTW concept as an additional burden,
subsequently this component has been appreciatively participated by the farmers and 6,833 CTWs
installed by the end of the Project period.
Aftercare services were provided by the Aftercare Organizers to the majority of the CTWGs.
These services were focused on two main activities viz.: the strengthening of the CTWGs and the
enhancement of their agricultural productivity.
Keeping in view, the enthusiastic response by the farmers in the SCARP transition concept,
Non-SCARP Tubewells were also included in this program and 266 Non-SCARP tube-wells have
been transitioned and stand replaced by the CTWs. These tube-wells were located in various parts
of the Province.
The involvement of women in the project started mid August 2000 after the installation of the
majority of the community tubewells. To maximize the impact of all the gender interventions in the
limited time available, the overall strategy has been to focus on quality rather than number of
women groups. It was decided that a maximum number of 100 groups would be consolidated.
Activities have been undertaken in all four areas with fairly good results. Within a short period of
18 months a number of activities have been undertaken to bring about their empowerment such as
mobilization and organization of women groups, their awareness raising regarding use of irrigation
water, training in skill development of line linkages line departments and development agencies.
As per SAR a total of 26 irrigation channels were conceived to be lined under the Project. The
main purpose of the lining works was to prevent building up of the saline aquifer as against the
largely pumped fresh zones in the surrounding, thus retarding extension of the saline zone of
SCARP-IH. Seepage tests were conducted on these 31 channels at 39 sites through ponding tests by
IRI, PID.
Farmers were required to contribute 5% of estimated cost as upfront and to pay remaining 50% of
cost in 8 installments over a period of 8 years. Thus, contributing a total of 55% of the lining costs.
It was also agreed by the project that the FO may pay 10% up-front without any further liability.
The requisite up-front contribution was successfully collected for 8 channels. Subsequently, five
more channels were identified in the saline zone, which were lined under the project.
- 46 -



Lining of 13 distributaries/minors was completed under the Project Once the construction work on
the first channel was completed, farmers' response on lining of channels has been very enthusiastic.
The tremendous improvements in the flow regime and canal management have attracted the
farmers' response in the form of financial contribution and involvement in the design and
supervision. The rate of progress on the farners' upfront contribution greatly accelerated with the
completion of first canal -- Nangiana Minor. On two channels FOs opted to cany out construction
themselves through community contract.
The component of Rehabilitation of Canal Structures was introduced to compensate farmers who
were making conjunctive use of STWs and canal flows in the tail reaches. Due to closure of
STWs, these farmers would have faced serious problems due to shortage of water at the tails of
canals. This component has helped in the improvement of canal flows and water availability
particularly in the tail reaches in addition to some water savings previously lost due to
obstructions. The canals rehabilitation works were implementation in following irrigation divisions:
1)    SCARP-IV, Gujranwala and Sheikhupura Irrigation Divisions
2)     SCARP-IH, Sargodha, Shahpur, Kirana, Rasul and Gujrat Irrigation Divisions
3)     SCARP- V, Lower Gugera and Burala Irrigation Divisions
4)     SCARP-II, Trimmu and Muzaffargarh Irigation Divisions
Scheme reports were prepared by PID and evaluated by the project and the doncor. Finally, 24
contract packages were awarded and implemented involving 144 irrigation channels with a total
length of 2249 Km.
A GIS database of Punjab's groundwater resources and irrigation facilities has also been prepared
and handed over to Groundwater Cell in Irrigation Research Institute of PID along with hardware
and software. The developments of a database for groundwater monitoring and management and
GWRF have progressed reasonably. Groundwater management areas and the critical areas needing
special attention for groundwater management have been identified/delineated in the Province. A
programme for the groundwater monitoring has been developed for the collection of data on time
variant parameters of groundwater balance. Farmers have been involved as a part of pilot testing of
the concept for participatory groundwater monitoring and management. A public awareness
campaign has been initiated under the project to arouse the interest of farmers and their active
participation. The farmers showed their reservation at the earlier stages but started coming forward
for active participation in the management of surface and groundwater.
Groundwater monitoring activities were carried out by a number of agencies without any
coordination and hence it involved duplication of efforts. A Groundwater Monitoring Coordination
and Working Group (GMCWG) have been constituted through the efforts of the Project team to
coordinate and institutioralize both groundwater monitoring and regulation within PID/PIDA.
Similarly a draft regulatory framework has been prepared to regulate hydrogeological and legal
aspects of groundwater management area. This framework is being pilot tested in one selected
"critical" groundwater management area and involves an awareness program, stakeholder
consultation, consensus building and intensive monitoring. Further work shall be carried out on
pilot testing under the National Drainage Program. The groundwater monitoring program and the
regulatory framework would help to ensure sustainability of groundwater resources. A
comprehensive technical report "Groundwater Monitoring Program for Punjab" was prepared to
aim at the need for systernatic monitoring and proposed set up for coordination, data sharing and
establishing guidelines for collection and analysis of water samples for various uses.
-47 -



A Workshop was organized by the project in December 1999 for the Management and Regulation
of Groundwater in Punjab. The primary object df the workshop was to share experience and
expertise of a broad range of participants, both national and international.
The component for installation of 70 Drainage tube-wells along Raniwah Drain (SCARP-II) to
prevent the saline groundwater intrusion in to fresh aquifer will get accomplished under NDP after
further analysis/studies.
The environmental assessment specialist of PGC, in consultation with senior specialists of NDP,
prepared a technical report on "Environmental Assessment and Water quality monitoring" from
PGC. This report is an outcome of phase -I of the environmental assessment study in the light of
the guidelines prepared by WB, GOP, GO Punjab. The report also assesses the project impact on
the socio economic conditions and proposes an action plan for phase II of the environmental
studies, outlining the scope of mitigation and management plan.
Training of farmers and the redundant SCARP Staff have been implemented under the Project.
About 26,365 office holders of WUA's and CTWG's have been provided training under the
Project on book keeping for the O&M of CTW and other social interaction. Training sessions for
farmers were organized to improve the technical skill and knowledge. Farmers' trainings at cluster
level (Kissan Melas) were organized in the four project areas to provide specialized services of
several organizations, agencies and suppliers.
Similarly 1900 staff members (being redundant) from the SCARPs have been trained under the
project to provide them a better opportunity in life. The training needs were assessed in
consultation with the concemed staff members. The SCARP staff preferred training in computer
skills, as electrician and as driver. The Water Management Training Institute, Lahore organized
refresher and orientation training courses for the OFWM professionals, Agricultural Extension
field staff and Water users farmers for not only improved OFWM and Water Management
Extension techniques but also in aspects relating to the "After Care " for community.
5.     ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT OPERATION
Dis-investment of 4,253 Government owned STWs in fresh groundwater areas and their
replacement by CTWs is a major contribution by the Project with active participation of farmers in
the Irrigation and Drainage Sector. Operation of CTWs through CTW Groups has ensured supply
and equity of tube-well water for irrigation. Feedback through PIES shows that due to ensured
water supply from CTWs, the farmers have improved the level of agriculture and tend to invest
more in other inputs i.e. better seeds, ferdlizers etc., to increase the cropping intensity/yields etc.
Dependability of T/W water has also proved an inpetus to switch over to cash crops. In future the
O&M of CTWs' by the farmers and dis-investment of STWs' will also provide big relief to the
financial burden of about Rs 250 million on public exchequers and saving of more than 100 MW
of electric power in the province for other uses. Also, the trend of rising groundwater is now
reversed as 6,833 CTWs are already or shall soon be in operation. Monitoring studies also indicate
that no negative impact has been observed in the project area and rather farmers have improved
their cropping pattem due to the ensured supply of water for crops.
Other project components such as lining of canals and distributaries, rehabilitation of canal
structures and improvement of watercourses will result in tangible benefits to the community. It
has been found that due to the above mentioned components, the tails of these channels are
-48-



receiving more supplies, canal breaches have been reduced, while maintenance requirements of
these channels and requiremnent of their watch and ward have also been reduced, there is less
dependence on the surface water supplies due to installation of CTWs, less water disputes and
therefore more social harmony within the community and has resulted in more equitable
distribution of irrigation supplies in the Project area.
On the water management side, the immediate effect of watercourse improvements has been the
increase in irrigation supplies to the fields due to reduced losses. As reported in the review of the of
the work by PIES in their impact assessment average losses on a watercourse shows an
improvement of about 10%, which will ultimately result in increased crop production. O&M
expenditures on these watercourses and channels have also been reduced.
6.     PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTS FOR FUTURE O&M
The permanent operating agency responsible for complete operation and maintenance of the project
is the beneficiary community itself. The canals where the rehabilitation works have been executed
will be operated and maintained under the nornal O&M by the existing PID/PIDA field offices.
The PID Executive Engineers will be responsible for operating and maintaining these channels.
The project took a major step towards developing sustainable Farmers' Organization (FOs) and
transferring them the responsibility of O&M of SCARP tubewells (STWs). The CT'V Groups/FOs
will be responsible for planning, implementing and the continuous functioning of the tubewells and
water supply to their members and no government liability is involved.
Farmers have been involved in the participatory groundwater monitoring and they have shown keen
interest in participation in the observations of water levels and water quality. Training has been
provided to farmers particularly, in the critical areas. Steps are also being taken to institutionalize
both groundwater monitoring and regulation and it is envisaged that this work would help to ensure
the sustainability of groundwater resources. Further work on the GWRF after the end of the project
will be continued under the NDP, which includes development of GW'RF as one of its important
components. The GWRF Steering Committee will continue to be leader of the GWRF work within
GO Punjab after the end of the project
Watercourses will also be maintained by the Water Users Associations (WU.A's)/ Farmers.
Necessary training for the operation and maintenance of the watercourses has been provided to
them. As such it is expected that the farmers will be able to operate and maintain these works
properly. The Directorate General of Water Management will hand over the construction drawings
as well as charts of material used to the WUAs' for future use.
Channels (Distributaries and Minors) are being lined with close participation of FC)s, which made
the upfront contributions to capital cost Initially, the PID/PIDA field offices will continue to be
responsible for O&M of these canals. However, the PIDA will build the capacity of these FOs and
gradually devolve increasirig the responsibilities.
7.     PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
Borrower's performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory. The Project
was conceived as a continuation of the SCARP Transition concept and to involve the farmers in
irrigation and drainage management The Project involved a nurnber of interventions and their
implementation through a numnber of agencies. A close coordination and continuous follow-up was
necessary to achieve the targets. The prime responsibility of this coordination and management fell
-49 -



upon various agencies involved in the implementation, which provided continuous supervision and
coordination among various public and private agencies for the accomplishment of the different
project components. Due to the conflicting requirements for the closing of STWs as per project
covenants and the dire need of the farmers for irrigation water due to the drought conditions, PMU
had to play a balancing role for smooth closure of STWs and their timely replacement through
CTWs to avoid the hardship of the farrners on one hand and to meet the public interest on the
other.
The Project played a pioneer role in the development of GWRF. Need for groundwater
management and regulation was not felt in the past and hence, PMU had to consistently pursue
various stakeholders and impress upon the need for a systematic groundwater monitoring and
management to ensure the sustainability of the threatened resource.
Lining of canals with active technical and financial participation of the farmers has been first time
introduced under the Project. The project had to play a very active role in the social mobilization
and to ensure the participation of the farmers along with an active role by PID. Procurement
through Item Rate Bidding rather than the contracting through the conventional schedule of rates
also helped in the attainment of quality construction work PMU played a pivotal role in the
transparency of the procurement process in accordance with the project requirements. PMU helped
in creating effective quality control through provision of the necessary testing equipment and
supporting manpower. This process greatly helped in the attainment of high quality construction
work in the lining and rehabilitation of the canals.
PID and P&D also provided timely advice and approvals for the smooth running of the Project
activities and due to timely decisions and actions by them, the targets have not only been achieved
but rather exceeded in many components such as transition of STWs. Non-SCARP tubewells were
not included in the original plan but have been achieved due to the appropriate project management
by PMU. The Project team organized effective interaction with Director Technical to curtail the
electricity billing on the denotified tube wells to ensure the financial relief on the public exchequer.
On the water management side the OFWM field teams generally performed quite satisfactorily in
spite of the initial delays due the problems of up-front payment by the farmers and the condition of
a CTW to be in place before the improvement of the watercourse.
A number of workshops were organized by PMU to propagate awareness to all concemed for
smooth implementation of the works as planned. Training sessions and workshops were effective in
floating the basic targets of the project and these sessions were attended by large number of
participants.
8.     PERFORMANCE OF BANK
The bank has done an excellent job of project supervision by fielding as many as 9 supervision
missions besides a number of meetings held at Islamabad and Lahore to discuss the day to day
progress of various components and to find ways to remove any hurdles. The Bank provided
excellent supervision, guidance, and cooperation on various issues by timely assistance and holding
discussions even on telephone, fax and by e-mail and provided assistance to resolve day-to-day
problems encountered on the project. It also provided coordination linkages with other
organizations like WAPDA, IWASRI and SMO. Successful implementation of the project at half
the estimated cost is also attributable to the close supervision and timely guidance and decisions by
the Bank staff especially the Task Manager. Valuable guidelines were available during
- 50 -



implementation through regular supervisory missions of the Bank, which not only carried out
detailed review of the project implementation but while indicating deficiencies, alsco gave helpful
and constructive suggestions and advice to overcome these problems that enabled the
implementation agencies to complete the project in the better interest of beneficiaries.
However, there were certun issues, which required to be addressed e.g. share of the up-front cost
recovery on watercourses required assessment of farmers' financial capacity. Affording capacity of
the farmers to share upfront cost needs to be carefully considered in the future project. To sum up
we can say that the co-ordination between the Bank and the Borrower during the evaluation and the
implementation phases of the project were effective and helpful.
A World Bank representative visited the office of PMU and the consultants in the last quarter of
1999 to guide them on the issue of Y2K problem and to prevent data damage that was feared at the
advent of year 2000.
9.     RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BORROWER AND THE BANK
The successful and timely completion of any project depends on the relationship between the
Borrower and the Lender especially in those projects where the Lender is also involved in the
technical supervision of the project. The relationship between the Borrower and its various
agencies PID, OFWM and the Bank remained very cordial during the evolution and the
implementation phases of the project were very effective and helpful. The Bank and the Borrower
carried out project supendsion jointly during visits of the bank's Review Missions while prompt
actions were taken on the recommendations of the missions. Special attention was paid both by the
Bank and the Borrower to the critical issues, which were resolved in time to ensure successful
implementation of the project. The success of the project is mainly due to intensive and close
supervision extended by the bank staff in general and by the Mission LeaderTask Manager in
particular whose valuable guidelines/directions were readily available during implementation
through regular missions of the bank and by telephone/fax, e-mails etc. MTR of the project was
held in time and changes/revisions made in project were definitely called for and their assessment
of progress towards project objectives enabled the implementation agencies to complete the project
in larger interest of beneficiaries.
10.    LESSONS LEARNT
1)     Project Management
*      The credit of in time successful completion of the project is attributed to various actors i.e. P & D,
PID, PAD, PIES, BUNYAD, FOs, and PMU. It is felt that good coordination was achieved due to
pro-active, prompt and positive assistance by the Donor especially the Task Team Leader
*      For successful implemenlation of a project, a well considered interaction on the part of Donor
would help the executing agencies to under-stand the development objectives. It may be expedient if the
intended social changes are deliberated and understood by the Government well in time.
*      It may be useful if the deployment of project key staff gets prior review by the Donor also. Once
the selection of appropriate personnel is completed then the frequent shifting may be avoidedl. The support
by the Government in this regard can provide an important assistance and encouragement for the efficient
and productive working of the project staff.
*      For smooth implementation it is helpful that the project is given due autonomy. Any change in the
original agreements may be agreed at the Government and Donor level and the decision so arrived at should
be strictly followed by all concerned.
*      It has been felt that Audil: Department do not accept the decisions between the Government and the
Donor. It is essential to consider such decisions to cary the requisite approval by the Govermnent. On
- 51 -



completion of the project the competent forum may extend their formal approval considering the interim
decisions.
*      Prior appointment of implementation consultants was made as a covenant for the effectiveness of
the credit of PPSGDP, which has expedited the start of the project in a short period.
I)     Financial Management
*      It has been felt very essential that anomalies arising due to application of the Govermment
procedures versus Donor policies needs to be clearly defined. For this purpose a clear understanding is
required especially on procurement of civil works.
*      It is absolutely necessary that Provincial Government including the Finance and the Audit
Department understand the procedure and discipline intended for implementation of the project. Raising of
subsequent audit observations discourages the pace of the project.
*      The experience on the project has indicated that the financial management could have been
exercised more efficiently through an independent organization rather than depending on individuals. These
financial consultants can devise suitable methods for operations of the accounts and be responsible for
audit of the project.
III)   Project Implementation
*      During the course of social mobilization with the farmers, the top most requirement was to build
up their confidence on the project team. This could be done in a systematic and structured manner and
farmers were involved in all stages of the process. An effective aftercare arrangement was helpful in
strengthening the sustainability of FOs/CTW Groups in the project area. During the process of aftercare
emphasis was put on the establishment of linkages with various agencies to enhance the agricultural
productivity.
*      In order to ensure better financial viability of these FOs/Tube-well groups, more attention could
have been given on multi-functional activities through Rural Support Programs so as to ensure their
continuity and active role in rural development.
*      The Gender Component was a late entry in the Project and it remained a pilot activity. Through
this experiment it has been realized that women are important water users, and partners in water
management and therefore their awareness regarding project interventions would enhance the sustainability
level of FOs/CTW Groups.
*      Up-front cost sharing by the beneficiaries is very essential to develop sense of ownership and
sustainable development However, it has been experienced that timely completion of the targets is
necessary to develop the confidence of the farmers. Once they see that the implementation has been
achieved they act as the advocates of the Project activities.
*      The combination of resident supervision by PID and top supervision by the Consultants has
ensured good quality of civil works. PID was encouraged and facilitated by the project to procure the
essential equipment for proper quality control.
*      As per agreement between the Government and the Donor, the procurement procedure for civil
works was changed from ICB to NCB and packaging of works on sub-system basis. This proved to be a
positive step in improving the pace and quality of works.
*      Normally the completion of civil works gets delayed and extensions in the project completion
period are required. In time successful completion of these works on PPSGDP was achieved through a
continuous process of meetings amongst PID, contractors, consultants and PMU.
*      In the past groundwater monitoring has been in the public sector whereas users have not been
involved. The existing groundwater situation warrants awareness and active participation by the
groundwater users for its appropriate management and optimal use. The project has initiated these steps
and encouraging response was extended by the beneficiaries.
- 52 -



*      In Punjab Province, management of surface and groundwater can not be segregated and proper
attention should be given to the conjunctive use of these resources for irrigation purposes.
*      Continuation of the public awareness campaign for appropriate use of the limited water resources
is a pre-requisite to achieve the goals for implementation of Groundwater Regulatory Framework. This
activity needs to be intensified in the already identified Critical Areas.
IV) The Way Forward
Most of the project objectives/components has been successfully completed. Their fituLre continuity
has already been discussed and agreed through NDP in the following areas:
*      Trainsition of remaining fresh groundwater Public tube-wells
*      Groundwater Monitoring in the Province
*      Implementation of Groundwater Regulatory Framework in the Critical Areas
*      Canal lining
The project strongly recommends the involvement of Rural Support Programs in the
implementation of Groundwater Regulatory Framework in the Province.
