FOURTH POPULATION AND HEALTH PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:           People's Republic of Bangladesh
Beneficiary:        Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
Amount:             SDR 1.33.2 million (US$180.0 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard with 40 years maturity
Project
Description:        The project, which cover a five-year time slice of GOB's
development program in population and health (1992-96),
has four main components: (a) strengthening FP service
delivery; (b) strengthening health services delivery; and
(c) improving supportive activities to the delivery of FP
and health services; and (d) women's and nutrition
programs. It will strengthen FP service delivery by
improving access to FP services, strengthening MCH
services, enhancing clinical service delivery and FP/HCH
quality assurance, imparting in-service training of
upazila and district staff in FP/MCH, construction and
renovation of FP/MCH facilities, and marketing of
contraceptives through the private sector. The project
will strengthen health service delivery through increasing
the range of maternal and neonatal health care,
strengthening nursing and medical education, introducing
medical quality assurance, supporting medical research,
strengthening disease prevention and control, developing
urban primary health care, continuing and expanding school
health programs, improving district and upazila health
facilities, and improving the utilization of Upazila
Health Centers. In support of the fir't two components,
the project will assist in strengthening information
systems, improving FP and health management, expainding
communications programs, supporting NGO activities, and
developing innovative projects. Finally, the project will
assist continuation of the three women's programs financed
under the previous three projects and will strengthen and
develop the National Nutrition Council, in anticipation of
a substantial program of nutrition interventions.
Benefits and
Riskss              The project will have a positive impact on family welfare,
particularly among women and children, through greater
birth spacing and better health status. In the long-term,
the intense pressure on the limited land and natural
resources due to population growth will be mitigated and
the challenge of providing social services and employment
to the growing population will be eased. Other benefits
will be enhanced effectiveness and efficiency of the FP
and health programs due to the cooperation between the FP
and health subsectors, reorientation of medical education



v 
towards communit medicine and public health, and
increased utilization of improved services.  The main risk
of the project is the Government's potential inability .o
implement fully the extensive reform program in the health
subsector, including the reorientation of medical
education toward community medicine and public health.
Another risk is the possible weakness of the management
capacity of the health subsector, although the financial
absorptive capacity is expected to be sufficient. To
minimize these risks, the project has been so designed as
to contribute to the Government's ability to handle the
reforms successfully and strengthen its managerial
absorptive capacity and intensive collaboration is planned
among important medical organizations and colleges in
Bang'ladesh and abroad.

BANGLADESH
FOURTH POPULATION AND HEALTH PROJECT
I. THE POPULATION AND HEALTH SECTOR
A. Introduction
1.1       Population and Family Planning.  Over the past 16 years, the
Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has invested in the institutionalization of
increasingly effective family planning (FP) and Maternal and Child Health
(MCH) care programs (Annex 1). This investment is beginning to bear fruit in
terms of key demographic indicators, albeit not to the extent envisioned in
the early stages of the programs. The Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) has
risen substantially (from 82 in 1975 to 332 in 1989) comparing favorably with
Nepal, Pakistan and less developed parts of India (Annex 2). The impact of
such increased contraception is reflected in a significant decrease in (a) the
Total Fertility Rate (TFR) from over 7 in the mid-1970s to just under 5 in
1989 and (b) the Crude Birth Rate (CBR) from 48 per 1.000 in 1970 to 38 in
1989 (Annex 3). Nevertheiess, these results are no cause for complacency.
They are still far from the levels required to match the population with the
country's resources and keep it within limits that the infrastructure could
support. With a population density of over 800 people per sq. km., Bangladesh
can hardly afford a growth rate of 2.42 per annum which would lead to a
doubling of her population in just over 30 years. In the light of this grim
outlook, the achievements mentioned afore can only be described as modest.
But they are significant inasmuch as they show that the approach and the
efforts have been in the right direction and need to be further intensified.
1.2       Maternal and Child Health.  Along with the endeavors in the
population field, GOB has attempted to tackle the problems of morbidity and
mortality among women and children. The accomplishments on these fronts are
less gratifying. The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and the Under-five Mortality
Rate (UMR) show some decline in the past ten years (the former from 132 to 110
(Annex 4) and the latter from 211 to 188, both per 1,000 live births], but the
Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) still hovers at a very high level of 6-8 per
1,000 live births. Comparisons of the main causes of infant and childhood
mortality in India, Indonesia and Bangladesh are shown in Annexes 5 and 6. A
recognition that FP and population measures cannot be effective without a
concurrent improvement in the general health status of women and children led
to the formulation of a coordinated strategy towards FP and MCH goals.
1.3       Health.  Besides the FP and MCH activities, another significant
factor in the social and economic development of Bangladesh is the extremely
poor health status of the general population. Although a national framework
for addressing these issues exists in the form of a Ministry of Health and a
network of health care facilities, the structural and functional efficacy of
this infrastructure leaves much to be desired. It would be fair to state that
the concentration of the country's attention on FP/MCH concerns has resulted
in the relative neglect of the broader health questions. Despite adopting the
"Health for All" policy, Bangladesh realistically will be nowhere near
attainment of this objective by the end of the century.
1.4       A comprehensive approach.  FP/MCH and health services are closely
interlinked in terms of similarity of objectives; types of personnel,



-2-
equipment, training and technologies used; infrastructure and service
facilities requ.redt facilitating factors, such as higher levels of literacy,
improved socio-economic conditions, women's development and other socio-
cultural determinants; and, most importantly, recipients of the services. An
IDA-led Consortium of external donors has been largely supporting GOB efforts
in the population sector through the three successive five-year projects from
1975, the last of which is scheduled for closing in December 1991.
Acknowledging the close linkages between health and FP and in line with the
outcome of discussions between GOB officials and IDA, an integrated and
balanced approach is being favored for these two sectors [now subsectors whose
programs are managed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW)].
Consequently, the !Fourth Project is envisaged as a Population and Health
Project with considerable inputs into health as well as FP. This explains the
substantially larger size of the pr -sed project compared to its predecessor.
B.  Background on t e    .iation and Health Situation
1.5       The population and heait; s`tuation in Bangladesh is characterized
by the: (i) enormity of the populatio- pressure, (ii) extraordinary level of
poverty and illiteracy that hurts the country's productivity as well as its
health status, (iii) generally gloomy picture of morbidity and mortality and
(iv) remarkable differential between the health status of females and that of
males (clearly in favor of the latter). However, some recent social and
demographic developments have begun to alter, although not yet radically, this
difficult background in which population and health programs have had to
operate.
1.6       With the exception of some city-states, Bangladesh is the most
densely populated country in the world (over 800 people per sq. km.). Its
population is currently estimated at 117 million, compared to 89.9 million in
1981 and 76.4 million in 1974 (Censuses). The increased population pressure
in rural areas has resulted in considerable migration to urban areas, where
large sections of the population increasingly live under overcrowded and
unhygienic conditions due to the inability of the urban settlements to cope
with such migration.
1.7       With a per capita income of US$170 (1989) and with more than half
the population living below the poverty line, Bangladesh is caught in a
vicious cycle of poverty and ill health. Such severe economic deprivation
combined with low literacy levels is responsible for a large share of the
morbidity and mortality, which in turn hampers productivity and growth. The
impact of a poor health status on economic growth is more apparent when one
considers that at any given time, three-quarters of the population (mainly
women and children) are ill and malnourished and that the health and nutrition
status of adult males remains very poor as well. Moreover, due to the large
proportion of young people (Annex 7), the dependency ratio is high at 96?
(also adversely affecting productivity).
1.8       Life expectancy is currently 52-54 years for men and 49-51 years
for women. Although the Crude Death Rate (CDR) per 1,000 has declined from 18
in 1981 to 14 in 1990, Bangladesh remains among the countries with the lowest
life expectancies in South Asia, at par with Nepal and behind India, Pakistan,
and Sri Lanka. Annex 8 gives the distribution of adult deaths by cause and
sex in Bangladesh and Annex 9 compares Bangladesh with Indonesia and India
with respect to selected causes of mortality. Some of the principal risks of
morbidity and mortality stem from high fertility, diarrhea, tuberculosis,



leprosy, tetanus, worms, measles, acute respiratory infections, malaria and
other vector-borne diseases. An idea of the morbidity patterns can be
obtained from Annex 10. High levels of chronic disability and severe
malnutrition are other leading health problems. Malnutrition, which is a
major cause of childhood mortality, affects adults as well, particularly
women. Almost all rural mothers are considered malnourished in terms of
weight for height. About 502 of the newborn babies have low birth weights,
one of the worst situations even among developing countries. Malnutrition is
made more severe by traditional dietary practices as well as infections. The
deficiency is not me:ely one of calories and proteins, but also of several
specific nutrients, some leading to serious disabilities, such as blindness.
Despite this rather dismal picture, a positive aspect of feeding practice in
Bangladesh is the almost universal breastfeeding of babies in both rural and
urban areas, although exclusive breastfeeding seems to be declining, a
worrying trend. Besides its nutritional benefits, breastfeeding acts as a
natural contraceptive.
1.9       A particular concern in Bangladesh is the divergence in health
status of females and males. Although the gap between life expectancies of
men and women narrowed recently (Annex 11), Bangladesh deviates from the
pattern seen in most countries where women live longer than men. Childhood
mortality among girls is higher than that among boys by almost 15-252 (IMR=
105-125 per 1,000 live births for girls and 90-115 for boys; CDR=16 per 1,000
for girls and 13 for boys). Women run an additional risk of mortality from
maternal causes with an MMR more than 100 times the rate in industrialized
countries and much higher than even that of most developing countries. The
main causes of maternal mortality are: self-induced miscarriages (abortion),
eclampsia, infection, hemorrhage, and mechanical complications (Annex 12).
These higher rates of mortality, traditional male gender preferences and
discriminatory allocation of family resources have resulted in a sex ratio of
104 males to 100 females (126:100 in the urban areas) and give an indication
of the unfavorable situation of women in Bangladesh.
1.10      In terms of recent social and demographic changes, the
traditionally young age at marriage of women has risen from 16 years on
average in the mid-1970s to 18 years in 1989. The proportion of single women
aged 15-19 has increased from 8? in 1961 to 492 in 1989. Similarly, the
proportion of single men age 20-24 has risen from half of the cohort in 1961
to three-quarters in 1989. In the last decade, the median age of women at
first birth rose by more than one year and the average number of children born
to women before age 20 fell by about 30Z. The large age difference between
husbands and wives has begun to narrow but remains at 7.5 years on average,
giving husbands considerable advantage in status, experience, and
decision-making in the family. Thus, despite some welcome changes, the
disproportionate male influence on decisions about family size and health care
persists; the low social and economic status of women remains a key element in
the demographic and health problematique of Bangladesh.
C. Overview of the National Population and Health Program
1.11      In the 1950s, voluntary efforts to promote FP and MCH began in
Bangladesh (at the time still East Pakistan). They led to a national program
in 1965 aimed at reducing population growth from 31 in 1965 to 2.7? in 1970
through reducing births from 50 to 40 per 1,000 and deaths from 20 to 15 per
1,000. The program was partly based on a network of FP clinics administered by
an autonomous FP board, independent of the health service. It depended on



- 4 -
doctors for sterilization, lady FP visitors for intrauterine device (IUD)
insertions, and incentive payments to personnel and acceptors. The program
sharpened public awareness of population issues and modern contraceptive
methods and created a latent demand for FP.   Revisions in the program planned
for Pakistan's Fourth Five-Year Plan (1970-75) could not be implemented due to
the civil war.
1.12      Although FP efforts nearly stopped in the early 1970s, considerable
discussion continued about the program. Through the first three five-year
plans, successive population programs contained new strategies, efforts at
streamlining administrative structures and increasingly more realistic
targets. The planning, policy-making and coordination of the program was
initially vested with an autonomous PP board under the Ministry of Health,
later to be replaced by an interministerial board. Some of the highlights of
the steps taken under the population program during the first three plan
periods were: a progressive move towards cooperation with the Ministry,
multisectoral efforts for communication and women's activities, research and
evaluation, community-based FP services through female and male field workers,
functional integration of FP and health sectors at the subdistrict level,
formation of the Family Welfare Centers (FWCs) and a serious attempt to reduce
morbidity and mortality among women and children. The fertility and
demographic targets set for the Third Five-Year Plan (1985-90) were: 32 births
and 13 deaths per 1,000 population, a CPR of 402 by 1990 and a Net
Reproduction Rate (NRR) of 1 by the year 2000.
1.13      Despite its commitment to the overall goal of "Health for All by
the Year 2000", Bangladesh has been so preoccupied with the pressing problem
of its population explosion that the general health situation has not received
enough attention. However, health is recognized by GOB as a fundamental right
and the stated policy is to provide essential minimum health care to all
through Primary Health Care (PHC). The GOB has inherited a health system
strongly oriented to curative care, with vertical programs being the only
channels of preventive activities. Steps were taken in the Third Plan toward
the direction of PHC. The construction of Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs) and
the network of FWCs in addition to the secondary and tertiary facilities is
the clearest evidence of these efforts. Annex 13 presents in greater detail
an overview of the FP and health sector.
Policy Formulation and Coordination
1.14      At present, population policy is formulated by the National
Population Control Council which replaced the National Council for Population
Control. Health policy is formulat:ed by the MOHFW. The Council is chaired by
the President and includes about 350 members (all the cabinet ministers,
parliament representatives, and eminent public personalities from different
walks of life) who meet every three to six months. Its main functions include
providing policy guidelines, approving strategies and innovations, ensuring
interministerial coordination, identifying impediments to implementation and
planning possible corrective actions. An executive committee headed by the
President and comprising all cabinet ministers helps translate the Council's
decisions into action programs and monitors implementation. Similar bodies are
being constituted at district level to focus attention on population, FP and
MCH concerns.
1.15      The Population and Health Sections of the Planning Commission
assist in developing policy options for consideration by the National Economic



Council, and formulate the five-year plan proposals for population and for
health. They are also responsible for an independent evaluation of key MOHFW
activities. At the beginning of the Third Plan, the Population and Development
Planning Unit and the External Evaluation Unit were merged into a Population
Development and Evaluation Unit (PDEU) within the Planning Commission.
Program Implementation by the MOHFW
1.16      Institutional Framework and Functions.  The MOHFW is headed by a
Minister (see Charts 1 and 2). One full-time Secretary and one Additional
Secretary manage MOHFW's major functions, which are divided between an FP wing
and a health wing, each having its own planning unit. Directorates, one each
for FP and health, headed by Directors-General (DGs) and supported by
Directors of functional units assist the Secretariat and are responsible for
program planning, implementation, supervision, training, logistics and
supplies, and monitoring activities in their respective areas. The
education/communication function in FP is vested with the Information,
Education and Motivation (IEM) Unit under the DGFP, while a separate Health
Education Bureau (HEB) functions under the DG Health. Beyond Dhaka, the
organizational structure is separate according to FP and health activit:Les at
the 64 districts, 397 rural upazilas, 4,403 unions, and 13,500 wards. The 349
UHCs and 1,274 Rural Dispensaries (RDs) at upazila level and 2,500 FWCs at
union level comprise the main service delivery infrastructure. Field staff
include the envisaged 23,500 Family Welfare Assistants (FWAs) and 21,500
Health Assistants (HAs) who are to work as teams providing outreach services.
The impact of visits by field workers for conveying FP knowledge is shown in
Annex 14. Attempts have been made to integrate the FP and health services
structure, but generally without success, largely due to staff concerns
regarding their position in the bureaucracy.
1.17      Training.  Recognizing that successful fertility control efforts
largely depend on a well trained and motivated work force, GOB has invested
considerably in training institutions. Orientation of basic training of
Medical Officers (MOs) to community health through posting at selected UHCs is
yet to materialize. Model FP and MCH clinics intended as sites of basic
training for all undergraduates and interns exist in all the eight Government
medical colleges. !elected clinics run by NGOs, particularly the Bangladesh
Association for Voluntary Sterilization, provide in-service training in
sterilization techniques to MOs. Basic training and retraining of field staff
and supervisors is provided at 12 Training Institutes for Family Welfare
Visitors (FWVTIs), 8 Medical Assistant Training Schools (MATS), 20 Regional
Training Centers (RTCs), the National Institute of Population Research and
Training (NIPORT), and the National Institute of Preventive and Social
Medicine (NIPSOM). NIPSOM caters to postgraduate training in public health
and in-service training of MOs working in UHCs. NIPORT has been successfully
upgraded to an apex institute for FP and some MCH training, headed by a
Director General. Several institutes outside FP and health are beginning to
provide management training for FP and health personnel.
1.18      Training of Family Welfare Visitors (FWVs) and Medical Assistants
(MAs) was discontinued temporarily during the Third Plan; 8 of the 12 FWVTIs
are being used for initial training of new FWAs and the other 4 for refresher
training of FWVs. Similarly, the MATS are being used for training of new HAs.
Out of tune with the needs of the country, the medical colleges overproduce
specialist clinicians, resulting in a serious shortage of family
practitioners, gynecologists, obstetricians, pediatricians, public health



- 6 -
physicians, etc.  While the physician/population ratio is far from adequate,
the country's health care system cannot yet accommodate the number of rural
PHC physicians required for effective coverage. Training of nurses remains
unsatisfactory and the nurse/population ratio is 1:26,000. Much remains to be
done in the fields of MCH and PHC training which lagged behind over the last
ten years while FP training was strengthened.
1.19      Information, Education and Motivation (IEM).  This program is to
inform, educate and persuade people about the benefits of a small-sized and
manageable family ar4 about healthy lifestyles in general. It aims to reach
not only eligible  Juples but also those at home and in the community who
influence decision-making. The program depends on three mutually reinforcing
approaches: mass media, small group contacts, and individual contacts.
Infrastructure, developed during the first two Plan periods, includes the
units of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the IEM Unit &nd HEB of
the MOHFW, the FP and health field workers, voluntary agencies, and Swanirvar.
Three women's projects supported under the first three projects also serve as
major communication channels.
1.20      Mass media now reach a large segment of the rural population thanks
to the impressive improvement in access to radios including those distributed
to union councils, mothers' clubs, radio listening fora, etc. Health and FP
messages are broadcast for 70 minutes a day through the national studio and
230 minutes a day through the various regional stations.  A government
laboratory produces film on population-related subjects.  Bangladesh
Television devotes more than four hours a month to FP and health programs.
Information campaigns are being held, billboards and neon signs are being put
up in important places, and large quantities of pamphlets and leaflets are
being printed and distributed. Folk songs and Swanirvar's program for FP and
MCH-related activities also have had significant impacts. The result is that a
fairly large population of rural women know about FP methods. Sensitization
of males, however, remains weak.
1.21      Economic Welfare of Women.  RecognizLag that an enhanced status of
women is critical to economic development of the country and long-term
reductions in fertility, GOB started three programs to assist women through
Mothers' Centers, Women's Cooperatives and Women's Vocational Training in
1976. Under the current project, they cover 238 upazilas and about 730,000
women. They provide gainful employment to women through income-generating
activities and impart nonfonmal education with emphasis on FP, health,
nutrition and child care. Program inputs like training and credit facilities
have helped women earn some income which they otherwise would not have earned.
They have also helped women reduce fertility as the CPR is higher in program
areas than in non-program areas.
1.22      Logistics.   The DGFP and the DGHS each have a separate Directorate
responsible for procurement and delivery of most drugs, kits, medical and
surgical requisites, and other supplies for the FP and health programs.
Distribution is through central warehouses in Dhaka, various regional
warehouses and district stores. Logistics management is done by teams of
monitoring officers, supported by a Logistics Management Information System
(LMIS), and technically assisted by UNFPA, WHO, UNICEF, USAID, CIDA, and IDA.
About 5,000 static distribution points serve the country. Some commodities,
such as donated contraceptives and specialized drugs, are procured directly by
donors and distributed to intermediary institutions.



- 7 -
1.23      Monitoring, Evaluation and Research.  Infrastructure for these
activities consists of the Management Information System (MIS) of the FP Wing
of MOHFW with its special service statistics cell, the PDEU in the Planning
Commission, HEB of the Health Wing, the Population and Health Study Centers of
the Bangladesh Institute for Development Studies (BIDS), the Research Wing of
NIPORT, and the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). Besides, agencies like
the Bangladesh Fertility Research Program (BFRP), International Center for
Diarrheal Disease Research in Bangladesh (ICDDR'B), NIPSOM, Institute for
Post-Graduate Medicine and Research (IPGMR), the medical colleges, Dhaka
University and some NGOs are involved in research. The NGO sector has also
made contributions in operational research and evaluation. Apart from many
significant, internationally respected, results in clinical and MCH care
regarding diarrheal diseases and MCH/FP service delivery effectiveness,
important progress has been made with the publication of the Bangladesh
Fertility Study (BFS) 1989, the sample registration system of the BBS, the
monthly reporting system of the MIS, and the evaluation studies of the
Planning Commission. However, evaluation and research remain weak in terms of
quality, relevance, and systematic collection of gender-disaggregated data.
1.24      Clinical Supervision.   To assist GOB in monitoring and improving
the quality of its clinical family planning effort, four clinical Surveillance
Teams were created in 1982. Through regular visits to health facilities
performing clinical contraception (sterilizations, IUDs, injectables,
implants, etc.), the four teams provide medical surveillance and in-service
training. The quality of care has improved considerably since. The teams
were reorganized in 1986 under the DGFP and renamed Family Planning Clinical
Surveillance Teams (FPCST). A recent survey of client satisfaction (1990)
indicates that emphasis on reversible contraceptive methods should be
continued.
1.25      Management Development.   The Management Development Unit (MDU) was
established in 1987 to improve the effectiveness of the FP/MCH program
primarily through strengthening efficient and effective management practices,
resulting in greater managerial absorptive capacity. Field work started only
in May 1988. The professional staff consists of four internationa' d.i four
national experts, one assigned to each of two districts per division. The MDU
tries to strengthen at district level managerial capacity through operational
planning, coordination, training, service delivery and supervision. MIS data
are used for local level evaluation and planning. Notable achievements have
occurred in the districts and upazilas where the MDU operates. A review of
MDU's functioning by GOB, IDA and the Cofinanciers in 1990 suggested that the
MDU should build on and disseminate experience from the current project and
function as a resource center and strategic management group for MOHFW with a
close liaison between the FP and Health Directorates.
1.26      Acceptance and Use of FP and MCH Services.  The utilization of
these national programs is reflected as follows. A closer scrutiny of the
increased use of contraceptive methods reveals a growing popularity of
injectables in 1988 and 1989, with a continued decline in sterilizations.
About 45Z of ever-married women in 1989 have ever used modern contraception
(BFS). Preference of methods among users in 1989 in rural and urban areas and
by number of children is shown in Annex 15. Ever more women are willing to
use modern contraception. In the area of MCH, the Expanded Program of
Immunization (EPI) increased the immunization coverage (six childhood
diseases) from 2Z in 1985-86 to over 602 in 1991. While the use of Oral
Rehydration Solution against diarrhea has reduced or postponed infant and



- 8 -
child mortality and many programs have been initiated to address such
important problems as acute resptratory infections (ARI) and maternal
mortality and morbidity, the proportion of women receiving at least one
prenatal visit remains at a low of 35Z and the proportion of deliveries
receiving skilled care is no more than 252 (the number of trained Traditional
Birth Attendants (TBAs) now is a little over 12,000, out of a total of
62,000). The BFS 1989 shows that the number of children desired by women has
come down to about three, demonstrating an unmet demand for FP services. The
distribution of women who want no more children or have been sterilized is
shown in Annex 16.
Sector Development Issues
1.27      Issues of concern to GOB and to the IDA-led Consortium of donors
arising during formulation and implementation of the first three Projects but
resolved satisfactorily included the determination of demographic targets, the
correct calculation of the required contraceptive mix, the establishment of a
FP and MCH service balance, and questions regarding the appropriate use of
several "incentives". They are discussed in more detail in Annex 17.
1.28      Key issues currently requiring substantial attention in respect of
FP and health programs include the quality of care, use of FP and health
facilities, human resource development, organization and management of FP and
health services, operations of NGOs, and financing of the sector programs.
These issues have been analyzed in detail in the extensive Project Completion
Reports of the first two projects (paras 1.43 and 1.46) and the lessons
learned are being applied in the ongoing dialogue between GOB and the
Consortium.
1.29      Quality of Care.  Over the last 16 years, GOB's focus has been on
extending FP services and limited attention has been paid to the quality of
health services. The quality of FP/MCH clinical services continues to be
addressed through the FPCST. The currently unacceptable level of quality of
health care is related to several factors: inadequately trained personnel, an
absence of professional standards, poor patient-doctor interaction, inadequate
medical supplies, a non-operational referral system, insufficient diagnostic
facilities, substandard physical facilities and scant career prospects.
Quality assurance requires: development of standards for health workers based
on outcome measures, orientation of health managers and service providers to
these new standards, development of reporting and recording forms, formation
of a quality assurance resource center, introduction of a medical audit and
other measures (para 2.38).
1.30      Use of FP and Health Facilities.  A continuing problem is that the
use of PP and health facilities, which were built up at significant cost,
remains unbalanced with some facilities highly overused and others underused
(Annex 18). In 1985-90, the average daily patient load was over 1,250 in each
of the 8 medical college hospitals, 300 per district hospital (14 in all), and
175 per UHC (349 in the country). In 1989, the bed occupancy rate of UHCs was
less than half that in the hospitals. Apart from epidemiological patterns of
disease and from cultural determinants (e.g. female literacy, female social
mobility, etc.), the complex issue of use of FP and health services is related
to management capacity, skills and knowledge of service providers, relation of
providers with clients, quality of care, adequate supplies, and community
involvement. In view of this, a holistic approach to the problem was agreed
upon as followss initially, in several districts (50 upazilas) this issue will



- 9 -
be addressed in-depth, ensuring the availability of medical and FP supplies,
improving diagnostic facilities, enhancing motivation and commitment of the
work force, encouraging community participation, strengthening the district
and upazila managerial capacity, promoting more effective client-workers
relationships, and many other steps, such as improving the effectiveness of
the referral system (managerially and medically a notoriously complicated
issue) (para 2.59).
1.31      Human Resource Development.  The general focus so far has been to
upgrade the quality and number of staff at upazila level and below through
preservice and inservice training. While these efforts have largely
succeeded, there is an increasingly stronger case to focus current attention
on medical and nursing personnel. Earlier programs and projects did not
address these cadres, with the result that they have slipped badly over the
last decade and the quality and quantity of medical and nursing care are in an
unacceptable state. The curriculum lacks the essential emphasis on maternal
and neonatal health, clinical contraception, management of FP and health
services and poverty-related diseases, e.g., tuberculosis and leprosy.   Field
training in PHC and preventive medicine is vital and the planned reorientation
of medical and nursing training away from urban curative care, towards rural
health and community medicine, thus is of utmost priority. At the same time,
GOB is still to formulate a comprehensive overall human resource development
plan for the FP and health sector. Such a plan would address central matters
like needs assessment, education, training, employment of women at all levels,
career development opportunities, and other areas neglected in the past (para
2.70).
1.32      Organization and Management of FP and Health Services.
Organization of FP and health services has attracted considerable attention in
recent times. The proposal to integrate the two services, approved in 1980,
and even a more modest subsequent proposal, have not worked satisfactorily.
Despite this setback, the case for integrating both services is strong due to
the close relationship of the two services, sharing of common physical
facilities and complementarity between job functions of staff at various
levels. But a phased approach is necessary. Moreover, integration alone will
not be the solution. The sector is too centralized, much of the management
cadre (22Z) is vacant, and frequent charnges of senior staff, often away from
their fields of expertise, indicate weak personnel management. Highly
insufficient travel and daily allowances impede village-based care. Concerns
exist as to GOB's capacity to manage the envisaged substantial expansion of
the FP and health programs and the increasing sectoral resources under the
Fourth Plan. The planning units in the MOHFW are to be strengthened and
planning cells to be set up within both FP and Health Directorates. These
will be linked to the envisaged Health Economics and Financing Pilot Project
and the MIS of both FP and Health; the data from the EPI Surveillance System,
the demographic and health surveys, the CPSs every two years, the 1994 BFS and
the 1991/1992 Census will be fed into these. Departmental work plans will be
established by the planning units. The MOHFW supports an analytical exercise
to assess the combined capacity of all the various units as part of a Sector
Reorganization Plan in response to the above-mentioned concerns (para 2.69).
Combined efforts would be made by a team of expatriate and Bangladeshi
management specialists and FP/health personrnel.
1.33      Operations of NGOs.  While many NGOs are in place to provide FP and
health services, GOB's approval procedures for activities have constrained
their effectiveness. Recently GOB established an NGO Bureau under the



- 10 -
President's Secretariat to provide a one-stop approval system for NGOs
receiving foreign funds. The system is intended to avoid the complicated and
costly interministerial process that NGOs had to deal with in the past. Some
time will be needed to assess the effectiveness of the new system (para 2.81).
1.34      Financing of FP and Health Services.  In the Fourth Five-Year Plan
(1990-95), GOB has provided for a substantial increase in its allocations to
the health and FP subsectors. During the previous three Plans (1975-90).
investments in health and FP roughly doubled every five years, a trend
reflected in the total cost of the previous projects (US$45.7, 110.0 and 213.8
million, successively). This raises concerns regarding the long-term
sustainability of these very significant increases (Annex 1 analyzes this
concern in the social sectors in Bangladesh further). From a perspectl-- of
substance, the need for these increases is inherent in the objective of
expanding coverage of FP and health services. Paradoxically, in this
particular sector, as services become more effective they necessarily lead to
greater expenditures: on the one hand, this is due to the increased demand
consequent upon better care and the resultant greater longevity, in turn
leading to higher medical "maintenance" costs; on the other hand, while unit
costs in Bangladesh still remain extremely low (e.g., US$0.11 per person per
annum for medicines, see Annex 19), the increased costs are due to population
growth, the planned doubling of service coverage (up to 10? of population) and
the wider range of services.
1.35      In its Third Five-Year Plan (1985-90), GOB had allocated 5.68? of
its overall investment budget to the sector (2.2? for health and 3.48Z for
FP). In its Fourth Plan, GOB intends to invest 7.3Z (US$793.4 million) of its
total Plan outlay, in health (2.82), and FP (4.52). During the review of the
overall public expenditure plan of GOB and the subsequent three year "rolling
plan", the FP and health sector has been protected from the cuts made across
the board. Thus US$501.5 million was allocated to the FP and health sector
for 1991-94. This amounts to more than 60% of the original five-year plan
allocation, indicating that the sectoral allocation for the three year period
has not been cut back and in fact been marginally increased (Annex 1, p. 9).
1.36      GOB has allocated sufficient overall investment budgets to the
sector in line with the requirements of the proposed Fourth Project. The
operational capacity of the sectors to absorb the increased funding has been
established (for managerial absorptive capacity, see paras 1.32 and 2.67-
2.72). At issue remains intrasectoral priority setting leading to appropriate
allocations (Annex 20 lists low priority components within the sector). At
present, GOB's limited capacity to apply cost-effectiveness and efficiency
criteria to the sector remains a serious obstacle for such intrasectoral
prioritization. Therefore, a new Health Economics and Financing Pilot Project
in the MOHFW is to be set up for assisting GOB to build up its analytical
capabilities in both macro- and micro-economics and financing of health and FP
services (on recurrent costs, see para 2.73). The pilot project will also
address the technically complex issue of cost recovery in health care and lay
the ground work for the introduction of a rational system of user charges.
D. Objectives and Strategy under the Fourth Five-Year Plan
1.37      Introduction.  More favorable circumstances than in the past
prevailed at the time of formulating the Fourth Plan. Fertility decline has
set in. EPI covers the whole country with a remarkable increase in the levels
of immunization. A basic FP and health infrastructure now caters to most of



- 11 -
the country. GOB recognizes that the original target of NRR of 1 by 2000 is
unattainable and acknowledges that the MCH component of the FP/MCH program is
still weak. GOB is determined to make much moze progress in the Fourth Five-
Year Plan.
1.38      Oblectives.  The demographic objectives of the Fourth Plan are to
increase the CPR from around 332 to 50X and consequently bring about a
fertility decline of 27Z, i.e., TFR falling from just under 5 to 3.3 and CBR
from 38.2 to 30.1 per 1000 in the period 1990-95. However, based on past
experience and the maximum achieved by some of the best performing FP programs
in the world, more realistic targets would be a CPR of 45-50., a CBR of 30-35
per 1,000 and a TFR of around 4. The proposed contraceptive mix (Annex 21)
relies heavily on sterilization of both sexes, expected to be 33? of all
methods by 1995, and even more heavily on other female methods (52X).
1.39      Objectives for crucial MCH and health indicators include reducing
the IMR from 110 to 80-85 per 1,000, the MMR from 6-7 to 4-5 per 1,000, the
UMR from 188 to 140-145 per 1,000, neonatal mortality from 72 to 55-65 per
1,000 and the CDR from 14 to 12 per 1,000, all from 1990 to 1995. Life
expectancy at birth is targeted at 55 years by 1995. Prenatal care would cover
50-602 of pregnant women (currently 35Z) and 40-501 of all deliveries would be
attended by trained personnel (currently 20Z). PHC services are to be
extended to 80? of the population and a beginning made to address PHC for the
urban poor with an emphasis on poverty-related diseases.
1.40      Strategy.  The broad strategy for achieving the FP and health goals
has been defined by GOB as an intensified and concerted effort at improving PP
and health services at grassroots levels through better management and a
comprehensive approach. This strategy could be briken down into the following
elements: (a) conversion of the population progrp-i progressively into a social
movement; (b) decentralized and functionally integrated services for FP and
health; (c) improved effectiveness and efficiency of management practices,
better supervision, higher quality of care, and a wider range of services; (d)
improved satellite clinics; (e) an intensified and expanded MCH program; (f) a
functional two-way referral system; (g) adequate and appropriate human
resources in FP/MCH, health care and nursing; (h) improved supply systems and
local production of esst-tial drugs, vaccines and contraceptives; (i)
sharpened communication programs to cover FP and health (j) active involvement
of and cooperation with NGOs; (k) community participation; (1) increased
financial allocations to cost-effective FP and health care; and (m) improved
social, health and nutritional status of women and their greater participation
in PP and health activities.
1.41      The strategy would be implemented through four major areas of
concentrationt family planning service delivery, including most MCH services,
FP and MCH training, facilities and supplies; health service delivers,
including medical and nursing education and research, disease control, PHC and
improved health facilities; supportive activities, including managerial and
financial capacity, quality assurance, information systems, and community-
oriented programs; and women's programs and nutrition.



- 12 -
E. External Financing
1.42      Assistance to FP and health activities in Bangladesh has been
provided through bilateral donors, specialized agencies, and the IDA-led
Consortium of donors. While most of the major public and private donors
active in FP/health have assisted Bangladesh at one time or another, the
public agencies supporting MOHFW on a continuous basis are UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO,
ADB, USAID and IDA. UNICEF contributes about US$40 million annually,
supporting child health, e.g., immunization, essential drugs and nutrition.
UNFPA's country program amounts to roughly US$5.5 million a year and focuses
largely on FP service delivery and population education, while WHO is MOHFW's
main internatiotnal source of technical assistance in the health field,
supporting a wide array of projects ranging from PHC and MCH to infectious
diseases and technical skills for drug testing (approximate annual budget of
US$5.0 million). ADB recently agreed to support a project costing US$58
million, mainly on curative medical care (secondary and tertiary hospitals,
health technology institutes, medical equipment), but also including support
for health planning capacities, nursing education and indigenous medicine.
USAID currently supports the largest FP program of all donor agencies, with an
annual outlay of nearly US$ 25-27 million, more than 75? of which is direct
funding to NGOs and the rest to MOHFW. USAID's main support is for the supply
of contraceptives, social marketing, logistics, FP service delivery, NGOs,
management information and evaluation, EPI and technical support.
1.43      S'nce 1975, IDA has supported three projects for a total credit
amount of US$124.9 million. Under the First Project (Cr. 533-BD), the credit
of US$15 million was fully disbursed (total project cost of US$45.7 million).
A Project Performance Audit Report (No. 6303) was completed in June 1986.
Under the Second Project (Cr. 921-BD), about 96? of the credit of US$32
million (total project cost of US$110 maillion) was disbursed. A Project
Completion Report (No. 7792) was prepared in May 1989. The Third Population
and Family Welfare Project (Cr. 1649-BD) provided IDA financing of US$77.9
million (total project cost of US$213.8 million), of which US$50.4 million had
been disbursed as of December 31, 1990. Australia, Canada, Germany (GTZ and
KfW), Norway and the United Kingdom have cofinanced all three projects; the
Netherlands, the second and third projects; and Sweden, the first and second
projects. For details about the projects and their compoxients see Annex 22.
1.44      The Fourth Five-Year Plan extends from 1990 to 1995 while the
Fourth Population and Health Project covers the period 1992-96. Almost all of
the project components and subcomponents coincide with those of the GOB's
Five-Year Plan. This reflects IDA's and Consortium's very considerable input
into the formulation of the Plan itself, through extensive and detailed
consultations between MOHFW and the Planning Commission on the one hand and
IDA and the Consortium members on the other. These consultations took place
between 1988-1990, on a continuous basis by PPO in Dhaka, as well as through
five major GOB-donor workshops and conferences in Bangladesh and Geneva,
preceding the formulation of the GOB's Plan Document and the IDA Consortium's
Project Brief Document. This close cooperation is expected to enhance the
effective and appropriate absorption of the project funds. Since most of the
(sub)components are intended to strengthen the GOB's infrastructure and its FP
and health service delivery system, they are expected to continue beyond the
Plan period. However, the IDA, cofinancier and GOB funds proposed for this
operation are tied to specific items and activities within the framework of
thq project.



- 13 -
P. IDA's Role and Sector Lending Strategy
1.45      IDA has long been a major supporter of Bangladesh's PP and MCH
programs. In recent years, IDA has become the leader of a donor Consortium
comprising seven external donors and three multilateral executing agencies.
In that capacity, IDA has helped GOB mobilize substantial financial and
technical support for FP and health programs and to coordinate the donors'
assistance to this sector critical to the country's socio-economic
development. It has been instrumental in keeping the Consortium from breaking
up over potenttally damaging issues such as compensation payments to
sterilization acceptors. IDA has contributed significantly to the current
consensus as to the priority of the population programs. For the Fourth
Population and Health Project, IDA has been able to enlist the support of four
additional donor agencies. Furthermore, USAID has observer status in the
Consortium, while ADB will informally participate in the Consortium from
September 1991 onwards. The Bangladesh Population and Health Consortium for
the Fourth Project thus would comprise as its members Australia, Belgium,
Canada, the EEC,. Germany (both KfW and GTZ), Japan, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden and the United Kingdom, with USAID as observer and ADB as an informal
participant and potential member; UNFPA, UNICEF and WHO would act as executing
agencies to the Consortium for specific project components. Annex 23 gives a
detailed description of the Consortium and its workings.
1.46      As documented in the Project Completion Reports, the first two
projects have been implemented satisfactorily and have helped GOB establish a
viable population program. After a 10-month delay in project effectiveness,
the current Third Project is moving ahead and expected to be completed by the
end of 1991. Following Board approval in 1989, sizable savings have been
allocated to the purchase of contraceptive supplies and rehabilitation of
health facilities. The main lessons learned, pertaining to the importance of
formative evaluations, a participatory GOB-donor approach to strategy and
program formulation, a strong IDA presence in the field, and the need for
better management practices and for a long-term commitment to the sector, have
been incorporated into the project design and, indeed, into the very process
of project formulation.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Strategies
2.1       In line with the twin national goals of Health for All and
fertility reduction leading to an NRR of 1 by the turn of the century or as
soon as possible thereafter, the major objectives of the proposed project are
to: (a) reduce fertility by increasing the CPR to 45-50Z; (b) lower morbidity
and mortality in children under five; (c) improve maternal care and ensure
safer deliveries thereby reducing maternal mortality from the current 6-8 to
4-5 per 1,000 live births; (d) reduce disability, morbidity and mortality from
common poverty-related diseases; (e) enhance the nutritional status of women
and children; and (f) improve effectiveness and efficiency in the planning and
delivery of FP and health services to accelerate the achievement of the above
objectives. The project seeks to achieve these objectives in the following
manner.
(a) Reduced fertility would be achieved by increasing the CPR through
improved access to FP/MCH services by outreach visits, satellite
clinics, and the enlarged network of FWCs and through ensuring
timely supply and providing a wider range of contraceptives.
(b) Lower morbidity and mortality of children under five would be
achieved by expanding EPI coverage and strengthening programs of
diarrheal disease control (CDD), ARI control and nutritional
supplementation by Vitamin A.
(c) Improved maternal care and reducer! maternal mortality would be
achieved by: training TBAs; screeining and referring high risk
pregnancies: strengthening anteratal, natal and postnatal services;
supporting a special maternal aad neonatal health care project; and
strengthening obstetric and gynecological services at UHCs and
district hospitals.
(d) Reduced disability and morbidity -,account of poverty-related
diseases would be achieved by stre.vthening programs relating to
tuberculosis and leprosy control, vector-borne diseases, enteric
diseases, and worm infestation.
(e)  Improved nutritional status of mothers and children would be
achieved by distributing Vitamin A mainly for infection and
blindness control, producing iodized salt for goiter control,
dispensing ferrous iron to pregnant mothers, and strengthening the
National Nutrition Council to enhance its leadership capacity for
planning, implementing and monitoring niutritional promotion
uctivities for mothers and children.
(f) Improved effectivenees and efficiency of FP and health services
would be achieved by: strengthening the planning capability of
MOHFW; improving quality of services; supporting a project on
rational use of drugs; improving utilization of UHCs and FWCs;
strengthening management and supervision of the FP and health
program; encouraging a well-coordinated approach to communication
through interpersonal, group and mass media; continuing the three
women's programs; strengthening management information systems;
improving epidemiological surveillance; reorienting PDEU;



. 15 -
reorganizing the FP and health program; promoting NGOs; supporting
innovative projects; setting up of a Health Economics and Financing
Pilot Project; constructing a Population and Health Building, and
other related measures.
2.2       Women in Development (WID) Strategy.  In accordance with GOB's
recent initiatives to mainstream women into development, the following
guidelines were identified by the Consortium in order to improve women's
access to health and FP services and to increase their participation in the
delivery of these services through the Fourth Population and Health Projectt
(a) the project focus should be broadened from female reproductive
health to all aspects of female health and the health facilities
supported by the project should be expanded to deliver the range of
services required by females sta;ting from birth;
(b) women should be represented at all levels of the PP and health
system, in all committees, and in project implementation units and
should be given increased access to training and to scholarship and
fellowship programs;
(c) gender equity should be considered in promotion decisions within
the Directorates of Health and of FP;
(d) field-level female workers should be provided with adequate
transportation arrangements and safe accommodations;
(e) personnel statistics, baseline surveys and operational research to
be undertaken through the project should systematically include
gender-disaggregated data;
(f) field-level workers should not be compelled to meet FP acceptor
targets;
(g) the IEM program focus should be broadened to address both men and
women on such topics as age of marriage, birth spacing, maternal
and female nutrition, and contraceptive methods;
(h) gender awareness topics should be included in basic and in-service
training curricula of field workers of the Directorates of Health
and of FP;
(i) a gender strategy should be included in all NGO activities
supported by the project; and
(j) gender equity should be included as a topic in the terms of
reference for all local and international consultants financed
under the project.
Broad performance indicators for monitoring the WID strategy are set out in
annex 24. They will be developed in more detail during project
implementation. Progress will be monitored during review missions for the
project (paras 4.12 and 4.13).
2.3       Intersectoral Population Activities Strategy.  Improving healt' and
reducing fertility depend not only on interventions in the FP and health

sectors; rather, factors such as improving female and general education,
reducing poverty and assuring equity in socio-economic development all
interrelate with and contribute to the success of efforts in the FP and health
sector. In view of their importance and size, intersectoral population
measures in sectors including '.ndustry, agric_lture, education and women's
development are proposed to b4 pursued as a separate project. However, the
current project will provide bridge financing for at least two years or longer
to the three women's programs that have been an integral part of the previous
population projects for two years, by which time the programs are expected to
become part of the comprehensive Intersectoral Population Activities Project.
2.4       Overall Strategy.  The Fourth Population and Health Project has
been designed to incorporate the assistance of most of the donors to the GOB's
FP and health program for the Fourth Five-Year Plan. This strategy reflects
the lesson learned from the three previous projects regarding the importance
of a participatory GOB-donor approach to strategy and program formulation. It
is intended to ensure that the support provided through the project is in line
with agreed GOB and donor priorities, minimize GOB's aid management burden,
and prevent donor competition in the FP and health sector. Apart from
continuing relevant activities under the Third Project, the Fourth Project
will finance additional PP and health activities from GOB's Fourth Plan and
extend into the Fifth Plan. The project will particularly respond to the
continuing need to improve the quality and use of the GOB's PP and health
service delivery systems and will strongly support new initiatives to improve
maternal health.
B. Summary Project Description
2.5       The project, which covers a five-year time slice of GOB's
development program in population and health (1992-96), has four main
components: (a) strengthening FP/MCH service delivery; (b) strengthening
health services delivery; (c) improving supportive activities to the delivery
of FP and health services; and td) women's and nutrition programs. It will
strengthen FPIMCH service delivery by improving access to PP services,
strengthening MCH services, enhancing clinical service delivery and FP/MCH
quality assurance, imparting in-service training of upazila and district staf
in FP/MCH, construction and renovation of FP/MCH facilities, and marketing of
contraceptives through the private sector. The project will strengthen health
service delivery through increasing the range of maternal and neonatal health
care, strengthening nursing and medical education, introducing medical quality
assurance, supporting medical research, strengthening disease prevention and
control, developing urban primary health care, continuing and expanding school
health programs, improving district and upazila health facilities, and
improving the utilization of URCs. In support of the first two components,
the project will assist in strengthening information systems, improving FP and
health management, expanding communications programs, supporting NGO
activities, and developing innovative projects. Finally, the project will
assist continuation of the three women's programs financed under the previous
three projects and will strengthen and develop the National Nutrition Council,
in anticipation of a substantial program of nutrition interventions. Each of
the components listed below is described fully in project-related Project
Proformas, for which GOB approval is a condition of credit effectiveness. The
costs indicated reflect base costs exclusive of contingencies.

C. Detailed Project Description
Component A. Strengthening of FP/MCH Service Delivery (US$321.7 Million)
2.6       Component A will support GOB efforts to expand and strengthen the
entire range of services of its FP and MCH program. This includes more
emphasis on providing outreach services and supervision, ensuring
contraceptive supplies, enlarging the satellite clinic program, and enhancing
the quality of clinical services. It also covers all training activities,
2     This subcomponent is discussed in detail in Chapter IV,
Implementation and Supervision, para 4.10.
a     Cost estimate is inclusive of B(2) (iv).



- 20 -
including TBAs, and renovation and construction of new FP and MCH facilities.
Finally, it supports provision of contraceptives through the private sector.
A.(l) Improving Access to FP Services
2.7       Outreach Services.  Currently, about 16,500 male HAs and about
20,000 female FWAs provide outreach services. Vacancies exist for 5,000 HA
positions. GOB has agreed to fill these by female workers and gradually
replace the majority of male HAs by females. GOB also plans to recruit an
additional 3,500 FWAs. It has been agreed that a common job description will
be drawn up for all female field workers (FWAs and HAs) and that the present
geographical area/population covered by these workers will be divided into
two; each worker will be placed in independent charge of one area, thus
reducing by half the number of households she/he covers. The supervisor-
worker ratio under the arrangement will work out at 1:5, which is manageable.
Agreement was reached with GOB during negotiations that, by January 1, 1995,
it will employ qualified women to fill at least 4,500 of the 5,000 vacant HA
positions in its outreach services and, by March 31, 1992, prepare and furnish
to IDA for comments a plan on the recruitment of HAs including the appropriate
proportions of male and female staff, and subsequently carry out such plan
taking into account IDA's comments.
2.8       In view of the recurrent cost implications in expanding the HA and
FWA cadres, GOB plans to use female members of the Village Defense Party
(VDP), Swanirvar (NGO) and the Mothers' Clubs and Women's Cooperatives to
function as an interface between FWAs and clients. These volunteers will need
additional training, a clear job description, supervisory support, and
community support. The project will assist GOB plans to use the volunteer
force; components on community participation (para 2.80), NGOs (paras 2.81-
2.82) and innovative projects (para 2.83) will be used to supplement the
strength of field workers.
2.9       In view of the strategic importance of female health and FP
workers, GOB will absorb increasingly the cost of their salaries. GOB will
finance 11,500 HAs and 13,500 FWAs and the Consortium, upto 5000 female HAs
and 10,000 FWAs (partly from the proceeds of fertilizer sales in Bangladesh
under a separate agreement between the Government of Canada and GOB).
Currently Consortium financing accounts for 14,500 out of 20,000 FWAs. The
project will also finance field worker supplies as these supplies will
directly contribute to field worker efficiency and proper storage of
contraceptives. The recruitment of female health and FP workers will be done
in line with the human resource development plan (para 2.70).
2.10      FWC-based Services.  The present sanctioned strength of each FWC is
one each MA, FWV, pharmacist, aya and peon-cum-night watchman. The post of
pharmacist is often vacant and found to be superfluous. Due to increased
demand, a single FWV can no longer cater to the full needs of her area in
providing prenatal, natal, and postnatal care, inserting IUDs, providing
injectables, etc. The project will therefore support a second FWV to each FWC
in lieu of the pharmacist. The few pharmacists posted at FWCs will be
deployed at UHCs and district hospitals. During the project, 2,000 FWVs will
be trained and posted to districts and upazilas where performance has been
comparatively poor. The project provides for all operational costs for the
newly recruited FWVs.



- 21 -
2.11      Supervision.  The supervisory tiers developed under the Third
Project, i.e. of Senior FWVs, Assistant Family Planning Officers (APPOs), and
divisional directors, will be continued and strengthened. A major weakness at
district level will be removed by renewing the post of Assistant Director
(MCH/FP) and by the PWVs supervising the FWAs. Recruiting for the 460
sanctioned positions of AFPOs will be completed under the project (168 had
been recruited by February 1991). The mobility of supervisory staff will also
be improved through a suitable mechanism, such as the payment of expenses
towards the hire-purchase of suitable transport, e.g., motorcycles, rickshaw-
vans, etc. and/or adequate travel/daily allowances (para 2.13). Procurement
of 22,500 bicycles will be continued for field workers. The type of transport
for three female categories, i.e. FWVs, Senior FWVs and female M0s, remains
problematic. GOB will prepare a working paper on transport provisions and on
payment of travel-related expenses or suitable alternatives for review by IDA
and the Cofinanciers and subsequent implementation of the agreed
recommendations (para 2.13). During negotiations, agreement was reached that
GOB will establish transportation arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, for FP
and health field workers to attend satellite clinics.
2.12      Provision of Contraceptives and Other FP Supplies.  The project
will finance the purchase of contraceptives and other FP supplies to ensure
their uninterrupted availability. The MOHFW has improved its logistics
management to an extent by addressing key issues such as forecast of demand,
timely procurement, in-country distribution, and logistics monitoring and
supervision. Based on the targeted CPR of 45-50Z to be achieved by 1995 (para
1.38) and the mix of contraceptive methods envisaged (Annex 21), GOB has
projected requirements for contraceptives and nedical and surgical requisites
(MSR) for the Fourth Plan period as follows:
Contraceptive Method Number of Acceptors 4 Contraceptives or MSRs
(millions)             Required (millions)
oral pills (low dose)       12.50                     188.0  cycles
Condoms                      7.20                  1,088.0  pieces
Injectables                  6.50                     32.5  doses
IUDs                         2.89                      2.89 pieces
Sterilization                2.08              MSR for 1.24 Tubectomies
0.84 Vasectomies
These requirements would be reviewed quarterly to reflect the emerging program
needs through an established GOB mechanism. The condoms required are planned
to be procured and supplied directly to the Social Marketing Company (SMC)
(para 2.28). While high-dose oral contraceptive pills are currently still
used in the program, eventually only low-dose pills will be procured under the
project, following a phased transition period. Apart from those described in
para 2.18, new contraceptive methods to be introduced up to 1997 may be funded
as well (para 2.83 and Annex 21). Agreement was reached with GOB during
negotiations that a fertility survey will be carried out by December 31, 1994,
and a contraceptive prevalence survey will be carried out every two years,
commencing by March 31, 1993, both in accordance with terms of reference
acceptable to IDA, and the results furnished to IDA for comments.

A.(2) Strengthening MCH Services
2.13      Satellite Clinics.  The project will significantly expand the
satellite clinic system which possesses great potential to deliver
comprehensive MCH and FP services nearer to the community. To maximize the
clinics' effectiveness, some of the requirements that the project will support
are training and supervision of FWC and upazila staff, supply of essential
equipment, Drug and Dietary Supplement (DDS) kits and transport. NIPORT will
include a module on satellite clinics as part of training of all upazila
staff. The disease patterns and drug requirements at satellite clinics will
be closely monitored ar,d analyzed after a year to assess any modificetion in
the drug supply that may be needed.  To increase the mobility of ke, staff,
the project will provide for special payment of travel-related expenses and/or
hire-purchase of appropriate transport, such as bicycles, motorcycles,
rickshaws, rickshaw-vans and boats. A condition of credit effectiveness is
that GOB will establish transportation arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, for
FP and health field workers to attend satellite clinics.
2.14      Essential MCH Drugs and Equipment.  The requirement of DDS kits for
the project duration is estimated to be around 130,000 for stationary clinics
and another 100,000 to 200,000 for satellite clinics, i.e. 5 kits a year per
functional FWC, 10 kits a year per MCH unit, and 4 kits a year per satellite
clinic. The project will firance the supply of DDS kits, to the required
extent, starting with around .10,000 and reviewing in 1993-94, the rate of
absorption of this initial allocation. GOB will keep accurate records of
attendance and types of cases at the clinics and analyze the records on a
sample basis at the end of each year to facilitate review of the types,
quantities and appropriateness of drugs needed starting in 1992. The contents
of kits for satellite clinics will then be suitably recalculated and modified.
The project will also finance MCH and midwifery kits at the rate of at least
one kit per service facility. Apart from the requirements of new centers,
replacement equipment will be provided to 2,725 MCH service facilities and to
2,925 midwifery rooms.
A.(3) Enhancing Clinical Service Delivery and FP/MCH Quality Assura--3
2.15      FPCST.  Periodic reviews of the performance of the FPCST have
highlighted not only its usefulness in improving the quality of clinical PP
services but also the need to widen the scope of the teams. Under the
project, the teams will therefore also review clinical MCH services. They
will assist with internalizing quality of care supervision of clinical FP and
MCH service delivery at district level and below by linking up with the
departments of obstetrics/gynecology of the medical colleges (para 2.35). The
subcomponents on Medical Quality Assurance (para 2.38), technical assistance
for Health Care Quality Assurance (para 2.86) and maternal and neonatal health
care (para 2.30) would be implemented in close cooperation with the FPCST.
Staffing of the FPCST is to be reorganized. The Director (Clinical Services)
will be the Project Director of the FPCST, which will comprise eight teams,
each composed of one national medical and one national nurse consultant. The
expatriate consultants, a physician and a nurse, will serve as counterparts to
the Project Director. A national level committee will be constituted to
monitor and advise on the teams' activities and MOHFW action, as necessary.
Technical support to the FPCST will be provided by UNFPA, with the support of
an international resource group providing external backstopping.



- 23 -
2.16      Support to FP Clinical Services Delivery.  The project will support
the provision of FP clinical services. Whereas increasing priority will be
given to non-clinical FP methods such as oral contraceptives and condoms,
clinical FP services will remain a very important factor in reducing fertility
and enhancing maternal and child health for a long time to come. The clinical
FP services will include vasectomies and tubectomies, menstrual regulation,
IUD insertions, provision of injectables and implants, clinic-based
supervision and examination of women using oral contraceptives and all other
FP services for which an institutional facility is necessary. The project
will finance operational expenditures, staff salaries, equipment and
transportation connected with clinical FP services.
2.17      Mohamedpur Fertility Services and Training Center.  This clinical
center has been developed to promote a variety of FP services, including
menstrual regulation, clinical contraceptive training and adaptive
contraceptive research. The center will give comprehensive FP services to
15,000 clients annually, MCH services to all women and children visiting the
center, and clinical training to 1,145 female physicians and FP/MCH cadres.
Laboratory facilities are planned for evaluating side-effects of clinical
contraception. The project will finance the continuation and strengthening of
the center in terms of salaries and allowances, equipment and transport.
2.18      Introduction of Contraceptive Technologies.  GOB proposes to
introduce laparoscopic techniques for tubectomies, expand the implant program,
and introduce nonscalpel vasectomies. It has been agreed with GOB that new
and existing contraceptive technologies will be introduced after proper
evaluation and in a phased manner, given the priority need to improve quality
and coverage of services. Introduction of laparoscopic techniques will be
based on phase IV clinical trials to assess the types of personnel best able
to learn the techniques, associated training requirements and potential of
laparoscopy for increasing the acceptance of tubectomy. Expansion of implants
is proposed to be taken up for 1993, while addressing such issues as training
of relevant staff. Nonscalpel vasectomy is already being supported by USAID,
and GOB proposes to extend it to at least four government clinics. The GOB
has agreed to consult IDA and the Consortium before each new phase of
expansion and to carry out a midterm review. The Bangladesh Fertility
Research Program (BFRP) will, among others, be responsible for evaluations and
clinical trials. The project provides for purchase of laparoscopes, implants,
training costs, IEC activities and evaluation, as well as for research and
development expenditures by BFRP and other research institutes. Additional
funding from the Innovative Activities component may be used if necessary
(para 2.83).
2.19      IUD Kits.  To ensure the effectiveness and smooth delivery of IUD
insertion services, the project will finance the purchase of 5,581 IUD kits,
i.e. one per clinical IUD service facility in the country.
A.(4) Imparting Inservice Training in FP/MCH to Upazila and District Staff
2.20      Training of FP/MCH Staff through NIPORT.  During the Third Plan
period, NIPORT advanced a long way toward building infrastructure, improving
capacity utilization and, to some extent, the quality of training, and
conducting research. Some of the steps taken were: introduction of Mobile
Training Teams' for trainer training at FWVTIs and RTCs, links with Bangladesh
Rural Advancement Committee for treining methodology and management, and a



- 24 -
more skill-oriented curriculum. Despite the good progress, staff shortages
persist.
2.21      Integration is proposed of the 12 FWVTIs, 20 RTCs, and NIPORT into
a single "Institution" to impart collaborative training to program managers
and staff at all levels (Chart 3). The focus of NIPORT research will largely
be on training. A total of 28 program/training-related studies have been
planned for 1991-95. NIPORT will undertake logistics management training as
well as training of physicians on sterilization. About 67,000 personnel will
be trained during 1991-95, including about 9,100 program managers. NIPORT
will also organize mobile training teams to train 8,000 FPAs/AHIs at UHCs.
About 2,000 FWVs will undergo 18 months of basic training during the period
(para 2.10). Gender awareness topics will be included in basic and in-service
curricula of field workers.
2.22      The project will continue to finance NIPORT and its strengthening.
It will cover the addition of about 90 positions to NIPORT staff, replace 34
worn out vehicles and purchase 8 new jeeps. The existing three expatriate
consultants will be complemented by the addition ol a specialist in training-
related research and evaluation. An outdoor service unit for PP/MCH consisting
of one FWV, one midwife/nurse and two Grade IV staff will be established in
each of the 12 FWVTIs. Provision will be made for additional accommodations
for NIPORT.
2.23      Training of TBAs.  The training of TEAs initiated under the Third
Plan (10,000 so far) will be continued and expanded. In close cooperation
with UNICEF and complementing its funding, the project will support training
of a total of 48,000 TBAs (out of 52,000 yet to be trained). In addition, the
Senior FWVs will receive refresher training. The training management unit
established under the Third Plan will be continued. The number of project
officers will be increased from the present four to eight and training
allowances for all categories of personnel will be doubled from current
levels. The project officers will be supplied with vehicles on hire-purchase
basis. The training program will be closely monitored and evaluated with
special reference to: (i) appropriate referral of high-risk pregnancies; (ii)
safe delivery techniques; (iii) number of clients serviced annually by each
TBA; (iv) community acceptance and utilization of TBAs; and (v) impact of the
TBA project on MCH.
A.(5) Construction and Renovation of FP/MCH Facilities
2.24      Construction and Upgrading of FWCs and RDs.  Phased expansion of
the network of FWCs will continue. As of January 1991, of the 4,403 unions in
Bangladesh, 460 were served by UHCs, 1,275 by RDs (of which 310 have been
upgraded) and 2,500 by FWCs. A further 100 FWCs will be established in unions
curgently not having any FP or health facility and 500 RDs will be upgraded to
union FWC level. At the end of the Fourth Project, this will leave 68 unions
without any NWC or other facility and 465 RDs still needing to be upgraded. In
view of the importance of new or upgraded facilities being fully utilized for
FP and MCH services, agreement was reached with GOB during negotiations that a
survey of the physical condition and the utilization of existing FP and health
facilities will be carried out by September 30, 1992 and the results furnished
to IDA for comments.
2.25      The standard design for FWCs adopted in the previous projects and
modified slightly from time to time will be adopted for the Fourth Project.



- 25 -
All buildings will have reinforced roofing. The plinth level of the buildings
will be located above the highest flood level observed so far (1988). GOB has
agreed that utmost care will be observed in the selection of sites to ensure
maximum utilization, with final site selection subject to approval by IDA and
the Consortium. The standard equipment for each FWC includes one each of MCH
kit, Midwifery kit, IU) kit, TBA kit and FWC kit (items specially required by
the MA). The project will finance the procurement of these items in case they
are not provided by other agencies.  Costs for design and supervision of the
works, either through the Local Government Engineering Bureau (LGEB) or
proposed Maintenance anid Construction Management Unit (MCMU)-lec
consultancies, will also be funded by the project. Based on annual
maintenance requirements, 8,892 maintenance works for keeping FWCs operational
will be provided for during the Fourth Project period. The project will meet
502 and GOB the other 50Z of the maintenance costs. Rehabilitation of flood-
affected FWCs has been assigned to LGEB, which will continue during the
project. The proposed MCMU will be responsible for maintenance work (para
2.76). During negotiations, agreement was reached that GOB will furnish to
IDA the list of sites for construction of FWCs, selected based on criteria
acceptable to the Association and subsequently construct the centers in
accordance with standard design agreed with IDA.
2.26      Upgrading the Maternal and Child Health Training Institute.  The
Maternal and Child Health Training Institute at Azimpur and Lalkuti will he
upgraded to provide high quality, essential and comprehensive MCH/FP services
for the urban area of Dhaka city. It will train medical and paramedical
trainers and personnel, TBAs, field workers and FWVs in essential MCH and
obstetric functions (including the importance of breastfeeding). The existing
MCH hospital at Azimpur will be expanded and a new building constructed at
Lalkuti. The targeted training capacity is 60 staff per month, for which
expatriate assistance will be covered throughout the project. The project
provides for renovation of existing buildings; construction of additional
buildings; purchase of equipment, vehicles, and furni.ure; appointment of
additional staff; and maintenance of buildings. At Azimpur, the component
includes renovation and extension of the main building to provide an
additional 50 training beds as well as construction of a building for
extension of the present training and outpatient facility. The conatruction
component of Lalkuti envisages a 250-bed MCH training hospital, staff quarters
and a training hostel for 40 trainees.
2.27      Strengthening the FP/MCH Logistics and Supply System.  The project
will improve the efficiency of the logistics and supply system through a
number of interrelated activities. One is improving the capacity for
commodity forecasting and strengthening the existing procurement cell within
the FP Directorate with additional staff and training. The cell will work
with the LMIS at the central warehouse to prepare projections for
contraceptives, drugs and MSR. Seven additional posts will be supported.
Another is strengthening of the logistics system itself through training of
local staff. The third is provision of training for each of the four
divisional logistics monitoring teams. The last is addition of staff to the
central warehouse and regional warehouses (73) in view of the larger quantity
of supplies to be handled. The project will replace worn out transport of
various types. The service of a forecasting and procurement adviser under
Consortium (e.g. EEC) or USAID-financed schemes will be funded by the project,
with special reference to direct funding for condom supplies to SMC of
Bangladesh. Technical assistance and counterpart training for the procurement
of pharmaceuticals, including quality assurance, will be performed by a



- 26 -
pharmacist to be posted by UNICEF, while condom testing will be contracted out
to a technically competent agency. The project will support a maintenance
cell that will look after the upkeep of the warehouses, including those at
UHCs for storing FP and health supplies. Following a feasibility study to
identify the exact storage requirements for FP and health supplies at UHCe,
the project will finance the cost of such storage requirements. Agreement was
reached with GOB during negotiations that, by December 31, 1992, a feasibility
study to identify the storage requirements for FP and health supplies will be
carried out and the results furnished to IDA.
A.(6) Private Sector Contraceptives Marketing
2.28      Condom Supply through SMC and Other Suitable Organizations.  The
provision of condoms t'.rough the SMC currently accounts for about 382 of
contraceptive prevalence for condom use. SMC is a fully private agency, which
essentially acts as a private sector foundation and recovers its operating
costs by selling condoms at a minimal price. Condoms so far have been
supplied by USAID directly to SMC. USAID, however, is obliged to purchase
condoms domestically at a rate four times higher than could be obtained at
international competitive bidding level. Agreement has been reached with GOB
and USAID that the IDA Consortium will take over condom supply to the SMC
(totalling around 411 million pieces over the project period), thereby freeing
USAID resources for more productive activities in the sector and ensuring more
efficient use of resources for condom procurement. The principle of direct
supply will be maintained and the existing logistics system will continue to
be used as far as possible. Condom distribution through other suitable
organizations may be financed as well.
Component B. Strengthening Health Services Delivery (US$144.2 million)
2.29      Component B will expand the Consortium's support from the PP
subsector to the Health subsector. It will assist the establishment of
maternal and neonatal health care as a GOB priority area, reorient nursing and
medical education towards community and public health, and strengthen critical
disease prevention programs. It will also make a start with developing urban
and school health programs. Renovation and construction of health facilities
for MCH will be supported. A special effort will be made to improve the
utilization of health care facilities.
B.(l) Comprehensive Maternal and Neonatal Health Care Pilot Project
2.30      This component will develop comprehensive maternal and neonatal
health care services in selected districts. The major approaches proposed are
sound planning a-ad implementation of a combination of outreach and clinicaA
maternal health interventions, training of health personnel in epidemiological
and essential obstetric functions, use of IEM (e.g., regarding breastfeeding),
improved operational management and provision of essential supplies (e.g.
blood). All the 295 unions in the districts of Kushtia, Tangail, Feni and
Sirajganj/Pabna will be covered.
2.31      Beginning with a comprehensive baseline survey, the project will,
among others, include: continuation of refresher training of TBAs, special
training of physicians in abnormal maternity cases, development of IEM
materials, implementation of maternal referrals, outreach pregnancy-risk
assessments, logistics of blood supplies, intravenous fluids and other
essentials at UHC or union-level, etc. The Project Director will be assisted



- 27 -
by an expatriate MCH Advisor and MCH Coordinator. The project offers a unique
opportunity to integrate some of the strategies developed in other components
into one coherent program through coordination between the other related
prcjects like IEM, TBA training, medical and nursing education, and quality
assurance (paras 2.15 and 2.38). The entire cost of the component, including
administrative costs, training, research and evaluation, production of IEM
materials, transport and contingencies, will be met by the project. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with GOB that, by March 31, 1992, a
comprehensive baseline survey of maternal and neonatal health care in the
districts of Kushtia, Tangail, Feni and Sirajganj/Pabna will be initiated and
the results furnished to IDA for comments.
B.(2) Strengthening Nursing and Medical Education
2.32      The Fourth Five-Year Plan addresses the issue of reorienting the
Bangladesh medical and nursing education system to support more appropriate
health care priorities, including FP/MCH and PHC. This is planned to be
achieved through: (i) enhancing staff strength, trainer training, providing
stipends for students, and improving infrastructure; (ii) reinforcing the
training in obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics and community medicine in
medical and nursing colleges including rural field placements of students and
faculty; (iii) attempting community-oriented medical education through
innovative approaches; (iv) supporting specific national institutions already
active in this area, such as the Center for Medical Education (CME), NIPSOM,
Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), and
Institute for Public Health (IPH), and creating a new Institute for Mother and
Child Health.
2.33      Nursing Education.  To address the underdevelopment of nursing
education and services, the project will: (i) strengthen the College of
Nursing's post-basic program for sister-tutors, nurse administrators and nurse
supervisors; (ii) strengthen teaching and field work methods for implementing
the revised basic nursing curriculum in the 38 basic Nursing Institutes; (iii)
create additional essential nursing posts; (iv) expand continuing education
for nurses; (v) develop fourth-year options for the basic nursing curriculum;
(vi) develop rural education curriculum for field training of students in
urban Nursing Institutes; and (vii) develop an MIS for the Directorate of
Nursing (Annex 25). The project will finance additional staff, curriculum
development and library teaching materials and language training; construction
and rehabilitation of the nursing colle3e, Nursing Institutes, continuing
education centers, and rural health care training centers; equipment and
supplies; and technical assistance, including support by WHO. Agreement was
reached with GOB during negotiations that additional nurse positions in
Nursing Institutes and UHCs will be created by September 30, 1992, in
accordance with a schedule agreed with IDA.
2.34      Medical Education.  The eight Government medical college hospitals
and four post-graduate institute hospitals of the country endeavour to provide
tertiary health care services, including referral services for patients sent
by primary and secondary health care points. In fact, they have become so
overwhelmed by primary care patients and so derelict due to budgetary,
managerial and professional neglect that even primary care is no longer of
acceptable quality, let alone MCH or referral services. This component aims
to improve and consolidate the program for training doctors in MCH and
community medicine through improvement of physical facilities, modern but
appropriate technology, and better clinical training for relevant categories



- 28 -
of staff. At four medical college hospitals (Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Sylhet and
Salimullah), the project will support creation of mother and child welfare
outpatient rooms and 20-bed children's wards; repair of water supply, sewage
disposal and drainage systems; repair of electrical systems and equipment;
procurement of essential MCH eqt'ipment; and recruitment of personnel. It will
also finance renovation of the eight medical colleges and construction of
hostel facilities for female students with 50-60 units each, at the Barisal,
Sylhet, Mymensingh, Chittagong and Salimullah medical colleges.
2.35      The eight medical colleges will develop preventive MCH services and
training through their Model Clinics. The project will support the
Departments of Obstetrics and Pediatrics and the Model Clinics, which will
become the medical college hospitals' out-patient departments for MCH. The
functioning of the Model Clinics will be improved by placing them under the
Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics, appointing ten field
workers to each clinic, enlarging the scope of the services to encompass all
MCH services, and revising the MCH curriculum for interns (including emphasis
on such issues as breastfeeding). A new post of coordinator will be created
under the project. Other aspects to be supported are obstetric equipment and
supplies, journals and books, new posts (ranging from community obstetrician
to librarian), language training and study tours. Technical assistance will
be provided through WHO and institutional linkages overseas.
2.36      All vacancies in the Departments of Community Medicine in the eight
medical colleges will be filled. The project provides for training of
teachers in modern teaching methods, special allowances for field placements,
purchase of two 15-seat microbuses for each medical college, renovation of
seven field training sites, and construction of one new field training site
for Sher-e-Bangla Medical College. A full-time expatriate consultancy,
institutional linkages overseas, short-term visits by foreign experts and
study tours/fellowships by senior staff are expected to lend strength to this
component.
2.37       In each medical college, special units for medical education exist
under the authority of the CME in Dhaka. Under the project, the CME will
further develop those units, formulate a pilot scheme outside Dhaka for staff
development, and develop a capability to produce teaching materials and
prepare a manual for training teachers and evaluating medical education. The
Center will also implement the Human Resources Development Program (para 2.70)
and the Resource Center for 'Development of Health Care Quality Assurance'
(para 2.38), which will be funded by the project.
2.38      Medical Quality Assurance. A major effort will be made toward
improving the quality of health care to motivate use of FP and medical
services. Apart from strengthening FP clinical surveillance through linkages
with FPCST (para 2.15) and the rational use of drugs (para 2.42), the
development of quality assurance in medical practice will be undertaken. The
project will finance a quality assurance system at two levels for enabling
health professionals to tackle quality problems in health care delivery. At
the central level, the project will support a Resource Center at the CME (para
2.37). At the field level, it will finance 14 health institutions, selected
for the first phase of the project, where baseline assessments of patient care
will be conducted and task groups, with technical assistance, will identify
problems, set priorities, establish criteria and standards of good care, and
develop manuals, training and continuous evaluation. Linkages will be
established with local professional groups like the Bangladesh Medical



- 29 
Association and with overseas groups such as the International Society for
Quality Assurance in Health, the IHCAR of the Karolinska Institute and WHO.
2.39      Community-based Medical Education.  To develop medical personnel
suited to community needs, a pilot project will be supported. This
reorientation in training will follow the McMaster module of medical
education. It will focus on community diagnosis of health problems and their
prioritization using epidemiological tools; planning, implementation and
evaluation of community health programs; appropriate treatment of common
diseases; training of community health teams; supervision and coordination of
these health teams; facilitation of behavioral change and community
participation; and multisectoral efforts. The project will be located at a
medical college other than Dhaka and Chittagong, with technical support from
the International Network of Community-Oriented Medical Institutes. It will
mainly be funded from the Innovative activities sub-component (para 2.83).
2.40      Institute for Mother and Child Health.  The MCH programs of the GOB
directed at preventing and treating the illnesses of children under 15 and
women of reproductive age (50? and 20X respectively, i.e. 702 of total
population) still remain weak. A structural cause is the severe shortage of
MCH staff adequately trained in combined clinical and preventive pediatric and
obstetric skills; absence of institutional MCH leadership in the country
contributes to the low priority accorded to such training. The project will
fund the establishment of an Institute for Mother and Child Health with
limited clinical facilities in a semi-rural area. It will be modelled on the
Child Health Institute in London and will follow the Morley approach to MCH
training. The Institute is meant to establish a leading position in MCH and
pediatrics to promote appropriate MCH strategies and policies. A strong link
will be established with the community-based medical education subcomponent
(para 2.39). Subject to final design approval by IDA, the project will fund
physical facilities, pediatric equipment, MCH supplies, training and training
supplies and transport. Strict adherence to the Morley approach in design and
execution of the Institute will be closely monitored by the annual IDA
Consortium Review Missions (Annex :6).  Agreement was reached with GOB during
negotiations that the final design of the Institute for Mother and Child
Health will be furnished to IDA for clearance.
2.41      NIPSOM.  The focal point for the production of public health
professionals and for health service research in Bangladesh is NIPSOM. The
project will address some of the current constraints of NIPSOM and upgrade the
quality of training and research capability. The objectives include: human
resource development as per Health for All by the year 2000 strategies; health
systems research; establishment of a dialogue between planners, managers,
providers and consumers of health care; better occupational health services;
and promotion of the rational use of drugs. The project provides for:
administretive, institutional and departmental reviews; construction/
renovation and furnishing of offices, including a special project office for
the rational use of drugs; a student hostel; and a field practice area. All
aspects of the library will be upgraded.   The project will also fund
equipment for occupational and environmental health, promotion of field work
through improved transportation arrangements, support for health service
research through grants, increase in staff strength, and an institutional
linkage of NIPSOM with a center in Australia. In addition NIPSOM will develop
linkages with the IEM, HEB, CME, NIPORT, Maternal and Child Health Institute,
ICDDR'B and others.



- 30 -
2.42      Within NIPSOM, a special project will be funded on the Rational Use
of Drugs, seeking to influence prescribing and utilization practices in
accordance with WHO guidelines. Emphasizing IEM, it will develop medical
practice guidelines through workshops, reference materials, a reporting system
for prescription profiles, a system to monitor prescription patterns, studies,
etc. Support includes special staff, consultancies, furniture and equipment,
and drug management material, among others.
B.(3) Supporting Medical Research
2.43      The activities of the Bangladesh Medical Research Council, the main
organization for the promotion of medical research in the country, have been
hampered, largely due to inadequate funds. The component aims to develop a
strategy for essential national medical research with short and long term
objectives, better coordinate medical research, disseminate research findings,
and ultimately improve quality of medical education. Proposed actions include
a national consultative meeting for research strategy, research cells in eight
medical colleges to coordinate research and a focus of research on community
medicine and MCH. The project will fund research grants to priority
departments of obstetrics, pediatrics and community medicine, awards for
researchers to visit overseas institutions for specific training relevant to
their research project, visiting overseas experts, enhanced literature search
capacity of medical colleges, research dissemination and logistic support,
such as office equipment and vehicles. Agreement was reached with GOB during
negotiations that recipients of research grants and of project-financed
training will remain in their institutions/areas of specialized expertise for
at least two years after completion of training or research to enable creation
of institutional capacity.
B.(4) Strengthening Disease Prevention and Control
2.44      Reorganizing Programs for Tuberculosis and Leprosy.  These poverty-
related diseases have grave socio-economic consequences. Estimates put the
prevalence rate at 1.6 million for tuberculosis and 1.3 million for leprosy.
Tuberculosis is more fatal but leprosy has a devastating social impact due to
the high rate of disability. Both diseases are completely curable and control
is possible through concerted case-detection, case-holding and complete
treatment. The project will finance reorganized and intensified control
programs with the following main objectives: (i) reduction of morbidity and
mortality due to tuberculosis and leprosy; (ii) an effective information
system, adequate manpower development facilities, and supply of drugs; and
(iii) rehabilitation and health education.
2.45      Salient features of the project include: (i) baseline surveys on
the extent and distribution of the two diseases; (ii) training and deployment
of staff (8,000 for tuberculosis and 4,000 for leprosy, including about 450
new leprosy control assistants); (iii) enhanced local diagnostic and
management facilities; (iv) expanded coverage of case-detection and better
case-holding through outreach follow-up by providing transport to field
workers; (v) strong surveillance and information systems; (vi) better
coordination between GOB and NGOs; and (vii) increased rehabilitation
facilities, particularly for leprosy. District tuberculosis coordinators and
district medical officers (leprosy) will be appointed and foreign consultants
will be employed to assist the project. Agreement was reached with GOB during
negotiations that baseline surveys in accordance with terms of reference



- 31 -
acceptable to IDA will be carried out by September 30, 1992 and the results
furnished to IDA for comments.
2.46      Continuing the EPI Program.  The EPI program seeks to reduce the
morbidity, mortality and disability arising out of six important childhood
diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, polio and tuberculosis).
The program aims at 85? coverage of the main target groups. The strategy
includes social mobilization, an intersectoral approach, strengthening
institutional services, and sustaining and improving a vast network of
outreach services. While GOB will provide for the majority of EPI staff, the
project will support: all existing development staff and recruitment of new
staff, namely, 3 assistant directors, 16 MOs, 3 cold-chain engineers, 10 cold-
chain technicians, 19 drivers and 64 assistant storekeepers; refresher
training of all staff: purchase of vaccines; maintenance and replacement of
cold-chain equipment; and renovation and modest expansion of the EPI
Directorate facilities. In addition, 400 motorcycles and 500 bicycles are to
be provided to staff on a hire-purchase basis for monitoring of coverage and
EPI target disease surveillance. Three expatriates from UNICEF and two from
USAID will be available for technical assistance to this component.
2.47      Continuing the CDD Program.  Under this component, the major
objective is to reduce childhood mortality from diarrheal diseases. The
project will support education and training of both the health service
providers and community. Fifty new district diarrheal disease centers, 50
more Oral Rehydration Treatment corners to cover at least one upazila per
district, and an upazila surveillance system to cover 20 sentinel upazilas are
planned. The project will provide technical and management training to 20
national CDD facilitators. In coordination with the IEDCR, it will also
strengthen epidemiological surveillance, provide for study tours, use 3? of
the budget for IEC activities (e.g. regarding breastfeeding), and fund the
production and/or procurement of oral rehydration salts. The usefulness of a
separate reporting system for diarrheal diseases will be examined under the
project.
2.48      Supporting the Vitamin A and Iodine Deficiencies and ARI Programs.
These components will provide support to prevent and treat (night) blindness
(Vitamin A deficiency), goiter (iodine deficiency), and ARI. Vitamin A
deficiency is very prevalent in the country and is implicated in nutritional
disorders leading to higher rates of common infections; more directly visible
are the millions of disabilities due to Vitamin A blindness. Assistance will
be given for the expansion of an anti-blindness program under which Vitamin A
is given to children 6 weeks-6 years old. Children with xerophthalmia up to
15 years and lactating mothers also will be treated. FWAs, HAs, and NGOs will
be involved actively for both implementation and monitoring.
2.49      Over 10 million people in Bangladesh suffer from iodine deficiency
disorders (goiter). Universal iodization of salt is the treatment. In view
of the delay in the salt iodization process, the project will finance iodine
injections, which were started as a stop-gap measure. UNICEF evaluation shows
that the program is well monitored and of high social value. The medical
iodine application will be phased out over the project period as salt-
iodization proceeds. The project will fund iodization in each of the existing
210 salt crushing units over two years, beginning with severely affected
districts. The Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC)
and UNICEF will provide technical assistance and equipment. Eight salt



- 32 -
testing centers will coordinate and monitor the iodization process country-
wide.
2.50      The second major cause of mortality among children is ARI.  The
project component aims to reduce the incidence, severity and complications of
and mortality from ARI, especially pneumonia. Beginning with 8 upazilas and 2
slums, the project will be extended to 248 upazilas and 62 slums by 1996.
Support will be provided for the training of health workers to diagnose and
treat ARI, purchase of equipment and medicines, IEM, monitoring and
evaluation, and rational use of antimicrobial drugs for treatment, including
surveillance for antibiotic multiresistencies. Liaison will be maintained
with WHO and the project on Rational Use of Drugs (para 2.42).
2.51      Developing Control of Vector-Borne Diseases.  An integrated
approach to the control of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, kala-azar,
filariasis, dengue fever and japanese encephalitis, is proposed in the
interest of efficiency. Existing units are to be harnessed to form a program
for Integrated Control of Vector-Borne Diseases, with an emphasis on
surveillance. The aims are to: improve parasite control through better
epidemiological surveillance and vector control through entomological
surveillance; train manpower on diagnostic procedures, effective control and
preventive measures; and conduct field-based research. The project will fund
new posts (a chief scientific officer, two medical officers, entomologists,
and support staff); provision of essential drugs; transport, including a
mobile laboratory; training of staff, including fellowships; cost of
accommodation; investigation of epidemic outbreaks and revision of
surveillance maps; basic and applied research on changing vector and pathogen
behavior; and, where necessary, ezpatriate consultants. Expenditure related
to the procurement of insecticides, particularly DDT, will be fi:..nced by GOB
outside the purview of the project. The reorganized project unit will be
headed by a director, supported by a deputy director and administrative staff,
and coordinated by the DG Health and NIPSOM with a linkage to national (IEDCR)
and international (WHO) centers experienced in this approach.
2.52      Assisting the Intestinal Parasite Control Project.  Some 50X-70Z of
Bangladeshi children (35-40 million) are infested with worms. This component
will support relative cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative interventions
(e.g. health education, antihelminthic treatment, and promotion of waterseal
latrines). The study will cover eight unions and include measuring the
prevalence of worms and the effect of reduced worm infestation on the
nutritional status of children (through the IEDCR and NIPSOM). The project
provides for temporary staff, purchase of drugs, transport, subsidy for
waterseal latrines and health education (to be coordinated with the IEM/HEB
Unit, para 2.76).
2.5.,     Expanding Institute of Public Health (IPH). Blood and intravenous
fluids are extremely important elements in addressing the problem of maternal
mortality. IPH production of sterile blood and intravenous fluid bags will be
expanded, while capacity to produce nutritional fluids and diagnostic
reagents, equally necessary for acute emergency patients, will be established.
The project will fund an additional 120,000 blood bags, 10,000 nutritional
fluid bags and limited quantities of diagnostic reagents. Staff and
facilities at the IPH will be strengthened, with WHO and other technical
assistance if and when necessary. The IPH will produce reports for the
Consortium, covering capacity in terms of human resources, facilities and
equipment. At least 70Z of IPH output will go to maternal and MCH care at



- 33 -
district hospitals and UHCs, with priority distribution to the various project
areas (paras 2.31 and 2.59).
2.54      Modernizing the Drug Testing Laboratory. The Laboratory has had a
substantially increased workload since the introduction of the National Drug
Policy of 1982. It will be modernized to:(i) improve drug testing capacity of
imported and local drugs from 5,000 to 10,000 samples per year; (ii) improve
quality centrol; and (iii) extend training to pharmaceutical laboratories on a
cost recovery basis. To achieve this, the project also will support buildings
and equipment, in close association with WHO and ADB funding, chemicals,
furniture and stationery.
B.(5) Developing Urban PHC
2.55      Despite an expanding urban population and a clear need for PHC
services in urban areas, these have yet to be systematically planned and
organized (para 2.69). The project will support the development of a
comprehensive strategy and action plan for urban PHC for a phased
implementation, following a survey of exisUing health facilities and a mapping
exercise. A beginning is to be made in five unserved wards of Dhaka.
Existing urban dispensaries are to be renovated. Eleven PHC centers with
female outreach workers will be constructed. Consultants and fellowships are
provided to develop the plan. Essential drugs, training and equipment will
also be funded. In view of the need for strong management and extensive
evaluation, a new post of Assistant Director (Urban PHC) within the
Directorate of PHC is envisaged. Agreement was reached with GOB during
negotiations that, by July 31, 1992, responsibility for urban PHC will be
assigned either to the national or to the local government and that IDA will
be informed of the decision.
B.(6) Continuing and Expanding School Health Programs
2.56      Children in primary and secondary schools constitute 152 of the
total population. Especially in a country like Bangladesh, an investment in
school health is central to the quality of life of the population. Currently
there are 27 school health clinics, with three in Dhaka and the rest in
districts, serving 1,116 primary and secondary schools. Each clinic has two
MOs, one pharmacist and three support staff. Forty-four more school health
clinics will be funded in the uncovered districts, resulting in one clinic per
district. Apart from the current program of medical examination and
treatment, which is largely clinic based, a new emphasis will be placed on
healthy living, nutrition and personal hygiene through health education,
control of communicable diseases, and health promotion in schools and homes.
Linkages between the school health clinics, the general health system and the
educational system will be systematized. Funding of the programs will be
conditional on the development of a master plan for school health during the
first year of the project, to be finalized through revised Project Proformas
after discussions and agreement between GOB and IDA/Cofinanciers. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that GOB will prepare, by March 31, 1993,
a masterplan for school health programs in accordance with terms of reference
satisfactory to IDA and thereafer, carry out such programs taking into account
IDA's comments.

B.(7) Improving Health Facilities
2.57      Renovating District Hospitals and UHCs.  The number of beds in the
59 district hospitals ranges from around S0 to 200. These hospitals serve an
average population of 1.5 million each. They all have medical and surgical
specialists and an operating theater, but smaller ones (50-100 beds) have only
two wards - one male and one female. Many need renovation and those with only
one female ward lack labor wards and delivery units. Depending on the
availability of funds, the project will renovate/reconstruct upto sixteen
district hospitals and three UHCs, which may be upgraded to small district
hospitals. Selection of the district hospitals and UHCs will be reviewed by
GOB and IDA/Cofinanciers and remain subject to final Consortium approval. The
project provides for construction, equipment, furniture, land development,
salaries and allowances of additional posts and additional supplies of medical
and surgical requisites. During negotiations, agreement was reached that GOB
will carry out plans, by April 30, 1992, for the allocation of 70? or more of
the beds in district hospitals and UHCs for women and children.
2.58      Constructing UHCs.  UHCs are the country's lowest level health care
facility providing in-patient care. With a maximum of 31 beds and 9
professional staff, they serve on average a population of 330,000 and are
essentially out-patient oriented, larger rural health centers with some in-
patient capacity (1 bed:l0,000 population). Of the 397 rural upazilas
requiring a UHC, only 351 have one. As part of GOB's long-term plan to build
UHCs in the remaining upazilas, the project will establish 10 new upazila
health complexes. The design adopted for the UHC is the same as that approved
by IDA for the previous projects, with the following modifications: offices
for four physicians, FP/MCH stores, and allocation of at least 70? of beds for
women and children. Besides construction costs, the project provides for
equipment and furniture as per the standard list, previously approved by IDA.
Agreement was reached with GOB during negotiations that the architectural
plans for the new UHCs will be made available to IDA by April 30, 1992 for
comments and that the plans will include indication of the selected sites,
allocation of at least 70Z of the beds for women and children, and a
comprehensive maintenance plan.
B.(8) Improving Utilization of UHCs and FWCs
2.59      The underutilization of UHCs, FWCs and RDs seems to be largely due
to poor quality of services, which in turn is due to poor management coupled
with a lack of community participation and socio-cultural factors,
particularly those that prevent women from making use of the facilities.
Following successful examples in other countries, the project supports a
holistic UHC-centered approach to improving service delivery and utilization,
both vis-a-vis outreach and institutional care and family planning services.
The underlying strategy of the project will be to motivate the staff at the
UHC level and below, both as individuals and as a team, to improve gradually
their management and job performance in high priority service areas, and to
provide them with the necessary inputs and support to accomplish this. UHC
participation in the project will be performance-oriented and phased in order
to guarantee optimal use of limited resources. Support actions will combine
various inputs (e.g. essential equipment, drugs and supplies, laboratory
facilities, separate MCH units, accommodation, transport facilities, repair
and maintenance of buildings, sound management practices, clinical quality
assurance, an effective referral system, promotion of community participation
and advisory and training services), all of which will be provided within the



- 35 -
context of a functional improvement training effort and action plan worked out
and agreed with each UHC individually.
2.60      Implementation will be through a special implementation unit in the
Health Directorate and is initially planned for 50 upazilas, selected from at
least one district in each Division, according to agreed criteria. The
Director PHC will ensure coordination between the Directorates of FP and
Health. A "National Steering Committee" under the chairmanship of the
Secretary of MOHFW and with adequate representation of both the Health and PP
Directorates, as well as from other relevant Ministries and Institutes, will
meet at least twice a year to approve overall work plans, and allocations.
Steering committees at district and upazila levels, with adequate
representation of all parties involved, will approve the selection of UHCs and
the proposed functional improvement training and action plans including
detailed allocations. Multidisciplinary teams are envisaged, for each
district and at the center, for technical and daily operational work. In view
of its crucial significance to the overall objectives of the sector, this
component will be very closely monitored by the Consortium in its annual
reviews. Agreement was reached during negotiations that GOB will carry out,
by June 30, 1994, an in-depth review of the outcome of the special program to
address capacity utilization at the UHCs and FWCs, prepare an action plan for
the expansion of the program to the remaining upazilas, furnish the review and
action plan to IDA for comments, and carry out the action plan taking into
account IDA's comments.
Component C. Improving Supportive Activities to the Delivery of FP and Health
Services (US$66.2 million)
2.61      Component C provides for support to the project activities under
Components A and B. It will emphasize strengthening the MIS for the FP and
health subsectors, with a particular emphasis on gender-specific data
collection sufficiently disaggregated to permit meaningful analysis of policy
issues in terms of the WID strategy for the project (annex 24). It also will
focus on improving managerial and financial capabilities in both sectors, and
expanding community support for FP and health services. The component will
highlight the importance of NGOs and innovative approaches and provide
technical assistance to specific subcomponents of the project.
C.(l) Strengthening Information Systems
2.62      MIS for FP/MCH. To make effective use of the MIS as the main source
of monthly FP and MCH performance data, the system will be reorganized to make
it more of a management tool and ensure better quality of data. A needs
assessment will be made from upazila to central level in 1992; the system
design, field testing, the preparation and implementation of working
guidelines for management information flows, training on the production and
use of MIS reports, and recommendations on hardware, software and personnel
requirements will be funded by the project. The future basis for MIS data
will be the Field Worker Record Keeping System, replacing the couple
registration system. Supervision and guidance of registration work will be
done at upazila level through (refresher) training of FWVs and FPAs.
Agreement was reached with GOB during negotiations, that the needs assessment
and system design will be carried out by July 31, 1994 and furnished to IDA
for comments.



- 36 -
2.63      The LMIS is another management tool for decentralized decision-
making. The project's support to it aims at more efficient use of
contraceptive supplies by assurance of quality of data, rapid processing and
transmitting of reports, and comparison with performance statistics on the
same form to enable managers to see linkages and inconsistencies. Potential
duplication of data collection will also be addressed, e.g. with the health
information systems under development or other information schemes in the
sector.
2.64      MIS for Health.  The project seeks to coordinate the separate
functions of the Health Information Unit into a coherent MIS for decision-
making. To ensure meaningful information, the Unit wills (i) prioritize
information for health management based on a needs assessment; (ii) design,
field-test and establish a computer-based MIS; (iii) train health personnel;
and (iv) ensure quality of information on a gender-disaggregated basis. A
database on health personnel, health service utilization and logistics, and
morbidity and mortality statistics by sex will be set up under the project.
Staff will be augmented, (inter)nationally trained, and equipped. The MIS
will be decentralized from the perspective of reliable data collection and use
of information for decision-making. The Unit will closely cooperate with and
receive assistance from WHO, IPGMR, and NIPSOM. Agreement was reached with
GOB during negotiations, that the needs assessment and system design will be
carried out by July 31, 1994 and furnished to IDA for comments.
2.65      Health and Demographic Survey.  This survey by BBS aims at
collecting data disaggregated by gender, on morbidity, mortality, immunization
coverage, health services utilization, health behavior and socio-economic and
demographic characteristics. A number of pretested questionnaires/schedules
will be used to collect the data on carefully selected priority areas to be
surveyed. BBS will coordinate its efforts with other agencies planning
similar surveys, e.g. NIPORT and USAID, avoiding duplication (e.g., with the
planned CPSs and the BFS). Qualified women will be recruited to fill 50Z of
local enumerator positions. UNDP will provide technical assistance. The
detailed objectives and design of the study will be finalized in consultation
between GOB and IDA/Cofinanciers. During negotiations, agreement was reached
that GOB will carry out, by December 31, 1994, a health and demographic survey
in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to IDA and furnish the
results to IDA for comments.
2.66      Epidemiological Surveillance System.  Epidemiological surveillance
is key to sound preventive disease strategies. Under the project, the
currently too-weak IEDCR will be strengthened as a center of epidemiological
surveillance by improving its field-based surveillance, assisting data
analysis at central and peripheral levels, and conducting periodic
epidemiological surveys and investigation of disease outbreaks. This includes
providing a new biostatistics unit, data processing, increasing and training
staff, technical assistance, renovating and adding space, and supporting
transport and equipment.
C.(2)  Improving FP and Health Organization, Management and Financing
2.67      MDU Support to FP and Health Services.  The project will continue
to support the successful MDU, whose focus will be enlarged to include
managerial capability at the directorate, district and upazila levels. The
aim will be for managers to apply planning concepts, problem-solving methods,
team work and supportive supervision in their work. The MDU will continue to



- 37 _
emphasize the improvement of key management skills of program personnel and to
provide regular feedback on operational constraints, solutions and improved
management practice from the field to the central level. Its work during the
Fourth Plan period will extend to management issues at central level and to
work in both the FP and Health sectors.
2.68      The MDU will continue functioning in each of the four divisions of
the country, with a stronger presence at district level. The composition will
include four divisional teams and at the central level one team leader plus an
advisor. UNFPA will provide administrative backstopping under an MOHFW
Steering Committee. For professional support, the MDU will continue to have
linkages with selected international management institutions.
2.69      Reorganization of Health & Family Planning Programs. In view of the
lessons from the previous projects that point to the importance of sound
management, MOHFW's structure and functions will be reviewed to propose: (i)
improvements in management and planning performance; (ii) allocation of
resources to priority areas considering potential outcomes and recurrent
costs; (iii) enhancement of the coordination of donor inputs; (iv) fostering
of decentralization of reoponsibilities; and (v) integration of FP and health
functions. A strong, integrated information system and a central planning
structure that avoids the present duplication of efforts will also be
developed at a later stage (para 2.63). The project will support the
analytical work needed, the conduct of various operations, and the testing of
assumptions and proposed solutions and their implementation. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that GOB will carry out, by August 31,
1993, a Dolicy study on the reorganization of the health and family planning
programs in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, furnish
the recommendations of the study to IDA for comments, and thereafter, prepare
and carry out an action plan taking into account IDA's comments.
2.70      A very important factor determining the success of any project,
particularly in the FP and health sector, is the adequacy and appropriateness
of human resource development. A comprehensive review of the human resource
situation will be carried out considering, among other aspects, the (i) match
between the assessed need and available staff; (ii) optimal staff mix in terms
of the various cadres (right from the physician through the FWA) and in terms
of gender; (iii) geographic distribution of staff as per population spread and
epidemiological considerations; (iv) policy and operational implications in
terms of employing staff either in the development or the revenue budget; (v)
career development plans for all staff; (vi) issues surrounding single-purpose
workers such as leprosy control assistants in the context of an integrated PHC
approach; and (vii) possible sharing of human resources between the FP and
health subsectors. Gender equity should be encouraged insofar as possible in
all of the preceding factors. WHO will assist this subcomponent which is
being supported as a technical assistance project (para 2.85). Agreement was
reached during negotiations that GOB will prepare, by March 31, 1994, a human
resource development plan for strengthening the capacity for human resource
development planning which takes specific account of female representation at
all levels of the FP and health system, furnish the plan to IDA for comments,
and carry out the plan taking into account IDA's comments.
2.71      Strengthening the PDEU.  Considering the lessons of past projects
regarding the need for adequate evaluation, the project will continue to
finance PDEU in carrying out operational research to support policy-making
within the Planning Commission. It will be strengthened through refocussing



- 38 -
its function on evaluating the population control program as to its nationally
important intersectoral links and effects. PDEU will analyze existing
research and data sets from other institutions for policy implications. The
studies to be contracted out every year will be part of a research work plan,
based on identified information needs for policy decisions to be prepared
periodically and reviewed by NASCOPOR and the IDA/Cofinanciers annual review
missions. The review will also consider the qualification and efficiency of
different institutions for contract research projects. This approach will
enable the GOB to reduce the size of PDEU staff substantially by the end of
the Fourth Plan period. All future research/evaluation supported by the
project will provide for gender disaggregated data collection and analysis.
2.72      Establishment of the MCH Coordination Cell.  More than any other
activity, MCH services cut across both the health directorate and the FP
directorate. To enhance coordination, the project will finance the
establishment of an MCH Coordination Cell in the MOHFW (Chart 4). The MCH
Cell will serve as a secretariat to the National MCH Coordination Committee,
support MCH Coordination Committees at district and upazila level, and monitor
the Maternal and Neonatal Health Care Pilot Project (para 2.30-2.31). The
Cell will be attached to the Joint Secretary concerned, and will be staffed by
at least four professionals (including one senior international adviser), with
technical backstopping by WHO. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with GOB that the MCH Coordination Cell will be established and maintained in
accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA and with competent
staff in adequate numbers. A condition of credit effectiveness is the
establishment of the MCH Coordination Cell within the MOHFW in line with the
terms of reference already agreed upon between GOB and IDA.
2.73      Establishment of the Health Economics and Financing Project.
Sustainability of the program is a serious concern of GOB and the Consortium.
It has various dimensions: (i) long-term donor and GOB commitments to the
development needs of the sector and increasing GOB commitment to meet
recurring costs; (ii) efficiency and cost effectiveness considerations; (iii)
cost-sharing aspects, subject to equity principles; (iv) privatization scope;
and (v) public/private mix of FP and health services. The Banglad-< ;iealth
Financing Study 1988/89 underlined the lack of relevant expertise, which so
far has prevented in-depth analyses by GOB of the complex issues involved.
The project will thus support strengthening capacities within GOB,
particularly in MOHFW and the Planning Commission, for appreciating and
analyzing health economic and financing issues. It will fund all development
costs for a separate Health Economics and Financing Pilot Project under a
Director in the MOHFW for FP and health, which will interact continuously with
or become part of the existing planning cells. A high powered committee,
headed by the Secretary, MOHFW with membership from senior officers of MOHFW,
the Ministry of Finance, ERD, the Planning Commission and a few experts, will
provide overall guidance regarding project prioritization. Agreement was
reached with GOB during negotiations that (a) it will establish, by August 31,
1992, a Health Economics and Financing Pilot Project in the MOHFW with
competent staff in adequate numbers and with terms of reference and a work
program acceptable to IDA, (b) take all actions required to strengthen the
MOHFW in accordance with policy-related financial and economic analyses by the
project and (c) by September 30, 1993, furnish to IDA for comments a plan to
address the issue of long-term sustainability, including among others:
proposals for achieving an acceptable balance between the MOHFW's revenue and
development budgets, proposals for transfer of specific expenditure items from
the development to the revenue or the local government budget as well as



- 39 -
specific proposals on cost-sharing mechanisms and improved cost-effectiveness
and carry out the plan taking IDA's comments into account.
2.74      Restructuring of the Project Finance Cell (PFC).  The current role
of the PFC in handling only population-related projects will be restructured
to include monitoring of health-related projects funded through the
Consortium. The Director of the PFC will be made responsible to the Jo'nt
Secretary (Planning and Development) who combines the functions of plarning
for the FP and health wings of the MOHFW. The project will also finance
computerization of the PFC. During negotiations, agreement was reached that
GOB will maintain the PFC with competent staff in adequate numbers until
completion of the project.
2.75      Construction of a FP and Health Building. The Directorates of PP
and Health are currently located in a number of different rented buildings,
scattjred over the city and of dismal quality. Due to rental contracts and
financial considerations, many offices are regularly relocated to other rented
premises. Apart from ever higher recurrent costs of renting the
accommodations, this has led to serious administrative dislocation, low
effectiveness of supervision and virtual managerial isolation of sone
programs.  More serious is the fact that the physical separation of the FP
Directorate and the Health Directorate has hampered earlier integration
attempts by MOHFW (paras 1.32 and 2.69).  To redress these constraints, GOB
plans a common facility for both directorates, which would also facilitate
many of the integration and merger components under the project (paras 2.68,
2.76 and 2.77). The project will support the construction of a common
building to house the FP and Health Directorates at Mohakhali. It will
accommodate 328 officers and 1,229 staff, with common facilities and replanted
grounds, in a ten-floor, 15,800 sqm building. Maintenance will come under the
MCMU (para 2.76).  Funding will be shared between GOB, the IDA/Cofinancier
Consortium and USAID.
2.76      Establishment of the MCMU. Several agencies are involved in the
implementation of construction, renovation, maintenance and rehabilitation
works pertaining to MOHFW. No clear delineation of responsibility exists
among the four main agencies, i.e. CMC, the Building Planning and Design Unit
(BPDU), Public Works Directorate and LGEB. This often results in inefficiency
and a serious lack of coordination and accountability. Under the project, the
two current engineering units of MOHFW, i.e. the Construction Management Cell
(CMC) and BPDU, will be merged and renamed as "Maintenallce and Construction
Management Unit (MCMU)". The newly created MCMU will coordinate and implement
all the facility-related works of MOHFW under the project, with full financial
and technical authority. Subjec; to satisfactory completion of rehabilitation
of the flood-affected FWCs by LGEB under the Third Project and subject to
documented future capacity at LGEB, construction and maintenance of facilities
below upazila level will be delegated to LGEB with an appropriately defined
supervisory role for the MCMU. Agreement was reached with GOB during
negotiations that BPDU and CMC will be unified by June 30, 1992 and given the
required administrative and financial authority to carry out its construction
and maintenance responsibilities.
C.(3) Expanding Communications Programs
2.77      Functional integration of the IEM and HEB Units.  The project will
finance continuation and strengthening of the communications program following
an integrated IEM strategys (i) classifying target audiences; (ii) identifying



- 40 _
audience needs; (iii) developing audience-specific messages; (iv) promoting
localized message planning; (v) ensuring complementarity of interpersonul,
group and mass media approaches; (vi) improving coordination of all agencies
concerned; (vii) training all personnel involved in communication; and (viii)
providing research, evaluation and monitoring support. To plan and implement
the strategy successfully, GOB proposes to integrate functionally the IEM Unit
of the FP Directorate and the HEB of the Health Directorate. This would mean
a close working relationship between the two units, a common work program and
a practical action-plan towards the integrated IEM strategy. Production of
materials and research and evaluation will be contracted-out. The staff can
thus be reduced in phases. A cell will be created to address women's IEM
issues and have its five posts staffed by women. The project will support
audience research, message development costs, evaluation studies, training of
field staff, community leaders and folk singers, publication of newsletters
and production of FP and health educational materials and films. Agreement
was reached with GOB during negotiations that a strategy and work plan,
acceptable to IDA, for functionally integrating PP and health communications
activities will be furnished by August 31, 1992, such strategy to include
indicators related to gender awareness and that the functional integration
shall be put into effect by December 31, 1992.
2.78      Support for Mass Media Activities.  The project will support
strengthening of the Radio Bangladesh programs for FP/MCH/PHC communication.
The broadcast time will be increased from 305 to 330 minutes a day, providing
for 30 minutes of broadcast from each of the three subcells. The contents of
broadcasts will be diversified by inclusion of more health subjects. The
project will provide for improving production facilities, transport for the
subcells, spares and equipment, artists' services, fellowship training and
operational expenses.
2.79      About 300 minutes of television programs are broadcast every month
under six titles linking population with health, religion, child care, etc.
In addition, NGOs buy time for their programs on FP and health. The
population cell finds it difficult to retain technical personnel recruited to
produce programs as the cell is treated as temporary. Because Bangladesh
Television has not been able to fill sanctioned positions for so long, a
lumpsum provision will be made available for programs to be produced in the
private sector. Bangladesh Television's Population and Health Cell will
decide on the nature of telecasts, messages to be conveyed, and reviews of
telecasts produced by the private sector. The project will also finance
regular evaluations of program effectiveness.
2.80      Promotion of Community Participation.  Progressive involvement of
the community in promoting FP and health activities will continue through
community volunteer programs, such as the VDP and Swanirvar. Besides their
moti.tstional works, the VDP women members will act as village depot-holders
under the FWA. Each will maintain contact with 40 households. VDP coverage
will expand from 64 to 96 upazilas. The project will finance training,
subject to a formal evaluation of the current program by an independent
agency. Swanirvar's population activities have expanded to 138 upazilas in 39
districts (1,486 unions and 2,500 villages). Population planning and
education are integrated into the overall village development program and the
credit program for disadvantaged women, with an evaluated positive impact on
fertility. The project will support training for coverage of all villages in
the upazilas, following the agreed method for funding through NGOs. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with GOB that the community volunteer



- 41 -
programs will be evaluated by June 30, 1993 and the resu:.ts furnished to IDA
for comments and that by December 31, 1992 all actions required will be taken
to ensure that contraceptives are provided on a priority basis to the Mothers'
Centers, Women's Cooperatives and Women's Vocational Training Programs being
supported under the project.
C.(4) Supporting NGOs
2.81      The project will continue to provide significant funding for NGO
participation in national population and health efforts. Currently about 156
such projects are operated by NGOs besides those financed through the now
defunct MOHFW Subvention Committee. These projects cover over 364 sites of
which more than 200 are located in rural areas. MIS data of 1989 estimate
that NGOs may contribute up to 36.52 of the total couple years of protection.
NGOs train their own staff and contribute to government field staff training
in FP and health.
2.82      The project will finance NGOs that complement governmental efforts
towards a CPR of 48Z-50Z and infant and child mortality rates of 80 and 140
per 1,000, respectively, by 1995. Following the new one-stop clearance system
(para 1.33), it has been agreed with NGO leaders and GOB that under the
project: (i) vertical NGO FP programs will develop integrated PHC programs;
(ii) NGOs will participate in the production of IEC materials and management
development; (iii) NGO health activities will be working towards a system of
more effective MCH referrals; (iv) DGFP will ensure regular contraceptive
supplies to NGOs; (v) FPCST will also cover NGO clinics; (vi) NGOs will extend
their field activities to areas of greater need; and (vii) the NGO Secretariat
will process new NGO proposals within 90 days of submission. The project will
continue to finance the existing Consortium NGO technical support unit. In
addition the GOB will allow approximately 38Z of the project's contraceptive
condom supplies to be channelled through the SMC (para 2.28).
C.(5) Developing Innovative Projects
2.83      Substantial financing will be set aside to develop and test
innovative projects that will help achieve sectoral goals with an emphasis on
developing ideas, concepts, and program measures for sustainability and cost-
effectiveness in FP and health. These activities are aimed at improving the
effectiveness and efficiency of current programs as well as developing
additional program measures to accelerate development in FP and health. They
will be forerunners to the development of the Fifth Fivu-Year Plan in FP and
health. Projects will be developed from time-to-time in line with emerging
needs. The major areas envisaged are improved access to services, in-service
training, new contraceptive and medical technology, community involvement,
'beyond-FP" measures, community-based medical education, environmental health
programs and health economics, including cost-effectiveness analysis, cost
recovery issues and health financirg programs. GOB will continue the existing
Steering Committee, which will function as under the current Third Project.
The approved studies will be contracted-out and progress will be assessed
periodically during the annual IDA/Cofinanciers review missions. The
innovative projects component also will include funds to prepare a fifth phase
of donor assistance to the national FP/MCH program. Prior approval of IDA
will be obtained for innovative projects estimated to cost over US$50,000.



- 42 -
C.(6) Supporting Technical Assistance Projects
2.84      Training Health Personnel in Operational Management. This sub-
project will support improved quality of supportive supervision. It will fund
training of: (i) health workers in operational management, including MCH and
FP; (ii) physicians in surgery, internal medicine, gynecology, and simple
anesthesia to improve the quality of care in UHCs; (iii) female volunteers in
community health (selective); (iv) trainers to form training teams; and (v)
local village leaders (selective) on PHC. It will also finance preparation
and collection of training materials and development of monitoring and
coordinaticn mechanisms for training activities (Annex 27).
2.85      Human Resources Development Masterplan.  A comprehensive plan for
the development of human resources in the health and PP sector will be
undertaken with the assistance of WHO and international expertise in the field
of national health manpower systems. A significant input by national
expertise from Bangladesh will be required as well. The project will provide
technical assistance for the preparation of the plan, which is described in
detail in para 2.70 (see also para 6.1, xx).
2.86      Health Care Quality Assurance.  Currently Bangladesh has no
established mechanism for systematically monitoring, let alone improving, the
quality of health care within or outside the public sector. No professional
standards have been set. no outcome measures have been agreed upon and no
routine information on quality is available. This subcomponent will provide
technical support to assess and assure the quality of both clinical and
community health care objectively and to introduce a system of quality
improvement to ensure professional accountability of different categories of
health personnel. The development of standards and criteria, training and
information systems are some of the essential elements envisaged. The project
subcomponent on medical quality assurance (para 2.37) within the area of
medical education will provide the institutional base for this technical
assistance subcomponent.
2.87      Control and Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs).  An
urgent need exists to combine the ongoing efforts in AIDS control (with WHO
assistance) and an intensified drive to control other sexually transmitted
diseases. This component will provide technical assistance for STD
surveillance, diagnosis, training, and increasing public awareness (Annex 27).
2.88      Control and Prevention of Cancer.  Notwithstanding more pressing
health priorities in Bangladesh, cancer demands its share of attention. The
annual incidence is estimated at over 200,000 and this project component aims
to meet the issue through technical assistance to formulate a control strategy
(Annex 27).



- 43 -
2.89      Establishment of a Pharmaceutical Production Unit at Khulna.  A
study will be conducted on the feasibility of a pharmaceutical plant in
Khulna, with a view to meeting the needs of essential drugs in the public
health system. The existing drug plants at Dhaka and Bogra produce 32 of the
45 essential drugs and meet 75Z of the public sector requirements. Twelve new
products are proposed for the new plant at Khulna. Financing of the new plant
will depend on the outcome of the feasibility study and subsequent GOB-
Consortium agreement. Technical assistance will be provided in consultation
with the Essential Drugs Unit and the component on the Rational Use of Drugs
(para 2.42 and Annex 27).
2.90      Establishment of Condom Manufacturing Plant.  Feasibility studies
carried out in the past on the need for developing local capacity for the
production of condoms are not only outdated but also lacking in
comprehensiveness. A fresh feasibility study will be conducted with
comprehensive terms of reference, addressing: (i) economic and non-economic
considerations of private or public sector production; (ii) various donor
policies on the procurement of locally produced condoms; (iii) development of
several price scenarios; and (iv) environmental impact. The results of the
study will be reviewed with the Consortium. Subject to economic viability,
availability of funds and other relevant considerations, the project may
provide funding towards setting-up of local condom production capability
during the project period (Annex 27).
Component D. Women's and Nutrition Programs (US$11.6 Million)
2.91      Component D will fund three women's programs in the field of family
planning and MCH. It will also support the strengthening of the National
Nutrition Council as a potentially important catalysc for country-wide
coordinated nutrition programs.
D.(l) Continuing the Three Women's Projects
2.92      Continued financing of the three ongoing women's programs will be
provided during the first two or three years of project implezientation as a
bridge to the proposed Intersectoral Population Activities Project (para 2.3).
The objective of the three women's programs (Mother's Centers, Women's
Cooperatives, and Women's Vocational Training) is the economic, social, and
leadership development of women, especially the young, in the lowest economic
and social segments of society. In line with the lessons learned from the
three previous projects, the strategies for achieving the programs include:
(i) improving credit facilities for women; (ii) emphasizing nontraditional
trades, where possible; (iii) encouraging women's entrepreneurship; (iv)
exposing more women to primary health care; and (v) establishing effective
links with the FP Directorate. The present programs (para 1.21) will be
strengthened as a result of a thorough review of implementation so far by a
team of expatriate and local consultants, which will analyze in detail the two
major components crucial to achieving the objectives of the programs: (i)
income generation impact, considering the present emphasis on traditional
products and the need to identify new areas of non-traditional and innovative
products for the local market; and (ii) awareness-raising training (general
and legal literacy, non-formal education, credit usage, savings, knowledge in
nutrition/health/family welfare, immunization benefits, etc.). An
entrepreneurship program will be developed to facilitate 'graduation' of

participants who are older in age and length of involvement. Coverage of the
programs will be expanded to additional upazilas. Activities in some existing
upazilas, where projects have been in operation for about 10 years, will be
transferred to the revenue budget, with GOB thereby assuming responsibility
for funding out of its own budget. Adequacy of transport allowances and means
will be analyzed. Standard indicators for monitoring and evaluation of
progress will be agreed to avoid the present confusion caused by different
data and analyses in reports prepared by project monitors, PDEU, and external
evaluators. In addition to this study, GOB will establish mechanisms for
regular coordination of the management and implementation of activities of the
.hree projects from the directorate level down to the upazilas, develop depot-
holder systems to ensure easy access to contraceptives, use women's project
centers in the field as service delivery points for FP/health/nutrition
programs, and develop and implement pilot studies for promoting self-financing
of the inputs for income generating activities. Annex 28 gives further
details. During negotiations, agreement was reached that G-OB will carry out,
by September 30, 1992, an in-depth review of the three women's programs,
prepare an action plan for strengthening of the programs, furnish the results
of the review and action plan to IDA for comments, and carry out the action
plan taking IDA's comments into account.
D.(2) Coordinated Nutrition Program of the National Nutrition Council
2.93      The reconstituted Council has great potential for leadership in a
wide range of nutrition activities in the country. The project component
seeks to strengthen the Council's role. Major objectives will be reflection
of an updated national nutrition policy in GOB and NGO programs and research,
and development of a master plan for nutrition activities. Priority will be
given to problems affecting children and adolescent girls. Improved
breastfeeding practices will be encouraged and infectious disease control will
be addressed (paras 2.26, 2.30, 2.35 and 2.40). Attention will be given to
nutrition improvement through diarrhea control; provision of Vitamin A,
iodized salt, ferrous iron, intravenous fluids, and parasite control (paras
2.47-2.49 and 2.52-2.53). The project will provide for staff, equipment,
training, publications, seminars, and grants for nutrition intervention
programs. It will also fund studies on nutrition, determinants of
malnutrition, and reorientation of the public food distribution program.
Evaluation is included. The Council will preferentially recruit female staff
for its Secretariat.
D. Environmental Considerations
2.94      The proposed project was determined to be in screening Category D,
which includes projects that are expected to have a positive environmental
impact. No environmental analysis has been prepared for this project. A
brief overview about population and the environment is provided in Annex 29.

3.2       Basis of Cost Estimates.  Cost estimates are based on GOB estimates
and reflect recent quotations and appraisal estimates. The costs of civil
works are based on reviews of recently awarded contracts in Bangladesh for
similar construction. Estimates are based on final designs for standardized
works and on preliminary designs for other types of construction. Government
Schedules of Rates have been used and updated with allowable premiums where
appropriate to reflect recent tender experience. Costs of equipment,
furniture, transport and supplies are based on analyses of requirements for
the project and derive from local market p.ices or CIF unit price. Costs of
production of FP and Health education materials, training, local and
expatriate consultants, applied research and other services reflect local or
international prices, as applicable. Overseas fellowships are based on
average United Nations rates for training in Europe, North America, Australia,
Egypt, Indonesia, Japan, Nepal and the Philippines. Costs of salaries and
allowances, including training allowances, are based on current Government
rates. Base costs reflect an exchange rate of US$1 = Tk 35.79 (the exchange
rate at the time of appraisal).
3.3       Contingency Allowances.  Total contingencies represent 1lZ of the
base cost, or US$57.7 million. Physical contingencies (amounting to US$10.1
million, or 22 of the total base cost) estimated at 72 of the boase cost have
been applied to civil works and at 52 of the base cost have been applied to
equipment, vehicles and medical and biological supplies. Price contingencies
(amounting to US$47.6 million, or 92 of the total base cost) have been
estimated using projections reflecting Bank guidelines on local and
international price increases: 82 in 1992, 72 in 1993, 62 from 1994 onward
for local costs, and 3.42 from 1992 onward for foreign costs. A purchasing
power parity assumption for the exchange rate has been applied to offset the
difference between local and foreign inflation in the project years.
3.4       Customs Duties and Taxes.  All imported goods are subject to
customs duties and taxes. The cost of the project (US$601.4 million) includes
import duties and taxes estimated at about Tk 905.4 million (US$22.9 million),
or 4Z of the total cost, to be financed by GOB.
3.5       Foreign Exchange Component.  The estimated foreign exchange
component of US$185.3 million, or 31Z of the total project cost, is calculated
on the basis of estimated foreign exchange proportions as follow: (a) civil
works 22; (b) equipment and furniture 342; (c) vehicles 552; (d) medical and
biological supplies 912; (e) technical assistance and consultants services
55Z; (f) training and fellowships 82; (g) innovative and NGO activities 82;
and (i) project operating costs of civil works, equipment and vehicles 42.
3.6       Recurrent Cost Implications.  GOB's contribution to the project is
estimated at US$165.1 million (Tk 6,593.7 million), representing 272 of the
total project cost of US$601.4 million. Apart from taxes and duties (US$22.9
million, or 42 of the total cost), GOB will finance the bulk of regular
recurrent costs of the project, especially salaries and allowances. While
under the First Project (1975-82) GOB contributed 0.4Z to salary recurrent
costs, under the Second Project (1980-86) 22.72, and under the Third Project
(1986-91) 43.12, under the Fourth Project GOB will finance 82.1? of all
salaries and allowances (Annex 32). This ncrease in GOB funding for



- 47 -
recurrent cost is also reflected in the share it will finance of the FWA and
HA cadres. Under the Third Project, 14,500 FWAs are being financed by the
Consortium and around 6,000 by GOB. Under the Fourth Project, GOB
will increase its financing from 6,000 to 13,500 FWAs, in phases, whereas the
Consortium will concurrently decrease its share from 14,500 to a maximum of
10,000 FWAs (see Annex 1, page 10). Regarding HAs, GOB will continue to
finance the recurrent costs of 11,500 HAs, while the Consortium will fund
5,000 HAs who all will be women. While salaries and allowances generally
constitute the largest part of recurrent costs in as labor-intensive a sector
as the health and FP sector, it could be argued that supplies such as
essential drugs and vaccines also belong to such costs. The long-term
understanding between GOB and the Consortium regarding recurrent costs
envisages a phased approach, with GOB increasingly absorbing recurrent salary
costs during its Fourth Five-Year Plan (1990-95), whereas recurrent medical
supply costs would be considered for absorption by GOB under the next Five-
Year Plan (1995-2000). Inclusion into the 1990-95 project period of recurrent
cost financing by GOB of the majority of both salaries and medical and FP
supplies would not have been sustainable by GOB's budget yet (all supplies and
drugs under the revenue budget are, of course, financed by GOB already). If
GOB would keep to its objective, formally stated during appraisal, to allocate
10? of total government outlays - both revenue and development budgets - to
health and population by FY99, then such a phased approach may indeed prove to
be possible. Although 10? may be too ambitious in view of the average
corresponding figures in other Asian countries, by FY96 GOB intends to
allocate close to 8Z of the revenue budget to health and FP; the revenue
budget, which for health and FP is roughly equal to the Fourth Plan outlay,
i.e. US$700-750 million over a five-year period, contains mainly recurrent
costs financed by GOB (see Annex 1, page 9). Taken together with the 81.3?
GOB financing of recurrent costs under the project's (development) budget,
this reflects an important trend towards assuming a higher level of
"ownership" of the population and health programs by GOB.
B. Financing
3.7       Financing Plan.  The proposed IDA credit of US$180.0 million would
finance 30Z of the total project cost, including 30Z of the foreign exchange
cost (US$56.0 million) and 32? of the local cost (US$124.0 million) of the
project. GOB would finance 27? of the project costs, including 36Z of the
local cost (US$142.2 million) plus taxes and duties (US$22.9 million). The
eleven cofinanciers -- Australia, Belgium, Canada, EEC, Germany (GTZ and KfW),
Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and United Kingdom -- would finance 43Z of
the project cost (US$256.3 million), including 70? of the foreign exchange
cost (US$129.3 million) and 32? of the local cost (US$127.0 million).
Altogether, external financing of the project would amount to US$436.3
million, or 73Z of the project cost, and GOB financing would amount to
US$165.1 million, or 27Z. The proposed financing plan is summarized as
follows:

The financing plan in terms of detailed investment and recurrent costs is
shown in Annex 33.
3.9       Cofinancing Arrangements.  Four new donors, Belgium, EEC, Japan and
Sweden, joined the Consortium and participated in the preappraisal and
appraisal missions. All cofinanciers participated in the appraisal mission.
The funds of all external donors will be contributed on grant terms. Germany
and Japan are likely to establish separate financing arrangements with GOB but
all other cofinanciers will make deposits into trust funds to be administered
by IDA. Formal cofinancing arrangements still remain to be completed. A
condition of credit effectiveness will be the fulfilling of conditions
precedent to the effectiveness of the Canadian, EEC, KfW, and Norwegian Grant
Agreements.
C. Disbursements
3.10      The proposed IDA credit covering 302 of the total project costs
would be disbursed against the following categories: (a) 902 of expenditures
for civil works; (b) 1002 of foreign and local (ex-factory) expenditures and
652 of expenditure on locally procured items for equipment, furniture,
vehicles, and medical and biological supplies; (c) 1002 of expenditures for
technical assistance, consultants services, training, fellowships; (d) 82 of
expenditures for salaries and allowances of new female health and FP workers,
which represents a declining scale of IDA financing (252 for FY92, 20Z for
FY93, 152 for FY94, 102 for FY95, and 52 for FY96); and (e) 302 of total
expenditures for project operating costs.
3.11      The IDA credit is expected to be disbursed over five years (January
1992 - December 1996), with the Closing Date being December 31, 1996.
Although the current regional sectoral disbursement profile is seven years,
the five-year period is based on the phasing and programming of project
activities in line with GOB's sector development plan. The schedule of
estimated disbursements appears itl Annex 34.   Funds from the IDA credit and
any other funds which IDA may be authorized to disburse on behalf of other
donors will be disbursed on the basis of satisfactory documentation submitted
by GOB's Project Finance Office. Disbursements against contracts for goods
and services exceeding US$200,000 equivalent will be fully documented.
Disbursements below that level will be made on the basis of Statements of
Expenditures, to be kept available in the PFC for examination by IDA missions.
3.12      To facilitate implementation of the project and ensure that
adequate funds are available for project expenditures, GOB will establish and
open a project special account in a commercial bank on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA. The authorized allocation of the Special Account will be
the convertible taka equivalent of US$12 million, representing about four
month's expenditures. Replenishment will be requested in line with IDA
guidelines.

3.14       The elements of the civil works program under the project (US$91.0
mllion) to be financed by IDA (US$62.9 million) consist principally of: (a) a
large number of small low unit cost FP and health facilities; and (b)
upgrading and maintenance work associated with existing FP and health
buildings. These facilities would be widely dispersed throughout the country
and work would be carried out over five years. Local contractors in
Bangladesh have the capacity to carry out these works and, on the basis of
experience with similar projects in the country including the Third Population
and Health Project, foreign firms are considered most unlikely to be
interested in competing. Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures, which
are acceptable to IDA, would be followed for such works (US$50.0 million



- 51 -
including contingencies). In addition, the building for the MOHFW's FP and
Health Division (US$9.3 million) to be financed by IDA is unlikely to attract
foreign bidders not already located in Bangladesh and would be contracted
following LCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Nonetheless, any foreign bidder
interested in bidding would be allowed to participate. Other construction
under the project, financed separately by donors in the Consortium, would
follow procedures of the respective agencies.
3.15      Equipment (US$39.6 million), vehicles (US$11.2 million), and
medical and biological supplies (US$135.8 million) will be grouped to the
extent possible into bid packages of US$200,000 or more and will be procured
through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA
Guidelines. As far as practical, DDS kits will be procured through UNICEF and
contraceptive supplies through UNFPA following IDA guidelines. For bid
comparison, goods manufactured domestically will be allowed a preferential
margin of 15Z of the c.i.f. costs of competing imports or the actual customs
duties, whichever is lower. Contracts valued at less than US$200,000
totalling up to US$12.8 million and furniture totalling up to US$6.4 million
may be purchased through LCB following procedures acceptable to IDA, in which
foreign suppliers are eligible to participate. Exceptions to the above will
be made where parallel financing agreements directly between cofinanciers and
GOB require different arrangements to be made.
3.16      International or local shopping, based on comparison of at least
three quotations, will be permitted for urgently needed items, including
essential drugs and medical supplies, valued at US$50,000 or less, and will be
subject to an aggregate of US$500,000 equivalent during the project.
3.17      Technical assistance and consultants services (US$41.3 million) as
well as training and fellowships (US$52.0 million) will be provided in
accordance with the guidelines of the various cofinancing agencies. All IDA-
financed consultants will be selected in accordance with IDA Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants. Standardized documents will be developed for LCB for
construction, equipment, furniture, and medical supplies under the project.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that GOB will submit to IDA draft
standard documents before any bidding is undertaken on the respective
components. Civil works, furniture, goods and supplies contracts over
US$200,000 equivalent, under IDA's purview, will be reviewed by IDA prior to
award. This will cover about 45Z by value of such contracts.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPERVISION
A. Project Organization and Management
4.1       The Fourth Project will be implemented over a five-year (1992-96)
period that coincides with a three and one-half year time slice (1992-95) of
GOB's Fourth Five-Year Plan and a one and one-half year time slice (1995-96)
of GOB's Fifth Five-Year Plan. Implementation arrangements will be similar to
those under the Third Project. However, recognizing that the new project has
a larger magnitude than the ongoing one, and considering lessons of past
projects, care has been taken to provide in the design for expansion of GOB's
implementation capacity, including staffing, accommodations, an4 equipment.
The schedule of key implementation activities is in Annex 35. The overall
responsibility for management of project-funded service delivery, including
training, will be vested in the MOHFW which is generally adequately staffed
for this purpose. DGFP will be responsible for the components of the project
relating to family welfare, including relevant areas of MCH, while DGHS will
be in charge of the components concerning health services. Assignment and
supervision of staff will be dealt with by DGFP in the case of FWAs, FWVs,
FPMOs, the Supervision Directorate, the FPCST and the MDU, and by DGHS in the
case of health personnel. Except for condoms which will be centrally procured
with the assistance of an independent procurement agent, the respective DG's
logistics staff and procurement units will be responsible for procurement,
distribution and control of all project-financed vehicles, drugs, equipment
and supplies. Logistics support will be provided by donors having
institutional arrangements with GOB, e.g. UNFPA, USAID and UNICEF, together
with the Consortium members and IDA.
4.2       Project-financed training will be organized and managed by NIPORT
and the various institutes under the DGFP in the case of FP/MCH services, and
by NIPSOM, the medical colleges, the college of nursing, the Institute for
Mother and Child Health and the various programs under the DGHS in the case of
health services. NIPSOM will have a new unit for the purpose of training
health personnel, which, together with the colleges, will be accov-.1',e to
the Director of Medical Education. Full- and part-time expatriate advisors
(para 2.32) will assist the DGs with implementation.
4.3       The MOHFW (PP and Health wings) has a coordinating committee in
charge of all MCH programs, chaired by the Secretary, MOHFW, and assisted by
an MCH Coordination Cell. Committee membership includes the MOHFW; the DGs of
both FP and Health; the Directors of each of the major MCH Programs, of Public
Health Nutrition, of PHC and MCH services and representatives of NGOs active
in MCH.
4.4       The MCMU, comprising the merged CMC and BPDU of MOHFW, will
coordinate and implement all construction and maintenance under the project
through local consultants. MCMU will also supervise quality and monitor
progress of the LGEB when it maintains and constructs facilities below upazila
level. The Chief Engineer, MCMU will have full financial powers to implement
the project works. In the case of the project components 'renovating and
constructing UHCs", a Project Management Unit accountable to the Director, PHC
will coordinate the project activities, although all civil works will be
carried out through the MCMU.



53 -
4.5       IEM activities will be functionally integrated between the IEH Unit
of DGFP and the HEB of DGHS. Private professionals will be used to develop
messages and educational material.
4.6       The MIS for FP/MCH will be organized and managed by a Director and
staff under the DGFP and restructured to promote the use of MIS in decisLon-
making. The MIS for Health Services will be managed by the Chief of the
Health Information Unit. The health and demographic surveys will be managed
directly by the MOHFW, with assistance from both MIS systems, in cooperation
with BBS. The PFC will continue under the Fourth Project to prepare
withdrawal applications, keep project accounts and carry out routine audits.
The PFC is adequately staffed for this purpose.
4.7       The three women's programs under the present project will be
organized and managed as under the Third Project. Coordination amor!g the
women's programs and with MOHFW will take place through the continued
operation of an interministerial committee headed by the Secretary, MOHFW, but
longer-term linkages will be institutionalized through the separately planned
Intersectoral Project (para 2.3).
4.8       The Directors of specific program areas, such as: mycobacterial
disease control, nursing, NIPSOM, medical education, IPH, immunization, TBA
training, and diarrheal management programs will have direct responsibility
for management of project components relating to their respective programs.
Similarly, existing agencies with specific areas of responsibility within GOB
will oversee and coordinate project components related to those areas, e.g.,
the coordinated nutrition program by the National Nutrition Council under the
Secretary, MOHFW; development of medical research by the Bangladesh Medical
Research Council; the epidemiological surveillance project by the Director of
IEDCR; control of vector-borne diseases by the Director, Program for Control
of Vector-Borne Diseases under the MOHFW: urban PHC and school health by the
DGHS Directors for PHC, and control of iodine deficiency disease through salt
iodization by the Director of the Bangladesh Institute of Salt Iodization and
Crushing.
4.9       Special project management units or cells will be set up for
specialized project components, e.g., Omaternal and neonatal health care'
(under the DGHS but coordinated with the DGFP through the MCH Coordination
Cell); 'quality assurancen, by a combined cell under the Director of Hospitals
within the Health Directorate of MOHFW and the Director of the Center for
Medical Education; and "health economics and financing' by a pilot project
under the Joint Secretary concerned of the MOHFW, with close coordination with
the Planning Cells of the DGFP and DG Health.
B. Project Management and Supervision Support
4.10      The Population Program Office (PPO) has operated since 1976 in the
Bank Group's Resident Mission in Dhaka to monitor, report on and assist GOB in
finding prompt solutions to issues of population and PP. Because of the
increased prominence of health care with the Consortium, the PPO will be
expanded as a Population and Health Office (PHO), supported by a technical
committee consisting of resident professional advisors from the Consortium
members. The supervisory office at the Bank in Washington, D.C. which
coordinates and oversees PHO's activities, will continue its function as under
the Third Project. One of the lessons of the three earlier projects was that
this strong IDA presence provides a Consortium mechanism to promote a cohesive



- 54 -
and consistent donor dialogue with the GOB on both policy and operational
issues of the national population and health programs. Moreover, IDA's
presence helps to bring about project monitoring and provides technical
assistance to the GOB. The funding arrangements for the offices in Dhaka and
Washington will be consolidated and continue as they exist for PPO under the
current Third Project, with contributions from the Consortium members,
including IDA. The expansion of PPO with additional MCH and health staff will
be fully funded by the cofinanciers. Funding will include vehicles, salaries,
equipment, supplies and operating and supervision costs.
C. Monitoring and Biannual Reviews
4.11       Because of the project's slze, scope and central role in GOB's
development plan for FP and health anu in accordance with lessons from the
previous projects, MOHFIF will carry out in-built monitoring and evaluation
during its regular operations. Reporting tools, structured for each major
project intervention and supervision reports, covering output and process
indicators as well as evidence of compliance with legal covenants, will be
prepared at regular intervals by the relevant implementing offices. Managers
will be aided in their reporting tasks by the MIS systems under development.
Additionally, data will be obtained through the Bangladesh Fertility Survey,
the Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys, and the epidemiological, demographic and
health surveys under the project.
4.12       Project supervisio4. will be based on Technical and Annual Review
missions as shown in the following table:

Review missions on behalf of and in conjunction with the Consortium will occur
twice yearly. The first mission, early in the calendar year, will be known as
the Technical Review and the second mission, in September or October of each
year, will be the Annual Review. Due to the potential number of mission
members and the scope of the project, intensive dialogue with GOB colleagues
will be fostered on those broad technical and policy issues of greatest
concern at the time. In addition to these large review missions, each project
component may be subject to scrutiny by a small team of experts and special
supervision missions will be carried as needed, in response to information
from progress reports and PHO. While specific documentation and reporting
formats will be designed by the Consortium and MOHFW prior to the first review
mission, pertinent areas of focus are described below.
4.13      Indicators measuring achievement of quantitative project objectives
will include: CPR, TFR, IMR, and EPI coverage figures. Data on MMR and UMR
would provide relevant supporting information. Indicators measuring
qualitative project objectives would include service delivery indices such as
utilization rates and costs of human resources deployed, and levels of client
satisfaction. Particular attention will be given to monitoring of indicators
measuring performance related to the WID strategy for the project (para 2.2
and annex 24). In addition, GOB's annual budget allocations for the FP and
health sectors--both in absolute terms and relative to the total national
budget--and the intrasectoral priority allocations will be reviewed annually.
4.14      Further, the goal of increased coordination between the two wings
of MOHFW, as well as administrative effectiveness, will be monitored. This
will entail annual expenditure reviews for MOHFW and the degree to which the
new Health Economics and Financing Pilot Project is involved in short and long
term planning for the sector. Finally, intersectoral goals, such as improving
the status of women, will be evaluated through a combination of indicators
(see Annex 35).
4.15      Annual reports as of the end of the fiscal year will be prepared in
a mutually agreeable format by the Supervision Directorate, FPCST, MDU,
NIPORT, NIPSOM, IEDCR, NNC, IPN, ICRH, IEM/HEB, MCMU, communications
component, evaluation subcomponent, MIS (Health and Family Welfare), women's
programs and each of the Project Directors within the MOHFW, and furnished by
the Secretary, MOHFW, to IDA and the cofinanciers at least four weeks before
each annual review. Specific terms of reference for each annual review will
be worked out among the cofinanciers, IDA and the GOB not later than six
months before the review data. GOB will continue the annual review system for
the present project, as established for the Third Project.
4.16      GOB will also provide IDA and the cofinanciers with an interim
progress report every February 15 on physicAl and financial implementation of
each project component for the six month period ending December 31 in a format
reflecting the approved budget and work plan for that fiscal year. Agreement
was reached with GOB during negotiations that, by September 30, 1992, an
annual project review system acceptable to IDA, including a review of annual
budgets for the health and FP subsectors, will be established and the first
annual review of the project will take place in consultation with IDA not
later than October 31, 1992, after which required actions will be taken.



- 56 -
D. Accounts and Audits
4.17      Each participating ministry or implementing agency will prepare and
maintain in accordance with sound and generally accepted accounting principles
and practices acceptable to IDA: (a) records permitting identification of all
receipts and payments under the project; (b) financial statements, including
sources and uses of funds at the close of each fiscal year; and (c) a
certified copy of the accounts together with the auditors' report, to be
submitted to IDA as soon as possible, but not later than nine months after
the end of each fiscal year, including a separate opinion on the Special
Account and on the records and accounts used to support disbursement against
Statements of Expenditure.
4.18      The PFC will continue to audit local currency expenditures
quarterly and furnish these reports to IDA within six months of the completion
of the audited quarter. Reimbursement in each succeeding quarter will be
dependent on the availability of the PFC audit for the quarter ending six
months earlier. Agreement was reached with GOB during negotiations that
audits of project accounts by independent auditors acceptable to IDA will be
made available to IDA, within nine months of the close of each fiscal year.

V. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits
5.1       The main benefits from the project will be improved family welfare,
particularly among women and children, through greater spacing of births and
improved health status. In terms of the socio-economic and environmental
outlook of the country, the project will mitigate the intense pressure on the
limited land and other natural resources due to population growth and ease the
challenge of providing social services and employment opportunities to the
growing numbers of people. The project is a powerful catalyst for increased
investment into the social sectors of population and health under GOB's Fourth
Five-Year Plan, an increase which is strongly supported by the Bank's public
expenditure review of the country. Additional benefits will be enhanced
efficiency and effectiveness of FP and health services due to the: (i) planned
cooperation and possible integration of the currently stiil separate
subsectors of family planning and health services; (ii) reorientation of
medical education towards community medicine and public health away from the
conventional focus on medical and surgical curative care; and (iii)
significant improvement of the quality of FP and health care services.
Acceptable quality of care would also augment the utilization of services, an
important concern at present.
B. Risks
5.2       The main -isk of the project is the GOB's potential inability to
implement fully the extensive reform program in the health subsector,
including the reorientation of medical education toward community medicine and
public health. Another risk is the possible weakness of the management
capacity of the health subsector. Whereas the FP subsector has demonstrated
its capacity to handle increasingly large investments with reasonably good
results, the health subsector capacity remains to be tested. While there is
little doubt about the adequacy of financial absorptive capacity, it is the
managerial absorptive capacity that is likely to require strengthening. To
minimize these risks, the design of the project addresses the reorientation of
the medical profession, while also providing ample support to the GOB's
managerial, planning and evaluative faculties to facilitate the successful
handling of the proposed reforms. This would include intensive collaboration
with the Bangladesh Medical Association, the Medical and Dental Council, the
Medical Colleges, the World Health Organization (WHO) and various other
agencies to ensure adequate professional inputs into the process of reform and
the establishment of a robust management system.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.1       During negotiations, the following agreements were reached that the
GOB wills
(i)   hire, by January 1, 1995, qualified women to fill at least 4,500 of
the 5,000 vacant HA positions in its outreach services and prepare
and furnish to IDA for comments, by March 31, 1992, a plan on the

BANGLADESH
FOURTH POPULATION AND HEALTH PROJECT
vore Investments for Population, Health and Education
1.          The Core Fourth Five Year Plan (FFYP, FY1991-FY1996) projects for
population, health and education will be discussed together, as they are
integral parts of the government's strategy for human resource development and
both raise similar issues for the public expenditure program. There is no
question that human resource development warrants the high priority accorded
it in the FFYP. Current levels of human capital formation are unacceptably
low by any standard and constitute a serious constraint on the country's long-
term development prospects and aspirations for social equity. Life expectancy
at birth is 52-54 years for males and 49-51 for females, due in part to an
infant mortality rate that is quite high (110 per 1000 live births). In
family planning, there has been substantial progress, with the contraceptive
prevalence rate increasing from 7.7Z in 1975 to 33? in 1989, while the total
fertility rate has fallen from over 7 per woman of childbearing age in 1975 to
around 4.9 in 1990, due largely to increasing contraceptive prevalence and
changes in nuptiality patterns (especially an increasing age of marriage).
Nevertheless, the current population growth rate of around 2.4 per annum
remains very high in relation to low per-capita income and high population
density (1199 per km2 of cultivable land). The adult literacy rate is
estimated at 33?, with a female literacy rate of only about 20?. Enrollment
ratios as of 1987 were 61? for primary education (50? for girls) and 24? for
secondary education (15? for girls). Experience from Bangladesh as well as
many other countries demonstrates that significant improvements can be
achieved in these "quality of life" indicators, which would also provide
substantial economic benefits over the long-term by improving labor
productivity and accelerating the adoption of improved technologies.
Achieving this objective, however, requires a clear political recognition of
the importance of human resource development, an ability to innovate and adopt
new procedures, many of which may be opposed by entrenched public sector
bureaucracies, and a long-term commitment to allocate substantial amounts of
additional funding to expanding and improving human resource development
programs, while maintaining the necessary financial discipline on other areas
in the budget to make these programs sustainable.
2.        The primary reason for low levels of human resource development has
been inadequate expenditures, both historically and at the current time.
Expenditures for health care and family planning, which accounted for a little
over 5? of the total government budget in FY88 (0.8? of GDP), represents an
expenditure of approximately US$l per capita for health services and 50 cents
for family planning, a level that is very lo( both in absolute and relative
terms as compared to other low income countries. Similarly, expenditures for
education comprised 1.8? of GDP in FY88 (10? of government expenditures), a
level that is one-half or less of the level found in other South Asian
countries (except Pakistan). While these statistics are revealing, they are
only a part of the story, as the quality of services is inadequate as well.



- 63 -
Annex 1
Page 2 of 12
In primary education, the curriculum is overloaded and highly theoretical,
while the amount of student-teacher contract time is inadequate (a maximum of
472 hours per annum in the initial grades). The drop-out and student wastage
rates are very high, such that only 142 of entering primary school students
actually complete the full five-year curriculum within the stated time (as
compared to 55Z in other low income countries). In the health sector, the
1988 BIDS Survey found that while there has been a substantial reallocation of
the budget to rural health services, reinforced by donor support for the
development of Upazila Health Centers (UHCs), the utilization of these
facilities has been poor; while this partly reflects socio-cultural patterns,
it is also due to inadequate quality of service, with in-patient facilities at
UHCs having a utilization rate of only around 50Z and out-patient facilities
showing a somewhat higher but similar pattern. Only in family planning does
the government appear to have established an effect system for providing
services, relying on female outreach workers and the provision of
contraceptives through both public and private sector channels. Even though
the family planning program is cost-effective on a per-capita basis, its total
cost already amounts to one-third of the budget for health and family planning
and a substantial increase in total cost will be required in order to raise
the CPR rate to the necessary level of 60Z-70Z.
3.        In this situation, the best strategy for the government and the
donors would be to expand the programs for primary health care, family
planning and primary education as rapidly as possible, subject only to
constraints imposed by local implementation capacity (including the need for
improvements in service quality). This is essentially the strategy adopted by
the Fourth Population and Health and General Education projects, drawing on a
unique model of government-donor coordination that has been established for
family planning and health in the form of the Population and Health
Consortium. The Consortium, which is an informal body chaired by IDA that
receives direct financial support from several donors to cover administrative
costs, was originally established as a mechanism for coordinating donor
programs in the family planning field and reducing the burden on the
government of having to deal with many separate donor agencies. Its
successful experience in terms of coordinating policy formulation, avoiding
overlaps in program design, and mobilizing funds to support a rapid increase
in family planning activities has encouraged the Censortium to extend its
activities into the health sector under the Fourth Population and Health
Project, where donor financing has traditionally been limited and provided on
an individual project basis. In addition, a similar consortium has been
formed for the education sector to take over the management and financing of
the General Education project. Eight donors are involved in cofinancing the
General Education prrject (which was approved in FY90 and recently became
effective, while almost twenty donor agencies (including specialized agencies)
were involved in the recent appraisal of the Fourth Population and Health
project, which is expected to be approved during FY91.
4.        The approach adopted by the General Education Project is to focus
heavily on improvement in education quality in order to address the root
causes of high student wastage rates and limited educational relevance to the
student's a needs. Thus, almost half of total project costs (estimated at



- 64 -
Annex 1
Page 3 of 12
US$310 million for the FFYP period) are devoted to quality enhancement
programs, including training and retraining of primary school teachers,
textbook development and distribution, and curriculum development at the
primary and secondary level. The program of physical construction is
relatively modest, providing for only 30? of the projected classroom needs
during the project period, with a heavy emphasis on renovation and improvement
of existing facilities. Several innovative components are included to test
alternative approaches to educational expansion, including a pilot program
for satellite schools in under-served villages which demonstrate strong
community support, a grant program to promote involvement by NGOs and
community-based groups in non-formal primary education programs and outreach
activities in order to encourage the very poor and girls to participate in
primary education, and experience with reduced construction standards (at a
cost of 40? of regular school structures). Finally, a special effect is being
made to develop the management systems and information base needed by the
sector institutions to support a take-off of the primary education program by
the end of the FFYP to achieve universal primary education by the year 2000,
defined as 90? enrollment of eligible school age children in primary education
programs of acceptable quality.
5.        The Fourth Population and Health Project adopts a more aggressive
approach to expansion of the sector, based on the successful experience
achieved in the family planning program up to now. Approximately 54? of total
project costs (roughly $320 million out of $600 million total) will be devoted
to family planning activities, of which the delivery of family planning
services, including salaries of outreach workers and contraceptive supplies,
represents the largest single activity (approximately $200 million). Another
25? of project costs will go to improving health service delivery, including
training of health service practitioners, control of preventable diseases
(especially those affecting the poor) and renovation of rural health
facilities (primarily union level facilities and UHCs). The remaining project
costs will be devoted to support system activities, including information
systems, management improvements, and communication programs to generate
demand for family planning and maternal health services, as well as efforts
in support of intersectoral women's programs. Several notable features of the
project deserve emphasis. First of all, there is a major effort to shift the
focus of public sector health programs increasingly towards services oriented
to women, children and the poor, where the deficiencies in health care are
more severe and where the justification for public sector financing (as
compared to private sector services) is strongest. Secondly, there is a
strong emphasis on improvements in the quality of care, rather than the
expansion of physical facilities which has dominated the health program up to
now. Quality enhancement requires a multi-faceted approach to the sector,
including training, provision of adequate supplies, improvements in management
and supervision, appropriate incentives, and targeting of health services, all
of which will be addressed under the project. A third aspect of the project
is the increased recognition of the complementary nature of health and family
planning services and the need to achieve a closer integration in serve
delivery, as compared to the artificial division of responsibilities that has
existed in the health ministry up to now. Finally, based on the demonstrated
success of community outreach programs in the family planning field, greater



- 65 -
Annex 1
Page 4 of 12
efforts will be made to promote community participation and communication
throughout the health sector.
6.        Given the large size of the projects and their stated objective to
bring about a permanent increase in the share of GDP devoted to the social
sectors, questions as to their long-term sustainabilit, are clearly relevant.
The projects will have a major impact on the recurrent obligations of the
government, which, even though the initial impact will be modest because of
extensive donor financing of recurrent expenditures, will eventually have to
be borne largely by the government form its own revenues. Financial
projections prepared for the General Education project indicate that achieving
UPE by the year 2000 will require an average annual increase in the budget for
primary and secondary education in excess of 71 p.a. in real terms, of which
the largest share will go for recurrent costs such as teachers' salaries,
school supplies (e.g., textbooks), maintenance of school buildings, and
inservice training of teachers. For the Fourth Population and Health Project,
financial projections from the 1989 Health Financing and Expenditure Study
indicate that the increase in costs needed to improve service quality and
continue the expansion of the existing system will require a growth in the
budget for health and family planning in excess of 8Z p.a. in real terms, of
which approximately 90Q of the cost increase will be in the form of recurrent
expenditures. Given the very low share of GDP and the government budget
currently allocated to these sectors, it is possible to argue tha_ such an
increase should be affordable and manageable by the government. Nevertheless,
given the experience of the past ten years during which revenue growth has
stagnated and non-essential recurrent expenditures have increased rapidly, it
is clear that a major increase in recurrent expenditures by the social sectors
would put serious pressure on the budget unless the government simultaneously
increases revenues and/or reallocates funds from other sectors, or the donors
are willing to accept long-term responsibility for financing recurrent costs.
7.        In the short term, there appear to be adequate grounds for
confidence that the government will provide sufficient resources to support
the efficient implementation of the Fourth Population and Health Project and
the General Education projects. Unlike the experience in many other sectors
(e.g., water resources) where shortages of local funding have been a major
cause of poor project implementation, the Planning Commission has provided
sufficient local funding to support efficient project implementation of major
family planning and education projects; in addition these allocations have
been preferentially protected during periods of budgetary cut-backs, as in the
past few years. This is reflected in the generally good disbursement
performance of the projects. The recently completed Second Primary Education
project tended to disburse ahead of schedule. While there were some delays in
disbursements in the initial stages of the Third Population and Health
project, these can be attributed largely to management problems in the
Ministry of Health which have now been adequately resolved, so that the
project is disbursing normally. Both the Fourth Population and Health project
and the General Education project place heavy emphasis on upgrading the
management capacity of sectoral institutions, as well as maintaining close
coordination between the donors within the respective consortiums. Thus,
unless there is an unexpected change in the priority afforded to the social



- 66 -
Annex 1
Page 5 of 12
sectors by the government, both projects can be expected to perform reasonably
well.
8.        In the longer-tarm, the ability of the government to absorb the
financial impact of these projects is likely to be determined primarily by the
extent to which it can maintain financial discipline on the growth of other
recurrent costs in the sectors. The government has routinely used the excuse
of tight constraints on the recurrent budget as a way to argue for a large
share of donor financing of recurrent expenditures in social sector projects,
generally covering 902 of total costs, including local salaries and other
costs. Thus, for example, in the General Education project, the donors agreed
to finance the cost of all net new female teachers over the project period on
a declining basis, both in order to moderate the impact of the recurrent cost
burden on the budget and to provide a positive incentive to the government to
hire additional female teachers as a way of encouraging higher enrollments by
girls. In the Fourth Population and Health project, the government has agreed
to absorb the salaries of family welfare assistants (i.e., female family
planning outreach workers) hired under past projects on a phased basis, but
the project will continue to hire additional female health and family planning
workers with the costs largely absorbed by the donors.
9.        While the excuse of budgetary constraints is valid in the short
term and provides adequate justification for financing recurrent expenditures
in order to expand services at a rapid pace, in the medium term the government
has shown considerable flexibility in varying sectoral shares of recurrent
expenditures, although not necessarily in a manner that is consistent with its
stated policy objectives. For example, between FY83-88, recurrent
expenditures in the education sector grew at the rate of 23.5Z p.a.,
significantly faster than the growth of overall recurrent expenditures (18.12
p.a.) or the growth of education expenditures in the ADP (17.02 p.a.). While
a large share of this increase was due to general inflation of public sector
wage scales, as well as some additional teachers hired as a result of new
capacity created by donor-financed projects, the principle factors behind the
extraordinary rate of expansion of education costs had relatively little to do
with the government's stated objectives in the sector. Between FY80 and FY9C,
the government progressively increased the rate of subvention for teachers'
salaries in private secondary schools from 502 in the FY80-85 period, 602 in
FY86, 702 in FY87-89, and finally to 802 in FY90; moreover, the number of
private secondary schools accredited by the government (and thus eligible for
the subvention) increased at a rapid rate. In addition, approximately 4,000
primary schools were nationalized by the government during the past five
years, despite policy statements that the practice of nationalizing schools
would be strictly limited. While well-conceived policies to mix public and
private funds may well form a part of a long-term strategy for the government
to achieve its education goals, the decisions so far have not been justified
on any clear policy basis and appear to have had little impact on improving
educational quality or addressing other major issues in the sector. Instead,
the decisions have been made largely in an ad-hoc manner and in response to
the demands of well-organized and politically powerful teachers unions.
Similarly, the former government announced its intention during 1990 to
introduce compulsory primary education from January 1, 1991. While such a



- 67 -
Annex 1
Page 6 of 12
goal is clearly desirable in the long term, no attempt has been made to
reconcile this policy with the carefully conceived program for achieving
universal primary education under the General Education Project. Moreover, in
terms of the availability of classrooms, teachers, school supplies, and an
adequate curriculum, the introduction of compulsory primary education is
several years premature and could result in a further deterioration of the
already inadequate quality of education that is provided. The government
provided a block grant of Tk 100 crore in the FY91 recurrent budget in order
to support the achievement of compulsory primary education, although the
precise allocation of this sum has not been announced and it reportedly is
being reduced because of overall budgetary pressures. Moreover, the major
policy instrument that has been announced to achieve compulsory primary
education, which is a subvention of TK 500 per month to four teachers in
recognized non-governmental primary schools, appears to have little relation
to expanding the quality or quantity of primary education, despite its
substantial budgetary cost (in the range of Tk 15-20 crore on an annual
basis).
10.       In the health and family planning sector, the experience of the
past ten years has been different. Recurrent expenditures rose at an annual
rate of 7.22 p.a., from FY83-88, much less than the growth of the overall
recurrent budget, while expenditures for health and population in the ADP grew
at the rate of 21.7Z p.a., well above the rate of increase of 10.7Z for the
overall ADP. As demonstrated by the 1989 Health Financing and Expenditure
Study, while there was a significant change in the targeting of expenditures
form urban to rural health services, the net impact was a more extensive and
thus more costly but lower quality care system given that the change was
accomplished within a fixed budget. This explains much of the problems
experienced by the UHCs in terms of poor service quality and low utilization
rates which is being addressed under the Fourth Population and Health project,
with further substantial inputs of donor financing.
11.       While much of the focus of the discussion on long-term
sustainability has been on aggregate levels of public expenditures, two
additional factors need to be considered for a complete picture. The first is
the role of non-governmental institutions, including NGOs, charitable bodies,
local organizations, and private individuals. Historically low rates of
public expenditures in the social sectors do not necessarily imply that
service were not available. Indeed, as shown by the 1989 Health Financing and
Expenditut.e Study, over half of total expenditures on health services, albeit
including curative adult care, currently take place through non-governmental
channels. Similarly, in the education sector, most secondary schools are in
the non-governmental sector (although they receive a large share of their
revenues from the government) as well as a significant number of primary
schools. Given the long-term constraints on the government budget, non-
government institutions and individuals should be encouraged to continue
playing a very major role in the provision of health and education services.
There are several ways in which this can be achieved. Government services can
be better targeted to address areas where the private sector response has not
been adequate; as mentioned earlier, the Fourth Population and Health Project
includes a major effort to target health services increasingly to the needs of



- 68 -
Annex 1
Page 7 of 12
women, children and the poor, including reserving 70? of the facilities in new
UHCs and district hospitals for services aimed at women and children.
Training of health personnel and teachers and adequate provision of drugs,
contraceptives and learning materials through private sector channels can also
provide ways in which non-governmental services can be strengthened. Finally,
there may be a role for various types of long-term cost-sharing arrangements
between the public sector and non-governmental organizations in health and
education, but these programs need to be carefully evaluated and clearly
linked to objective standards of quality and service enhancement, rather than
unplanned and poorly targeted budgetary transfers that have been introduced up
to now.
12.       A second area affecting long-term sustainability, which is closely
linked to the role of the non-governmental sector, is cost-sharing for
government services.   The government made some modest increases in health and
education fees in 1987 and 1988, but since then there has been little changes,
except for a roll-back in fees at UHFWCs and for girls at the primary level in
FY90. There is widespread agreement that the social benefits of primary
health care and family planning and primary education, so important that fees
should not be raised to a level that would significantly impeded demand.
Moreover, better targeting of public services (for example, to maternal and
child health care) may reduce the capacity of the sector to generate revenu.es.
Nevertheless, there is some evidence that well-designed programs of cost-
sharing enhance service quality and demand, particularly if the revenues are
retained at the local level to cover local costs. The argument for increasing
levels of cost-sharing is particularly strong where public funds are being
used to substitute for private contributions or where the socio-economic
status of the beneficiaries is primarily from the higher income groups (e.g.
specialized hospitals and university education). While more work is needed in
both the health and education sectors to design appropriate forms of rnst-
sharing (which ideally should be linked to improvement in service quality to
generate public support), the government should also demonstrate a firmer
intention to pursue cost-sharing by adjusting the current structure of fees
more frequently.
13.       In summary, the government clearly recognizes the importance of
human resource development and follows sound policy initiatives in the form of
the Fourth Population and Health project and the General Education project to
put its plans into practice. The broad and enthusiastic response of the donor
community to these projects provides an ample demonstration that this strategy
commands widespreau support among Bangladesh's development partners. While
endorsing this approach, recognition has to be given to broader developments
in these sectors, as well. In this regard, the government's record in the
health and education sectors during the past decade has not beenL particularly
satisfactory and demonstrates an undue sensitivity to short-term political
considerations, rather than consistent support for the long-term development
strategy agreed with and financed by the donors. This is a very complex
problem to resolve. First of all, many of the decisions were not made in
consultation with sector agencies but rather represented ad-hoc political
decisions. Secondly, the sector agencies themselves have not developed a
capacity to analyze financing issues affecting the health and education

sectors, a problem that is being addressed under both the Fourth Population
and Health and General Education projects. Finally, while the government has
developed some capacity to analyze projects in the context of the development
budget, very little attention has been paid to the development impact of the
recurrent budget, where most of the problems affecting the sectors have
originated.
14.       The new government can claim a legitimate mandate to improve the
quality and coverage of health and education services in a sound and cor'-
effective manner, and Bangladesh has developed a tremendous base of goodwill
and technical support in the form of the Population and Health Consortium and
the Education Consortium to put these polices into practice. Up to now, the
government has been reluctant to discuss policies and programs that lie
outside the purview of specific donor projects, claiming that this would
represent an unwarranted interference into its internal affairs. Such a
stance is inconsistent, given that the government has already asked the donors
to provide extensive financing of recurrent expenditures and to support
programs that would have a major long-term impact on the share of overall
resources devoted to these sectors. The government needs to account for its
actions in the sectors, both within the framework of specific projects and
more generally within the context of the overall budget. Questions such as
long-term donor financing of recurrent expenditures, cost recovery, and the
government's stated objective of greater self-reliance can only be answered in
the context of overall development prospects for the sectors, not in terms of
the sustainability of individual project initiatives.

/1    The figures shown are projected estimates (except for FY91) based on
planned expansion of infrastructure assuming an annual increase of 4.9Z
(Griffin, 1989: Mobilizing Resources for Health and Family PlannxiLg.
1987 Bangladesh Health Expenditure Study. Table 7). This constitutes
7.26Z of the total projected revenue budget for GOB.
/2    This constitutes 7.31 of the total Fourth Five-Year Plan outlay.
/3    This amounts to 63.22 of the original Fourth Five-Year Plan outlay for
FP and health thus representing a marginal increase compared to the 602
that would be expected for the three-year period on a pro-rata basis.
This shows the GOB commitment to the FP and health sector, especially in
the light of cuts made across the board in the three-year rolling plan.
/4    This is derived by combining costs of the Fourth Project with those of
other ADP costs, including GOB contributions to them.
A     This represents 33Z of the total estimated injection of funds into the
sector (i.e., GOB revenue budget, ADP costs and direct NGO funding).
/6    This amounts to 27.5Z of the total Fourth Project costs.
/7    This equals 30Z of the total Fourth Project costs and 9.82 of the total
estimated expenditure in the sector during the project period (FY92-96).
/9    This estimate is derived by adding GOB's estimated revenue budget for
the period, GOB's estimated ADP budget for the period and direct NGO
funding.

FOURTH POPULATION AND HEALTR PROJECT
An Overview of the Population and Health System in Bangladesh
1.        Bangladesh is administratively divided into 4 Divisions, 64
Districts, 460 Upazilas and 4,403 Unions. Several villages constitute a
Union, which with a population of 20,000 - 25,000, is the smallest
administrative unit for FP and Health Service delivery.
History
2.        Family Planning in Bangladesh has its historical roots in the
establishment in 1952 of the voluntary East Pakistan Family Planning
Association. In 1965, d strong program of family planning was initiated and
by 1970 a large autonomous organization with field workers had been set up to
carry out and coordinate population activities. After independence it was
made part of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as one of its wings.
The FP program in Bangladesh has had ambitious and unrealistic goals all
along, but these reflected the seriousness with which the problem was viewed
and the commitment of the Government to address it. The impact of the FP
efforts is apparent from the enhanced awareness about contraceptive methods,
the increased use of contraceptives and the resultant decline in fertility.
Although falling short of the challenging targets set earlier, the results so
far are a positive indication that the strategies are working.
3.        Historically the health sector in Bangladesh has not been mucL of a
priority sector, partly due to the more pressing issues of population and
partly due to the severe resource constraints under which the country has had
to operate. Although the Ministry of Health is committed to the goal of
"Health for All by the Year 2000", the low priority accorded to the sector is
evident from the fact that on average as little as 3.2 X of the total
development budget was allocated to health during the 19808.
4.        Generally, the "health" care and training facilities have been
oriented towards curative "medical" care. Nonetheless, more recently GOB has
endeavoured to bring Primary Health Care (PHC) closer to the community through
the establishment of Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs) and Union Health and
Family Welfare Centers (FWCs) and the development of field workers in health
as well as family planning. The current situation in this regard is being
described below from paragraph 11 onwards.
5.        Some major milestones in the development of health services in
Bangladesh were: the adoption of the National Drug Policy in 1982 to ensure
the availability of essential drugs; the establishment of a pharmaceutical
plant at Bogra; the strengthening of the drug testing laboratories; the
constitution of two Medical Boards, one for indigenous systems (Una.ai and
Ayurvedic) and one for a Homeopathic System to regulate educational standards
and practice of these systems; the adoption of an admission policy for the
medical colleges, setting out criteria based on merit, quotas for women,



- 92 -
Annex 13
Page 2 of 6
tribal students, etc.; the introduction of a Private Clinics and Laboratories
Act (1982) to regulate and monitor private sector medical care; and, the
adoption of a policy to post medical graduates in rural areas at least for two
years.
VP and Health Services Facilities
6.        Three categories of agencies provide FP and health services in
Bangladeshi the Government, non-government organizations (NGOs) and the
private sector (for-profit). However, systematically organized service
delivery is largely implemented by the Government through its Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare and its nationwide infrastructure of training,
research and service facilities.
7.        Little information is available on the private sector, but GOB
estimates that there are currently about 16,000 qualified allopathic
physicians, of which only 6,160 are employed by the Government (who may also
engage in private practice after-hours). Given the poor economic conditions,
especially in the rural areas, most of the private allopathic medical care is
centered around cities and towns where the purchasing power is concentrated.
The private facilities are by -to means limited to physicians; there has been
an increase of nursing and medical assistant graduates and many new private
laboratories, drug stores and clinics have emerged in Dhaka in the last few
years. In the rural areas, physicians with a medical degree are outnumbered
by indigenous practitioners, the quality of care by whom is difficult to
monitor. Contraceptive services provided by the private sector are few and
far between, with the exception of the successful social marketing program.
8.        The role played by NGOs is undoubtedly significant, both in FP and
in health care. They generally operate as non-profit organizations, funded by
charitable foundations or interndtional development agencies. The NGOs tend
to have greater resources focussing on smaller geographical areas, thus being
able to provide a markedly better quality of care than the Government
facilities. However, since they bring different types of bureaucracies with
them and operate within their specific mandates, there is a need for
coordinating their efforts to maximize the benefits from their inputs and keep
a national perspecLive.
9.        The FP and health system of the Government is best described in
accordance with the different levels at which a tangible structural and/or
functional framework exists (see charts 1-4). At the national level, the
highest body vested with the responsibility of the nation's health and
population issues is the MOHFW. Headed by a Cabinet Minister, this Ministry
formulates policies and plans and coordinates all the activities related to FP
and health in the country, both public and private. The Ministry has a
Secretariat with a Secretary, an Additional Secretary, Joint Secretaries,
Deputy Secretaries and Section officers, as well as planning and coordination
cells for FP and health. The FP and health wings of the Ministry each has a
Directorate headed by a Director-General assisted by Directors for individual
program areas.  Special units responsible for information activities fur-tion
within each wing, called IEH in the FP wing and HEB in the health wing. There



- 93 -
Annex 13
Page 3 of 6
are also separate Management Information Systems for FP and health wings, the
latter being under development.
10.       On the technical side, apex bodies have been established at the
national level, to advise the Ministry and the Directorates on relevant area3
of expertise, to train and develop human resources, to provide specialized
clinical and preventive care services and to conduc~t research on important
issues confronting the sector. Importaz.t among such institutions are the
Institute of Post-graduate Medical Education and Research, NIPORT, NIPSOM,
IEDCR, IPH, CHE, the National Leprosy Institute, the Infectious Disease and
Chest Hospital and a number of smaller centers and institutes focussing on
various non-communicable diseases such as cardio-vascular disorders,
ophthalmic problems, diabetes and cancer. Tertiary care and medical and
nursing training of broader scope is provided to some extent by the 8 medical
colleges and their hospitals, one nursing college, eight medical assistant
training schools and two paramedical institutes. Facilities providing general
health care to selected categories of the population are one Government
employees' hospital, nine railway hospitals, three labour union hospitals, 20
police hospitals and 19 jail hospitals. Other special care centers include
four TB hospitals, eight TB sanatoria, three leprosy hospitals, one mental
hospital, one dental hospital, one casualty hospital and eight clinics under
family planning.
11.       Each Division has two full-time Divisional Directors (DDs) one each
for FP/MCH and health.   The major responsibility of DDs is to supervise and
coordinate district staff. The DDs FP/MCH are not provided with technical
staff to assist in their functions. Like the Secretariat, the present
district and divisional organization, particularly for FP, is the result of
administrative changes that occurred in the 19808.  No specific Dhvisional FP
or health care facilities exist.
12.       At the level of the district, the Deputy Director PP is in charge
of FP and MCH services and is assisted by one full-time Assistant Director and
one Medical Officer (MO) for MCH and clinical contraception.  The HO is also
in charge of the district's urban facilities, and this responsibility
constrains the time (s)he spends on supervision of the work in rural upazilas.
On the health side, each district is headed by a Civil Surgeon who has
technical support staff for health education, statistics, epidemiology, etc.
District hospitals are not uniform in bed numbers and staff ccemplements. Of
the 64 district hospitals, 43 have 50 beds each and are planned to be upgraded
to 100 beds each. In addition to district hospitals, 93 Maternal and Child
Welfare Centers (MCWC, of which 84 are currently functional) service district
and subdistrict levels. Most MCWCs have 10 beds each and a staff of two FWVs
and support staff. MCWCs at the district's urban center also have an MO.
13.       At the upazila and union levels FP and health services are
functionally integrated. The three main functionaries in an upazila are the
Upazila Health and FP Officer (UHFPO), the Upazila Family Planning Officer
(UFPO), and the Medical Officer (MO) in-charge of the MCH/FP Unit at the
Upazila Health Complex (UHC). The position of MO (MCH/FP) is filled by
deputation from the Directorate of Health. According to the latest

Annex 13
Page 4 of 6
governmental order, the UHFPO and the UFPO report to the Upazila chairman, who
is responsible for coordinating both FP and Health services under functional
integration. In pursuance of the decision o! the NPCC, an Upazila Family
Planning Committee chaired by the Upazila Parishad Chairman has been
constituted in each Upazila. The Committee, consisting of electet
representatives and concerned officials as members, has the UFPO a its
Member-Secretary. The Committee ie responsible for implementing the FP
program in the upazila within the decentralized set-up. Coordination of HCH
activities, shared by the two directorates, is car.ied out by a National
Coordination Committee headed by the Secretary MOHFW at national level, by
district coordination committees chaired by the Civil Surgeon at district
level, and by upazila coordination committees chaired by the UHFPO at upazila
level (see chart 3). Functional UHCs, each with an MCH/FP unit (with
facilities for institutional MCH care), so far have been established in 349 of
the country's 397 upazilas.
14.       FWCs form the focal point for FP and health services in the unions.
Each FWC is headed by a Medical Assistant (MA) and has two other positions,
one Family Welfare Visitor (FWV) and one Pharmacist. The Pharmacist positions
are mostly vacant. The FWC's field staff comprises a two-member team of one
female Family Welfare Assistant (FWA) and cne male Health Assistant (HA), each
team being responsible for about 4,000 people. The FWAs are supervised by a
Family Planning Assistant (FPA) and the HAs by an Assistant Health Inspector
(AHI), both males. While the work of field staff is coordinated at the FWC
through monthly meetings, the first line supervisors are administratively
controlled by the UFPO and the Health Inspector (HI) located at the upazila
headquarters. The FWA is essentially an FP and MCH worker, while the HA is
responsible for malaria control, epidemic control, environmental sanitation
and general health work. To complement domiciliary service delivery by field
workers, satellite clinics are conducted by FWVs in selected locations on
fixed days. Satellite clinic activities are in their very early stages of
development and much more has to be done to make them effective.
Institutional facilities for MCH care are available at all functional FWCs.
15.       A second type of health facility at union level is the Rural
Dispensary (RD), of which 1,275 are in place and are administered under the
Healch Wing of the MOHFW.  The RDs are staffed in various ways, but mainly by
MAs. In 1983, the GOB decided to unify the functions and staffing patterns of
FWCs and RDs and, over time, to upgrade RDs to FWCs in unions without FWCs.
Contrary to this decision, the Health Wing in 1983 assigned about 600
physicians to RDs. Meanwhile, the MOHFW has decided however, that whenever
RDs are redesignated as FWCs, all the physicians will be reassigned.
16.       With completion of the 1,000 FWCs currently under construction,
2,500 unions will have full-fledged FWCs and 1,275 unions will have RDs; more
than 70? of the RDs however, provide only rudimentary services.
17.       Institutional facilities for sterilization are available in all 351
functional UHCs, 84 MCWCs (of which 48 are located at district or sub-district
levels), 64 district hospitals and the eight medical college hospitals.
Selected FWCs provide sterilization services from time to time. This is in

addition to facilities in the )rivate sector and hospitals of other
governmental agencies like the military, railways, etc. Facilities for IUD
insertions are available in all t-ne above facilities, in 2,035 FWCs, in 607
hired clinics and in those unions where a trained FWV has been posted,
irrespective of the availability of a constructed physical facility or hired
clinic. At union level, some 3,700 FWVs are posted. Injectables are
delivered at 11 UHCs and at MCWCs and unions where FWVs are posted.

FOURTH POPULATION AND HEALTH PROJECT
Issues in the Population Sector
During implementation of the three previous projects, satisfactory
understandings were reached regarding some issues of concern to the GOB, IDA,
and other members of the Consortium of donors for the sector, i.e. regarding
demographic targets, the contraceptive mix, the FP and MCH service balance,
and incentives. The GOB used to establ.sh demographic targets during the
First and Second Five-Year Plans that were, by no means, attainable.
Discussions between the GOB and donors at the start of the Third Five-Year
Plan led, however, to a near consensus under which the aim would be to reach a
CPR of 392 or better by 1990 and of about 48-50? by 1995, as well as an NRR of
1 by 2000 or early thereafter, which would be maintained until a zero
population growth rate was reached. Consensus also has been reached that the
demographic realities of Bangladesh require all-out efforts to achieve early
demographic stabilization (NRR 1) and all avoidable delays and bottlenecks
should be avoided. In regard to the contraceptive mix, the early emphasis on
terminal methods has given way to a mix emphasizing temporary contraceptive
methods, particularly pills, condoms, injectable and implants for low parity
couples, and sterilization for those who have achieved the desired family size
and want to terminate childbearing. The need to keep the mix under constant
review and to adjust to changing circumstances has been agreed. The problem
of striking a balance between FP and MCH services has been addressed since
1985 and some progress has been made in correcting the imbalance. Efforts
will have to be continued for many years until the present infrastructure and
manpower levels, which are insufficient to tackle the problem of high maternal
morbidity and mortality, are strengthened considerably. The Fourth Five-Year
Plan addresses this issue in some depth. GOB's incentive system, developed
over the years, had also led to some controversy, particularly regarding
punishment of field workers who failed to achieve sterilization targets and
payments to agents who referred cases for sterilization. These components
were perceived as violating the principle of free choice in contraception and
led to malpractice, neglect of follow-up and withholding of information to
clients. After an extensive study in this connection, the GOB has abolished
the system of payment of referral fees to referral agents. They have also
withdrawn orders for punishing field workers who failed to meet their FP
ta-gets.

FOURTH POPULATION AND REALTH PROJECT
Bangladesht A High Point in Donor Coordination
1.        There are over a dozen donors, bilateral and multilateral, who want
to assist in addressing the very urgent and very severe population problems
which Bangladesh is facing. Some of these donors were providing assistance to
this end long before the Bank's arrival in 1972.  Many of the problems
associated with poorly coordinated donor relationships were present in the
Bangladesh case, as well. It took over a decade to work out the present
impressive mechanisms that now govern the workings of the Bangladesh
Population and Health Consortium (a semi-formal grouping of the Bank, seven
cofinanciers, and several UN agencies). Developing and maintaining the
Consortium's financial and administrative relationships is one reason the
Bangladesh population projects have always had high coefficients.
2.        The Bank's first project was able to mobilize more support from
more donors than had previously been involved, and linked six of them ir. an
initial cofinancing relationship. At that time, all but one of the
cofinanciers preferred to have parallel financing agreements with the
government, with separate financial and operational reports, and separate
supervision missions. Thanks to the Bank's intervention on this front, donor
competition and confusion was reduced, and external resources were increased;
but it was to take years before the pn ties learned how to minimize the
administrative burdens which multiple donors often mean for a government.
3.        The initial cofinancing arrangements were converted into a more
structured Population and Health Consortium in 1987. Membership is limited to
the Bank and its cofinancing partners, with WHO. UNFPA and UNICEF as executing
agencies for a number of activities. Today, most members continue to sign
separate agre-aments with the government and cross-agreements with the Bank
(i.e. parallel financing remains the dominant mode, but under a master co-
financing agreement between the Bank and the government). In time, most
Consortium members have agreed to turn over their funds to the Bank for
centralized disbursement under a Trust Fund arrangement, using Bank
disbursement rules. The government needs to submit reports only to the Bank,
which then submits financial reports to each donor.
4.        The Consortium members remain on good terms with each other, and
with the other donors who remain outside (e.g. ADB and USAID; USAID has
applied for membership, but has not yet been incorporated). Donor
coordination does not stop az the borders of the financing Consortium; non-
members often attend meetings of the Consortium as observers. Consortiun
members have agreed to share the costs of a project administrator and, ince
1986/87, three additional professionals in the Bank's Dhaka office. After a
few years, as noted above, most Consortium members agreed to turn over their
funds to the Bank for centralized disbursement, using common disbursement
rules, centralized accounting, and consolidated financial reporting. This

Annex 23

imposes so much additional administrative work on Bank headquarters that a
four-person Project Support Unit had to be set up, much the largest and most
complex of the many Trust Funds for which the Bank acts as trustee. The Bank
had to be persuaded to take on these special arrangements, and to shoulder the
added costs (in effect, the interest earnings of the donors' trust funds are
paying these administrative costs). Consortium members agree to limit their
field supervision to participation in two Bank-led annual missions: one is a
50-60 person program-review-cum-field-visit mission in February/March, the
other a smaller supervision mWssion in September/October. Relations with the
government today are actually so good that in early 1990 the government asked
Consortium members for advice on its health and family welfare program for the
next Five Year Plan. The Bank arranged a three-day working meeting for this
purpose in May 1990, at WHO's Geneva 'headquarters.
5.        Instead of falling victim to rivalries and administrative
complexities, donor coordinatioi and co-financing continue to grow: a new
population and health project is under preparation that looks to be twice the
size of Population III; the Consortium is likely to expand from seven members
to 10 or 12 during the next fiscal year. The Bangladesh Population and Health
Consortium is probably the longest-lived, largest, most complex, and perhaps
the most successful example of donor coordination and cofinancing in the
history of Bank operations.
6.        Slowing population growth takes years, of course; but donors now
think they see light at the end of the tunnel. The contraceptive prevalence
rate (CPR) has risen from 7.7Z in 1975 to 33? in 1989. The total fertility
rate (TFR) has fallen from over 7.0 in 1977 to between 4.6 and 4.9 today.
With only a slight increase in the age of marriage, active population
policies, family planning and MCH seems to deserve most of the credit for
these hopeful trends. The government deserves high marks on these
achievements, but it could never have made as much progress as it has without
the remarkably effective system of donor coordination and cofinancing which
has been built up in the sector over the past 17 years. Some other countries
have noted the success of the arrangements worked out over the years in
Bangladesh, and have expressed interest in Bank assistance in doing something
similar to this arrangement.

Indicators for Monitoring Women in Development Strategy
The following performance indicators are based on the gender
consideration guidelines identified by the Consortium during the Appraisal
Mission for the Fourth Population and Health Project. Some indicators are more

FOURTH POPULATION AND HEALTH PROJECT
Nursing Services
1.        In 1977 the Directorate of Nursing Services (DNS) was established
under the Health Wing of the MOHFW within the Directorate of Health Services.
The DNS is responsible for the planning, administration, organization,
implementation, supervision, coordination and evaluation of nursing education
programs and nursing services in health facilities throughout the country.
The DNS advises the MOHFW, the Directorate of Health Services, other
Directorates, and other institutions about nursing matters. It maintains
liaison with international nursing organizations.
2.        The DNS is composed of a Director, two Deputy Directors, one each
for Education and Administration, two Assistant Directors in the Headquarters
Office and one Assistant Director in each of the four divisions. These
Divisional Assistant Directors work with the Divisional Deputy Directors of
Health Services and supervise nursing education and nursing services in their
division. There are currently over 7,000 nurses registered with the
Bangladesh Nursing Council. Almost 5,000 nurses are working in GOB hospitals
and other facilities. Approximately 2,000 are employed in the Middle East and
other countries. The remainder work in private facilities or for NGOs.
3.        Nursing in Bangladesh has traditionally been hospital-based and
curative-oriented. Now efforts are underway through changes in the basic
nursing curriculum and development of the Nursing Institute to reorient
nursing to be more community-based and prevention-oriented. A position for
District Public Health Nurse (DPHN) has been created in each of the 64
Districts. In addition to working as members of the Civil Surgeon's staff,
this nurse will work with Upazila Health Complex nurses, teach community
health nursing and primary care courses at Nurses' Training Institutes and
supervise student nurses community field experiences.
4.        Standards for nursing education and nursing services are set and
controlled by the Bangladesh Nursing Council. At present there are 43 Nursing
Institutes in Bangladesh; 8 Government Nursing Institutes are attached to
Medical College Hospitals and 30 to District Hospitals. Theoretically a total
of 1,138 seats are available for annual admission in the Government Nursing
Institutes; around 800 students actually enroll and around 650 nurses pass the
examinations each year and are eligible for registration with the Bangladesh
Nursing Council.
5.        The basic nursing curriculum is four years in length.  Three years
are basic nursing. Almost all female student nurses take midwifery in the
fourth year. Another one year diploma course exists for specialized nursing.



- 116 -
Annex 25
Page 2 of 2
6.        Currently there are 4,087 sanctioned posts for nurses in Government
health facilities with 26,913 beds, giving a nurse-to-bed ratio of 1 nurse for
every 6.6 Government hospital beds. Even if all sanctioned posts were filled
and if all nurses were engaged in hospital nursing, which they are not, this
would remain a very low nurse-bed ratio.
7.        Internationally recommended minimum standards for nurse-bed ratios
ares
1 nurse for every 4 general beds
1 nurse for every 2 specialized beds
1 nurse for every intensive care, OT, or labor bed.
8.        Thus, many more sanctioned posts are needed to improve the nurse-
bed ratio for acceptable quality of nursing care. In addition, approximately
1,000 registered nurses are currently waiting for posting in Government
service. Sanctioned posts are also needed for nurses in public health
nursing, school health and occupation/industrial health services.
9.        The College of Nursing, a Constituent College of Dhaka University,
is the institution of higher education for nursing in Bangladesh. The College
offers two-year post-basic courses in Nursing and in Public Health Nursing.
Faculty for Nursing Institutes, District Public Health Nurses, and supervisors
for health facilities receive post-basic training at the College.
10.       The project will support posts for 10 nursing trainers, one
librarian and two English teachers, consultants for curriculum development,
library and other teaching materials, and renovation and repair of the Nursing
College. It also will finance technical assistance and refresher training,
construction of four nursing institutes, repair and renovation of existing
nursing institutes and provision of teaching materials.
11.       The project will also support 573 senior nurse posts at Nursing
Institutes and UHCs and a one month introduction course for new nurse
trainers. It will support staff, construction and equipment for four
continuing education centers and four rural Health Care Training Centers as
well as 15 courses in each center per year, including technical assistance and
supplies.
12.       Project implementation may be assisted by WHO, which would hire and
support a Project Manager for the nursing component.

FOURTH POPULATION AND HEALT! PROJECT
Institute for Mother and Child Health
1.        In Bangladesh, 702 of the population are either children under 15
years (50Z) or women of reproductive age (20S). These are also the
"vulnerable groups" suffering high morbidity and mortality from usually
preventable causes. The MOHFW has FP and health programs directed to
preventing and treating the illnesses of this group through the MCH program.
As yet this is still a weak program, a major reason being the shortage of
personnel with adequate combined clinical and preventive health care training.
The project will establish an Institute with small clinical facilities located
in a semi-rural area, with the objective of providing communW.ty and clinic
based training for all levels of service. The Institute is meant to establish
a unique and leading position in the country to promote appropriate MCH
strategies and policies. This will be a community-oriented approach for the
training of medical and nursing staff from an institution and clinical base,
which is currently absent in the country. It will be both an institution to
guide and lead the country in MCH and a model of combined clinical and
community-based services.
ObWectives
2.        The project has been formulated in great detail and aims to:
(a) provide a base for community-based comprehensive training of health
personnel responsible for preventive, promotive and curative health
care of children and mothers. Staff shall include pediatricians,
obstetricians, undergraduate medical students, upazila medical
officers, medical assistants, family welfare visitors and medical
social workers.
(b) conduct problem-oriented essential health services research.
(c)  provide comprehensive preventive, promotive, and curative services
in the community and the outpatient department, treat common
illnesses of children in the inpatient department, and care for at
risk-pregnant mothers.
Project Strategies
3.        The outpatient and inpatient facilities and the community will be
the bases to fulfill the above objectives. Training and courses will run
throughout the year for the various level health workers. The surrounding
villages (300,000 population) will function as field practice area; health and
nutrition services will be provided to the children and mothers and VP
services to the mothers in the villages in a package. Essential health



- 118 -
Annex 26
Page 2 of 3
services research and operational research will be conducted in the community.
The outpatient department will deal with the health and nutrition problems of
children, pregnant and lactating mothers. It is expected that there shall be
daily attendance of 300-500 children and mothers. Risk pregnancies, which are
identified as contributing to maternal mortality, will be admitted as
inpatients, either as referral from the field practice area or from medical
practitioners. Prenatal and postnatal follow-up will be done at the
outpatient clinic and in the community. The components of child survival,
such as growth monitoring, immunization, breastfeeding promotion and
protection, oral rehydration for diarrhea, nutrition education, distribution
of Vitanin A capsules, deworming, and birth spacing wil) be practiced in the
outpatient clinic and in the community. Very sick children with common
problems, such as diarrhea, acute respiratory infection, meningitis, severe
protein energy malnutrition, or infectious diseases, will be admitted for
treatment. The services will be such that the trainees are exposed to the
common real life health problems of the children and mothers of the country.
Community participation and leadership will be developed in the matters of
health and nutrition of children and mothers. Regular training courses will
be conducted for nurses in community and clinical pediatrics and obstetrics.
Position of the Institute
4.        This will be a Government Institute.  It will be responsible to
train Government health and FP personnel in child and maternal health. The
facility will not pretend to remain the only institute of its kind but should
look like a model training base in the subjects appropriate for trainers. It
will provide a base for training of Upazila medical officers and of trainees,
such as MAs, family welfare workers, medical social workers and nurses. The
trainers and trainees from institutes such as IPGMR, Dhaka Shishu Hospital,
Dhaka Medical College, Salimullah Medical College, NIPSOM, School of Nursing
and Upazilas will attend various moduled courses. In these courses, the
comprehensive community approach to health care will be highlighted, followitng
the Morley approach of the Child Health Institute in London. It will be a
resource center providing a data base, teaching and audiovisual materials.
The center will have ciose linkages on aspects of teaching, research and
services with the IPGMR, Dhaka Medical College, Salimullah Medical College
Hospital, Azimpur Maternity Center, ICDDR,B., Bangladesh Institute of
Development Studies, Save the Children Fund and other NGOs. The Institute
will make all efforts to change and develop an attitude in trainers and
trainees towards appropriate health care of children and mothers. Although a
Government Institute under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, it will
have an autonomous status. The Institute's Board/Committee will thus select
and retain its own staff. All care will be taken to appoint motivated
committed staff who are fully oriented to the objectives of the center.
Components
5.        The Government will purchase 12.62 acres of suitable land at
Matuail. The Institute will have the following departments:
(a) Medical Units: for pediatrics and obstetrics, with outpatient and

community services sections. Support units wvil be the units of
pharmacy, medical records, surgery, radiology and laboratory
services.
(b) Nursing: a small school of nursing vill provide training for MCH
nursing care in the community and at the clinic.
tc) Administration: for ancillary services of caumunication, stores,
laundry, medical illustration, library, kitchen, transport and
maintenance.

FOURTH POPULATION AND HEALTH PROJECT
Technical Assistance Prolects
Training Health Personnel in Operational Management
1.        The project will upgrade the ability of supervisory staff at all
levels to provide support and guidance for supervision through on-the-job
training and by identifying weaknesses of supervised MCH and FP staff. It
will develop remedial measures, create better work environments, and formulate
solutions to problems experienced by staff in day-to-day operations.
2.        The project will fund training of: (i) health workers in
operational management including MCH and FP, (ii) physicians in surgery,
internal medicine, gynecology, and simple anesthesia to improve the quality of
care in UHCs; (iii) 'emale volunteers in community health (selective); (iv)
trainers to form training teams; and (v) local village leaders (selective) in
PHC. It will also finance preparation and collection of training materials
and development of monitoring and coordination mechanism for training
activities.
3.        The strategies will be: (i) assessment of training needs of the
different categories of health personnel at the different levels of the health
services starting from ward to district level; (ii) development of a plan of
action to implement the training programs; (iii) development of Core Support
Groups for organizing and implementing training programs; (iv) improvement of
the existing training facilities available at the district and upazila level;
(v) development of training modules, work manuals and other support materials;
(vi) raising health volunteers from the Community to act as a supplementary
work force alongside the government salaried personnel (on an experimental
basis); (vii) orientation training for Community leaders and mass media staff
for social mobilization in support of health promotion as an important
component of community development (on an experimental basis); and (viii)
development of a mechanism for coordinating training activities to avoid
duplication of efforts and to promote efficient use of resources.
Control and Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Diseases
4.        This component has been formulated to: (i) establish a surveillance
system for STDs; (ii) facilitate diagnosis and treatment of STDs; (iii)
arrange appropriate training to health workers in its control and prevention;
(iv) improve laboratory facilities to help diagnose STDs; and tv) increase
public awareness of the issue.
5.        The proposal aims to combine the currently ongoing efforts in AIDS
control (with WHO assistance) with an intensified drive to control other
sexually transmitted diseases. Activities envisaged ares (i) a sentinel
survey to obtain baseline information; (ii) supply of essential equipment to



- 121 -
Annez 27
Page 2 of 3
selected laboratoriest (iii) training of lab technicians; (iv) purchase of
essential drugs against STDs; (v) specialized training of physicians, nurses
and other staff; and (vi) and information campaign on STDs.
6.        Implementation will be by the Directorate of Health Services, with
the specific executing agency being the IEDCR. 'WHO will assist the project
technically as well.
Control and Prevention of Cancer
7.        Notwithstanding more pressing health priorities in Bangladesh,
cancer demands its share of attention. The annual incidence is estimated at
over 200,000 and this project component aims to meet the issue through
technical assistance to formulate a control strategy.
S.        Stated objectives are to: (i) study behavioral factors related to
cancer, especially of the lung and the breast; (ii) development of cancer
professionals; (iii) creation of public awareness about prevention of cancer;
and (iv) coordination of interagency efforts in cancer control.
9.        Proposed activities include the development of a cancer registry,
periodic surveys of prevalence of cancer and associated factors, staff
training, development of surveillance activities through a strong data
management system, establishment of linkages with other health and non-health
departments relevant to cancer control, and production of health education
materials (posters, slides and films). The implementing agency will be CIRH
in cooperation with IEDCR, NIPSOM and IEM/HEB. WHO will support this
component as well.
Establishment of a Pharmaceutical Production Unit at Khulna
10.       The main objective of this component is to cater to the needs of
essential drugs in the public hospitals and clinics. GOB planned to establish
4 pharmaceutical production plants in 4 divisions of the country. GOB already
established 2 plants for drug manufacturing, one at Dhaka and one at Bogra.
These plants produce 32 of the 45 essential drugs and meet 752 of the public
sector's requirements. GOB's Fourth Five Year Plan proposes to produce 12 new
products in the proposed plant at Khulna. The proposed plant would adopt the
basic concept of GMP (Good manufacturing practice) and manufacture essential
drugs in the forms of tablets, sachets for ORS, sterile injections and dry
vials, and soft gelatine capsules of Vitamir. A (high potency). The plant
would have 5,609 sq m constructed building. The entire product of the plant,
when available, will be purchased by GOB out of its revenue budget.
11.       The project will incorporate technical assistance to help GOB in
further scrutiny of proposals and development of detailed implementation
plans. The Essential Drug Unit will be consulted before finalizing the
composition of any proposed drug list. GOB has also agreed to employ females
under the project to the maximum possible extent and make provision for
women's facilities in the building. The project will also be coordinated with
the project component on 'Strengthening the Rational Use of DrugsR.

12.       The Fourth Project might support this component, preliminary costed
at a total of Tk 4,320.53 lakhs or US$11.86 million, if funds would be
available from other components not materializing, or from excess funds due to
foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Support could be programmed through
the existing R&R system, provided the outcome of the feasibility study would
be positive and subsequent GOB-Consortium agreement could be reached.
Establishment of a Condom Manufacturing Plant
13.       The project endorses the need for developing local capacity for the
production of condoms. Based on the sheer volume of commodity requirements by
1992, Bangladesh is clearly a candidate for local production of condoms.
Feasibility studies carried out in the past are not only outdated but also
lacking in comprehensiveness. GOB has agreed to have a fresh feasibility
study conducted with comprehensive terms o reference, addressing (i) economic
and non-economic consideration of private and public sector production; (ii)
the effect of various donor policies with regard to procurement of locally
produced condoms; (iii) development of several price scenarios; (iv)
implications of a public sector plant, fully or partially controlled by the
government; and (v) the environmental impact of the project. The study will
be conducted in conjunction with UNFPA. The results of the study will be
discussed with the IDA/Cofinanciers Consortium and subject to economic
viability and other relevant considerations. The project may consider
providing funds towards setting-up of local condom production capability
during the project period. The same funding considerations as mentioned under
the sub-project above (pharmaceutical production plant at Rhulna) will apply.

FOURTH POPULATION AND HEALTH PROJECT
The Three Womenlls Prousm
1.        Women in Bangladesh have only limited access to services that can
equip them to acquire knowledge, obtain essential social services, and
overcome gender-specific constraints on participation in the labor force.
Since 1976, IDA and the Cofinanciers have been providing assistance to such
women through funding of three women's programs - Mothers' Centers, Women's
Cooperative, and Women's Vocational Training. From a modest beginning, the
three programs have expanded to cover in 1989 about 2-8 upazilas, of which
some are overlapping, the Mothers' Centers cover 80 upazilas, the Cooperatives
cover 100 upazilas, and the Vocational Training covers 58 upazilas.
2.        The three programs have reached rany women over the past 15 years.
Coverage has been in the range of 730,000 women (Mother's Centers - 540,000
Cooperatives - 140,000, and Vocational Training - 50,000). These numbers m'y
not seem striking in the context of the size of the country's women
population, but most members are innovators who serve as examples to others,
both in self-employment and contraception; they are scattered widely in rural
areas; are now better informed; and facilitate a two-step flow of information
and innovation.
3.        Evaluations by various agenc'es since 1979 have indicated that
these programs were able to provide some gainful employment to women; that
project women know more about contraception and practice contraception more;
that members actively persuaded other women to use contraception; and that
agriculture-related income-generating activities wers more widely practiced,
although these were not always the most profitable choices. The contraceptive
practice rate among women participating in the three programs ranges from 54Z
to 60Z. The variations in monthly income among the participants of the three
projects ranged from Tk 97 (Mothers' Centers), to Tk 111 (Women's
Cooperatives) to Tk 201 (Women's Vocational Training). A larger proportion
(66X) of members of Women's Cooperatives received loans than did members of
Mothers' Centers (31Z) or Women's Vocational Training (12Z). These
differences are attributable to a comparatively well-developed credit system,
through local banks, for Women's Cooperatives. The other two projects depend
on a small revolving fund provided by the projects although operated through
the banking system.
4.        The evaluations indicated common deficiencies in the three
programs. Those deficiencies relate mainly to the: inadequacy of credit,
particularly for the Mothers' Centers and Women's Vocational Training where
the amount is small for individual credit (the maximum being Tk 500);
difficulties experienced in access to contraceptive services; lack of market
surveys as a guide to choice of goods to be produced; inadequate training;
inadequate marketing facilities; and lack of quality control. Some of these
deficiencies have been addressed, although not adequately. A quality control

staff has been recruited for Mothers' Center projects; market surveys have
been carried out recently for two of the three projects; and contraceptive
service delivery has been strengthened. But the immense possibilities for
using the resources of organized groups in 100 upazilas to strengthen family
planning, maternal and child health services have not been fully explored.
S.        To strengthen the program in the future, the Fourth Project will
support a thorough review of the three Women's programs, as described in paras
2.85. Considering the importance accorded to enhancing the incomes of the
women involved, the review will give particular attention to the programs of
training in traditional products. The principal question to be addressed will
be whether the main trade of all projects should be tailoring (at least 45? of
activity) and the second trade of two projects should be cane and bamboo or
whether comparative advantages of certain projects should determine
appropriate specializations. In the course of the review, complementary
subjects will be addressed including skills levels of trainers, comon
training curricula and manuals, joint training facilities, adequacy of
equipment and materials, procurement arrangements for inputs, quality of
products, market development, supervision, credit and seed money, and access
to share deposits held in banks.to share deposits held in banks.

FOURTH POPULATION AND HEALTH PROJECT
Population and the Environment
1.        The environmental setting in Bangladesh poses obvious challenges to
the population. Powerful rivers dominate the geography, cutting the land
vertically and laterally into a deltaic plain of temporary land and rising in
the monsoon into a rushing sea. Without elevated land to define their
courses, rivers flood half of the arable land in the peak of annual floods and
calamities recur when annual rainfall shifts subtly. About 202 of people live
on land that i, inaccessible in the monsoon season and not considered
permanent. Clusters of artificially raised land serve as the basis for
settlements that are widely dispersed, without permanence or geographic
boundaries. Most of the 66,000 villages in the country cannot be reached by
road or scheduled river transport. These fundamental ecological insecurities
permeate all social systems and constrain effective communications, including
outreach services, in the country.
2.        Population pressure (averaging 813 persons per sq. km. and rising
on agricultural land to 1,199 persons per sq. km.) has resulted in intense use
of forests, fisheries, and land. Moreover, with rising demand for fuelwood.
biomass, and land for agriculture and housing, high population density is
contributing to an overharvesting of homestead and other accessible forest
area. The country has less than 0.02 ha of forest land per person, one of the
lowest ratios in the world, whereas it had 0.035 ha in 1968-69. Fragmentation
of land holdings is a serious problem. Half of all families own less than 0.5
acre. The number of landless families is rising as productively sized plots
of agricultural land become increasingly scarce. Growing landlessness is
causing particular hardship for female-headed households. The sheer force of
population pressure no doubt is the most basic cause of the country's
environmental degradation. According to FAO, the total area of degraded
land' is estimated to be 989,000 ha (7.42 of total land area). Up to 1985,
some 128,000 ha had reportedly been rehabilitated or protected to some degree.
Treatment of a further JO,000 ha was planned during 1986-90.
3.        Population pressure will continue to grow.  While the GOB's FP
program has succeeded in increasing the CPR from under 82 in 1975 to around
33Z in 1989 and in reducing the TFR from over 7 in the mid-1970s to just under
5 in 1990, sustained rapid decline in fertility will be needed to
significantly slow population growth. An immediate concern is the present age
1   In FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific,  Environment and
Agriculture, 1989 the term land degradation is defined as "the process whereby
land deteriorates through a reduction in soil depth or quality as a result of the
actions of water, wind, gravity and temperature which may be reflected in reduced
productivity in current or future periods by its impact on the quality or
quantity of vegetation which the land supports."

structure of the population. With about 50 million children now below age 15
(43Z of the population), many will not be able to find productive work in
rural areas. This will be a major factor contributing to the projected
doubling of the urban population in the country over the next 10-15 years.
For example, the populations of Dhaka (3 million) and Chittagong (1.5 million)
are expected to triple within the next nine years. Host urban population
growth will occur in t)he poorest and most deprived areas of the cities. Rapid
population growth already has led to severe shortfalls in basic
infrastructure, developed land, social services like education and health
care, and shelter. Further population growth will result in critical shortage
in roads, drainage, solid waste collection, electricity, transport; water
supply, and sanitation facilities.
4.        To begin addressing these problems IDA is supporting the Fourth
Population and Health Project, in conjunction with many donors. It also
supports an Urban Development Project that is improving storm water drainage,
solid waste collection and disposal and sanitation in Dhaka and Chittagong.
In addition, three low-income settlements in Dhaka area are being upgraded
with new roads, footpaths, water supply, gas distribution, surface drainage,
solid waste collection, low-cost sanitation, land filling and more secure land
leases. The project also is supporting development of a 100 acre sites and
services component in Chittagong to provide affordable housing to lower income
groups. IDA is also, under the ongoing Dhaka Water Supply and Sanitation
Project, supporting a study of the availability and quality of the water in
the aquifer under Dhaka; a similar study is proposed as part of the FY92
Chittagong Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The Chittagong Project also
will introduce waterborne sewerage in priority industrial, residential and
commercial areas, and will provide assistance to strengthen the Department of
Envi'onment in Chittagong. Overall, IDA has assisted the water supply and
sewerage sector in Dhaka and Chittagong since the late 1960s.
