MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE*S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A FOURTH POPULATION *ND HEALTH PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 133.2
million (US$180.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance
a fourth population and health project. The project will be cofinanced by
grants from Australia (US$9.6 million), Belgium (US$2.8 million), Canada
(US$40.3 million), the European Economic Communities (US$47.8 million), the
Federal Republic of Germany (US$51.6 million), Japan (US$9.1 million), the
Netherlands (US$24.8 million), Norway (US$33.2 million), Sweden (US$13.4
million), and the United Kingdom (US$23.7 million).
2.        Background:  Over the past 15 years, the Government of Bangladesh
(GOB) has been able to institute increasingly effective family planning (FP)
and mother and child health (MCH) programs. The contraceptive prevalence rate
(CPR) rose for less than 82 in 1975 to about 332 in 1989 aad compares
favorably witb nther poor South Asian countries like Nepal (15Z) and Pakistan
(12Z) and with the less developed States of India. Increased contraception
has been the major factor leading to a significant drop in total fertility
from above seven in the mid-1970s to less than five in 1989. Moreover, the
management of diarrheal diseases and the rate of immunization have improved
considerably, resulting in a decline in infant and child mortality. Important
progress has also been made toward formulating a comprehensive program to
reduce maternal mort lity.
3.        Despite these achievements, the FP and MCH programs continue to
exhibit a number of weaknesses, including poor quality of services, lack of
integration with health services, occasional interruptions of contraceptive
supplies, insufficient travel and daily allowances for field staff, and
needless constraints on the operations of non-governmental organizations
involved in FP and MCH services. In addition, progress has been exceedingly
slow in developing a comprehensive approach to malnutrition in Bangladesh.
4.        With most of GOB and donor resou;ces allocated to FP, the health
sector proper hus been neglected and it suffers from mismanagement,
unacceptable quality of care, poorly maintained and overcrowded hospitals next
to underutilized rural health facilities, lack of medical supplies, out-of-
date and irrelevant medical training, and a dearth of trained nurses. In
addition, investment priorities in the health sector tend to be skewed toward
high-technology curative care in institutional settings, mostly for males,
resulting in a lack of attention to women's health problems and to common
diseases of poverty, such as measles, respiratory infections, tuberculosis and
leprosy. The poor performance of the health care system is also affecting its
credibility as a dispenser of FP services, thus constraining contraceptive
behavior.



5.        In the course of project preparation, GOB and the donors, led by
IDA, have engaged in an intensive dialogue regarding sectoral priorities in
population and health. Several GOB-donor workshops in Dhaka and a special
conference in Geneva served to forge a consensus on GOB's population and
health strategies and targets in the context of the Fourth Five-Year Plan
(1990-95) and of the proposed project. The strategic directions that emerged
involve the further strengthening of GOB's FP service delivery system, a re-
orientation of the health care system toward public health, including maternal
health, the introduction of an effective medical and FP quality assurance
system, including higher utilization of services, and improving GOB's
managerial capabilities in the FP and health sector, including creating
capacity to address sustainability issues. The proposed project will support
GOB's efforts in the implementation of these vital new program orientations.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement:  From the start, IDA has been a
major supporter of Bangladesh's FP and MCH programs. In recent years, IDA has
led a donor Consortium comprising seven external donors and three multilateral
executing agencies. In that capacity, IDA has helped GOB mobilize large
amounts of financial and technical support for PP and MCH programs and to
coordinate the donors' assistance to this critical sector for the country's
socio-economic development. On occasion, IDA has been instrumental in keeping
the Consortium from breaking up over politically divisive issues (e.g.,
compensation payments to sterilization acceptors), which would have caused
major damage to the population program. In fact, without IDA's leadership, it
is likely that the current consensus over the priority to population programs
would have been eroded in favor of a drastic switch-over to health programs--a
less politically sensitive area for many bilateral donors.
7.        Project Objectives:  The project would support GOB's efforts to
reach the qualitative and quantitative population and health targets laid out
in the Fourth Five-Year Plan in terms of: (a) reduced fertility levels through
an increase in contraceptive prevalence to 48-502; (b) lower morbidity and
mortality in children under five; (c) safer deliveries and reduced maternal
mortality from the current 6-8 to 4.5 per 1,000 live births; (d) reduced
disability, morbidity and mortality from a range of coamon poverty-related
diseases; (e) enhanced nutritional status of women and children; and (f)
improved effectiveness and efficiency in the planning and delivery of FP and
health services.
8.        Project Description:  The project, which covers a five-year time
slice of GOB's development program in population and health (1992-96), has
four main components: (a) strengthening PP service delivery; (b) strengthening
health services delivery; (c) improving supportive activities to the delivery
of FP and health services; and (d) women's and nutrition programs. It will
strengthen FP service delivery by improving access to FP services,
strengthening MCH services, enhancing clinical service delivery and FP/MCH
quality assurance, imparting in-service training of upazila and district staff
in FP/MCH, construction and renovation of FPIMCH facilities, and marketing of
contraceptives through the private sector. The project will strengthen health
service delivery through increasing the range of maternal and neonatal health
care, strengthening nursing and medical education, introducing medical quality
assurance, supporting medical research, strengthening disease prevention and



- 3 -
control, developing urban primary health care, continuing and expanding school
health programs, improving district and upazila health facilities, and
improving the utilization of Upazila Health Centers. In support of the first
two components, the project will assist in strengthening information systems,
improving FP and health management, expanding communications programs,
supporting NGO activities, and developing innovative projects. Finally, the
project will assist continuation of the three women's programs financed under
the previous three projects and will strengthen and develop the National
Nutrition Council, in anticipation of a substantial program of nutrition
interventions.
9.        The total cost of the five-year project (1992-96) is estimated at
US$601.4 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$185.3 million
equivalent (312). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Annex B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Bangladesh are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing the geographical
coverage of the project is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9400-BD,
dated May 20, 1991, is being distributed separately.
10.       Lessons Learned From Previous IDA Involvements  The first two
projects have been implemented satisfactorily and have helped GOB to establish
a viable population program. The current Third Project is moving ahead and is
expected to be completed by the end of 1991, six months behind schedule.
Following Board approval in 1989, sizeable savings have been allocated to the
purchase of contraceptive supplies and rehabilitation of health facilities.
The main lessons learned, which pertain to the importance of continuous
evaluations, of a participatory GOB-donor approach to strategy and program
formulation, of a strong IDA presence in the field, of improvements in
management practices and of a long-term and sustainable coimitment to the
sector, have been incorporated in the project design, and indeed in the very
process of project formulation. The proposed project will coordinate and
focus the support of 11 cofinanciers and three multilateral executing
agencies.
*        11.       Agreed Actionst During negotiations agreements were reached on
actions to be taken with regard to (i) improved utilization of health and PP
services; (ii) institutional reforms in the sector; (iii) the formulation of a
Human Resource Development Plan; and (iv) the enhanced sustainability of GOB's
health and FP programs. In order to improve the utilization of health and FP
services, GOB will carry out by June 30, 1994, an in-depth review of the
special program to address capacity utilization at the Upazila Health
Complexes and Family Welfare Centers and prepare an action plan for expansion
to the remaining upazilas; and, will carry out plans, by April 30, 1992, for
the allocation of 702 or more of the beds in district hospitals and Upazila
Health Complexes for women and children. The institutional reforms in the
sector will be addressed through a policy study on the reorganization of the
national Health and Family Welfare Program to be carried out by GOB with the
assistance of qualified consultants, by August 31, 1993. In order to reorient
health personnel toward public health, the Government will prepare and furnish
to IDA by March 31, 1994 for review a Human Resource Development Plan, which



-4-
will also address female representation in the FP/health system. To ensure
the enhanced sustainability of the health and PP programs, the Government will
set up a Health EcoDomics and Finance Project, with the terms of reference and
work plan finalized by August 31, 1992; take measures, in agreement with IDA,
for financial and economic strengthening of the MOHFW; furnish to IDA by
September 30, 1993 a plan for better balancing revenue and development budgets
and proposals on cost-sharing mechanisms and improved cost-effectiveness in
the health care system; and, by September 30, 1992 establish an annual review
system for the project, including a review of annual sectoral budgets, under
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
12.       The conditions of effectiveness are that the GOB will: (a) approve
all project-related Project Proformas; (b) establish transportation
arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, for FP and health field workers attending
satellite clinics; (c) establish the 4CH Coordinatlon Cell within the Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare in line with the terms of reference already
agreed upon between the Government and IDA; and (d) fulfill conditions
precedent to the effectiveness of the the Grant Agreements with Canada, the
European Economic Community, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, and Norway.
13.       Environmental Aspects:   The proposed project was determined to be
in screening Category D, which includes projects that are expected to have a
positive environmental impact. No environmental analysis has been prepared
for this project.
14.       Benefits: The project will have a major impact on improved family
welfare, particularly among women and children, through greater birth spacing
and better health status. In the long term, the pressure on the limited land
and natural resources due to population growth will be mitigated and the
challenge of providing social services and employment to the growing
population will be eased. Other benefits will be increased effectiveness and
improved efficiency of the PP and health programs due to the cooperation and
possible integration of the FP and health services, reorientation of medical
education towards community medicine and public health, and significant
improvement of the quality of FP and health care services.
15.       Risks:  The main risk of the project is the Government's potential
inability to implement fully the extensive reform program in the health
subsector, including the reorientaton of medical education toward community
medicine and public health. Another possible risk is the limited managerial
absorptive capacity of the health subsector, although the financial absorptive
capacity is expected to be sufficient. To minimize these risks, the project
has been so designed as to contribute to the Government's ability to handle
the reforms successfully, including intensive collaboration among important
medical organizations and colleges in Bangladesh and abroad. Furthermore, the
project contains a significant number of components to strengthen the
Government's managerial absorptive capacity.



16.       Recomuendation: I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomend that
the Executive Directors approve it.

c) The principal amounts of IDA credits are shown in US Dollar equivalont at date of negotiations, as shown
In the President's Report. Undisbursed mounts shown in US Dollar equivalent are valued et the exchange
rate applicable on the date of this statement. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates
a dollar mount greater than the original principal credit amount expressed In dollars.
d> Fluctuations In the exchange rate of the SDR vis-a-vis the US dollar and the Bangladesh Taka between the
tim of appral'sl of the project and March 81, 1991 result In an artificially high figure of
undisbursement. The actual disbursemont stands at U5856.4 million; taken against the original allocation
of USt78.0 mIllIon, the undisbursed asount would be lower at US119.6 mlliIon.
