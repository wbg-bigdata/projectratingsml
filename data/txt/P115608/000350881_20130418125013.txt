1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

    1.1.A. Macroeconomic Context at Appraisal

1.      Despite stable economic conditions over the years immediately preceding the global
economic downturn of 2008,1 the Mexican economy was severely affected by it. Mexico faced
both a sharp aggregate decline in demand from its major trading partners and strained global
financial conditions. Annual economic growth decreased substantially as the economy entered
into a recession in the second half of 2008, leading to a limited GDP growth of 1.5 percent that
year and a sharp contraction of 6.1 percent in 2009.

2.      In response to these challenges, the Mexican authorities implemented counter-cyclical
fiscal stimulus policies to mitigate the impact of the external demand shocks on the domestic
economy. Fiscal discipline and strong fiscal policy frameworks, including the establishment of
stabilization funds and the acquisition of oil price hedges, enabled the authorities to implement
this counter-cyclical response. The fiscal stimulus policies adopted included additional public
investment in infrastructure incorporated in the 2009 budget, as well as employment programs, a
reduction and freeze of public sector administrated prices in the energy sector and an expansion
of development banks’ credit programs. The 2009 budget included a fiscal stimulus of about 1.5
percent of GDP2 that was financed, in part, by increased public sector borrowing. In addition,
monetary policy was eased in 20093 in order to support other efforts to reduce the downturn in
economic activity.

3.       The strained external financial market conditions led the Government to request for a
substantially higher volume of lending from the multilateral development banks. In response,
the Bank stepped up financial assistance to $9.4 billion during fiscal year 2009-10. The ability
of the Bank to prepare and approve such a large program of operations was enhanced by the
countercyclical reduction in Mexico’s outstanding debt to the Bank, which declined from about
$9 billion in 2004 to less than $5 billion in 2007.4 The Government also increased its borrowing
from the IDB during the crisis, as it had previously reduced its outstanding debt with the
institution.

  Mexico’s GDP growth averaged 3.9 percent during 2004 -2007 and the economy enjoyed a stable currency,
inflation of 4.0 percent in 2007, low levels of external indebtedness as a share of GDP, declining public debt ratios
and a sovereign credit rating two steps above the lowest investment grade.

  The State of Public Finances: A Cross-Country Fiscal Monitor, IMF July 30, 2009. Later that year, the
Government announced spending cuts equivalent to 0.7 percent of GDP, in response to revenue pressures, and
focused on personnel and administrative costs that slightly modified the size of the fiscal stimulus.

    Monetary policy has been left unchanged after the substantial easing in 2009.

4.     The authorities also took several actions to maintain orderly conditions in foreign
exchange and domestic financial markets, in view of the unprecedented global financial shocks.
The central bank intervened in foreign exchange markets providing foreign currency liquidity to
the private sector. Bilateral and multilateral support, through a US$30 billion currency swap
arrangement with the US Federal Reserve and a US$47 billion Flexible Credit Line (FCL) with
the IMF, provided additional precautionary sources of external funds.5

5.      Despite the significant challenges posed by the global economic downturn and the
strained financial conditions, the macroeconomic policy framework was considered to be
adequate for the purposes of the proposed Development Policy Loan.

6.       The Green Growth DPL responded to the country’s needs under the economic conditions
at the time and was consistent with the financial and economic policies that had been put in place
to mitigate the effects of the Mexican economy’s slowdown.

7.    Overall, at the time of loan approval, the Bank’s view of Mexico’s macroeconomic
framework was positive and considered adequate to meet the policy requirements of OP8.60.


1.1.B. Sector Background at Appraisal

8.      At the time of the appraisal of the DPL, the Government of Mexico (GOM), fully aware
of the environmental challenges facing the country, took a leading role in the world Climate
Change agenda by pledging to reduce emissions voluntarily, even though the existing
international frameworks did not demand this from Mexico. Mexico became an international
leader in Climate Change mitigation. The Mexican Government’s commitment to addressing
Climate Change was evidenced by the specific emissions targets established in the National
Climate Change Strategy and the steady march from the definition of broad policies to the
development of regulatory frameworks, institutions and sectoral programs.

9.     In April 2005, Mexico established the Inter-Secretarial Commission on Climate Change
(Comisión Inter-secretarial de Cambio Climático – CICC), to build coherent sectoral strategies
for addressing Climate Change. The mandate of this commission was to formulate and
coordinate national Climate Change strategies and their incorporation into sectoral programs.
Two sectors that were fundamental in the GOM strategy to reduce emissions were energy and
transport; these two were the largest sources of Mexico’s GHG emissions, accounting for

 Of Mexico’s total GHG emissions, 18 percent are emitted by the transport sector overall; however, urban transport
accounts for a significant share of this total. Energy represents 27 percent of total emissions— of which two thirds
comes from the electricity sector (Special Program for Climate Change, 2009.)

10.    This DPL was part of an overarching broad program of interventions in support of
Mexico’s Climate Change policy and institutional development. (See Annex 4 for further
description of how this DPL fits within the Mexico/Bank overall Climate Change program). The
Bank-supported activities include mitigation of potential climate change impacts, as well as
measures to reduce emissions and contribute to overall sustainability goals.


11.     The Prior Actions that anchor the DPL recognized the importance of the over-arching
framework defined through the Programa Especial de Cambio Climático (Special Program for
Climate Change, PECC) and included setting out the landmark institutions, regulations and
financing mechanisms that would give substance to the transport and energy programs
established in the PECC. These prior actions, taken as a whole, put Mexico on the path to
achieving its ambitious green agenda with regard to emission reductions.

12.    Remarkably, throughout the deepening economic crisis, the GOM explicitly retained—
even strengthened—its commitment to the development of infrastructure policies that combat
climate change and reduce GHG. As a single-tranche operation, the DPL provided additional
resources for the GOM’s operations while acknowledging and supporting the important steps
being undertaken by the GOM to develop Urban Transport and Energy Policies that combat
climate change and reduce GHG and other emissions.


Energy Sector

13.     The energy matrix in Mexico was heavily reliant on hydrocarbons, which represented 90
percent of total energy consumption and fueled over 70 percent of installed power generation.
Mexico’s prospects of diversifying its generation mix and consumption patterns by increasing
energy efficiency and investing in renewable energy (RE) sources were excellent. But this
required substantial investments in RE sources that represented less than 5 percent of total
installed power generation capacity.

14.    To address many of Mexico’s energy sector challenges, the Congress approved an energy
reform package in October 2008. The package aimed at improving the efficiency of the
management of the hydrocarbons sector, providing stronger incentives for investment in
renewable energy, and fostering substantial energy efficiency gains.

15.     The package included two key pieces of legislation relating to the Climate Change
mitigation efforts of the Government: a law to promote the efficient use of energy and a law to
promote the use of renewable energy sources. While these laws were not prescriptive in nature,
they established a framework for a shift in energy policy in Mexico to encouraging greater
efficiency in the use of energy and promoting sustainability in the production of energy. The two
Laws, coupled with efforts to reduce the country’s dependency on fossil fuels, were designed to
help mitigate global GHG emissions and lower the carbon intensity of Mexico’s economy, in
addition to helping to alleviate local air pollution in the country’s urban areas.




                                               3
Urban transport sector

16.    Mexico’s transport emissions increased by 27 percent between 1990 and 2005. They
accounted for about 18 percent of Mexico’s total emissions in 2005. 7 The relatively high
contribution of the transport sector to the country’s carbon footprint can be attributed to factors
such as:
         Mexico’s growing motorization rate--the highest in Latin America with 107 vehicles per
          1,000 inhabitants;
         Increased road congestion;
         the composition of the public transport fleet, which favors smaller-capacity vehicles and
          includes a growing share of older vehicles;
         inadequate fuel specifications that impede improvements in energy efficiency and
          reduction of airborne pollutants; and
         inadequate regulation of emissions of cars, trucks, and motorcycles.

17.     In addition, high levels of urban air pollution, exacerbated by inefficient transport,
represent a major health and environmental concern in Mexican cities. In spite of technological
improvements in fuel compounds and the definition of its environmental legal framework,
according to recent emission inventories, automobiles accounted for 52 percent of nitrogen oxide
(NOx) emissions, 40 percent of hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, and about 36 percent of particulate
(PM) emissions. The transport sector was also the largest generator of methane (CH4) and
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), making it the primary source of Mexico’s air pollution.8


1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

18.     The Development Objective of the operation was to support the GOM's program to
further develop the regulatory, monitoring and financial framework for low emissions evolution
of the transport and energy sectors. The three Policy Areas of the DPL aimed to (i) implement a
verifiable, targeted and cross-sectoral strategy for emission reductions; (ii) establish institutions,
regulations and monitoring capacity to allow for the reduction of emissions in urban transport,
energy generation and efficiency; and (iii) institutionalize the appropriate financing mechanisms
to allow for the reduction of emissions in urban transport and energy generation and efficiency.

19.    This DPL fit within the framework outlined in the existing Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for Mexico, which states that the implementation of the GOM’s climate change strategy
could be supported by follow-up actions through a mix of the following interventions: (i) a
possible stand-alone second phase climate change DPL; (ii) inclusion of activities to implement

 Air pollution results mostly from a high concentration of ozone, produced by the reaction of VOCs and NOx in the
presence of sunlight; carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrocarbons (HC)
emitted by vehicles fueled with gasoline and diesel; sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted by industrial processes and
commercial services using liquid industrial fuels; and PM in the form of particles smaller than 10 microns (PM 10)
emitted by stationary and mobile sources using diesel and other fuels.

the GOM’s climate change strategy in a future multi-sector DPL; (iii) technical assistance loans
to support DPL implementation and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities; and (iv) a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on advisory and analytic activities on climate change
and the completion of those activities.

20.     As noted above, this DPL was part of an overarching broad program of interventions in
support of Mexico’s Climate Change policy and institutional development. (See Annex 4 for
further description of how this DPL fits within the Mexico/Bank overall Climate Change
program). The Bank-supported activities include mitigation of potential climate change impacts,
as well as measures to reduce emissions and contribute to overall sustainability goals. Through
its analytic and advisory work, the Bank has contributed to the development of Mexico’s
national climate change program, most significantly through the evaluation of impacts,
adaptation measures, and mitigation strategies related to water, forests, energy, transport, and
urban development. In all of these areas, the Bank has provided Mexico with experience from
other countries, (e.g. in the use of carbon markets and renewable energy policy), and in turn has
helped to disseminate Mexico’s best practices internationally (e.g. in community forestry, bus
rapid transit, and overall environment and climate change planning). The Bank has also
contributed to the financing of Mexico’s sustainable development and climate change agenda
through a variety of instruments- grants (GEF), concessional financing (CTF), carbon finance
payments, and sector investment loans in the areas of clean energy, urban transport, waste
management, and land-use and forestry, as well as through development policy loans.

21.    In particular, the role of this DPL within the Climate Change program was to support the
GOM in its long-term commitment to reduce GHG emissions, as established in the PECC
through green sectoral policies, incentives and regulation. Specifically, the operation supported
the Government's program to further develop the regulatory, monitoring and financial framework
for low emissions evolution of the transport and energy sectors.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

23.    This DPL supported policy-level actions to promote long-term sustainable development
in two priority sectors —Energy and Urban Transport— as explained below.

Energy Sector

24.     While the law to promote the efficient use of energy and the law to promote the use of
renewable energy sources were not prescriptive in nature, they created an appropriate framework
for a shift in energy policy in Mexico, encouraging greater efficiency in the use of energy and
promoting sustainability in the production of energy. These Laws provided the policy framework

                                                         8
for the creation of norms, directives and methodologies to encourage electricity generation from
renewable sources and to promote energy efficiency.

25.      The Green Growth DPL recognized the significance of these two laws and aimed to
provide support for the subsequent efforts by the Government to create the supporting regulatory
framework designed to produce the programs, policies and investments needed for the
transformation and de-carbonization of the country’s energy sector. The DPL was focused on
three main policy areas: (i) a comprehensive policy framework for the reduction of emissions in
the energy sector; (ii) an enabling and monitoring framework for the reduction of emissions; and
(iii) the establishment of financing mechanisms to facilitate the reduction of emissions in energy.

26.     In the case of the first policy area, the DPL supported the new legal framework to
develop strategies, policies and programs that promote sustainable and more efficient energy use
and the mainstreaming of renewable energy sources in Mexico’s electricity generation mix. With
respect to the second area, the DPL supported the institutional mechanisms put in place for
developing and issuing methodologies for the monitoring and quantification of GHG emissions.
In the third policy area, the DPL supported the Fund for the Energy Transition and the
Sustainable Use of Energy. This fund was set up to support the financing of projects promoting
the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Urban Transport Sector

27.      Recognizing the significant negative environmental impact of the transport sector, the
Green Growth DPL supported changes in Mexico’s urban transport agenda to help ensure
sustainable growth and improve citizens’ quality of life. Specifically, the operation sought to
create a national mass transit program that supported efforts by states and municipalities, and to
institutionalize this program as a funding mechanism with rules that promoted sustainability. As
a result, the prior actions were related to the creation of the Federal Support Program for Mass
Transit (PROTRAM), within the National Infrastructure Fund (FONADIN). PROTRAM’s
mission is to promote the implementation of bus- and train-based mass transit projects that are
consistent with long-term integrated and sustainable mobility plans and that are developed by
leveraging varying degrees of private sector participation. FONADIN is a trust fund for
infrastructure that offers grants, loans, and loan guarantees to infrastructure projects approved by
entities such as PROTRAM. FONADIN also finances projects in areas such as water, tourism,
and energy.

28.      Along these lines, the DPL focused on three main policy areas in urban transport: (i)
creating a comprehensive policy framework for the reduction of emissions in the urban transport
sector; (ii) creating an enabling and monitoring framework for the reduction of emissions; and
(iii) establishing financing mechanisms to facilitate the reduction of emissions in urban transport.

29.    With regard to the first policy area, the DPL assisted the delineation of urban transport
sector emission reduction goals within the National Emissions Inventory as a basis for the
Government’s 4th National Communication to the UNFCC. In the second policy area, the
operation encouraged municipalities’ programs for urban transport to incorporate sustainability
and climate change considerations through the adoption of urban transport planning guidelines

                                                 9
and methodology guidelines for developing corridor emission baselines. Finally, in the third
policy area, the DPL recognized the creation of the FONADIN and its efforts to fund
municipality-driven urban transport programs that promote reduction of GHG emissions.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

The government’s policy program remained unchanged.

1.6 Other significant changes

None.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

2.2. A Strong government commitment

31.      This DPL was implemented successfully due to strong ownership by the GOM and the
institutional support of the Finance Ministry (SHCP), the Ministry of Environment and Natural
Resources (SEMARNAT), and the Ministry of Energy (SENER). These ministries provided
coordination and oversight from the outset and encouraged active participation of agencies
involved in the Program.

2.2. B Difficulties of inter-sectoral coordination

32.     While strong government commitment resulted in successful implementation, inter-
sectoral coordination for this operation was a challenge for the Mexican authorities as it required
the coordination of three ministries (SHCP, SEMARNAT and SENER), two National Banks
(BANSEFI and BANOBRAS), and two agencies (CONUEE, former CONAE, and PROTRAM).

33.     Given the broad scope of this operation, the implementation of the sector reforms and the
regulatory framework embedded in the PECC required strong inter-institutional coordination
capacity, horizontally as well as vertically. Outcome monitoring posed a logistical challenge, as
it required coordination among the different ministries and agencies to create, integrate and
distribute the information on the sectoral emissions targets. The Mexican Government designated
SEMARNAT as the entity responsible for monitoring the evolution of institutional commitments
incorporated in PECC for urban transport, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. Reviews
were conducted by SEMARNAT to monitor progress in program implementation.

2.2.C. Difficulties emerging from DPL design

34.    There were no difficulties resulting from DPL design.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

2.3.A. M&E Design:

35.     A set of indicators for measuring progress in each policy area was defined during the
preparation of this loan. These indicators, selected in agreement with Government counterparts,
were defined among two main axes: (i) outputs to be achieved at ICR date to be evaluated in
further detail through this ICR; and (ii) monitoring and evaluation indicators to measure
outcomes in the medium term at the end of year 2012. The selected outputs assessed under this
ICR are sector-specific targets defined in the Green Growth DPL, while the monitoring and
evaluation indicators linked to the medium term outcomes include a sub-set of the Government’s
official indicators as outlined in the PECC. Throughout the implementation process,
SEMARNAT was in charge of integrating the information of each of the ministries and agencies
involved in the operation. SEMARNAT was also responsible for reporting progress on each of
the loan’s components and will continue to monitor outcome indicators in the future.



                                                11
2.3.B. M&E Implementation:

36.    Data availability for all indicators was adequate and timely, as necessary information was
provided by the Government counterparts. SEMARNAT provided data on each of the indicators
during the Bank’s supervision missions held on May 20-21, 2010, and April 14-15, 2011,
providing concrete evidence of progress toward the completion of the loan’s outputs.
PROTRAM also shared all information needed with SEMARNAT, to enable assessment of
outputs, outcomes, and M&E indicators. In this regard, it is important to point out that in urban
transport, all indicators which were expected to be met by 2012, have been met already by 2011,
as shown in the Data Sheet.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

37.     Although this is not a programmatic operation, the Bank has provided Mexico with
continuous support to mainstream its climate change agenda into the energy and transport sectors
(see Annex 4). Among the operations approved by the Board subsequent to the DPL was the
Efficient Lighting and Appliances Project (P106424), which supports the GOM’s Energy
Efficiency (EE) Program to replace inefficient incandescent light bulbs, refrigerators and air
conditioners in the residential sector with more efficient technologies. This project mobilizes
various sources of finance, such as IBRD, CTF, GEF, and potential carbon finance. In urban
transport, the Urban Transport Transformation Project (UTTP, P107159) developed the
Investment Plan the Clean Technology Fund approved for Mexico. This project blended CTF
and IBRD financing (200 and 150 million respectively) and partners with PROTRAM in order to
achieve its objective of lowering the carbon growth path of urban transport in Mexican cities.
Finally, the Low-Carbon Development Policy Loan (P121800) was approved in 2010 to
promote: (a) cogeneration and small-scale renewable energy development and gas flaring and
venting reduction in oil and gas production in the energy sector; and (b) in the transport sector,
the creation of a regulatory framework and incentives to improve fuel efficiency of new vehicles
and road transport operations.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

38.     The operation defined a total of nine target outputs to be achieved at ICR date.


3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

39.    Mexico ranks 13th in the world in total GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions from energy
consumption are greater than those of Brazil, making it the largest energy emitter in Latin
America. About 60 percent of Mexico’s total GHG emissions are generated from fossil fuel -
based energy production and consumption, including transport and significant emissions from oil
and gas production and transportation (leakage, venting, flaring). 9 In 2011, as much as 76


9
 The potential for renewable energy is estimated by comparing the net costs of each renewable energy technology
with those of displaced fossil fuel-fired- capacity. Johnson, T., C. Alatorrre, Z. Romo, and F. Liu. (2010). México:
Estudio sobre la Disminución de Emisiones de Carbono. Washington, D.C.: The World Bank.

                                                        12
percent of Mexico’s installed electric power capacity is based on fossil fuels – mostly natural
gas, fuel oil, and coal – with only a small share contributed by hydropower (19 percent), nuclear
(2.3 percent), geothermal, biomass, and wind. Hence, the Government’s initiative to reduce GHG
emissions on a voluntary basis is a fundamental contribution to global efforts to reduce climate
change impact.

40.     The Green Growth DPL supported the GOM to develop and implement the infrastructure
policies that will combat climate change and reduce GHGs. In addition to supporting the
country's current development priorities, this DPL’s objectives and design were fully consistent
with the Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2008-2013 and particularly with its fourth
pillar of promoting environmental sustainability. This pillar, in turn, is also part of the
Government’s 2007- 2012 National Development Plan (PND). Finally, the Green Growth DPL
not only recognizes the GOM’s substantial efforts in developing the PECC, an over-arching
strategy for combating climate change, but also directly incorporates the PECC’s sector-related
emission reduction targets as medium term monitoring and evaluation indicators.

41.    The design of the DPL as a single tranche was appropriate to support the country’s
commitment to promote policies to reduce emissions in the energy and transport sectors within
the context of a global economic crisis, as it contributed to the GOM’s ability to stimulate the
economy while strengthening the framework for long-term sustainable growth. By recognizing
the Government’s policy commitment to regulatory, institutional and financial reforms in the
energy and urban transport sectors, as well as to building monitoring and evaluation capacity, the
proposed Green Growth DPL has strengthened Mexico’s ability to launch the urban transport
and energy sectors on a low-carbon growth path.

42.     The Bank also provided analytical support for the design of policies and regulations
needed to implement the new Renewable Energy Law through separate technical assistance. In
addition, the Bank funded workshops, training and studies for the implementation of the
regulatory framework supporting GHG emission reductions both in the energy and transport
sector.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

43.    The DPL’s main achievements to date are summarized below. Among others, they
include:

    Implementation of a verifiable, targeted and cross-sectoral strategy for emission reductions,
     emerging from the approval and publication of the PECC and subsequent developments.
    Finalization of the National Emissions Inventor y that served as the basis for Mexico’s 4th
     Communication to the UNFCCC;
    Submission by the Government of the 4th Communication to the UNFCCC.
    Creation of a monitoring framework for the reduction of emissions in the transport and
     energy sectors through the adoption of:
     - Guidelines adopted by PROTRAM for urban transport planning that mainstream
        climate change and guidelines for developing corridor emission baselines.


                                               13
     - Regulations corresponding to the Law for the Sustainable Use of Energy (i.e. the
       Energy Efficiency Law) and the Law for the Use of Renewable Energy and Energy
       Transition (i.e. the Renewable Energy Law)
   - Methodologies for quantifying GHG emissions from the energy sector.
  Creation of sustainable financing mechanisms for the reduction of emissions in the two
   sectors through:
   - funding by FONADIN for urban transport programs that incorporate climate change
   considerations;
   - the capitalization of the Fund for Energy Transition and the Sustainable Use of Energy.
   Development of a publicly available inventory of projects eligible for financing from the
      Fund.

44.     The above policy achievements with respect to mainstreaming environmental
considerations in the two sectors are detailed below per Policy Area as they appear in the DPL’s
original policy matrix

Policy Area 1: Comprehensive Policy Framework for the Reduction of Emissions Across
Sectors

45.    Mexico has completed the National Emissions Inventory, which served as basis for the
4th National Communication to the UNFCC. This communication, in turn, was submitted to the
United Nations in December 2010 and is currently available on the UNFCC website. Given that
the National Emissions Inventory does not enter into as much detail as called for in the PECC,
SEMARNAT monitors progress of PECC goals on a semiannual basis. SEMARNAT concluded
the PECC’s last progress report in December 2010.

Policy Area 2: Enabling and Monitoring Framework for the Reduction of Emissions in
Urban Transport and Energy

46.      Urban Transport: As set forth in the DPL’s policy matrix, Mexico has met all outputs
expected at ICR closing date. Through a modification of the PROTRAM guidelines adopted by
FONADIN’s Technical Committee on May 14 2010, it was determined that projects must be
prepared using the MASTU, therefore including climate change considerations and a baseline
measure of GHG emissions, in order to receive funding from PROTRAM. MASTU is the
safeguard framework prepared for the Bank-financed UTTP, in order to receive funding from the
PROTRAM. All cities that enter the PROTRAM pipeline must comply with these updated
guidelines. At least three, Mexicali, Chihuahua, and Monterrey, have completed the preparation
process following these guidelines. PROTRAM has also prepared the draft terms of reference for
a comprehensive and sustainable transport planning study, PIMUS, which takes into account
climate change considerations. PROTRAM makes these TORs available to any city that is
interested in presenting a project to be included in the pipeline. Further, the TORs are updated
periodically to incorporate lessons learned. Regarding the requirement to include a baseline
measurement, the methodological guideline in the MASTU is to ask cities to measure a
minimum set of indicators that constitute the baseline. The MASTU, moreover, gives freedom to
cities to use the methodology that makes more sense technically speaking. This flexible approach
is technically sound because the level of detail with which a city has to establish a baseline

                                              14
depends of the objectives of project sponsors. If project sponsors want to just meet the
requirements of the MASTU, then the level of uncertainty allowed is higher than if they want to
sell the resulting emission reductions in the carbon market. The methodology changes with the
level of detail desired.10

47.     Energy: On the Regulatory side, the enactment of the Energy Efficiency Law and the
Renewable Energy Law provide a legal framework for strategies, policies and programs that
promote sustainable and more efficient energy use. Both laws came into effect on November
28th, 2008. While setting the legal basis for formulating strategies, policies and programs
oriented toward the promotion of sustainable energy use, the Energy Efficiency Law and the
Renewable Energy Law required strong secondary regulations to create the specific mechanisms
for implementing the stated energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives and strategies.
Therefore, in November 2009 the Programs defining the terms of the Renewable Energy and
Energy Efficiency Laws were published. These Programs have the specific role of setting rules
for the development of renewable generation and the implementation of the stated energy
efficiency objectives and strategies.

48.     Furthermore, the Mexican Government developed methodologies for the quantification of
GHG for the exploitation, production, transformation, distribution, and consumption of energy,
as well as avoided emissions. These methodologies estimate the potential and cost of the
strategies for the sustainable as well as the efficient use of energy. Furthermore, these
methodologies quantify the potential energy savings and avoided GHG emissions in the medium
and long term due to activities implemented in the framework of the Energy Efficiency Law and
the Renewable Energy Law.

Policy Area 3: Establishment of Financing Mechanisms to Facilitate the Reduction of
Emissions in Transport and Energy

49.     Urban Transport: Regarding mechanisms for financing low-carbon urban transport
projects, FONADIN and the GTC (Consultative Working Group) together have received 41

requests for funding, which constitute the current pipeline of projects of the PROTRAM. This
number of cities is well above what the M&E framework established in the Program Document
required by 2012. Further, FONADIN has approved funding for three cities Mexicali,
Chihuahua, and Monterrey (Guadalajara’s request had also been approved but it was cancelled
after local politicians disagreed after a local election on the scope of the approved project).

50.     In transport, therefore, FONADIN/PROTRAM has become Mexico’s robust federal
program for financing urban transport projects. There is widespread interest by Mexican cities in
receiving PROTRAM grants. And as said above, the amendments to the PROTRAM rules assure
that all of its projects consider climate change and its mitigation and include a baseline
measurement of GHG emissions to be compared with the situation once the project is
operational.

51.     Energy: The Mexican government established the Fund for Energy Transition & the
Sustainable Use of Energy in 2008, to promote financing and foster the implementation of
renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Given the economic crisis in 2008, access to
financing was reduced and the role of the Fund became particularly important in the leveraging
of these projects. While the ability of the Government to fully capitalize the Fund was affected in
the short term, the Government mobilized US$60 million as an initial subscription in 2009.

The indicator for the ICR date is the capitalization of the Fund at a sufficient level to finance at
least one pilot project in energy efficiency. Up to April 2011, the Fund was capitalized with
US$480 million (US$420 million additional to the initial subscription in 2009) and supported a
total of seven projects. One of these projects, a pilot project for substitution of incandescent light
bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), was fully implemented. Another project is a home
appliances substitution program, which is currently in operation. Furthermore, the Technical
Committee chaired by Ministry of Energy has developed an inventory of projects eligible for
financing from the Fund. The inventory is publicly available on the Ministry of Energy webpage.
This inventory is updated quarterly. Project eligibility criteria take into account the objectives of
the National Strategy for the Energy Transition and the Sustainable Use of Energy.

The ICR rates the achievements of results as satisfactory.

52.     The Overall Program Development Objective was to support the GOMs’ program to
develop the regulatory, monitoring and financial framework for low emissions evolution of the
urban transport and energy sectors. In summary, the outputs of the DPL at the ICR stage
included in the three Policy Areas of the DPL have been met. These include: (a) implement a
verifiable, targeted and cross-sectoral strategy for emission reductions; (b) establish institutions,
regulations and monitoring capacity to allow for the reduction of emissions in urban transport,
energy generation and efficiency; and (c) institutionalize the appropriate financing mechanisms
to allow for the reduction of emissions in urban transport, energy generation and efficiency.

53.    The prospects to meet the medium term goals are high considering the strong GOM
commitment to reduce CO2 emissions and the accountability mechanisms implemented to
monitor reduction emissions targets by sector. As previously noted, SEMARNAT is responsible
for monitoring the CO2 emissions targets committed in PECC and Inter-Secretarial Commission
on Climate Change (Comisión Inter-secretarial de Cambio Climático – CICC) is the institutional
                                                 16
mechanism serving as the platform of the accountability and monitoring mechanisms
implemented by the GOM. SEMARNAT is the ministry member of CICC managing the
accountability systems to monitor the CO2 emissions commitments.11

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

54.    The overall outcome rating of satisfactory is based on the following considerations. First,
important actions were taken in all relevant policy areas prior to Board presentation and all prior
conditions were met. Approval and publication of PECC in the Diario Oficial de la Federación
was fundamental to creating a comprehensive policy framework for reduction of emissions
across sectors. Second, all the expected outputs at ICR date have been achieved. Third, even
though it is difficult to foresee results of the medium term outcomes defined for the end of 2012,
the GOM is on track to meet them and has created the institutional mechanisms to oversee the
CO2 emissions reductions targets committed in PECC. SEMARNAT coordinates the oversight
mechanism to follow up on a semiannual basis the target indicators defined in PECC for CO2
emissions reductions.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

55.     The provisions of OP8.60 apply to the Framework for Green Growth DPL and the
operation is expected to have a significant positive poverty and social impact through its support
to the strengthening of the regulatory, monitoring, and financial framework for low emissions
evolution of the transport and energy sectors.

56.     On the urban transport side, the transit projects supported by PROTRAM will benefit
urban populations representing 70 percent of the country’s total. Transit users are, for the most
part, below average income levels and significantly close to the poverty line or below it. Urban
transport policies supported by the DPL are thus generating a positive social and poverty impact
by extending the availability of public transportation. In a country as urbanized as Mexico, these
developments will generate significant co-benefits related to: (i) improved mobility of the poor
who disproportionately rely on public transport; (ii) improved travel conditions and increased
safety for passengers; (iii) reduced street congestion and improved travel times; and (iv)
improved health impacts from lower exposure to air pollutants. Additional positive social
impacts of the development of mass transport systems include better use of public space and
associated urban renewal, benefiting both passengers and urban dwellers in the areas influenced
by these systems. Lastly, the development of mass transit will particularly benefit female
passengers, due to their particular travel patterns as a result of the various household and child-

   PECC emissions commitments are evaluated using a database system. SIAT-PECC is the system integrating the
information with the evolution of CO2 emissions across ministries and sectors.


                                                    17
related responsibilities, lower travel budgets, fewer options for commuting, and greater security
concerns.

57.     In the energy sector, the energy efficiency policies supported by this DPL will have
significant positive and progressive social impacts through the reduction of electricity bills
brought about by targeted replacement of high energy-use appliances and bulbs. In addition,
both energy efficiency and renewable energy development provide positive social impacts,
including health benefits from lower particulate emissions.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

58.    This DPL contributed to the GOM’s institutional strengthening in both the energy and
transport sectors.

59.     In the transport sector, institutional coordination has been strengthened through
PROTRAM’s operationalization of its role to support the implementation of bus and train-based
mass transit projects that are consistent with long-term integrated and sustainable mobility plans.
Specifically, institutional strengthening has been achieved through the close collaboration of the
government agencies involved in the Technical Committee and the Consultative Working Group
or GTC, the main decision-making bodies in PROTRAM headed by the Ministry of Finance and
Public Credit (SHCP). Other agencies that participate in these decision for a include the Ministry
of Transport and Communications (SCT), the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL), the
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), National Bank of Public Works
and Services (BANOBRAS), and the National Infrastructure Fund (FONADIN). FONADIN’s
Technical Committee, also includes representatives of three state governments. As said above,
the Technical Committee and the GTC were instrumental in the consensus building process that
led to amending PROTRAM’s rules so that transport projects took climate change into
consideration, measured a baseline of GHG emissions, and applied World Bank safeguards, as
established in the MASTU, regardless of financing sources. This collaborative effort shows that
inter-institutional cooperation has been strengthened as a result of the program.

60.     The green growth DPL also enabled the creation of institutional capacity for the design of
policies and regulations needed to implement the new Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency
Laws. Through complementary technical assistance provided under the Mexico Renewable
Energy Assistance Program (P117870), the Bank provided funding for studies and workshops on
the economic evaluation of renewable power participation in the generation mix, the design of a
national renewable energy inventory that uses a geo-reference data platform, and guidelines for
small scale renewable energy auctions.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

61.   In urban transport, the decision by FONADIN’s Technical Committee to adopt the
MASTU safeguards framework for all PROTRAM projects, regardless of financing sources, is
an important unintended outcome. The MASTU was developed originally for the Bank-financed
Urban Transport Transformation Project (P107159). However, as the preparation of the UTTP
advanced, officers in the PROTRAM saw in the MASTU a convenient safeguard tool that should

                                                18
be applied to all projects in the PROTRAM. The ultimate decision by the Technical Committee
of applying the MASTU to all PROTRAM-financed projects makes de facto World Bank
safeguards the law of the land for federally-supported urban transport projects in Mexico.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

62.         Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

63.         The risk to development outcome is low for the following reasons:
      (a)    The DPL has achieved all of its objectives and has supported the GOM’s program to
             develop and establish the regulatory, monitoring and financial framework for low
             emissions evolution of the two largest sectors in terms of the country’s GHG emissions.
      (b)    The DPL benefited from strong government ownership of the policy, regulatory and
             financing framework. The GOM is fully committed to the medium-term climate change
             mitigation goals defined in the PECC.
      (c)    In urban transport, the PROTRAM’s success at receiving requests for funding for
             sustainable transit projects, 41 at the time of finalizing the ICR, shows that the federal
             mass transit program has tapped a latent demand. The objective of PROTRAM is
             therefore well established: Mexican cities need to reform their urban transport systems
             and implement mass transit lines in the corridors, to benefit transit users and lower the
             carbon footprint of urban transport. Moreover, the demand for PROTRAM’s funds also
             represents a constituency that translates into political support and political
             sustainability. On the other hand, the financial resources at FONADIN to cover the
             commitments made by PROTRAM are currently sufficient to satisfy the short term
             demand of the first projects to be implemented and there is a reasonable prospect of
             maintaining adequate funding.
      (d)    The Fund for Energy Transition & the Sustainable Use of Energy has been capitalized
             to finance 7 projects in energy efficiency. Despite the financial crisis and the narrow
             budgetary margin of the GOM, the fund has been capitalized and there is a positive
             prospect of maintaining funding at a reasonable level to keep funding new energy
             efficiency projects.
      (e)    Inter-Ministerial coordination ensured a broader discussion of the issues and promoted
             buy-in with respect to strategy proposals and instruments from the sectors.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

   Rating: Satisfactory

64.     The team that prepared the Green Growth DPL ensured that it built successfully upon
other activities that were part of the Bank’s continuous engagement with Mexico on climate
change issues dating back to the mid-1990s, which at the time of DPL approval comprised about
25 different initiatives (see Annex 4 for a full description of the Program). The design of the
DPL incorporated knowledge from a series of ongoing sector-level operations and a countrywide
low-carbon study that reflect a long-standing and comprehensive policy dialogue and operational
relationship between the GOM and the Bank.

65.     The DPL served as a natural follow-on to the Climate Change Development Policy Loan
(CCDPL-P110849), approved in 2008 to support the GOM’s efforts to mainstream climate
change and environmental considerations into public policy. Specifically, the achievements of
the CCDPL – including the initiation of sectoral programs for energy, and support of policy
incentives to reduce the carbon intensity of the Mexican economy – were consolidated by the
Green Growth DPL’s focus on low-carbon transport and energy use. In fact, several of the
monitoring indicators used by the CCDPL, particularly in the areas of mitigation, knowledge
base and institutional strengthening, were used directly as prior actions for the proposed
operation, reflecting the Bank’s programmatic approach in engagement on these issues. The
Climate Change DPL opened the doors for the Green Growth DPL to promote the official
approval and publication of the Special Program for Climate Change (Programa Especial de
Cambio Climático or PECC) and for its establishment as a comprehensive policy framework for
the reduction of emissions across sectors.

66.     Similarly, the Green Growth DPL also leveraged the Bank’s engagement in Mexico in
the environmental arena. More specifically, the DPL built on the Environmental Sustainability
Development Policy Loan (ENVDPL), approved in September 2008, to support the Government
in mainstreaming environmental considerations in key development sectors (tourism, energy,
water, forestry, agriculture, and housing). In the energy sector, specifically, the prior actions of
the ENVDPL go hand in hand with those for the sector in the Framework for Green Growth
DPL. Under the ENVDPL, the main prior action was the approval and implementation launch of
the 2007-2012 Energy Sector Program by the Federal Government in order to increase energy
efficiency and energy production from non-hydro renewable sources and to regulate sulfur
emissions. The Green Growth DPL took these actions one step further by establishing a
regulatory framework for the accomplishment of the Energy Sector Program through the passing
of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Laws, by calling for a more precise roadmap of
interventions through the definition of regulations under these two laws, and by supporting the
creation of CONUEE, which developed methodologies for quantifying GHG emissions in the
energy sector.



                                                20
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

67.     During the implementation phase of the DPL, the Bank team maintained continuous
communication with the client to assess progress in implementing the specific supported
reforms. In particular, the team maintained close dialogue with SEMARNAT, supporting its
efforts in coordinating the two sectors and the many agencies involved to ensure progress in
reaching the goals of the DPL and the Government’s own program (PECC). Through parallel
ongoing technical assistance and operational work, the Bank also continued to provide technical
support in both the urban transport and the energy sectors. It conducted two supervision
missions, one in May 2010 and a second one in April 2011, meeting with all key stakeholders
including SEMARNAT, SHCP, SENER, PROTRAM and BANSEFI.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

68.     The design of this DPL was appropriate, timely and focused on critical challenges for the
country with regard to the climate change agenda. The Bank provided technical support to
strength GOM institutional capabilities to enable the implementation of both the Renewable
Energy and the Energy Efficiency Laws. In addition, the Bank conducted a permanent dialogue
with the country on the technical assistance requirements to comply with the DPL’s policy
objectives. As explained for urban transport, the task team took advantage of the enhanced
dialogue allowed by the many operations running in parallel. This dialogue, furthermore, was
enriched by the common thread among the operations: improving urban transport to reduce
carbon emissions (among other benefits). Finally, as explained above, quality at entry and quality
of supervision was satisfactory and the continuous policy dialogue promoted commitment to
policy reforms under the Framework for Green Growth DPL.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

69.      The Government showed strong ownership of the design and delivery of all the triggers
of the operation. SEMARNAT, SHCP, SENER had fundamental roles in working with the Bank
on the policy agenda included in Green Growth DPL. These Ministries also worked closely with
the Bank team in shaping into a cohesive operation the various goals and strategies of each
institution that participated in the implementation of the policy framework. During
implementation, BANSEFI successfully coordinated the many participating Ministries and
agencies and ensured that the Program objectives remained on track. The Government ensured
the human and financial resources to implement the DPL’s objectives and created a results
reporting framework.



                                               21
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

70.     SEMARNAT, SENER and SHCP provided constant leadership and support during the
implementation of this operation. These Ministries provided coordination and oversight from the
outset and encouraged the active participation of all agencies involved in the Program.
SEMARNAT was responsible for monitoring the CO2 emissions targets committed in PECC.
SENER was responsible for the integration of key regulations for the promotion of energy
efficiency and renewable energy.

71.    The Financial Agent for this loan was the National Bank for Savings and Financial
Services (BANSEFI). BANSEFI helped coordinate operations, participating in negotiation
meetings with all participating entities, and reviewing and verifying information including legal
aspects. BANSEFI also coordinated disbursements and financial management of the operation.

72.     FONADIN-PROTRAM was responsible for the transport side of the program. The
officers in these institutions excelled in their willingness to meet the program objectives and
goals. The key example is the consensus building process related to the amendment to the
PROTRAM guidelines, approved May 14 2010, to have urban transport projects: (i) include
climate change considerations in order to receive funding from PROTRAM; (ii) include baseline
measurements of GHG, and (iii) be prepared using the MASTU, the safeguard framework
prepared for the Bank-financed UTTP. The first two points are directly related to the outputs
expected of the program. The third is an unexpected output that means all urban transport
projects in Mexico that receive support from the PROTRAM will comply with World Bank
safeguards.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

73.     The GOM, particularly SEMARNAT, SHCP, SENER, FONADING-PROTRAM and
BANCEFI, participated actively in the preparation of the DPL, facilitated and coordinated
actions with responsible agencies, closely followed compliance with the policy matrix, reported
to the Bank on progress and helped to organize missions and meetings to follow up the evolution
of the outcomes agreed in the three policy areas. As explained above the Government showed
strong ownership of the design and delivery of all the triggers of the operation.

6. Lessons Learned

74.         The lessons learned from the Framework for Green Growth DPL are the following:

      (i)      Extensive dialogue on the prior actions and the desired objectives leads to solid
               programs. The idea to anchor the Green Growth DPL to the approval of the PECC
               emerged early in the preparation stage. The consultations with the Mexican
               government on the PECC were extensive. As preparation advanced, a scenario

                                                 22
        emerged in which the PECC would not be approved because of the complexities of
        reaching consensus on such an ambitious program that could have important
        economic implications at times of a deep economic crisis. Rather than reformulate the
        key prior actions and the entire Green Growth program, the Bank engaged the
        Mexican government in further dialogue to understand the situation. The dialogue
        contributed in part to help the Mexican government to enact the PECC.

(ii)    Long-standing, comprehensive sector dialogue contributed to the ability to
        deliver immediate support. Preparation of a large operation like this DPL in a short
        period was the result of immediate World Bank response to the client both at Country
        Office and Headquarters and benefited from a long-standing, comprehensive sector
        dialogue.

(iii)   A one-tranche DPL is an adequate instrument to support a country’s sustainable
        growth in the face of short-term financial pressures. The experience under this
        DPL is that the financial support helped Mexico to continue with its ambitious
        climate change and CO2 reduction agenda by providing additional financial flexibility
        during the global financial crisis.

(iv)    A DPL can pave the way for many other Bank-financed operations, and in turn,
        those operations enrich the dialogue to develop the DPL. This situation is what
        happened in urban transport in this DPL. The Green Growth DPL rewarded the
        creation of PROTRAM and established outputs to develop the PROTRAM. In
        parallel, there are investment loans, the UTTP, grants, GEF STAQ, technical
        assistance, and even carbon finance. The common thread among all the operations
        was improving public transit so as lower the carbon growth path of urban transport in
        Mexican cities. But the linkages did not stop there: the outputs of the DPL at ICR
        date were technically beneficial to the UTTP.

(v)     Technical support from the Bank is key to reducing risk for the Government
        and helping to advance objectives. As seen, the FONADIN’S Technical Committee
        adopted the MASTU, the safeguard framework for the UTTP, as the safeguard
        framework for all PROTRAM-financed projects. This positive and unintended
        outcome of the program was possible in part because the Bank had committed with
        Mexico to finance a technical assistance program called the Mexico Urban Transport
        Sector Technical Advisory Program (P117624). This program is demand driven and
        establishes the priorities. Currently, most of the funds are directed toward advice on
        preparing projects according to the MASTU, and on how to prepare technically sound
        projects.

(vi)    Inter-institutional coordination is one key to enabling a successful program. The
        institutional framework of the operation required substantial effort on the part of
        participating entities to implement the operation. The commitment of the GOM to its
        green growth agenda and the leadership of SEMARNAT, SHCP, SENER and
        BANSEFI helped to establish a successful coordination process which provided
        opportunity for knowledge sharing among the different sectors

                                            23
   (vii)    Permanent dialogue with the client helped to identify TA requirements during
            the implementation of regulations and policy framework. The implementation of a
            technically sophisticated reform such as the ones implemented in Mexico to promote
            energy efficiency and renewable energy generation requires the creation of
            specialized directives and guidelines to enable an appropriate regulatory framework.
            The implementation of these regulations and policies demanded technical support of
            highly qualified specialists in the area. The permanent dialogue with the GOM
            allowed the Bank to identify the expertise required by the client, and guide the
            technical discussions with the government officials.

   (viii)   Necessities for a permanent follow up of indicators to identify challenges to
            comply with middle term goals. The outcomes at DPL ICR date were specific,
            identifiable and delivered before the elaboration of the ICR. The Medium Term
            outcomes were for the end of 2012, 18 months after the ICR Date. Overseeing their
            progress, despite the due date beyond ICR closure, is fundamental to identifying
            problems in their implementation. The GOM created an institutional mechanism to
            oversee the CO2 emissions reductions targets committed in PECC. SEMARNAT
            coordinates the oversight mechanism to follow up on a semiannual basis the target
            indicators defined in PECC for CO2 emissions reductions.

Annex 4. The Green Growth DPL within the Mexico/Bank Overall Climate Change
Program

1.      The World Bank has been working with Mexico on climate change and environmental
sustainability for nearly two decades. Over this period, the Bank has provided both financial and
technical support to Mexico’s efforts. This support contributed to Mexico’s creation of a national
climate change strategy, improved forestry management, and the passage of renewable energy
and energy efficiency laws.

2.      Overall, the Bank has supported Mexico’s sustainable development agenda. The Bank
strategy has supported and continues to support the GOM’s agenda to integrate environmental
considerations into public policy, in order to increase competitiveness and economic and social
development, while simultaneously protecting the environment. The World Bank support
program aims to help reduce air and water pollution, promote the efficient use of water and
energy, as well as conserve land and improve forest management. Also, improvements in
environmental sustainability are expected to benefit the poor. Given the significant impact of
climate change in Mexico and the country’s leading role in the field on the global level, the
Bank’s engagement has focused on strengthening Mexico’s policies and programs aimed at
achieving a low carbon growth path and developing resilience to the effects of climate change.

3.      Actions under Mexico’s Special Climate Change Program seek to halve its GHG
emissions (from a 2000 baseline) by 2050 and promote adaptation measures, such as: increased
electricity generation from renewable sources (from 23 percent in 2006, to 26 percent in 2012),
energy savings (replace 1.9 million air conditioning units and refrigerators and 47 million light
bulbs); integrated water resources management programs (three Watershed Management and
Soil Conservation Plans); sustainable housing solutions (provide green mortgage for 800,000
new houses, to reduce 1.2 million tons of CO2 emissions/year by 2012); integrated mass
transport corridors in at least the 10 largest cities in the country and incorporation of 2.9 million
additional hectares of forest into sustainable management programs and 2.1 million hectares into
payment for environmental services schemes.

4.      This DPL built on a number of past operations by the World Bank in support of Mexico’s
Climate Change policy and institutional development. The Bank activities include the areas of
potential climate change impacts, as well as measures to reduce emissions and contribute to
overall sustainability goals. The Bank has worked in almost all sectors of Mexico’s economy that
are relevant to climate change through a range of advisory services, analytical work, investment
projects, and other Development Policy Loans. Through its analytic and advisory work, the Bank
has contributed to the development of Mexico’s national climate change program, most
significantly through the evaluation of impacts, adaptation measures, and mitigation strategies
related to water, forests, energy, transport, and urban development. In all of these areas, the Bank
has provided Mexico with the experiences from other countries, such as in the use of carbon
markets and renewable energy policy, and in turn has helped to disseminate Mexico’s best
practices internationally, such as in the areas of community forestry, bus rapid transit, and
overall environment and climate change planning. The Bank has contributed to the financing of
Mexico’s sustainable development and climate change agenda through the use of grants (GEF),
concessional financing (CTF), carbon payments, and sector investment loans in the areas of
                                                 28
clean energy, urban transport, waste management, and land-use and forestry, as well as through
development policy loans.

5.     The Mexican Government and the World Bank have been engaged on an extensive
climate change agenda. In this engagement we can identify four stages (see Figure 1): (i)
Foundations; (ii) Early Support; (iii) Strengthening; and (iv) Consolidation.

6.      During the first stage, Foundations (before 1999), Bank support was focused on
investment projects in the waste, transport and forest management areas. Moreover, with the
launch of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) in 1991, Mexico gained new opportunities for
grants on projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation,
the ozone layer, and persistent organic pollutants. In the second stage, Early Support (1999–
2007), Mexico was admitted in the Kyoto Protocol, which led to the establishment of a national
strategy and sectoral committee on climate change issues. During this stage, World Bank support
to the climate change agenda became explicit. The projects were mainly focused on specific
sectors such as clean transport, waste management and energy provision. The Programmatic
Environment Development Policy Loans I and II (US$200 million each) recognized and
supported national environmental strategies on tourism, energy, forestry and water, some of them
explicitly related to climate change.

7.      In the third stage, Strengthening (2007–2010), Bank support was focused on cross-
sectoral strategies to address climate change and was closely related to the National Climate
Change Strategy. The flagship of this period is the Climate Change DPL (US$501 million)
which was presented to the Board for its approval jointly with a new Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS). In this stage, the analytical and knowledge activities increased considerably.
One of the key activities developed during this stage was the preparation of the Clean
Technology Fund (CTF) Investment Plan (IP), which provides support for the low-carbon
growth objectives in Mexico’s 2007–2012 National Development Plan, Climate Change Strategy
and Special Climate Change Program. During this same stage the Bank supported GOM’s
medium-term, outcome-based program to promote sustainable development though the
Environmental Sustainability DPL (US$300 million).

8.     In the fourth and current stage, Consolidation (2010–), the focus has been on
mainstreaming mitigation and adaptation to climate change across sectors and levels of
government. Some of the key instruments that were deployed during this stage and are underway
include:

9.          The Urban Transport Transformation Program (UTTP, 2010), which combines
various instruments, including a Clean Technology Fund (CTF) loan in the amount of US$200
million, and an IBRD loan in the amount of US$150 million. The program is also supported by a
GEF grant aimed at the development of clean transport solutions at the local level.

10.         The Low-carbon Development Policy Loan (2010) in the amount of US$401 million,
which recognized and supported the GoM’s reforms and implementation of policies and
programs under the PECC. This DPL, following from the flagship Low-carbon Study (MEDEC,
P108304), included the energy, transport, urban housing and forestry sectors.

                                                29
11.           The Subnational Climate Change Program (2010–), which is composed of a series
of activities, including: (i) the Subnational Climate Change Plans, financed by a grant from the
Spanish Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (SFLAC) and Bank budget. Its aim is to
develop State Adaptation Plans. The Bank has been supporting the following: (i) assistance to
three states (Michoacán, Campeche and Zacatecas) in capacity building; (ii) the SFLAC grant for
Local Sustainable Development, which aims to provide advisory services to develop a Municipal
Climate Vulnerability Index and Guidelines for Municipal Climate Change Action Plans; and
(iii) the Cities Alliance Grant to support the municipality of Othon P. Blanco, Quintana Roo, in
developing a municipal sustainability and climate change strategy.

12.          These instruments are complemented by an Engagement in the Water Sector and
Climate Change, which defines an integrated series of instruments, including: (i) the Adaptation
to Climate Change in the Water Sector DPL (2010: US$450 million), which supports the GOM’s
efforts to strengthen the Institutional Framework and Monitoring Capacity in Integrated Water
Resources Management and Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change in Water Programs;
(ii) Adaptation to Climate Change Impacts on the Coastal Wetlands in the Gulf of Mexico
(2010), partially financed by a GEF grant; and (iii) the Strategic Engagement Program (SEP) to
Support Adaptation of the Water Sector to Climate Change (2011), which furthers the
partnership between Mexico and the Bank by strengthening CONAGUA’s (Waters National
Commission) capacity to address the challenges posed to the security of the water supply needed
for Mexico’s economic and social development.

13.     The Bank’s program on climate change in Mexico constitutes an outstanding example of
engagement with a sophisticated middle-income country in which the Bank has deployed the full
range of available instruments to support the evolution of the government’s program through the
years in a continuous manner (see Figure 2). The focus has been on using the existing range of
Bank instruments in ways that build synergy and deliver knowledge services combined with
lending services.

Sector Specific Operational Work and Analytical Studies

14.    This DPL is linked to a number of sector-specific engagements that reflect a
longstanding and comprehensive policy dialogue and operational relationship between
the Government of Mexico and the World Bank.

15.     In the Energy sector, the World Bank currently supports a variety of interventions
aimed at putting the sector on a low-carbon development path. Among others, these
include studies on renewable resources (Mexico Renewable Energy Assistance Program,
to be completed in 2011) and on the social and environmental standards needed to
develop wind farms (Greening the Wind, forthcoming June 2011). They also include
investments in the development of wind plants (through Venta II) and studies on the
potential for minihydro development (through the Promoting Mini-Hydro Potential in
Mexico technical assistance project). A large IBRD, CTF and GEF-financed operation,
the Mexico Efficient Lighting and Appliances Project, approved by the Bank’s Board in
November 2010, supports Mexico’s end-use energy efficiency efforts by financing the
replacement of appliances and incandescent lighting in residential with more energy
efficient technologies for both public and private consumers. Under the Mexico
Integrated Energy Services Project, the World Bank is supporting rural electrification
solutions in isolated poor communities using small-scale renewable energy, mainly solar
photo-voltaic (PV) units.

16.      Through a Fee-based Analytical and Advisory Services project, to be completed in
2011, the Bank is supporting Pemex in improving its analytical and management tools to
help evaluate the environmental and social externalities of the company’s operations,
build performance indicators based on the valuation of environmental costs and benefits
that can complement corporate benchmarking exercises to report more fully on the
company's strategic goals, and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of Mexico's
institutional framework to regulate the environmental impact of the oil industry.

17.     In the Transport sector, particularly urban transport, this DPL builds on and
complements, among others, the outcomes of such Bank-supported projects as the
Mexican Medium Size Cities Transport Program, which supported the strengthening of
local institutional capacity as well as the federal urban transport decentralization process;
the Introduction to Climate Friendly Measures in Transport, a GEF project that assisted
the Government in developing policies and measures for stimulating a long-term modal
shift toward cleaner and less carbon-intensive transport in the Mexico City Metropolitan
Area. The DPL also links to the outcomes of the CTF and IBRD supported Urban
Transport Transformation Program (UTTP) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-
supported Sustainable Transport and Air Quality project, both aimed at placing Mexico’s
urban transport on a low-carbon growth path.

     Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The team received comments to the ICR draft from the Government of Mexico. In
general, there was broad agreement that the ICR captured the importance of the DPL
within the overall climate change program of Mexico. There was also agreement that the
ICR presented all of the necessary information to support the suggested ratings. No
changes in ratings were proposed. The suggestions and comments of the Mexican
government were mainly in the following four areas:

      1. Description of the achievements of Program Development Objectives

      2. Description of Climate Change engagement in Mexico

      3. Sector and theme codes

      4. Editorial comments

1.       Description of the achievements of Program Development Objectives

The GOM recommended a more detailed description of the achievements in the Policy
Area 2: Enabling and Monitoring Framework for the Reduction of Emissions in Urban
Transport. The team described in further detail the achievements of the DPL to promote
the adoption of methodology guidelines for developing corridor emission baselines


2.       Description of Climate Change engagement in Mexico

The GOM suggested some changes to the description of the WB engagement in Mexico’s
Climate Change agenda. These changes include, adding up some operations and technical
assistances approved to support the climate change agenda and eliminating an operation
that is not yet in the operations pipeline.

3.       Sector and theme codes

The GOM express concern in table D: “Sector and Theme Codes?. In the table, the
original row title is “Sector Code (as % of total Bank financing)?. The GOM suggested
to eliminate the phrase: “(as % of total Bank financing)?; to avoid a misinterpretation
of the scope of the DPL. Readers may interpret the DPL financed these sectors. The team
agreed with the GOM officials.
