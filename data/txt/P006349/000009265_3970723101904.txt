BRAZIL
CHESF-FURNAS POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBRAS)
Guarantor:          Federative Republic of Brazil
Beneficiaries:     - Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF)
- FURNAS Centrais Eletricas S.A.
Amount:             US$400.0 million equivalent
Terms:              Repayment in 15 years, including 3 years of grace, with
interest at the Bank's standard variable rate.
Relending Terms:   ELETROBRAS will relend US$113.2 million of the proceeds
of the loan to CHESF and US$286.8 million to FURNAS on
the same terms and conditions as those of the loan. The
beneficiaries would bear the foreign exchange risk on
the Bank loan.
Project             The proposed project would support Government efforts to
Description:        reverse the financial deterioration of the sector.  It
is a priority project within the Government's 1984-1988
Sector Development Plan which the Bank has analyzed and
approved. The proposed loan would finance the
construction of transmission facilities included in the
1985-1992 transmission expansion programs of CHESF and
FURNAS. It provides for the construction of about 1,730
circuit-kilometers of high voltage (HV) transmission
lines; construction of eight new substations including
the installation of about 5,400 MVA of transformer
capacity and about 520 MVAR of reactor and capacitor
banks; expansion of sixteen existing substations adding
about 1200 MVA of transformer capacity and about 1,260
MVAR of reactor and capacitor banks. The project also
includes training programs for CHESF and FURNAS.
Benefits and       The proposed project would allow the two utilities to:
Risks:             meet Brazil's market power needs especially in the
industralized cities located in the states of Sao Paulo,
Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, Bahia,
Alagoas, Paraiba, Ceara, Piaui, and Sergipe; transfer
the electricity generated at the Itaipu hydroelectric
plant (now being commissioned) to the main consumption
centers of the Southeastern and Central-Western systems;
achieve higher system efficiency by reinforcing CHESF



- vi -
and FURNAS networks and by interconnecting some isolated
systems (presently fuel consuming); and bolster CHESF's
and FURNAS' managerial and administrative capabilities
through training programs. The project itself does not
present any special technical risks. The main risk
derives from the financial difficulties currently
affecting the Brazilian power sector. These are being
addressed through a number of measures agreed between
the Government and the Bank that will progressively
improve the financial condition of the power sector.

1. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
Energy Sector
- Energy Resources
1.01      Brazil's energy resources comprise a vast hydropotential, as well
as oil shale, coal, nuclear fuels and biomass. Proven oil and gas reserves
are limited. Of the indigenous energy resources only hydro und biomass
currently play a significant role in the country's energy supply mix,
though domestic oil production has increased significantly in the last
three years and in 1983 it covered only about 35Z of the market
requirements. The potential for hydroelectric development is estimated at
about 213,000 NW of which about 50,000 MW are in use or under construction.
1.02      Presently the Government is making important efforts to increase
domestic oil production and substitute domestic alcohol, natural gas, coal
and other sources of energy for oil. Started in 1975, production of
alcohol for use as fuel in internal combustion engines amounted in 1984 to
9 billion liters equivalent to 120,000 bbls. of oil per day. The current
goal is to produce by 1993 about 20 billion liters of alcohol equivalent to
256,000 bbls. of oil per day. In 1983 coal production was 5.2 million
tons, equivalent to 29,000 bbls. of oil per day or about 4Z of the energy
supply. The government expects that in 1993 coal production will be 21.8
million tons, equivalent to 104,000 bbls. of oil per day, about 8X of the
total energy supply. Brazil is also developing a nuclear generating
capacity which should have an important role in electricity generation
beyond the year 2010, when most of the economically exploitable hydro
resources would be utilized. Efforts are also being made for a more
intensive utilization of other domestic energy resources, including burning
wood and sugarcane bagasse for electricity generation in isolated areas.
- Energy Demand and Supply
1.03      In 1983, Brazil's gross energy consumption was 152 million tons
of oil equivalent (t.o.e), or 1.2 t.o.e. per head of population and is
expected to grow at about 5.8% p.a. through 1986, reaching about 1.33
t.o.e. per capita in 1986. Oil products, about 612 of them imported,
ac-ounted for 35% of energy consumption and hydroelectricity for 29%; the
remaining 36% was met mainly by coal, wood products and bagasse.
- National Energy Policy
1.04      National energy policy has the following main objectives:
(a) Conservation and rational use of energy to encourage maximum
efficiency in the utilization of energy resources;
(b) substitution of imported energy sources by domestic ones,
especially -renewables", wherever technically and economically
feasible, to reduce dependence on imported petroleum and coal;
and
(c) exploitation of existing domestic energy resources and
intensification of search for new sources.



-2-
While (b) and (c) are desirable objectives, it is important for Brazil to
scrutinize further development of domestic energy sources carefully. Given
the country's domestic and external resource conotraints and the prospects of
relatively stable real oil prlces in the next decade, only cost-effective
substitutes which require relatively modest investments should be
undertaken. Controlling energy consumption is also Important. The
Government could be using pricing more aggressively to promote conservation.
While the domestic price of gasoline, and diesel are substantially higher
than the international price, LPG, fuel oil, and naphtha do not cover c.l.f.
international prices plus local distribution costs. Incentives for alcohol
use are still substantial; the retail alcohol price is 352 lower than the
gasoline price, although the energy differential between the two is closer to
20-25%. And, as discussed later on in this report, electric power rates are
substantially below the long-run marginal cost of productlon. Flnally, as
long as the Government continues to regulate the energy sector, more
coordination in the development and use of the major fuels is needed, in
order to reduce over expansion of capacity. The issues related to power are
being dealt with through this and other Bank loans given to the sector, while
loans for alcohol and transportation address issues related to alcohol and
other fuels.
Power Sector
- Policies
1.05      The power sector is making an important contribution in achieving
the national energy policy goals listed above. Pricing of electricity will
be very important in encouraging conservation and promoting efficient
resource allocation. In this respect, progress has been made through marginal
cost tariff studies carried out under loans 1300-BR, 1824-BR and 1939-BR. The
results of these studies will be put into effect over several years in the
framework of currently enacted legislation and should result in more
efficient use of installed capacity (para. 5.12). Plans for generating
plants to be built in the remainder of this century give emphasis to the use
of indigenous primary energy resources (hydropower, coal and uranium). As
96% of electricity generated in the existing interconnected systems is
hydro; there is little room for displacing oil in power generation. However,
to make full use of the existing hydro generation capacity, gradual
substitution of electricity for oil products in industry is being encouraged
through application of low rates for interruptible and off-peak electricity
services.
- Organization
1.06      The institutional development of the Brazilian power sector over
the last 50 years has been characterized by progressive nationalization and
growing centralization, resulting in the consolidation of a few large and
hundreds of small utilities into a relatively compact structure of state and
federally-owned utilities. The power sector is under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) created in 1960.  Since then the drive has
been towards increasing sector efficiency and coordination with the



establishment of Centrals Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBRAS) (paras.
2.02 to 2.11) in 1962, and the strengthening of the Departamento Nacional de
Aguas e Energia Eletrica (DNAEE), within MME, as regulatory agency. The aim
has been to combine, as much as possible, regionalization of operations with
country-wide optimization of resources.
1.07      Though complex, and one of the largest in the world, the
electric-power sector is well organized and past policies have generally been
well formulated and applied.  Decree 60,824 of June 7, 1967 established the
current sector organization under which DNAEE performs regulatory functions,
grants licenses for generating plants, assigns concessions, approves
expansion plans and sets tariffs, after approval by the Ministry of Planning,
based upon the Water Code of 1934, as amended, under the principle of
service-at-cost plus an adequate return on capital (Annex 1, Attachment 1).
ELETROBRAS serves as a holding company and as a sector development bank
(para. 2.06). ELETROBRAS also analyzes expansion plans for major generating
and transmission facilities and coordinates and supervises the public power
system.
1.08      Four ELETROBRAS' subsidiaries (FURNAS, CHESF, ELETROSUL
and ELETRONORTE) are responsible primarily for regional generation and
high-voltage transmission systems. They act as bulk suppliers to state and
municipal utility companies which generally are responsible for
sub-transmission and electricity distribution. In addition to the four
regional subsidiaries, ELETROBRAS also owns ESCELSA (Espirito Santo Centrais
Eletricas), the power distributor for the State of Espirito Santo in the
Southeast, and LIGHT - Servicos de Eletricidade S.A., servicing the
metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro. ELETROBRAS also holds the Brazilian
Government's 50% interest in the Itaipu Binacional, the binational agency set
up in April 1973 by the governments of Brazil and Paraguay to build jointly
the 12,600 MW Itaipu hydroelectric facility on the Parana river.
1.09      Since 1967 the Government policy has been to consolidate public
electricity service in the individual states into single state-owned
utilities primarily responsible for distribution activities, although some of
them have also generation and transmission activities. This policy has
resulted in the absorption by the major state-owned companies of many
municipal and privately owned utilities and in the gradual transfer to the
state-owned utilities of ELETROBRAS' ownership in distribution util4ties.
The main existing state-owned utilities are: Companhia Energetica de Sao
Paulo (CESP); Eletricidade de Sao Paulo S.A. (ELETROPAULO); Companhia
Energetica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL);
Companhia Estadual de Energia Eletrica (CEEE) - Rio Grande do Sul; Companhia
Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL); Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina
(CELESC); Companhia de Electricidade da Bahia (COELBA); Companhia de
Eletricidade de Pernambuco (CELPE), and Companhia Eletricidade do Ceara
(COELCE). All these utilities have been borrowers or beneficiaries under
past Bank loans. Despite this process of consolidation, the sector still
comprises 600 concessionaires, of which 25 are state companies and the rest
small municipal and private companies.



-4-
- Growth of Demand
1.10      In 1983, national average production of electricity was about 1,000
kWh per capita; the industrial sector used 51X of the electricity and the
residential sector 22%. Due to the high industrial and urban concentration
in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro the geographical distribution
of demand is umeven. Though the most developed states have promoted rural
electrification, access to electricity in rural areas for the whole country
is still low (about 20%). During the period of 1970 to 1980 public service
electricity consumption rose at an average annual growth rate of 13Z, which
is very high when compared with other ccuntries. Though the annual increase
rates in the last three years have been lower than the previous decade's, (3%
in 1981; 6% in 1982; and 8% in 1983) they are still high when compared with
other countries. The revised projections of electricity consumption recently
prepared by ELETROBRAS show that despite the difficult economic situation
faced by the country demand was expected to grow 11% p.a. in 1984 and at a
moderate rate of about 8Z p.a. in the period 1985-1998 which would imply a
certain degree of energy management through pricing. The Government's
intention now is to increase tariffs over time to reflect long-run marginal
cost. During negotiations the Government agreed on a plan of action to
implement by 1989 the recommendations of a long-run marginal cost study
financed by the Bank (Loan 1939-BR) (para. 5.12).
- System Expansion Planning
1.11      ELETROBRAS has the primary responsibility for the coordination of
planning in the power sector and for the preparation of system generation and
transmission expansion plans. Distribution planning is the responsibility of
each individual utility company but a higher degree of participation of
ELETROBRAS in the global assessment of the adequacy of the level of
investments of the individual utilities is needed, to ensure a consistent
approach. At negotiations agreement was reached with ELETROBRAS to implement
by December 31, 1987, a medium term program satisfactory to the Bank,
designed to strengthen ZZLETROBRAS' role in the sector distribution planning.
1.12      ELETROBRAS is subject to the supervision of DNAEE in the
preparation of its pla-s, and the plans themselves are subject to the formal
approval of IMME. However, in practice, DNAEE tends to concentrate on tariff
planning and on the sector budgeting exercise, which provides financial
projections for the ensuing three years. Since 1981 the responsibility for
approving the investment programs and tariff levels of public utilities has
been exercised by the Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN). The composition of
Brazil's current generation expansion program for the 1980's was based, by
and large, on ELETROBRAS' demand forecasts prepared in the 1970s which are
now seen to have been too optimistic and to have assumed an availability of
financial resources which failed to materialize fully. This program resulted



in commitments for large generating plants (Itaipu, Tucurui and nuclear)
which are now nearing completion but which leave a significant financial
burden to the sector.
1.13      ELETROBRAS has developed a set of mathematical planning models and
programs specially suited ta the size and couplexity of the Brazilian power
sector for preparing a comprehensive Master Development Plan every three or
four years. The latest generation and transmission development plan to meet
demand through the year 2000 (Piano 2000) was prepared in 1982. Plano 2000
is the result of a comprehensive planning process which includes evaluation
of energy resources and inter and intra sectoral coordination. The country's
major energy problem, its heavy dependence on oil imports, is reflected in
sector planning: Plano 2000 taps only indigenous resources - hydro, uranium
and coal - for expanding the generation system. A complete revision of Plano
2000 is scheduled for 1986; however, partial revisions are made annually to
adjust the expansion program to take into account: changes in demand, peak
reduction through application of time-of-day tariffs, the effect of energy
substitution program, the progress of projects under construction, and
financial considerations. As a result of these revisions, a medium-term plan
was prepared in 1984 and is described below.
- The Sector Development Plan
1.14      On the basis of the methodology of the Plano 2000 and in order to
address more effectively the urgent financial needs of the sector in the
medium term ELETROBRAS with support from the federal and state utilities, in
consultation with SEPLAN, and with input from the Bank, prepared in 1984 a
general Power Sector Development Plan for the 1984 to 1988 period. This
plan serves as a basis for the operations with Bank Involvement presently
under consideration. For the preparation of the revised Development Plan, it
was agreed that:
Mi) the demand scenario would be based upon moderae targets on
expanding electricity coverage to the population, realistic
assumptions in relation to the possibility of implementing large
industrial projects and modest increases in electricity consumption
due to energy substitution;
(ii) the expansion plan would consider the minimum investments required
to provide electricity to the final user with levels of reliability
which, even though lower than the reliability levels traditionally
used in the sector for planning purposes, are still considered
acceptable;
(iii) investments in generation would be directed toward
completing ongoing construction and starting additional works to
provide energy needed after 1990;



(iv) investments in transmission would be directed toward completing
transmission networks required for transfering the energy
generated by projects nearing completion and constructing high
priority lines;
(v) investments in distribution would include increases in the
level of investment over those in the last few years which are
considered low in relation to the needs. However, the sector
plan would not provide for major rehabilitation of some
distribution systems which have reduced their reliability because
of insufficient investment in the past few years; and
(vi) the Government would take or allow to be taken measures to
strengthen the financial condition of the sector so that it may
be in a position to carry out the investment program (paras.
5.08-5.12).
1.15      Sector investment needs in the period 1984-1988 would be about
US$4.5 billion per year. This level of investment is low considering that it
is equal in nominal terms to the average sector investment realized in the
period 1979-1983, when the demand was considerably lower. However, this is
reasonable because of the heavy investment in generation made in the past and
the current lack of resources.
1.16      The proposed project has been identified as priority investment in
this revised Development Plan; it is essential for transfering the energy
generated by projects nearing completiGn to the major load centers. Bank
financing for this project would support the financial rehabilitation of the
power sector by monitoring through annual reviews the sectoral investment
program and the measures that would be taken by the Government for this
purpose (para. 5.12).
- Sector Finances
1.17      The sector finances are discussed in detail in Chapter 5, and the
main problems and proposed actions on the subject are summarized here.
Sector finances deteriorated in the late 1970's and early 1980's and the
sector faces now a critical financial situation with a heavy debt service,
inadequate consumer based funds generation, and constraints in Goverment
contributions. The Government, with Bank assistance, has prepared a
financial rehabilitation program which is based on a program of real tariff
increases to achieve a rate of remuneration of 10% by 1989, a power sector
development plan which considers the minimum investment required to meet
demand projected at moderate rates (para. 1.14), improvements in the debt
profiles, and compensation to the sector of any increase of its operating
costs resulting from the operation of the nuclear plants and the Itaipu
hydroelectric station. The above problems and actions, related to the



financial rehabilitation of the sector, are being addressed through the
proposed loan and the loan for the proposed Southeast Power Distribution
Project currently under preparation (see Chapter 7).
- Financial Information and Financial Planning System
1.18      The procedures used to consolidate the financial information for
the sector as a whole are not adequate. While the ELETROBRAS Group issues
yearly consolidated financial statements for its subsidiaries, the sector's
historic financial information originates from different sources (several
departments of ELETROBRAS or DNAEE). This financial information is prepared
under different criteria; the final versions of each statement are completed
at different times, and the coverage is not always comprehensive of all the
utilities in the sector. The present procedures need substantial improvement
to allow a better analysis of sector finances.
1.19      Similarly, the financial planning system of the Brazilian power
sector has not yet been able to consolidate in a timely fashion the financial
projections of the utilities to arrive at sector aggregates. Thus
projections used for sector analysis do not contain details of each utility's
finances and are prepared using a computer model which is not compatible with
the computer models used for financial projections by the individual
utilities. The planning process goes from top to bottom as the sector
projections give the general conditions on which the individual projections
will be based. The process is slow as several months are needed to obtain
projections of individual utilities, consistent with the sector projections.
In the case of Brazil such slowness is critical as conditions change rapidly
and frequently, especially because of high inflation. Thus the sector's
financial planning system should be improved to allow more reliable and
timely analyses of financial forecasts.
1.20      During negotiations agreement was reached with ELETROBRAS to carry
out a study to consolidate, in a timely and consistent fashion, the
historical financial information and financial planning systems for the power
sector, within the general framework of Government regulations and avoiding
duplication of systems. This study should be completed by December 31, 1986
and its conclusions implemented starting in January 1987. The study would be
basically carried out by sector specialists with some external assistance
(see Annex 1, Attachment 2).
- Bank Participation
1.21      Since 1949, the Bank's loans to the Brazilian power sector have
amounted to about UTS$2.4 billion. Most of the loans have been for
hydroelectric plants and associated transmission facilities in the
Southeastern and Southern regions, but the most recent loans have been mainly
for transmission and distribution projects, and included beneficiaries
outside these two regions. The Bank's lending strategy in the sector has
been, besides financing high priority projects, to promote rational tariff
policies, monitor sector finances and keep continuous dialogue on measures



-8-
required for their progressive improvement, act as catalyst for the
mobilization of funding from other agencies, and help strengthen sector
coordination and planning.  Given the country and the sector's present
financial crisis, the Bank's role in the future would be to assist the
Government and sector authorities in their efforts to improve the financial
condition of the sector through realistic investment and financial policies.
The Bank began to assist the Government's efforts to improve the financial
situation of the sector with the tariff agreement of September 1981,
supplemented with the rate of remuneration agreement of November 1983
(para. 5.08). Since then, sector authorities and the Bank collaborated in
preparing the 1984-88 sector Development Plan which will be the general
framework for future Bank sector operations. Because the sector's present
financial constraints are so stringent the Bank would further assist the
sector by financing interest during construction of this project. Nine
project performance audit reportsl/ have been distributed to the vxecutive
Directors. These reports conclude that, despite construction delays, cost
overruns in some cases, and the beginning of a deteriorating financial trend
in the late 1970s Bank financing had been substantially successful. In
general, such reports emphasized the useful role played by the Bank in the
Brazilian Power Sector.

2. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARIES
Introduction
2.01      The borrower would be ELETROBRAS, which would onlend the proceeds
of the proposed loan for the two power transmission subprojects to the
executing agencies, CHESF and FURNAS, under the same terms and conditions as
the Bank loan (para 5.20(d)); the beneficiaries would bear the interest and
foreign exchange risks of the loan. At negotiations, it was agreed that as a
condition of loan effectiveness, the subsidiary loan agreements between
ELETROBRAS and CHESF and FURNAS would have been signed. Both executing
agencies have been Bank borrowers in the past, they are both highly efficient
and ELETROBRAS is not expected to play a direct role in the execution of
their respective project components.
The Borrower
ELETROBRAS
- Background
2.02      ELETROBRAS was created in 1962 by Law No. 3890-A as a vehicle for
consolidating existing public utilities, centralizing management of the
sector and encouraging orderly regional expansion and long-term growth.
ELETROBRAS is a mixed economy corporation (sociedade de economia mista),
operating under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME)
and responsible for the planning, financing, coordination and supervision of
the operation and expansion of the Brazilian power sector (paras. 1.06 to
1.09 and 1.11 to 1.13).
2.03      Under law, at least 51 percent of the company's voting stock must
always be owned directly or indirectly by the Brazilian Government, which
currently holds 99.8 percent of total company shares and 100 percent of
voting stock. In accordance with its objectives established by law,
ELETROBRAS shall apply the resources allocated to it for the development of
the electric energy sector of Brazil, coordinate the activity of and render
financial, technical and administrative assistance to its subsidiary and
associated companies, and implement the national electric energy policy under
the guidelines issued by MME.
- Organization and Management
2.04      ELETROBRAS is governed by an Administrative Board of Directors
comprised of the President (appointed by the President of the Republic of
Brazil); five Directors who are elected at the General Shareholders meeting
for a term of three years and who head up the various departments of the
company (Coordination, System Operations, Economics and Finance, Planning and
Engineering, and Corporate Management); four Counselors, elected for a term
of three years, who are associated with public power companies under federal
concession and have experience in technology, finance or business management;
and two Counselors, again elected for a term of three years, one representing



- 10 -
public bodies other than the Federal Government and another representing
private shareholders. An Executive Board, comprised of the President and the
five Directors, has responsibility of making policy recommendations to the
Board and managing the day-to-day activities of the company. Annex 2,
Attachment 1 shows the organizational structure of ELETROBRAS, which is
adequate to serve the company's needs.
- Financing Role
2.05      Because of its function as holding company, financial agency and
development bank for the Brazilian power sector, ELETROBRAS plays a pivotal
role in the development of the sector. It finances projects of subsidiary
and associated companies. ELETROBRAS, thus becomes heavily dependent on
sector based resources for its finances. This tends to make ELETROBRAS'
financial conditions mirror the trends in the finances of the sector.
2.06      ELETROBRAS raises funds from four sources, as follows:
(a) Statutory Resources: ELETROBRAS receives and distributes funds
from two statutory sources, the Compulsory Loan and the Global
Reversion Fund (GRF)(Annex 1, Attachment 1).
(b)  Government Funds.   There are two sources of funding from the
Federal Government, its reinvestment of ELECTROBRAS' dividends and
special appropriations.
(c)  Internally Generated Funds.  Internal sources of funds include
dividends paid on its investments by its subsidiaries and
associated companies and payments of interest and principal from
loans advanced to those companies. In lending from its general
resources, ELETROBRAS requires borrowers to guarantee their loans
with their statutory sole tax quotas (Imposto Unico de Energia
Eletrica - IUEE)(Annex 1, Attachment 1).
(d) Borrowings. ELETROBRAS raises both domestic and foreign currency
loans. Proceeds from these loans are relent or invested in
subsidiaries or associated companies. Annual borrowings targets
for ELETROBRAS are established on a yearly basis and in accordance
with the sector budget approved by SEST.
2.07      Decreasing consumer-based contributions in face of a relatively
heavy 'Lnvestment program, caused ELETROBRAS to increasingly rely on
borrowings (from 4% of total sources in 1973 to an estimated average of 25%
in 1982/84), thus increasing the debt service burden and thereby additionally
eroding its internally generated funds (paras. 5.05 to 5.07). Sector
financial projections forecast a reversal of such deteriorating trend (paras.
5.08 to 5.11). This reversal and a subsequent progressive improvement is
based upon the November 1983 agreement on tariffs and target rates of
remuneration and the implementation of a financial rehabilitation program for
the sector (para.5.12) to be agreed with the Government and ELETROBRAS during
negotiations of the proposed loan.



- Planning and Budgeting
2.08      ELETROBRAS has long been at the center of sector technical and
financial planning, both in the short-tern through the budgeting process and
in the long-term associated planning. Since 1981, however, ELETROBRAS'
responsibility for the budgetary process has been reduced with the
centralizing of decision-making in SEST (an agency of the Secretariat of
Planning). Besides budgeting and related financial planning ELETROBRAS has
primary responsibility for the coordination of medium and long-term planning
in the power sector and preparation of system expansion plans (para. 1.11).
Planning functions are carried out satisfactorily.
- Training and Staff Relations
2.09      ELETROBRAS' staff is competent and well trained.  At the present
time some difficulties in recruiting and maintaining staff exist because, in
order to fight inflation, ceilings for salaries of top management of
government-run entities have been estaolished and salary increases have not
kept up with inflation. The Federal Government has established a zero-growth
rate in the number of personnel of ELETROBRAS. With these constraints in
salary levels and number of personnel, ELETROBRAS will be obliged to improve
the productivity of its staff.
2.10      ELETROBRAS has a comprehensive and updated training program,
for personnel of Brazilian power utilities conducted by capable staff, that
also benefits its own staff members. This training program has been extended
to other South American power companies, members of the Regional Electric
Interconnection Comimission (CIER).
- Accounting and Auditing
2.11      The accounting system of ELETROBRAS is satisfactory and well suited
to ELETROBRAS' needs. Internal control functions are vested in the Internal
Auditing Department which reports to the President. Internal Audit carries
an adequate program of financial audits and follow-up on past recommend-
ations. ELETROBRAS employs as its external auditors the firm Boucinhas,
Campos and Claro Ltda. which is acceptable to the Bank. In addition, the
Fiscal Council, appointed by the Shareholders' meeting, carries out external
control duties in accordance with Brazilian legislation.
- Prior Bank Lending
2.12      The proposed operation would be the seventh loan to ELETROBRAS.1/
Except for its participation as one of the executing agencies of the Electric
Power System Coordination Project (SINSC) under Loan 1939-BR and small
components of studies and training under Loans 1300-BR, 1939-BR and 2365-BR,
ELETROBRAS has acted basically as a financing agency to channel the resources
to the executing agencies, beneficiaries of the loans. No PPAR on these
1/ 1300-BR (05/76); 1538-BR (05/78); 1939-BR (01/82); 2138-BR (05/82);
2364-BR (12/83); 2365-BR (12/83).



- 12 -
loans has yet been issued. ELETROBRAS' performance has been satisfactory in all
operations. In two of them (2138-BR and 2364-BR), ELETROBRAS' role was expanded
as the Bank delegated its functions of appraisal and supervision of the
beneficiaries. It is still too early to make an assessment of ELETROBRAS'
performance under this system.
The Beneficiaries
2.13      ELETROBRAS would on-lend about US$113.2 million from the proposed loan,
to Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF) and about US$286.8 million
to Furnas-Centrais Eletricas S.A. (FURNAS).
CHESF
- Background
2.14      CHESF was established in 1948; in 1962 became a subsidiary of ELETROBRAS
charged with the responsibility for the generation and transmission of electric
power in the Northeastern region of Brazil (paras. 3.03 to 3.06). CHESF's equity
as of December 30, 1984 is estimated at Cr$ 4.187 billion (about US$S54Omillion);
ELETROBRAS owns about 99.2% of the shares.
- Organization
2.15      CHESF is administered by an Administrative Council and a Board of
Directors. The Administrative Council comprises 3 members selected by the
shareholders from the Directors of ELETROBRAS for a 3-year period. The
Administrative Council is responsible for general policy formulation within the
company. The Board of Directors, which is charged with managing the operations of
the company, comprises a president and six directors (Engineering; Construction;
Operations; Administration; Supplies; and Economy and Finances) each elected to a
3-year term by the Administrative Council. Each board member also serves as
executive head of an operating department. In addition, a Fiscal Council,
consisting of 3 members elected by the shareholders general assembly to a one-year
term, approves the company's finances. In October 1983 the company had about
11,150 employees, which is reasonable considering the characteristics of its
service area. The company's organizational structure, which is shown in Annex 2,
Attachment 2, is sound.
- Management Systems
2.16      CHESF's financial planning, budgeting and management reporting systems
are satisfactory. Annual budgets and financial forecasts covering a period of 8
years are prepared and updated periodically. Accounting and billing are
satisfactory and well suited to the utility's needs. Training programs and
facilities are satisfactory; the Paulo Afonso Training Center provides permanent
training services which have been extended to other Brazilian and South American
power utilities; future needs are being addressed through a training program
included in the proposed Bank-financed project (paras. 4.07 (a)(iii) and 4.15).
Internal control functions are satisfactory, under the internal audit unit, which
carries out operational internal auditing and follows-up on past recommendations.



- 13 -
CHESF's financial accounts have been audited annually by the firm of Boucinhas,
Campos and Claro Ltda. which is acceptable to the Bank. The provision in existing
agreements requiring CHESF to have its accounts audited by external auditors
satisfactory to the Bank and to submit audited financial statements to the Bank
not later than four months after the end of each fiscal year would be repeated in
the proposed loan.
- Insurance
2.17      CHESF's insurance practices are poor and a program for improvement
should be formulated and implemented. Insurance is contracted based on historical
values instead of replacement cost without monetary correction. Fire insurance
coverage over historical values has averaged 30% in 1983 and 40% in 1984;
compensations are usually paid after long delays (6 months) with no monetary
correction or indexation. As this seems to be the case in other utilities of the
ELETROBRAS Group, a task force has already been created within the ELETROBRAS
Group to deal with insurance policy, management and other related matters and
recommend a consistent approach. By addressing this issue the Bank would be
supporting the Government efforts to improve the reliability of the electric
supply and to strengthen sound public utility practices. During negotiations,
ELETROBRAS and CHESF agreed to carry out a comprehensive study on insurance
requirements under terms-of-reference satisfactory to the Bank. The study should
be completed by June 30, 1986 and its recommendations implemented starting January
1987, after holding discussions with the Bank.
- Prior Bank Lending
2.18      The Bank has made three previous loans to CHESF, two directly and one
through ELETROBRAS for a total of US$118 million. The first, US$15 million made
in 1950, was to finance the first two 60 MW hydroelectric generating plants on the
Sao Francisco river. This project was successfully completed on schedule with
minimal cost overruns. The second, US$81 million was made in 1974 to finance
transmission lines associated with the Paulo Afonso IV hydro electric project.
Because of design changes execution of this project was delayed by about a year;
however, the project was satisfactorily completed in 1982. The third Bank loan of
US$22 million was made in 1980, to finance CHESF's load dispatch center,
telecommunication systems and related training. The project has overcome
technical problems and is now proceeding reasonably well; completion is now
estimated to be thirty months longer than expected at appraisal. In general
CHESF's performance has been adequate.
FURNIAS
- Background
2.19      FURNAS, an autonomous Government corporation, was established in 1957
and is the largest subsidiary of ELETROBRAS. FURNAS is a bulk producer and sells
only to other utilities at wholesale. It is a major supplier for the Rio de
Janeiro and Sao Paulo market, the most inhabited and developed area of Brazil
(paras. 3.07 to 3.10). FURNAS' total equity as of December 31, 1984 is estimated
at Cr$. 4720 billion (about US$1750 million); ELETROBRAS owns 99.2% of the shares.



- 14 -
- Organization
2.20      FURNAS is administered by a Board appointed by the Government, comprised
of a President and five Executive Directors, who also are heads of the Departments
of Engineering, Planning and Construction; Operations; Administration and
Contracts; Finance; and Nuclear Generation. Additionally, the shareholders
general assembly annually elects a 3-member Fiscal Council to review and approve
the financial operations. In June 1984, FURNAS' staff was about 9,100 employees,
which is reasonable and is adequately distributed among its major departments.
The organizational structure of the company is sound and is shown in Annex 2,
Attachment 3.
- Management Systems
2.21      FURNAS' financial planning, budgeting and reporting systems are
satisfactory as well as accounting and billing. Annual budgets and financial
forecast for 8-year periods are prepared and updated periodically. As in the
other companies of the ELETROBRAS Group, training programs and facilities are
satisfactory; FURNAS has five main Training Centers in FURNAS, Marimbondo, Angra,
Santa Cruz and Jacarepagua carrying out permanent training programs;future needs
are being addressed through a training program included in the proposed
Bank-financed project (paras. 4.07 (b)(iii) and 4.15). FURNAS has a well-staffed
internal audit group (including inter alia engineers, economists and lawyers),
reporting to the Finance Director through the Superintendent of Internal Control,
which carries out analytical and operational internal audits. The audit
programs covering most of the company's operations seem to be satisfactory; the
group also performs follow-up functions on past recommendations. The annual
financial statements have been audited by Boucinhas, Campos and Claro Ltda., an
independent auditing firm acceptable to the Bank. The provision on existing
agreements requiring FURNAS to have its accounts audited by external auditors
satisfactory to the Bank and to submit audited financial statements to the Bank no
later than four months after the end of each fiscal year would be repeated in the
proposed loan. Insurance policies and management appear to be adequate and in
accordance with accepted public utility practices.
- Prior Bank Lending
2.22      The Bank has made six previous loans to FURNAS for a total of US$396.3
million. All previous loans have helped to finance hydroelectric plants and/or
related transmission systems, which were completed satisfactorily and are in
operation. (a) first: Loan 211-BR (1958) for US$73 million for the 900 MW FURNAS
plant; (b) second: Loan 403-BR (1965) for US$57 million for the 1050 MW Estreito
plant; (c) third: Loan 474-BR (1966) for US$39 million for the Estreito
Transmission lines; (d) fourth: Loan 565-BR (1968) for US$22.3 million for the 360
MW Porto Colombia plant; (e) fifth: Loan 677-BR (1970) for US$80 million for the
1400 MW Marimbondo plant and associated transmission and 300 MW of additional
capacity in the FURNAS Plant; and (e) sixth: Loan 923-BR for US$125 million for
the 2080 MW Itumbiara plant and associated transmission.
2.23      Three FURNAS' Bank-financed operations have been reviewed by OED, and
distributed to the Executive Directors. Such reports conclude that Bank financing
had been successful in assisting the utility to develop power projects. The



- 15 -
Estreito performance audit report, including loans 404-BR and 474-BR, indicates
inter alia that: (a) FURNAS' institutional performance was satisfactory; (b) the
projects were completed on schedule; and (c) loan covenants were complied with.
The Marimbondo performance audit report (Loan 677-BR) concludes mainly that:
(a) utility institutional performance was fully satisfactory; (b) the financial
performance was satisfactory through 1975; thereafter, the decline in tariffs in
real terms made financial performance less than satisfactory; (c) although the
project was implemented a little behind schedule and with 11% cost overrun, the
unit cost of the hydro plant (US$128/kW in 1969 prices) was lower than unit cost
of the average hydro plant in Brazil at that time; and (d) loan covenants were
complied with.

3. THE POWER MARKET
Introduction
3.01      The market studies carried out by the beneficiaries follow the
methodologies established by the Technical Committee for Market Studies
coordinated by ELETROBRAS, and are consistent with the studies used by the
corresponding technical groups, responsible for the long and medium term
planning of the power sector.
3.02      The power sector is now projecting an annual rate of growth for
total electric energy requirements in the country of 7.5% for 1984-1992,
which is lower than observed in the past decade (10%). This projection has
been discussed with the Bank and was found to be reasonable (para. 1.10).
Historical market information, demand projections, and energy balances for
the two beneficiaries are discussed below.
Historic Power Market
CHIESF
3.03      CHESF supplies electricity to the eight North-Eastern states of
Brazil: Alagoas, Bahia, Ceara, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Piaui, Rio Grande do
Norte and Sergipe and during 1984 also to the nothern states of Maranhao and
Para. Its concession covers an area of about 1,220,000 km2 (15% of the
Brazilian territory) with a population of approximately 33 million
inhabitants (26% of the country's total population). The North-Eastern
region's yearly consumption and installed capacity amounts to about 765
kWh/inhabitant (compared to 1,100 kWh/inhabitant for the country) and to
about 185 watts/inhabitant (308 watts/inhabitant for Brazil as a whole)
respectively.
3.04      CHASF provided almost 100% of the electricity consumed in the area
of its concession through bulk sales at high voltage (RV) levels to eight
state-owned utilities; to two municipal companies; and to twelve large
industrial consumers which are directly connected to CHESF's 230kV system.
Its 1984 sales to the northern states of Maranhao and Para were about 65Z of
their total consumption.
3.05      CHESF's total electricity sales increased at an average annual rate
of about 11.6% between 1980 and 1984. During the same period, maximum demand
increased at an average annual rate of 7.0%. Annex 3, Table 3.1 illustrates
in detail the evolution of CHESP's electricity sales and power requirements.
A summary for 1980 and 1984 is given below:
Average Annual
1980           1984           Increase
Sales                    GWh                Wh    X            Z
Total Sales                   15,366  92.4    24,269  94.0          12.1
Transmission Losses            1,191   7.1      1,346   5.2          3.1
CHESF's own consumption           84   0.5        214   0.8         26.3
Total Requirements            16,641 100.0    25,826 100.0          11.6
Maximum Demand (MW)            2,963    -       3,887    -           7.0



- 17 -
3.06      The composition of CHESF's electricity sales has not changed
substantially during the period 1980-1984. Industrial consumers decreased
their share from 56% of CHESF total sales In 1980 to 53% in 1984.  Losses in    ' 
CHESF transmission and transformation system have decreased fron  7.2% of               ,'
CHESF total requirements in 1980 to 5.2% in 1984 due to the installation of
voltage and power factor compensating equipment.  During 1984 the structure
of electricity sales by categories in the North-Eastern market was as
follows:  Residential 21X, Industrial 53%, Commercial 11% and others 15%
(government, irrigation, public lighting).
FURNAS
3.07      FURNAS supplies electricity to the four Southeastern states of
Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro; to the two
Central-Western states of Mato Grosso do Norte and Goias; and to the city of
Brasilia (Federal District). The area served by FURNAS, known as the
Southeast and Central-Western Interconnected System, has an extension of
about 1,330,000 km2 (16% of the Brazilian territory) with a population of
about 62 million inhabitants (48% of the country's total population).
FURNAS' concession has a yearly consumption of about 1,590 kWh/inhabitant and
its installed capacity amounts to about 409 watts/inhabitant.
3.08      Electricity consumption in the area of concession served by FURNAS,
where the largest distribution companies of the country are located,
represents about 70% of the total consumption in Brazil. FURNAS supplies
about 32% of the electricity consumed in the above area (the balance is
supplied by: CEMIG-15%, CESP and ELETROPAULO-49% and others-40%)
through bulk sales at high voltage (HV) levels to five state-owned utilities;
to three utilities owned by the ELETROBRAS group; to one municipal company;
and to one private undertaking.
3.09      The electricity requirements of the Southeast and Central-Western
Interconnected System increased at an average annual rate of 5.6% between
1980 and 1984, while maximum demand increased at an average annual rate of
5.1% during the same period. During 1984, the structure of electricity
consumption in the above system was as follows: residential 21%, industrial
55Z, commercial 12%, and others 12%. Annex 3, Table 3.2 illustrates in
detail the variations of the Southeast and Central-Western System. A summary
for 1980 and 1984 is shown below:

3.10      FURNAS total electricity requirements increased at an average
annual rate of about 5.8% between 1980 and 1984.  During the same period,



- 18 -
maximum demand on FURNAS' generating plants increased at an annual average
rate of about 7.3%. Annex 3, table 3.3 illustrates in detail the variations
of FURNAS sales and power requirements. A summary for 1980 and 1984 is shown
below:
Average Annual

Existing Power Facilities
3.11      CHESF has a total installed capacity of 6,076 MW of which 93% is
hydroelectric (5,644 MW) and the balance 432 MW or 7%, is oil-fired power
plant (Annex 3, Table 3.4). Currently cHESF's generating facilities cover
the requirements of its concession, and during 1984, it partially covered the
ones of ELETRONORTE system. Electricity is sold in bulk to CHESF consumers
at bigh voltage level through a transmission system currently comprising
12,250 kilometers of transmission lines operating at 500 kV, 230 kV, 138 kV
and 69 kV and 72 substations with an installed transformation capacity of
16,070 MVA. The map included in Annex 8 detail3 CHESF's power system and its
area of concession.
3.12      FURNIAS has an installed capacity of 7,466 MW, of which 6,800 MW or
91Z of the total is hydroelectric and the rest, 666 MW, is oil-fired power
plant (Annex 3, Table 3.4). Additionally a nuclear power generating plant,
Angra I with a capacity of 626 MW, is under commissioning tests.  FURNAS
generating facilities supply about 32% of the requirements of its concession.
FURNAS delivers electricity to its customers through a transmission system
which includes transmission lines of 750 kV (568 km), 500 kV (2,257 km). 345
kV (5,205 km), 230 kV (758 km) and 138 kV (1,923 km).  Additionally, it
operates 30 substations with a total transformation capacity of 17,000 MVA
(see map included in Annex 9).
3.13      Both CHESF and FURNAS have historically operated and maintained the
above facilities efficiently as reflected in the level of losses and
efficiency indicators (paras. 3.20 and 4.14). However, during the last two
years (1983 and 1984) there have been indications that CHESF and FURNAS
systems' reliability and quality of supply might be worsening as system power
outages became more frequent and some transmission lines and transformers
operated above their nominal capacity. This is a consequence of several
postponements in the investments required for constructing new power
facilities because of the serious financial constraints affecting the
Brazilian power sector. The proposed project, described in detail in para.
4.07, addresses this problem.
Future Power Market
3.14      The Brazilian power utilities prepare market forecast employing
unified methodological guidelines which were issued in 1976 by the



- 19 -
Departamento Nacional de Aguas e Energia (DNAEE). The Bank has reviewed
these guidelines and found them reasonable. The power market forecast of the
Southeast and Central-Western system, CHESF and FURNAS for the period
1984-1992 were prepared on the basis of moderate targets on expanding
electricity coverage to the population, realistic assumptions in relation to
the possibility of implementing large industrial projects, reduction of peak
demand through application of-time-of-day tariffs, and modest increseas
in electricity consumption due to energy substitution. Market projections for
the above systems were jointly made by ELETROBRAS and the corresponding
subsidiaries, as well as the distribution companies based on comprehensive
analyses of: (i) extrapolation of historical electricity consumption trends;
(ii) econometric correlation between electricity consumption and
socio-economic indicators (income, population), and (iii) evolution of
existing and future industrial loads. The forecasts for consumption in the
areas served by CHESF and FURNAS are adequate and they are consistent with
the power market projections for the country as a whole and expected economic
growth in the regions served by them (para. 1.10).  The requirements and
sales forecast for these areas are summarized below.
3.15      CHESF's total electricity requirements, including transmission
losses and its own consumption, are expected to increase from 25,829 GWh in
1984 to 44,713 GWh in 1992 at an average annual rate of about 7.1%. This
growth is somewhat lower than the Brazilian sector projections for the same
period (about 7.5%). System load factor, estimated at 76Z in 1984, is not
expected to change substantially by 1992. Details of the energy and power
demand forecast are given in Annex 3, Table 3.1. A summary for 1984 and 1992
is included below:
Average Annual

3.16      The composition of CHESF's electricity sales is not expected to
change substantially during the period 1984-1992 as shown in the above table
and the table included in paragraph 3.05 which illustrates the structure of
CHESF sales during 1980-1984.
3.17      The electricity requirements of the Southeast and Central-Western
Interconnected System, which in 1992 is expected to represent about 58Z of
the total requirements in Brazil (as compared to 70% in 1984 - para. 3.08)
are expected to grow during the period 1984-1992 at an average annual rate of
about 5.9%. This growth is lower than the 1985-1992 national average of 7.5%
due to greater saturation of the electricity market in this area which is
more developed than the rest of Brazil. Details of the above forecast and
the one for the sales of the distribution companies serving this area are
included in Annex 3, table 3.2 and table 3.5 respectively. A summary for the
years 1984 and 1992 is given below:

3.18      FURNAS will be called upon to increase its share of supply in the
Southeast and Central-Western system. It will be marketing, starting in
1985, the bulk of the electricity to become available from Itaipu
hydroelectric plant (para. 3.19). FURNAS will supply by 1992 about 66% of
the electricity consumed in the area of its concession (32X in 1984).
Details of FURNAS forecast are included in Annex 3, table 3.3.  A summry for
1984 and 1992 is given below:

3.19      In 1980 DNAEE, ELETROBRAS, FURNAS and ELETROSUL agreed to market
the electricity to become available from the Itaipu hydroelectric plant (now
being commissioned). FURNAS and ELETROSUL will purchase all the energy
available from Itaipu Binacional which in turn will be sold at bulk to the
different distribution companies located in their respective areas of
concession. This agreement also stipulates that the allocation 3/ of the
energy generated at the Itaipu hydroplant will have priority over the
allocation of the energy produced at the existing plants. As a result,
FURNAS electricity purchases, mainly from Itaipu Binancional, are expected to
grow at an average annual rate of about 62% between 1984 and 1992. FURNAS'
sales to CESP and ELETROPAULO and to CEMIG are expected to increase
3/ All the energy available from Itaipu is to be allocated proportionally to
the consumption of the different systems to which it is interconnected:
South, Southeast, and Central-Western.

substantially between 1984 and 1992 at an average annual rate of about
22.6Z and 32.2%, respectively. System load factor, estimated at 56Z in
1984, is expected to increase to 68% by 1992.
Transmission Losses
3.20      In 1984, CHESF and FURNAS transmission and transformation losses
amounted to 1,346 GWh (5.8Z of total requirements) and to 1,087 GWh (3.2Z
of total requirements) respectively. By 1992 losses are expected to amount
to 5.5% (CHESF) and to 3.9% (FURNAS) of their total requirements
respectively. These levels are acceptable and they are in line with
commonly accepted levels for utilities in developed countries4/1
Energy and Capacity Balances
3.21      CHESF and ELETROBRAS have prepared annual energy and capacity
balances for CHESF system and for the Southeast and Central-Western
Interconnected System respectively.  These balances take due consideration
of the corresponding power market requirements, existing power availability
(both from their own systems and the ones to which they are interconnected)
and the commissioning of future plant additions. The results of the
simulation studies (details of which are included in Annex 3, tables 3.6
and 3.7) indicate that CHESF and the Southeast and Central-Western
Interconnected System will meet their corresponding power market
requirements (energy and capacity) during 1985-1992 through the
availability of their existing and projected power generating stations and
the purchases from ELETRONORTE (in the case of CHESF) with adequate margins
of reserve both during years with dry and average hydrological conditions.
The methodology and the results of CHESF's and ELETROBRAS' simulation
studies are considered satisfactory.
4/ In complex transmission networks, like the ones installed in USA,
Canada, France and Australia, losses vary between 3% and 5%.

4. THE PROGRAMS AND PROJECT
The Programs
4.01      The 1984-1992 Development Programs of CHESF and FURNAS (which are
an integral part of the Brazilian Sectoral Plan) were prepared taking into
consideration the scarcity of their financial resources. These programs
provide minimum investments required to supply electricity to the final user
with levels of reliability which, although lower than the reliability levels
traditionally used in the sector for planning purposes, are still considered
acceptable. Both expansion programs and the corresponding investment
requirements are considered adequate and they are consistent with the power
sector development program prepared by ELETROBRAS and reviewed by the Bank.
4.02      CHESF's and FURNAS' investments in generation are addressed to
completing ongoing construction and starting additional works to provide
energy needed after 1990. Investments in transmission would complete
transmission networks required to transfer the energy generated at projects
which will be completed soon and to construct high priority lines.
Details of these programs are included in Annex 4, Tables 4.1 and 4.2.
CHESF
4.03      In line with the premises described in the above paragraphs, the
generation program of CHESF required to meet the expected energy requirements

The Project
4.07      The project proposed for Bank financing was defined based on the
priorities established in a comprehensive review of the power sector
requirements which was carried out by ELETROBRAS and the Bank. The
implementation of the transmission works included in CHESP and FURNAS
sub-projects have a very high priority in the context of the power sector's
present needs. The project consists of high voltage (HV) transmission lines
and substations which have been defined and selected on the basis of: (l)
current demand projections; and (ii) the development plan for the period
1985-1992. It consists of works urgently required to supply future demand
with minimum but acceptable levels of quality and reliability. Details of
the physical works and services included in the proposed project are given in
Annex 4, Tables 4.3 and 4.4 and maps. A summary of them is included below:
(a)    Part A: CHESF

4.09      The project costs were prepared by the planning and construction
staff of CHESF and FURNAS. The above costs were estimated on the basis of
detailed designs and comprehensive bill of materials and equipment utilizing
price levels prevailing in December 1984. They reflect prices for equipment
and materials as well as for installation and similar construction contracts
recently awarded by FURNAS and CHESP. Costs include taxes and import duties
as applicable and they amount to about 10% of these costs. The above
estimates are considered reasonable. Physical contingencies were calculated
at about 10% of the base costs, which is appropriate given the nature of
works and the degree of accuracy of the above base estimates.
4.10      Price contingencies were calculated using the following annual
escalation rates applied to the basic costs and physical contingencies: 5%
for 1985; 7.5% for 1986; 8% for 1987-1990; and 5% for 1991 and 1992. It was
assumed that the exchange rate devaluation would reflect the difference
between internal and external inflation.

The proposed Bank loan includes US$80.5 million (US$22.8 million
corresponding to CHESF and US$57.7 million corresponding to FURNAS) to
finance up to February 14, 1990 the interest during construction and other
charges in order to alleviate the heavy financial burden imposed on the
beneficiaries and ELETROBRAS by the implementation of the ongoing expansion
program and the present limited access to other financing. The contribution
of the beneficiaries has been calculated including ELETROBRAS' support of
debt service through conversion of debt into equity and financing of interest
during construction.
Project Supervision and Implementation
4.12      CHESF's and FURNAS' engineering departments are preparing the final
engineering designs and bidding documents for the purchase of equipment,
materials, and construction works. Both utilities are utilizing (as required)
specialized services from consulting engineering firms and/or specialized
individual experts currently under contract with CHESF and FURNAS. The
technical staff of both utilities are very competent and it is expected that
project final design and procurement documents would be prepared adequately.



- 27 -
4.13      Construction works would be carried out simultaneously in several
states. In accordance to established practices, both CHESF and FURNAS are
likely to contract regional-based contractors for construction works (para.
4.19), which have vast experience in these type of works. Installation of
very large and/or sophisticated equipment would be done by the suppliers
under the supervision of CHESF and FURNAS respectively. Installation of
other equipment such as control, protection and distribution panels, required
for substation cuntrol rooms would be carried out by force account. Both
installation of equipme it and construction works would be under the su-
pervision or the corresponding construction departments of the beneficia-
ries. With the above arrangements, it is expected that the project would be
adequately completed, as demonstrated in the successful implementation of
very complex ongoing projects (Itaipu and Itaparica/Paulo Afonso transmission
systems).
4.14      Procurement, manufacturing, installation and construction of the
different works included in the project are expected to be carried out during
the period May 1985-December 1990.   The corresponding key dates are sum-
marized below:
Activity                                         Period
- Issuance of bidding documents                       May 1985 - February 1988
- Contract awards                                     November 1985-October 1988
- Construction and/or Manufacturing starts            March 1986 - August 1988
- Commissioning of works                              December 1987-December 1990
Project execution will be monitored against target dates included in the
project Implementation schedule shown in Annex 4, Tables 4.5 and 4.6.
At negotiations, agreement was reached with CHESF and FURNAS on the
performance indicators which are to be used to monitor CHESF and FURNAS
operational, financial and managerial performance. They are included in
Annex 4, Tables 4.7 and 4.8 and Annex 5, Tables 5.5 and 5.10.
4.15 The proposed training programs of CHESF and FURNAS, to be financed
partially with the Bank loan, would be implemented during the period
1985-1991. Both CHESF and FURNAS submitted comprehensive training master
plans for the period 1985-1991 for Bank review. Details of these programs
are included in Annex 4, Attachment 4.1. At negotiations agreement was
reached with CHESF and FURNAS: (i) on the contents of their 1985-1991
Training Master Plans; and (ii) that at the beginning of each year, CHESF and
FURNAS will submit detailed annual training programs for Bank review.

At negotiations agreement was reached with CHESF and FURNAS that they will
submit for Bank review all the corresponding procurement documentation
(advertisement, bidding documents, bid evaluation reports and contracts)
before their formal issuance and/or confirmation. Given the nature of the
different components of the project (Extra High Voltage equipment) it is
expected that less than half of the value in the contract for equipment and
materials would be awarded to Brazilian suppliers.
4.18      The proceeds of the Bank loan would finance items such as power
transformers, reactor and capacitor banks, substation ancillary equipment,
conductors and support materials for transmission lines and substations.
These items would be procured under international competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures in accordance to Bank guidelines. The Bank would also finance



- 30 -
items such as training and laboratory equipment and scholarships. Limited
international bidding (LIB) in accordance to Bank guidelines would be
appropriate for contracts exclusively related to the purchase of training and
laboratory equipment, each contract not exceeding US$200,000, and estimated
not to exceed US$2,000,000 in total. Training experts would be contracted in
accordance with Bank procedures. Financing of scholarships and related
expenses (included in the training program) would be made through the
corresponding reimbursement of foreign exchange currency expenses. For
contracts to be financed with proceeds of the Bank loan, local bids which
contain value added of Brazilian manufacture equal to at least 50% of the
ex-factory price, will be given a margin of preference equivalent of 15%, or
the applicable import duties, whichever is the lower.
4.19     Construction contracts would be awarded among Brazilian contractors
as the Government and sector authorities have decided to reserve procurement
of construction works for local firms. Similarly, the supply of equipment
such dS control, protection and carrier panels, which are to be installed at
new substations, would be made by Brazilian manufacturers as existing
Brazilian legislation precludes ICB for these items. For purposes of
determining the loan amount, the estimated cost of reserved procurement,
US$152.0 million (CHESF: US$64.8 million and FURNAS: US$87.2 million), was
excluded from total project costs, and the indirect foreign exchange costs
corresponding to this reserved procurement, US$29.1 million (CHESF: US$11.1
million and FURNAS: US$18.0 million), are not financed by the Bank loan.
This type of procurement is not expected to affect the economy and efficiency
of the project because: (i) it would be awarded after competition amongst a
sufficient number of well qualified local contractors and suppliers; and (ii)
construction prices in Brazil are in general competitive and comparable with
current international prices for this type of works.
4.20      Other miscellaneous items to be financed also by CHESF and FURNAS,
such as: (i) control, protection and carrier panels (which are either
required in very discreet quantities or because standardization aspects)
included in the expansion and/or upgrading of existing substations; and (ii)
miscellaneous equipment and materials (such as control cables, conduits,
distribution panels) required for substation control rooms; wou'ld be procured
under local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank, because in
the above cases this is considered to be the most economic and efficient
method. The procurement arrangements mentioned in paragraphs 4.16 through
4.20 are adequate.
Disbursements
4.21      The proposed Bank loan is expected to be disbursed over a period of
seven years. The disbursement schedule reflects applicable IBRD standard
disbursement profiles which are based on the Bank's experience in similar
projects. The disbursement schedule is included in Annex 4, Table 4.9.
Proceeds from the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against expenditures,
which should be submitted to the Bank fully documented for contracts valued
more than US$1,000,000 equivalent. Other expenditures would be disbursed
against statement of expenditures. The above proceeds would be applied to:



_ 31 _
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported goods, or 100% of the
ex-factory cost for local goods, both financed by the Bank and
purchased through Bank ICB and LIB procedures;
(b) 1002 of foreign expenditures for scholarships and related
expenditures;
(c) 100% of expenditures for contracting training experts, and
(d) interest and other charges during construction on the Bank loan
through February 14, 1990 up to US$80.5 million.
To reduce the interval during which both CHESF and FURNAS would finance with
their own resources, items which are to be financed by the Bank loan, a
Special Account would be opened with the Central Bank for payment to local
suppliers. At negotiations agreement was reached with CHESF and FURNAS that
such account will amount to USS10 million. Withdrawals of the account will
be made at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the
expenditures. Replenishment of the Special Account would be made in
accordance to standard Bank procedures. The closing date will be December
31, 1991.
Environmental Aspects
4.22      CHESF's and FURNAS' sub-projects do not present major problems.
Most of the transmission lines will be constructed utilizing existing
right-of-ways as they are additional circuits (but to be constructed in
independent structures) to existing transmission lines. For transmission
lines connecting new consumption centers, line routes are considerably
distant from urban centers. Most of the substation works are extensions to
existing ones, therefore not presenting any additional environmental or
aesthetic problems. The new substations would be constructed with due regard
to environmental and aesthetic criteria in accordance wich prevailing
Brazilian regulations. The beneficiaries of the proposed loar will
compensate property owners as required by the national legisl&tion. Clearing
of right-of-way would be kept to a minimum and natural drainage patterns are
not expected to be affected.
Project Risks
4.23      The project faces no special physical risks. ELETROBRAS, CHESF and
FURNAS have been adversely affected by the financial problems of the power
sector. These problems are being addressed through a program of tariff
increases and cost reduction measures already agreed in the context of
existing operations with the sector (para 5.12); and the proposed project
(Chapter 7). Failure to implement or insufficient action on the above
matters could however, negatively affect institutional performance and/or
result in program and project delays.

5. FINANCES
Introduction
5.01      The present legal structure of sector finances is such that it is
fundamental to analyze the overall sector finances in order to interpret
adequately the finances of individual utilities. A system of financial
communicating channels has been established through the tariff and rate of
remuneration equalization scheme (Annex 1, Attachment 1, para. 2 (d)), and
the most significant financial decisions are in the hands of the Federal
Government, with little participation of the State Governments and the
utilities.
5.02      The equalization scheme for tariffs and rates of remuneration is
implemented through the Global Guarantee Fund (RGG), a mechanism by which
companies with a rate of remuneration higher than the sector average make
payments to the RGG whereas companies with a rate of remuneration lower
than the sector average receive funds from the RGG, so as to equalize the
individual and the sector rates of remuneration. The Federal Government:
(i) through DNAEE, approves the operating costs of the individual utilities
and establishes the contributions to and the allocation of RGG resources;
(ii) sets the levels of the reversion tax and, through ELETROBRAS,
allocates its resources, and (iii) through the Ministry of Planning, sets
tariff levels, investment ceilings and availability of financing for each
utility.
5.03      The proposed loan has been prepared within the context of a
sector financial rehabilitation program (para. 5.12). The program
objectives are to assist the power sector, during particularly difficult
times, to carry out high priority investments in the context of the sector
present needs. Assistance through the proposed project is justified by the
efforts that are being made by the Government and the utilities through
such a financial rehabilitation program, to address the problems facing the
sector. This program has sector-wide scope, it includes measures that
would positively affect the finances of the beneficiaries and constitutes a
suitable basis to improve progressively the financial performance of the
utilities in order to enable them to carry out satisfactorily the proposed
project and the other works of their investment programs.
5.04      Consequently, this chapter presents a description of sector
finances followed by a description of the finances of the two bene-
ficiaries. The conditions resulting from the assumptions on which the
sector projections are based are given in detail after the sector financing
plan. In the case of the benef;ciaries projections, each one shows the
need of additional funding (para. 5.19 (a)(i) and (b)(ii)).



- 33 -
Power Sector
- Historical Performance
5.05      In the early 1960's, the establishment of the new structure for
sector organization - which included (i) ELETROBRAS as the federally owned
holding company, (ii) ELETROBRAS subsidiaries as entities primarily
responsible for regional generation and transmission, and (iii) state
utilities as entities primarily responsible for distribution - was part of a
general scheme to make the power sector an important contributing factor to
Brazil's economic development. The corresponding policies included the
setting of realistic tariff levels and adequate equity contributions in face
of an ambitious investment program which would satisfy the national
electricity requirements.
5.06      As a result of these tariff policies, the consumer based fund
generation and its contribution to the growing investment program increased
steadily through the mid 1970's, at which time the sector reached a peak of
financial soundness. In 1973, the net (after debt service) consumer based
fund generation had a share of 56Z in the sector's funding mix whereas
borrowings had a share of only 30Z, the rest being equity contributions.
Coincidentally with such peak in sector financial soundness the sector
initi2ted an even more ambitious investment program which included three
major generating schemes: the Itaipu (12,600 MW) and Tucurui (7,600 MW)
hydroelectric projects, ;.nd the nuclear program. The heavy investment
program in non-oil-fueled generating schemes became more justifiable because
of the oil crisis. The oil crisis of the mid 1970's also created 'a different
set of financial conditions for the Brazilian power sector: (i) inflation
affected substantially the unit costs of the investment program; and (ii) the
Government's fight against inflation resulted in a deterioration of real
tariff levels and of the consumer-based contribution to the investment
program. As a consequence of these conditions, the sector became
increasingly dependent on borrowings.
5.07      The increasing dependency on borrowings - compounded by
increasingly harder lending terms - created a heavy debt service burden for
the sector in the late 1970's and early 1980's. In 1983, the sector's debt
service was, for the first time, greater than the consumer based fund
generation, thus resulting in a negative self-financing ratio for the sector
investment program.
- Forecast
5.08      To reverse the deteriorating trend in sector finances, in September
1981 the Brazilian Government and the Bank agreed on a program of real
electricity tariff increases of 3% p.a. in 1982 and 5% p.a. thereafter, until
a 10% rate of remuneration is achieved and shortfalls in remuneration are
recuperated (the sector average rates of remuneration for 1981-1984 were
7.7%, 6.1%, 5.1% and 5.0%). In November 1983 this agreement was amended and
both parties agreed on a program of tariff action and other measures to
increase the sector's rate of remuneration by one percentage point each year



- 34 -
and reach in 1989 the 10% established by Brazilian legislation. Even though
the success of the sector's financial rehabilitation plan lies basically on
this assumption - which would significantly enhance the consumer based fund
generation - two other conditions are equally important to ensure such
success:
(i)  rationalization and curtailment of the sector investment program
through a greater emphasis on transmission/distribution development
in order to balance the heavy generation investments made in the
past, and no-growth in investments until 1988; and
(ii)  reduction of the indebtedness pressure on sector finances through
an improvement in the deat profile and a decreasing reliance on
borrowings as a source of financing.
5.09      As provided by the 1983 agreement, the Brazilian Government and the
Bank will hold in January 1986, a meeting to agree on the measures necessary
to achieve the annual rate of remuneration targets agreed upon in November
1983. Those measures will most likely include actions to increase the level
and to modify the structure of electricity tariffs. The average electricity
price level in Brazil is low, both on financial and economic grounds, and
needs to be increased to improve the sector's finances and the country's
internal savings. The tariff structure has been disrupted in the last few
years through a series of special tariffs, basically for oil substitution and
export promotion, which are a fraction of the already low normal industrial
tariffs. Under these conditions, neither the tariff level nor the tariff
structure are conducive to electricity conservation. As a result of this
tariff scheme, during the last few years, electricity consumption grew at
fairly high rates despite a null or low rate of growth in the country's
economy (para. 1.10).
5.10      Based upon the demand projections and Investment Plan discussed in
paras. 1.14 to 1.16, sector financial projections were prepared in mid-1984.
The basic projection assumptions, which are based on the financial
rehabilitation program (para. 5.12), are set forth in Annex 5, Attachment 1,
and the financing plan is summarized below:

5.11      This plan shows that the objective of financial rehabilitation of
the power sector will be attained during the projection period (1984-1988) as
the deteriorating trend in sector finances will be reversed. Even though the
level of sector finances is not satisfactory during the first two-years
(1984-1985) of the projection period, an improvement in the sector's funding



- 36 -
mix will already start at that time as the consumer-based contribution will
increase steadily whereas the reliance on borrowings will decrease and the
sector will reach a high level of financial soundness at the end of the
projection period.
5.12      The main assumptions of the sector financial plan (Annex 5,
Attachment 1) reflect the necessary conditions to rehabilitate the power
sector finances. As part of its justifying rationale, the proposed loan
would support the efforts made by the Government and the sector to attain
such rehabilitation. The main features of the plan are as follows:
(a)  Investment Program and Financial Plan (Paras. 1.14 to 1.16)  Prior
to loan negotiations the Government informed the Bank of its
intentions to carry out the 1984-1988 investment program and
financial plan prepared by ELETROBRAS and found to be acceptable by
the Bank. The Government is now reviewing the Plan to ensure that
it is in line with the national economic program. It has informed
the Bank that by July 1, 1985 it would send to the Bank an approved
1984-1988 Investment Program and Financial Plan. Consequently, the
following agreements were reached with the Government during
negotiations:
i)  as a condition of loan effectiveness the Government would
present to the Bank a satisfactory 1984-1988 investment
program and financial plan, formally approved by the
Government;
(ii) the Governmeut would submit to the Bank by November 30 of each
year an updated five-year investment program and financial
plan, both to be satisfactory to the Bank;
(iii) the Government would carry out the five-year investment
program in accordance with appropriate administrative,
financial, engineering and public utility practices and shall
provide or cause to be provided to the sector the funds and
other resources required in accordance with the provisions in
the five-year financial plan; and
(iv) the Government would take all actions expected to enable the
electric power sector companies to carry out a program
satisfactory to the Bank aimed at reducing over a reasonable
period, the sector's reliance on borrowings.
(b)  Long Run Marginal Cost Study:  During negotiations the Government
agreed to prepare and agree with the Bank during 1985 on a plan of
action to complete implementation by December 1989, the
recommendations of the long-run marginal cost study that is being
financed by the Bank (Loan 1939-BR).



- 37 -
(c)  Itaipu Tariffs: During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government that if tariffs for bulk sale of electricity generated at
Itaipu were to exceed the levels now charged by Brazilian power
suppliers in the South, Southeast and Central-Western regions of Brazil,
the Federal Government would promptly take measures required to offset
cost increases arising from high Itaipu tariffs and to ensure that the
rates of return agreed with the Bank are met.
- CHESF and FURNAS
- Historical Performance
5.13      The circumstances in which the finances of the power sector have
developed since the late 1970s (paras. 5.05 to 5.07) have determined the financial
performance of the two beneficiaries of the proposed loan. CHESF has had operating
results slightly below the sector average and FURNAS above such average. Since
the rates of remuneration of CHESF in 1983 and 1984 5/ are likely to be lower
than the average remuneration for the sector, this could be regarded as a
non-compliance of the November 1983 tariff and remuneration agreement (para.
5.08); since the differences are small, this should not be considered as an
issue. Consequently, no action is recommended to offset the income shortfalls,
especially since the cost-of-service mechanism (as provided by Brazilian
legislation) is expected to eventually compensate for them (accumulated income
shortfalls are incorporated in the rate base until their recuperation through
expected excess of remuneration in later years). The financial projections show
that further distortion is not expected under the financial rehabilitation program
(para. 5.10). The main reasons for the different operating results of CHESF and
FURNAS are: (a) market: while FURNAS serves the most developed area of the country
(paras. 3.07 to 3.10), which consequently is the most attractive market from
profit-return standpoint, CHESF supplies one of the less developed area (paras.
3.03 to 3.06) dominantly rural, including low and middle low segments of the
population, with few large cities; (b) operating costs: the higher operating costs
of CHESF have not always been compensated by additional operating revenues; (c)
influence of regional aspects: CHESF has usually had operating costs exceeding
legal limits approved by DNAEE; (d) management: FURNAS has traditionally had a
highly qualified management, more profit oriented than CHESF's management which
has been more tilted toward an economic development approach; and (e) remuneration
targets: before decree No. 1849 of 1981, the remuneration targets of CHESF had
been below the legal remuneration; since then the GGF has failed to equalize the
remuneration of CHESF to the sector average.
5/ DNAEE has not yet approved the cost of service for 1983 and 1984, consequently
all figures are still provisional.

5.14      CHESF and FURNAS have maintained cash flow balance with support from
ELETROBRAS. Both utilities have benefited from the debt-into-equity conversion
mechanism agreed under previous loans with the Bank (ELETROBRAS periodically
converts portions of its loans to equity to enable the utilities to perform within
agreed financial targets). Through debt service coverage or indebtedness
limitation covenants, cash flow performance has usually been maintained at safety
levels. However, when financial strains arose by the early 1980's, the safety
levels were somewhat loosened. The conversion mechanism has been instrumental in
keeping the cash flow performance of the utilities at reasonable levels in the
past and it is expected that conversion of ELETROBRAS loans into equity (Annex 5
Table 5.9) will continue to be necessary through project completion (para. 5.19
(b)(ii)).
5.15      Since 1981 CHESF's rate of remuneration6/ has fallen: it was 7.3% in
1981, 4.7% in 1982; 3.2% in 1983 and 3.3% - estimated - in 1984. In this
1981-1984 period contribution to investment was negative except in 1983 when 4%
was achieved; debt service coverage was .6 in 1981, 1.1 in 1982 and 1983 and .4
estimated in 1984; debt equity ratio was maintained at reasonable levels ranging
from 70/30 in 1981 to an estimated 60/40 in 1984 due to equity contributions from
ELETROBRAS (mainly in 1984) and the annual automatic asset revaluation.
5.16       In the 1981-1984 period FURNAS' rates of remuneration were:  1981:
10.42; 1982: 10.7%; 1983: 6.7% and 5.0% - estimated - in 1984. In the sane period
contribution to investment was negative, ranging from -4% in 1981 to an estimated
-91% in 1984, and debt service coverage dropped from .9 in 1981 to an estimated .4
in 1984.  Debt equity ratio was maintained about 70/30 most of the period
declining to an estimated 73/27 in 1984.  In 1970, FURNAS began to construct tne
Angra I nuclear plant, and in 1977 and 1982 it started on units II and III, which
were subsequently assigned to NUCLEBRAS.  NUCLEBRAS is to complete construction
and subsequently transfer the plants to FURNAS for operation.  The construction of
Angra I has taken longer than expected; the plant is currently being tested for
commissioning and its commercial operation is expected in mid-1985. Commercial
operation of Angra II and III is scheduled for 1990 and 1991. Construction costs
of Angra I were higher than expected mainly due to technical problems. These
higher costs, together with the power sector financial framework of the late 1970s
and early 1980s (paras.5.06 and 5.07), have contributed to the finan^Aal strains
experienced by FURNAS. A proposal to address the financial implications of the
transfer of the nuclear plants should be part of the financial rehabilitation
program (para.5.22).
6/ As ORTN indexes used for asset revaluation have lagged behind inflation
measured by IGP) since 1977, assets in operation are presently underestimated;
this issue which affects all sectors of the economy is being addressed under
the 1985 spring project implementation review.

Forecast
- CHESF and FURNAS
5.19      In addition to the sector agreements discussed in para. 5.12, which will
benefit all the utilities of the sector, to ensure that the financial performance
of the beneficiaries would be satisfactory, during negotiations the Bank reached
the following agreements: (a) with the Government, ELETROBRAS, CHESF and FURNAS:
(i) the Government and ELETROBRAS would provide adequate resources in a timely
fashion to enable the two beneficiaries to carry out the project; and (ii) the
Bank would carry out annual reviews of the financial plans, including budgets, to
fund the requirements of the beneficiaries for the following year;(b) with
ELETROBRAS, CHESF and FURNAS: (i) CHESF and FURNAS would implement a satisfactory
program to reduce the share of net borrowings as a source of financing up to 70%
of their annual financing needs for the 1986-1992 period; (ii) to enable the
beneficiaries to achieve an annual adjusted debt service coverage ratio of at
least 1.1 in 1985; 1.2 in 1986; 1.3 in 1987; 1.4 in 1988 and 1.5 in 1989 and
thereafter (para. 5.14), ELETROBRAS would convert enough of its existing loans or
would contribute equity, including dividends. This adjusted debt service coverage
ratio would exclude from annual debt service, proceeds of loans to finance
interest during construction, amortizations deferred to later years and the roll
over of foreign currency amortizations of commercial banks loans until December
1988; (iii) the beneficiaries would maintain at all times a ratio of debt to
equity not greater than 67/33. Additionally, if the standard debt service
coverage ratio is less than 1.5, the beneficiaries would not incur any long-term
debt unless the Bank were otherwise to agree; tiv) ELETROBRAS, CHESF and FURNAS
would prepare, by November 30 of each year, a plan, satisfactory to the Bank,
demonstrating that the above financial requirements would be met for the current
and following fiscal years.
5.20      During negotiations, CHESF and FURNAS agreed on other standard
managerial and financial provisions of Bank loans to Brazilian power sector
companies, including, inter alia: (a) tariffs would be set at such level as to
provide a rate of remuneration of not less than 10% in line with the Brazilian
legislation (it being understood that in the coming years this commitment would
not be enforced, provided that the Government were to honor its undertakings under
the November 1983 agreement on tariff policy); (b) the beneficiaries would consult
the Bank before carrying out any new major investment, defined as investments
costing more than 4% of gross revalued fixed assets plus works in progress; (c)
the borrower and the beneficiaries would periodically furnish the Bank with
technical and financial reports as reasonably required; (d) ELETROBRAS would
onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan to FURNAS and CHESF on the same terms and
conditions (para.2.01).
5.21      Provided that the financial rehabilitation program is implemented both
beneficiaries are expected to be able to perform satisfactorily and to carry out
the projects in a timely fashion. CHESF's financial projections show a progressive



- 42 -
improvement In operating results and cash generation; however, equity
contributions required from ELETROBRAS will continue to be significant until 1990
to maintain the adjusted debt service coverage under safety levels, because of the
construction of Itaparica, Xingo (ongoing) and Pedro do Cavalo (future) hydro
projects; average reliance on borrowings during the period is expected to be lower
than 65X of total financial needs. CHESF's performance through the main financial
indicators is shown in Annex 5, Table 5.4.
5.22      FURNAS' financial projections also show the progressive improvement
expected for the sector operating results and cash flow performance. Average
reliance on borrowings would be about 57 % of total investment needs in the
1985-1992 period. Partially in compliance with decree 86250/81 which confirms the
role of NUCLEBRAS as the financing agency of nuclear plants and the principle of
costs compensation, ELETROBRAS and FURNAS have made a proposal regarding the Angra
nuclear scheme. The proposal, which was found adequate by the Bank, has been
incorporated into the assumptions of the financial forecast. Under this proposal,
the Government would: (i) assume sector liabilities in an amount equivalent to the
investment cost difference between the actual investment cost of Angra I, which
was constructed by FURNAS and the equivalent investment cost of a comparable
hydro-plant; (ti) assume an amount of sector liabilities equivalent to the
payments which were made by FURNAS in the Angra II and Angra III nuclear plants,
before the responsibility for their financing was transferred to NUCLEBRAS; and
(iii) provide to the sector compensation equivalent to the amount corresponding to
the difference between the operating costs of the nuclear plants and the
equivalent operating costs of comparable hydro-plants (Annex 5, Attachment 2).
However, the Bank should be ready to accept other Government proposals, aimed at
the same end, such as additional tariff increases to cover debt service
requirements or higher nuclear operating costs. Then, other proposals would be
set forth in the financial rehabilitation plan which would be condition of loan
effectiveness. FURNAS' performance through the main financial indicators is shown
in Annex 5, Table 5.8.

6. JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Project Justification
6.01      The expansion programs of CHESF and FURNAS for the period 1985-1992
were planned on the basis of their corresponding: (i) power market forecasts;
(ii) system load flow studies; (iii) system stability analyses, and (iv)
system contingency evaluations based on probabilistic methods. The results
of the above studies, which were carried out in accordance with unified
planning criteria used by the Brazilian power sector, indicate that the
proposed Bank financed project should be implemented as promptly as
possible. The expansion of existing substations and construction of new
substations as well as the addition of high voltage transmission lines are
required: (i) to transfer the energy to be generated at Itaipu hydro-plant to
the consumption centers of Sao Paulo, Rio, Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo;
(ii) to meet increased demand in the states of Pernambuco, Bahia, Alagoas,
Sergipe, Ceara and Paraiba; and (iii) to improve current levels of system
reliability and quality of supply. Details of the above justifications,
which are adequate, are included in the Project File (Annex 7).
Least Cost Solution
6.02      The selection of the proposed transmission line configurations
(voltage level, structures, conductor sizes, span lengths and routing) was
based on economic comparison with other possible configurations. In each
particular case, both CHESF and FURNAS have selected the alternative with the
lowest present worth value (least cost solution) at a discount rate of 11%,
assumed to be the opportunity cost of capital in Brazil. Furthermore,
substation capacities (power transformers, capacitors, reactors) and their
lay-outs have been established to minimize investment and operational costs
over the facility's useful life, taking due consideration both to substation
load requirements and to applicable technical standards currently being used
in the sector. The selection of the proposed facilities and their
configurations is adequate.
Return on Investment
6.03      Since the proposed sub-projects are an integral part of CHESF's and
FURNAS' investment programs, their corresponding costs and benefits cannot be
segregated from those of their investment programs. Thus, the rates of
return were calculated based on CHESF's and FURNAS' investments for the
period 1985-1992. The rates of return on the corresponding investments were
estimated as being the discount rates which equalize the present value of the
economic net cost and benefit streams associated with the corresponding
investment programs. The economic net cost streams include: capital
investment on CHESF and FURNAS generation and transmission programs; the
corresponding sub-transmission, distribution and general investments
(building, furniture, etc.) to be made by the above utilities and the



- 44 -
distribution companies served by CHESF and FURNAS and costs of operation and
maintenance related to the capital investments. The economic net benefit
streams were measured by the forecast revenues from the incremental sales of
electricity, attributed to the facilities included in the investment
programs, at the average retail levels (which include the sole tax and
compulsory loan) at December 1984, and adding real tariff increases required
to attain the rate of remuneration levels in accordance with th.. agreement of
November 1983 between the Bank and the Brazilian government (paras. 5.03 and
5.14), and alternatively at tariff levels prevailing at December 1984
(without considering real increases). Details of the calculations as well as
the assumptions utilized are included in Annex 6, Tables 6.1 and 6.2.
6.04      The rates of return of the proposed programs utilizing tariff
levels as agreed between the Bank and the Government are estimated at 10.9%
for FURNAS and at 11.3% for CHESF. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to
evaluate the impact on these rates of return as a result of reasonable
variations on the investments (10%) and on revenues (10%). The results of
the sensitivity analyses are summarized below7/:
Rates of Return
CHESF           FURNAS
Investments: 10% higher                            9.9%            9.8%
Benefits:    10% lower                             9.6%            8.6%
Investments: 10% higher and Benefits 10% lower  8.6%               7.7%
Benefits:    at tariff levels of December 1984  7.2%               4.5%
6.05      The above results support the conclusion that prevailing tariff
levels: Ci) are inadequate and they should be progressively increased until
the sector average rate of renumeration reaches 10% and past shortfalls in
the sector remuneration are recovered; as agreed with the Bank in November
1983; and (ii) do not reflect appropriately long run marginal costs for major
power facilities, which is consistent with the findings of the DNAEE tariff
study. Currently, the Bank, through loan 1939-BR is financing a comprehensive
long-run marginal cost tariff study.8/, the results of which are expected to
become available by December 1985. This study should provide the basis to
establish the appropriate actions to be taken by the power sector authorities
on matters related to electricity tariff structure (para. 1.05).
7/ The rates of return of CHESF and FURNAS programs, utilizing tariff levels
at December 1984 (without considering real increases), are 7.2% and 4.5%
respectively, which may be compared against the opportunity cost of
capital in Brazil, currently estimated at 11%.
8/ This study, being carried out in various stages, was initially financed
through loan 1824-BR.

7.  SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      In addition to the standard clauses in power projects, during
negotiations agreement was reached on the following main points:
-(a)   With the Government that it would:
(i)  by November 30 of each year, furnish to the Bank an updated
five-year investment program and corresponding financial plan both
to be satisfactory to the Bank (5.12(a)(ii));
(ii) carry-out the five-year investment program in accordance with
appropriate administrative, financial, engineering and public

Itaipu tariffs and to ensure that the agreed rates of return were
met if tariffs for bulk sale of electricity generated at Itaipu
were to exceed the levels to be charged by Brazilian suppliers in
t'e South, Southeast and Central-Western regions of Brazil
(5.12(c));

co mpleted by June 30, 1986 and its recommendations implemented
starting January 1987, after holding discussions with the Bank
(2.17).
(f)   With CHESF and FURNAS on:
(i) regular submission to the Bank of the performance indicators
(4.14);
(ii)  the contents of their 1985-1991 Training Master Plans and that they
would furnish for Bank review, at the beginning of each year, their
detailed annual training programs (4.15);
(iII) procurement documentation to submit to the Bank for review
(including advertisements, bidding documents, bid evaluation
reports and contracts) for contracts expected to exceed US$1.0
million (4.17);
(iv) on a Special Account amounting to US$10.0 million to be opened with
the Central Bank for payment to local suppliers (4.21);
(v) not to incur any long-term debt without Bank's concurrence if their
debt service coverage falls below 1.5 (5.19(b)(ii));
(vi)  tariffs levels which should provide the legal minimum rate of
remuneration of 10%; (in the coming years this commitment would not
be strictly enforced, provided that the Government honor its
undertakings under the November 1983 agreement on tariff policy);
and consultation with the Bank before carrying-out new major
projects (5.20(a) and (b));
(vii) on the technical and financial reports to submit to the Bank as
reasonably required (5.20(c)).
7.02      As condition of loan effectiveness:
(a)   the subsidiary loan agreements between ELETROBRAS and CHESF and FURNAS,
satisfactory to the Bank, would have been signed (2.01).
(b)   the Government would present to the Bank a satisfactory 1984-1988
investment program and financed plan formally approved by the Government
(5.12(a)(i)).
7.03      Any change in sector legislation, or failure to implement the tariff
agreements, which may adversely affect the operations or financial performance of
ELETROBRAS, CHESF or FURNAS would be an event or default.
7.04      With the above assurances, the project would constitute a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$400 million, to be repaid over a period of 15 years,
including three years of grace.

1.        Consumer bills contain the following charges:
(a) The basic tariff, which on a nationwide basis, provides about 80%
of revenues collected from consumers.
(b) The sole tax (IUEE) on residential, commercial and small industrial
1/ consumer bills, which provides about 12% of sector revenues.
Forty percent goes to the Federal Government, fifty percent to
state and federal district utilities, and ten percent to municipal
utilities; and
(c) The Compulsory Loan (8% of revenues), an obligatory investment
scheme under which industrial consumers using more than 2,000 KWh
per month acquire ELETROBRAS bonds (20-year maturity yielding 62
annual interest and revalued through monetary adjustments).
2.        The basic tariffs are set at a level designed to cover:
Ca) operating, maintenance and administrative costs;
(b) taxes other than income, principally property taxes;
(c) straight-line depreciation on gross fixed assets at rates of 5% for
thermal facilities, 4% for distribution and 3% for hydro
facilities;
Cd) a charge of plant in service reduced by the Pm of accumulated
consumer advances, contributions and grants (the 'Reversion
Base). This charge consists of:
(i)   a tax of up to 4% of the Reversion Base levied by the
Government, the proceeds of which are credited to the Global
Reversin Fund. This fund is used to compensate utility
companies when their concessions revert to or are taken over
by government and to help finance electric utility expansion
programs throughout Brazil;
(ii) contributions to the Global Guarantee Fund, a mechanism
designed to assist in the equalization of electricity charges
throughout the country. Until 1980, the Global Guarantee
Fund (GGF), financed through a surcharge of up to 2% on
assets in operation, was used in the tariff equalization
process to supplement the earnings of eligible utilities. In
January 1981 the Brazilian Government expanded the role of
GGF, from a tariff equilization instrument for the sector.
(e) a return of between 10% and 12% on investment.
I/ Industries using less than 2,000 KWh per month.

BRAZIL
CHESF-FURNAS POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
TRAINING PROGRAM
I.        Background
1.        In general CHESF and FURNAS staff at all levels is competent and
well trained. This has been achieved through the implementation of
comprehensive and updated programs, mainly through in-house training. During
the last five years, training of professional staff abroad has been very
limited because of foreign exchange constraints. As a result, engineers and
administrators have not fully benefited from courses, seminars and/or
fellowships abroad which contain the latest technology and advancement in the
corresponding specialities (not currently available in Brazil).
2.        Both CHESF and FURNAS have training centers with adequate capacity
to handle current training needs. However, some of the facilities as
laboratories and demonstration equipment should be either upgraded or
expanded to meet the requirements of CHESF's and FURNAS' larger power systems
and sophisticated installations. A summary of existing training facilities
is given at the end of this annex.
-I.       Proposed Bank-Financed Training Program
3.        The proposed training program is mainly addressed to upgrade and
strengthen the skills of about 790 CHESF's and FURNAS' professional staff in
the areas of administration, engineering and operation of power system. A
summary of the main topics of training as well as number of personnel to be
trained under the proposed program and their corresponding cost estimates is
given in the following paragraphs and tables.
4.        Main Topics for Training Program
a)        Planning
- Methodologies for expansion of high voltage and extra-high
voltage transmission networks.
- Technologies applied to D.C. and A.C. transmission systems.
- Load management and energy conservation.
- Optimum planning, reliability and marginal costs for generation
systems.
- Advanced topics on energy planning and economic development.

BRAZIL
POWER SECTOR
BASIC ASSUMPTIONS FOR 1984-1988 FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
(a) the Government would make the necessary equity contributions to cover
the financial gaps resulting from the other assumptions;
(b) equity contributions from State Governments would remain, for each year,
equal to the 1984 level;
(c) as per Government-Bank agreement of November 1983, tariff increases, in
real terms, would be implemented each year to achieve the rates of
return of 5% in 1984, 6% in 1985, --, and 9% in 1988;
(d) Itaipu tariffs for sale of electricity to the Brazilian power sector
would be equal to similar sector tariffs for bulk supply in the
South-Southeast region;
(e) compensation to the sector for the nuclear plants, equal to the
difference in investment and operating costs of comparably hydro plants
in the least-cost sequence would be made to the power sector;
(f) arrears to contractors and suppliers would be made current by
end-1984;a/
(g) decreasing percentages of financing of debt service for foreign currency
loans, ranging from 90% in 1984 to 50% in 1988; and
(h) a nine-year repayment period, including five years of grace, and an
interest-plus-spread rate of 12% for all new borrowings would be
obtained.
a/   During preliminary discussions with the Government in October 1984, a
progressive reduction of arrears until end-1986 was agreed to in principle.
However, this assumption has not been modified in the financial projections
(para. 5.11).
