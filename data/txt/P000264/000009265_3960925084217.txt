THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT 1235-BUR
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. PREFACE
1.       This report covers the Third Telecomunications Project in Burkina
Faso supported by Credit 1235-BUR. The credit for SDR 14.9 million to the
then Republic of Upper Volta, which became Burkina Faso in 1984, was signed
on August 26, 1982, became effective on July 8, 1983 and was closed on June
30, 1989, 24 months after the original closing date.
2.       Parts I and III were pre, red by Bank Staff, based on information
available in the project files, supplied by the Office National des
Tel6communications du Burkina Faso (ONATEL) and a short mission in March
1990.
3.       The Borrower did not prepare Part II despite repeated requests
to do so.

BURKINA FASO
THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJE8T
CREDIT 1235-BUR
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALY ATION SUMKARY
Background
1.       The SDR 14.9 million (US$17 million) credit 1235-BUR was the third
IDA telecommunications credit in Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta). The
first two projects had been satisfactorily completed by the end of 1974 and
1979, after broadly meeting their developmental and organizational
objectives. The third project was appraised in 1981 and Credit 1235-BUR
was approved by IDA's Board in April 1982 (paras. 2.01 - 2.03).
Project Oblectives and Description
2.       The main objectives of the project were to:  (i) expand, improve
and establish reliable telecommunications facilities in and between towns
with substantial economic activity; (ii) strengthon the institutional
framework; and (iii) develop a sound financial basis for future operations
and investment.
3.       The project included:  (i) the expansion of local telephone
facilities in eight major towns, including 8,800 additional exchange lines
and construction of outside plant; (ii) expansion of the long distance
network through construction of three main transmission routes and
provision of new trunk and international switching equipment; and (iii)
technical assistance and training in development planning, operation and
maintenance, administration and financial management (paras. 3.02 and
4.01).
Implementation, Experience and Results
4.       Physical implementation did not raise difficulties.  Completion
was delayed by about three years because of political instability and
events in 1982-84. The project had to be updated and its scope revised in
1984-85 on account of actual costs, increasing demand and change of
technology (paras. 4.01 and 5.01 to 5.04, and 6.01). Network expansion
exceeded the initial target by 561. At project completion there were about
14,000 additional exchange lines installed, compared with 9,000 at
appraisal, and 95Z of all 16,000 main working lines were connected to
automatic exchanges. Overall demand and usage of service grew in line with
appraisal estimates (para. 6.01).



- iii -
5.       The estimated project cost was CFAF 10.84 billion ($40.5 million),
with a foreign exchange component of about 70Z. The actual cost is CFAF
12.40 billion ($34.7 millio") with about 36? foreign exchange. Due to
dollar appreciation by about 332 during intervening years, financing of
foreign exchange portions was sufficient even for increased capacities
under the revised project (para. 5.03). The local cost component was
financed by OPT from self-generated funds (paras. 5.05 to 5.07).
6.       In the financial area, achievements were well below appraisal
expectations. The accounting system has remained inadequate and
unreliable, and billing and collection are still poor. Government agencies
continued to accumulate arrears. Due to a 20? tariff increase in 1984, the
target 15? rate of return was reached from 1984 to 1986, but fell in
subsequent years following commissioning of assets. Financial management
remained weak and insufficient (paras. 6.02 to 6.07). At the beginning of
the project, postal and telecommunications services were still under the
responsibility of a single entity, OPT, but in 1986 the Government decided
to split OPT into two -eparate entities. This decision, previously
advocated by IDA, was 4  line with the current worldwide trend in the
coumunications sector towards separate autonomous management of postal and
telecommunications services. This major restructuring, however, delayed
the implementation of sound managerial, financial and accounting systems
and procedures. Efforts are currently being made to introducc these
improvements within the next few years (paras. 5.03, 7.03, 11.02 and
12.01).
Lessons to be Learned and Conclusion
7.       The main findings and lessons to be learned from the project are
that:
(a) early detailed project planning, design and preparation with the
help of consultants tinanced through a PPF contributed to the
satisfactory implementation of the physical components at low
costs (para. 5.01 to 5.07, and 6.01);
(b) major political events in the country affected project timing anl
IDA project supervision, but subsequent cooperation between the
beneficiary and its lenders enabled the moderation of the
detrimental effects of delays (paras. 5.01 to 5.03); and
(c) the positive decision made by Government to reform the sector,
splitting OPT into separate entities--one for Post (ONPBF) and the
other for Telecommunications (ONATEL)--has demonstrated that
although such reform can be launched very quickly, proper
implementation of the new organizational Ptructures and management
improvements require more time and the support of appropriate and
sustained external assistance (paras. 5.04, 7.01 and 7.03).



- iv -
8.       The follow-up of three telecommunications projects since 1969 in
Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) has shownr that: (i) on thi technical
side, expansion of existing facilities and development of new systems have
taken place successfully, with the resulting facilities being reasonably
well operated and working efficiently; (ii) on the economic side, internal
financial rates of return from the operation, though intermittently low,
have been adequate, and estimated internal economic rates of return from
the project have been high, showing the importance of telecommunications in
economic development; but (iii) for the institutional aspects, improvement
in management and particularly financial management, as well as changing
the overall management culture towards a more customer oriented commercial
approach are difficult, complex and slow processes. At the same time,
growth in demand for services requires continued expansion and external
financing. These findings indicate that there would be a rationale for
continued IDA involvement in the sector, as wished by Government (paras.
13.01 and 13.02).

2.   Background
2.01      Telecommunications in Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) are
under the supbrvision of the Ministry of Transport and Communications
(MTC). During the project implementation period, operation and development
of public telecommunications services, domestic and international, were
successively the responsibility of the Office des Postes et
Telecouumunications (OPT) and the 'Office National des T6l1communications
(ONATEL)l establ'shed in January 1987. OPT had been established in 1966 at
IDA's suggestion during the preparation of a First Telecommunications
Project (Credit 141-UV). It also operated postal services and provided
various public financial services such as money orders, postal checking and
savings accounts. In 1987, OPT's postal/financial operations were
separated from those for telecommunications and entrusted to the 'Office
National des Postes du Burkina Faso (ONPBF)'.
2.0Z      IDA has been associated with the telecommunications sector in
Up ar Volta since 1969 through three credits. The first one of US$0.8
million (Credit 141-UV), declared effective in June 1969, which partly
financed a US$1.4 million project, was satisfactorily completed by the end
of 1974 and the Project Performance Audit Report issued on June 2, 1976.
The second IDA credit of US$4.5 million (Credit 431-UV), declared effective
in May 1979, helped to finance the supply and installation of automatin
telephone exchanges in the capital city and five provincial towns, the
expansion of associated local networks and transmission routes, and the
strengthening of OPT's financial management. The project was executed
concurrently with the Ouagadougou-Abidjan and Ouagadougou-Lome microwave
links financed by CCCE, and the satellite earth station and telex exchange
projects financed by a consortium headed by the US Eximbank. The second
project's objective of opening up Upper Volta to telecommunications has
bten broadly achieved. The physical components of the project were
executed on schedule and satisfactorily completed by December 1978. A
Project Completion Report was issued on May 17, 1983. Following
commissioning of the satellite earth station (1977), OPT had also taken
over the responsibility for international overseas telecommunications



-2-
services from F:ance Cable et Radio. Up to 1977, OP, was a relatively
efficient organization which had redured its dependence on expatriate
services.
2.03       Since 1977, however, the situation had been deteriorating and
corrective measures were required. To this effect, and to further
contribute to priority investments, under OPT's telecommunications
development program from lS80 onward, the Government of (then) UTpper Volta
requested IDA's assirtancs in financing a third tele:ommunications praject,
in November 1978. shortly before completion of the .econd Project. The
proposed project was intended to be part of the next OPT investment
program.  Government and IDA's views were that the sactor developmental and
organizational objectives needed to be further supported. Furthermore,
OPT's investment program was specifically designed to support broader
economic development objectives of balanced regional development And
involvement of the entire population in the development process.
Suffizient communication infrastructure in both populated and remute areas
of the country, and to enablj linkages with other countries, is essential
for the effectiveness of this process. Some delays occurred in project
preparation in this context (paras. 2.04 and 3.01) Credit 1235-BUR of SDR
14.9 million ($17 million), for the third telecommunications project for
-hich this is the completion report, was signed on August 26, 1982, became
effective on July 8, 1983, and was closed on June 30, 1989.
2.04      The project was prepared by OPT with the assistance of
consultants financed through PPF No. P.r62 of March 8, 1979. Preparation
was delayed by discussions on the size and phasing of OPT's proposed
component under the Liptako-Gourma telecommunications project, a
multinational scheme to interconnect countries in the semi-arid Sahelian
region of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. The proiect was appraised in
February 1981. Following agreement by Government on program/project
objectives and the reduction of the Liptako-Gourma component to a more
feasible part of OPT's investment program for the period 1982-1986,
negotiations were held in Washington in February 1982. A credit of SDR
14.9 million was approved by IDA's Board on April 27, 1982. The credit
agreement with the Government of Upper Volt& and a project agreement
between IDA and OrT were signed on August 26, 1982 (para. 2.02).
3.   Project Objectives and Descriptior
3.01       Proiect Objectives.  The main objectives oi the project were tu:
(a) expand, improve and establish reliable telecommunicrtions facilities in
and between towns with substantial economic activity, population and demand
for services; (b) strengthen the institutional framework necessary for
higher levels of achievement in the sector; and (c) develop a sound
financial basis for future operations and investments. To reach these
objectives, the project also aimed at providing technical assistance for
planning, design, and realization of network expansion, operation and
maintenance, and introducing adequate management systems and procedures in
all areus, as well as managers and staff training.
3.02       Project Description.  The project was part of OPT's 1982-86
telecommunications investment program, designed to meet 75Z of demand for



3-
service in the main cities and extend reliable service to provinces, and to
improve OPT's management. Its main components were:
(a) 8,800 lines of automatic telephone exchanges in a major towns;
(b) extension of trunk and international switching equipment;
(c) construction of ducts and installation of local subscriber
networks in the 8 major towns;
(d) construction of 3 transmission routes: one in cable,
Ouagadougou-Deiougou; and two microwave links, Dedougou-Bobo and
Bobo-Dioulasso and Bobo-Dioulasso-Diebougou-Goua;
(e) training and improvements in maintenance and repair
organization;
(f) consultancy services to help in development planning,
supervision of implementation and initial operation of
facilities and in carrying out a Management Improvement Program
to strengthen OPT's administration and financial management.
4.   Proiect Design and Organization
4.01      The project was designed within OPT's 1982-86 telecommunications
investment program, to meet its objectives (para. 3.02) and to assist OPT
in (a) setting priorities and in strengthening its development planning;
(b) selecting least cost technical and economic solution and making
balanced investments; (c) introducing adequate management systems and
operational procedures to increase efficiency and productivity; and (d)
training staff. Basic project design and project organization remained
unchanged throughout implementation. Some revisions, however, were
required to meet increased demand and to adjust to the merging digital
technology (para. 5.03).
5.   Project Implementation
5.01      Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-up:   Although the
origit.al date was November 24, 1982 the Credit Agreement was not declared
effective until July 3, 1983. Effectiveness was postponed because of: (i)
difficulties encountered in obtaining the subsidiary loan agreement between
Government and OPT and the legal opinion on the ratified Legal Documents of
the Credit and Project; and (ii) delays in fulfilling conditions of
effectiveness of the parallel financing arrangements with CCCE and Dutch
Aid. Improvements could be achieved in this area by better informing the
various parties involved during the document approval cycle. For instance,
these documents and the ratifying procedure could be discussed and
explained at negotiations. Concerning project start-up, the early
engagement of consultants for detailed project planning under PPF enabled
OPT to issue tenders for the mair, items to be financed by IDA by mid-1982.
Suppliers had been selected for most of the procurement when the Credit
became effective in August 1983. However, because political instability
and events in 1982-84 (a coup d'Etat on August 4, 1983, involved two



changes of Minister, OPT's Board members, General Manager and several
senior executives d:iring the subsequent year), OPT was not able to finalize
the awarded contracts on time. Start of project construction was delayed
by about 12 to 18 months for the IDA financed components and up to 24
months for the CCCE financed ones. Major contracts under the Credit were
finalized and signed only in 1984.
5.02      Procurement.  OPT/ONATEL properly adhered to the Bank's
procurement procedures and the result of ICB was satisfactory. Tenders for
each group of equipment and works attracted a large number of bidders and
OPT obtaired good prices. Based on the contracts realized, the actual
costs of the IDA project components were below appraisal estimates as
follows: about 15Z below for the transmission component, 52Z for cables
and associated materials, and 60Z for civil works. This is noticeable for
such specific procurement in a small landlocked African country such as
Burkina Paso. Performance of the suppliers and consultant was
satisfactory, on the whole. One consultant had difficulty in providing and
maintaining on site the staff needed. The contract was terminated and the
works completed on schedule by another consultant already employed by OPT.
Also, one microwave link was of insufficient quality and stability at
provisional acceptance, but this was remedied by the supplier during the
equipment warranty period.
5.03      Project Implementation Schedule and Revision.  Physical project
components, originally scheduled to be completed in December 1986, were
completed about three -ears behind schedule. Table 3.4.B in Part III givs
details of the completion dates, estimated and actual, for the main project
components. The basic reason for the delay in both local and long distance
installations were the late project start-up (para. 5.01). The project
revision took place in 1984-85 when the awarded contracts could be
finalized. It mainly resulted in an increase by about 55Z of the
additional local and long distance network capacities in and between the
main cities (para. 6.01) and in the acquisition of complementary digital
switching equipment for trunk and international services, rather than of
existing electromechanical installatioas, which proved difficult or too
costly to expand as per OPT's initial plans. Table 3.4.A details the
additional facilities, as estimated at appraisal and actual following
revision. All new installations were not yet used in December 1989 at
physical project completion. About 1,000 new subscribers were connected in
1987 and 2,000 each year in 1988 and 1989 when the number of working DELs
reached about 14,000, the estimated appraisal target for December 1986.
ONATEL expects to reach full development from the project by December 1990,
when the total equipped capacity will be about 25,000 exchange lines and
16,300 DELs will be in operation, i.e. more than twice the number of DELs
at project inception. Corresponding growth of facilities and operational
performance is detailed at Annex 1.
5.04      The implementation of the institutional component was mediocre,
in particular with regard to OPT's financial situation and performance from
1982 to 1986, the last year of joint postal and telecommunications
operations. On the part of the Bank, supervision had to be repeatedly
postponed or cancelled in 1983 and 1984 and little follow-up could take
place. Government complied with some of its covenanted actions vis-a-vis



-5-
OPT with regard to tariffs, staffing levels, external audits and some
organizational measures, but the aspects concerning financial management,
commercial accounting system and Government receivables were neglected or
unsatisfactorily fulfilled. On the part of the Borrower, however, the
perception of difficulties and diseconomies of management in joint
operation of post and telecommunications, as had been previously stressed
by the Bank, resulted in 1986 in the formal decision to split the OPT into
an Office National des Telecommunications (ONATEL) and an Office National
des Postes du Burkina Faso (ONPBF). The two entities were legally created
and became effective in February 1987. The reorganization is in the early
stages of implementation and, in particular, a protracted delay was
observed in the start-up and establishment of effective financial
management for the two new entities (paras. 6.02 and 7.02). The
restructuring took place within Government policy of reorganizing and
making more efficient the public sector in the country. It was prepared in
1985-86 by Government and OPT, through appropriate interministerial
committees, with little, if any, external assistance. This was in line
with the current worldwide trend to evolve institutions and management of
the P and T sector towards separate autonomous and business-like operation
of the services. This reform, however, made it difficult for the project
objectives in the financial and accounting field to be fulfilled (paras.
6.02-6.03). More viable financial and commercial operation of the two
entities is expected to be achieved within the next two years.
5.05      Project Cost.  The cost of the project was estimated at CFAF
10.84 billian (US$40.6 million) with a foreign exchange component of about
702 of the total cost. The final cost is CFAF 12.40 billion (US$34.7
million) of which 862 is foreign exchange.  A 14.4Z increase in the total
project cost expressed in CFAF compares with a 14.5Z decrease when
expressed in US dollars, largely due to average dollar appreciation by
about 33Z during intervening years. Consequently, foreign financing was
sufficient even for increased capacities under the revised project and on
account of the good prices obtained from ICB (para. 5.03). In spite of a
decrease in the local cost component, OPT was barely able to meet its share
of the total cost by self-generated funds, largely because of its tight
financial situation due to the non-payment by Government of its bills for
rendered telecommunications services and of the corresponding arrears. A
comparison of the project costs, as estimated at appraisal and actual as of
December 31, 1989 is shown in Table 3.5.A of Part III. Project financing
and the country exchange rate variations during the project period are
detailed in Tables 3.'.B and 3.5.C, respectively.
5.06      The cost difference between appraisal and implementation stems
from the following factors:
(a)  appraisal estimates were based on the use of electromechanical
equipment for extension of some local and trunk exchanges and on
the historical cost of similar equipment and works. The good
prices obtained from ICB for grouped items (para. 5.02), the
expanded use of digital equipment for local and trunk exchanges
and the realization of larger systems made it possible to
purchase about 602 more local systems at a total cost of only 5Z
above the original estimate;



(b) cost of expanded transmission systems remained in line with
original estimates and procurement of increased capacities
resulted in about 1OZ decrease of the cost on a per channel
basis; and
(c) the use of contractors for civil works and installation of most
local networks resulted in an increase of the foreign versus
local cost components for this item, but ICB and grouped
procurement for larger quantities resulted in about 30Z decrease
of the cost on a per line basis.
As a whole, notwithstanding the implementation delays, project execution
proved relatively cost effective and technically satisfactory.
5.07      Allocation of Credit Proceeds.  The original and revised
allocation of proceeds and final disbursement by categories in SDRs for
Credit 1235-BUR in SDR are shown in Part III, Table 3.3.A. The revised
allocation was agreed on in June 1987 to reflect project revision (paras.
5.01 and 5.03). It was based on actual quantities and costs, and also
reflected the dollar appreciation by about 502 for the period 1984 to 1986
during which almost half of the credit amount was disbursed. IDA's
financing percentage of civil works for local line systems was increased
from 602 to 85Z to reflect the higher foreign exchange component of the
actual contracts. Cumulative estimated and actual disbursements, in US$
million for each Bank fiscal year, are shown in Part III, Table 3.3.B.
6.   Project Results
6.01      Physical and Operational Results.  The physical targets of the
project as planned and achieved are shown in Tables 3.4.A and 3.6.A of Part
III.  In 1984-85, installed capacities for additional exchange lines w.ere
increased by about 55Z, from 8,800 at appraisal to 13,700 by the end of
1989. As of December 31, 1989, there were 14,251 DELs in service, which
closely compares with the appraisal forecast of 13,850 DELs in Decrmber
1986. OPT/ONATEL's main operational results and performance on maior
indicators, each year from 1980 to 1989, are detailed in Annex 1.
Appraisal estimates for 1986 are also shown. From 1988 on, data include
additional installations of about 3,000 exchange lines and corresponding
local and trunk facilities, realized by ONATEL to cope with a rapidly
increasing demand, which followed the availability of new lines from the
project. Average yearly growth of demand was about 15? since 1987 which
coincides with appraisal forecast. At project completion 952 of the
telephone subscribers were connected to automatic exchanges. Most of them
had access through subscriber trunk dialling (STD) to nationwide interurban
service between exchanges in 14 main localities throughout Burkina and to
automatic international service with 45 countries. Annex 1, shows also
that available local network facilities not yet used at full development by
December 1990, would represent only about two years of demand growth. To
cope with this, ONATEL is faced with the urgent need to undertake an
important expansion program. International facilities are now close to
saturation and thus require urgent expansion and diversification to ensure
sufficient and reliable traffic routing.



-7-
6.02      Financial performarce.  The financial situation was poor at OPT
and is still poor at ONATEL, mainly because the quality of the financial
management is low. This is felt in all aspects of the financial
activities.
6.03      Accounting system.  The audit report for the 1986 OPT accounts,
the last to be audited, is dated July 1988. The 1987 accounts, ONATEL's
first operating year, are not yet audited. The auditor, SOFIDEC, did not
certify the 1986 accounts, because the system is in poor shape:
(a)  The accounting systems and procedures are not set up tightly, as
there is no comprehensive documentation and no internal control,
which go together, and the auxiliary and general computerized
accounts are not coordinated; the level of competence of the
accountants is low; furthermore there is no training.
(b)  The supply cycle, including purchases, stock management and
physical inventory, is not properly organized, the staff is not
competent and there is no effort to advise on the rotation of
items.
(c)  There is no cash management.
(d)  There is no register of fixed assets.
6.04      Revenue cycle.  The billing is slow and the collection is poor.
In this most sensitive area, OPT before, and probably ONATEL now (although
they claim that the collection rate was much improved at the end of 1989),
have been losing much money. At the end of 1987, 0l of the connected
lines were estimated unbilled, which is a loss of revenue but has no
influence on receivables, and the collection rate was estimated, in 1987,
to be SOZ. Consequently, the receivables were high, equivalent to 9 months
of billing at the end of 1987. In spite of a corrective agreement of 1987
between Government and ONATEL, Government agencies had arrears of well over
one year of consumption, as the budgeted consumption is kept each year at a
constant level, while the actual consumption is rapidly increasing.
6.05      The only remedy left for ONATEL to deal with this situation was
to compensate Government's arrears with its debts to Government.  This,
however, is bad practice for a utility company, because there is no
relation between arrears and debts, and debts can be high enough to let
Government's consumption get out of control, particu irly when civil
servants' official phones are allowed to become free public telephones for
friends and relatives. Controlling Government consumDtion is only possible
when a utility financial management can act as an es .1 partner in a
negotiation. Except for private subscribers who can be cut off, covenants
do not appear to be the right way to reduce receivabies. It is more
efficient to concentrate on reinforcing ONATEL's financial and accounting
structure.
6.06      Covenants on rate of return and debt service ratio.  In 1984
following a 20Z tariff increase, the rate of return on assets, the value of



which were approximately revalued (simply increased with inflation),
exceeded the covenanted rate of return of 152 and remained at a
satisfactory level in 1985 and 1986. The rate of return seemed to have
fallen in 1987 because of large commissioning of assets. However, those
high rates would have been much lower if adequate provisions for bad debts
had been calculated. The same is true concerning the debt service ratio,
which seems to be at the level requested by the appropriate covenant.
Covenants on receivables, rates of return and debt service ratios, are
interrelated and cannot be examined independently.
6.07      Economic rate of return.  The internal financial rate of return
of the investment programme is estimated, on the basis of the last
available documents - the 1986 audited accounts, the 1988 supervision
report, financial projections for 1988 and 1989 and estLiated revenues for
1990 and 1991 - at 192. This is less than the 252 rate calculated at
appraisal, because of the time lag between the capital expenditures (1983-
87) and the expected substantial revenues (from 1991 on) from the new DELs.
However, the internal economic rate of return, calculated with tariffs
increasing with inflation until 1989, is at 28Z, compared to 302 calculated
at appraisal, which shows more clearly the importance of the development of
the telecommunications sector for the country's economy.
7.   Proiect Sustainability
7.01      Project Benefits.  The project's benefits are significant and
relatively higher than expected. They include: (i) an increase both in
the quality and the coverage of telecommunications services (para. 6.01);
and (ii) the transformation of OPT's telecommunications branch into an
autonomous operating entity, more efficient and possibly self-sufficient
after substantial net contribution to Government resources (para. 6.02).
The principal risks to sustainability is uncoordinated further development
and poor management of the operating agency, as discussed below.
7.02      Considering the overall importance of telecommunications to
economic and social development and the rapidly growing current demand for
service (para. 6.01), the net benefits from investment under this project
are likely to be maintained, as in the two preceding ones. The current
project has practically multiplied by 2.5 the installed and in-service
network capacities over a seven-year period. A recent study of
telecommunications requirements in Burkina, made by ITU in 1988, shows that
ONATEL's next short term development program through 1995 should consist of
another doubling of current local network capacities by adding about 20,000
new exchange lines, together with expansion of trunk and international
facilities and rural coverage. Several lenders have shown interest in
cofinancing the next stage of deveiopment. Continued IDA involvement would
be suitabi'e to assist in determining and arranging for the important
external financing required and, simultane>isly, ensuring that development
continues in a coordinated and cost-effective way as was experienced under
the third project.
7.03       Institutional impact.  The institutional impact of the project
has been only limited, by introducing auditing, which happened to be late,
and a sense of compelling private telecommunications users to pay for the



-9-
services rendered, but the main reform of the sector was accomplished by
the country alone when, in 1987, the Government separated postal and
telecommunications entities. The little improvement brought about by the
Canadian technical assistance would have to be pursued vigorously in
reinforcing ONATEL's financial department with a strong manager, who could
be an expatriate, and enough competent staff, so that it would be in a
position to discuss on an equal basis with the technical department and the
corresponding Government agencies.
7.04      Economic impact.  The main economic impact is hardly measurable,
but it is considerable when the penetration rate is of the order of 0.2Z
(cumpared tu 502 in most advanced countries): it is what is brought about
by a more than doubled telecommunications network, improved communications
with provincial towns and more international lines. But this improvement
needs discipline for the best efficiency of the network, i.e., satisfactory
service, strict control of Government communications and timely payment of
bills.
8.   Bank Performance
8.01      Overall Bank performance has been satisfactory.  In the initial
stages, project preparation was combined with final supervision of the
second project. PPF No. 062, started in 1979 for detailed project planning
and engineering, enabled tendering for most IDA-financed items to take
place in 1982-1983, before credit effectiveness. Due to political
instability, supervision had to be repeatedly postponed from 1983 to mid-
1985, a period during which project implementation was delayed and could
not be well monitored. Regular supervision took place from 1985 to project
completion. Table 3.8 in Part III gives details of the supervision
missions and of the types of problems which were encountered.
9.   Borrower's Performance
9.01      Covenants.  Government was Lhe Borrower and OPT, ONATEL since
1987, was the implementing agency. The status of compliance with the
conditions of the Credit and Project agreements is indicated in Table 3.7,
Part III. The main non-compliance of Government was: (i) its continued
limited or non-payment of its telecommunications bills, though some partial
compensation was agreed upon in 1987; (ii) the de-facto non-settlement of
Government arrears for past usage of telecommunications; and (iii) the non-
coverage of deficits of the Postal branch. Concerning OPT/ONATEL's
compliance, impact of tariff study was limited and there were considerable
delays in submitting the audited financial statements.
10. Proiect Relationship
10.01     IDA's relationship with Government and OPT/ONATEL on the project
has been good. During project preparation, appraisal and supervision, OPT
provided all the support needed.



- 10 -
11. ConsultinR Services and Studies
11.01     Technical.  The project provided for technical consultancy
services to assist OPT in project preparation, detailed planning, project
management and supervision of execution of most of the works. Technical
assistance was provided from the IDA credit, including initial engineering
under PPF, and under the project components financed by other donors (CCCE,
Dutch Aid, ITU). Due to project revision and delay, additional assistance
of about 65 man-months was required, which was mainly financed by CCCE
(Table 3.4.A). As a whole, the technical assistance services provided to
OPT/ONATEL were satisfactory.
11.02     Financial management and audit.  Little is known about Canadian
technical assistance for the management improvement programme. Three men
arrived in August 1986, three years following effectiveness, two for
financial matters and one for personnel. We know from the auditor's report
that they have started to write accounting procedures manuals, but they
have not produced any report yet. Auditing was slow to start, as the 1983
accounts were the first to be audited, in February 1985 seven months
overdue. Lateness seems to be the rule, since the audit reports of the
1984, 85 and 86 accounts were available in December 1986, June 1987 and
April 1988, and we were told that the audit reports for the 1987 through 89
acco,.znts would reach the Bank at the end of 1990. The 1986 accounts were
not at the certification standard.
11.03     Studies.  Table 3.6.D in Part III gives a summary of the
telecommunications tariff study completed in early 1983, and of its impact.
New tariffs were introduced in 1983, but have never changed since then.
OPT did not exploit the recommended principles for formulating and
adjusting tariffs during the project period. The impact of the study was
thus limited, although the new tariffs from 1983 were relatively high.
ONATEL is currently updating the study with assistance from UNDP/ITU, in
particular with regard to new services.
12. Prolect Documentation and Reporting
12.01     The development credit and project agreements were adequate for
achieving project objectives in the key areas of sector development and
managerial/organizational improvement to strengthen OPT's administration
and financial management. The appraisal report of the project provided a
useful framework for review and follow-up of implementation by both IDA and
OPT. In particular, the developmc .t requirement forecast was realistic and
could have been feasible notwithstanding external circumstances (para.
6.01). Project revision was discussed with IDA and CCCE in 1984-85 to
allow for appropriate reallocation and best usage of the available
development funds (para. 5.03). Progress reporting, however, lacked
regularity and comprehensiveness, largely due to workload and difficult
coordination under changing management (OPT/ONATEL had four different
Directors-General during the project period). The necessary information
was provided during supervision and internal reports from the operational
divisions enabled us to complete and update the technical information. The
reporting and exchange of information was, however, much less adequate with
regard to institution building and reform, and strengthening financial



- 11 -
management of OPT/ONATEL. ONATEL is currently establishing its own
Information Management System (MIS), as was initially included in the
project, to provide data necessary for senior management and monitor
performance.
12.02     ONATEL and Government have informed IDA that a thorough project
completion report is being prepared on their part to reflect their
perspective on the project, its implementation, results and impact. The
draft report has not yet been received.
13. Conclusion and Recommended Action
13.01     The three telecommunications projects since 1969 in Burkina Faso
(formerly Upper Volta) have shown that parallel actions on both sector
development and institutional building require a long time to achieve
results. The main findings from the three projects were that: (i) on the
technical side, installed capacities in telephone exchanges were increased
twenty-fold, from 1,200 lines in 1969 to 24,000 lines in 1989, automatic
service was extended from 2 to 16 locations and most subscribers have
dialled access to 45 countries, or about 902 of the world's telephones.
Facilities are reasonably well operated and work efficiently. (ii) On the
economic side, internal financial rates of return from the operation were
102, 15% and 19Z under the first, second and third projects, respectively.
Internal economic rate of return for the third project was at 28% compared
to 30Z calculated at appraisal. (iii) For the institutional aspects,
improvement in overall administration and financial management is slow and
irregular. The financial situation of the telecommunications operating
entity remains weak, with tight cash flow poaition, large debt service and
insufficient financial strength to sustain further development. This, in
turn, compromises the self-sufficiency of the operating entity. A
continuous flaw in the soundness of telecommunications operations in
Burkina Faso has been the non-payment by Government of its bills for the
usage of services, the non-settlement of accumulated arrears and the non-
coverage of postal deficits. An agreement between the Government and the
operating entities on these aspects in the form of a Contract Plan is
overdue.
13.02     Following the split in 1986 of the former OPT into two separate
autonomous operating entities, the Government expected that IDA assistance
would be continued to strengthen and improve the overall organization and
financial management of the new entities and for the development and
further improvement of tha services to the public. Particularly,
Government considered that the Bank's experience in sector restructuring
and in coordinating, financing and supporting development would best
benefit ONATEL. In this context there would be a rationale for continued
IDA involvement in the sector and it is therefore recommended that a
dialogue be re-opened to establish a new basis for IDA cooperation with the
sector that would imply the appointment of a strong financial manager.
Financing requirements for future sector development could also be examined
with other potential co-financiers. This exchange of views could take
place in the framewotA of a possible stand-alone telecommunications
operation or in the context of the preparation of the proposed projects for
Public Enterprises and/or the Transportation sectors in Burkina Faso.

a/  Project start-up was delayed by about 12 months due to political instability in the
country and the resulting late decision on the final contracts for the
sophisticated installations (telephone exchange, transit exchange and microwave
links), and project completion by about three years, as a whole, to enable
completing construction of one microwave route which had been insufficiently
surveyed, ane of local networks in provincial cities. Two extensions of the
closing date ier. required for delivery and acceptance of all systems.
b/  Following physical completion of the local networks and of the si!-, provincial
exchanges by September 1989, it was expected that about 2,700 addtitional DELs from
the revised project, still to be cz"nected, would be in service by the end of 1990.

Appraisal Estimate         Actual
Internal Economic Rate of Return                  301                   282
Underlying Assumptions
1.   Incremental revenues assigned to the programme are based on the
traffic increase brought about by the programme, from 1983 to 1991
(forecasts for the last four years), and carried out until 2003.
2.   Incremental costs excluding depreciation and intetest are based on
the additional assets, traffic and staff requirements brought about
by the programme.
3.   Costs have been deflated to bring them to the 1983 price level and
make tbem comparable with the capital expenditures (inflation
estimated at 61 annually during the period).
4.   Revenues have been calculated by estimating a portion of the consumer
surplus, with prices expressed in current terms until the programe
is commissioned (1989), to show that existing and new subscribers are
willing to buy services at tariffs increasing with inflation.
(Inflation estimated at 61 annually during the period).
5.   Labour has not been shadow priced, as OPT/ONATEL mostly employs
skilled staff of which there is no surplus in Burkina Faso.
6.   A summary of the programme incremental cost and benefit streams, at
1983 price levels for cost and at current price levels (until the end
of the implementation period) for revenues, is as follows:

Table 3.6.C: FINANCIAL AND FISCAL IMPACT
Appraisal Estimate        Actual
Internal Financial Rate of Return:            25Z                  192
Underlying Assumptions
They are the same as for the internal economic rate of return, except that
incremental revenues have been kept at their 1983 price level, since thiere has been
no tariff increase during the period.
Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis oii the above rate of return shows that with 10 higher
capital expenditures, 10 higher operating costs, 10? lower revenues, and the
accumulation of the three, the rates of return would be respectively 172, 18Z, 16?
and 142.
Fiscal Impact
The theoretical income taxes due by OPT/ONATEL as a result of the programe, and
assignect over its 20-year life would be CFAP 10.8 million compared to revenues of
CFAP 103. 7 million both expressed in 1983 price levels. The moderate ratio between
the two amounts ( 9.6?, it should be well below 10), Is the result of OPT/ONATEL's
near success in reaching the rate of return objective.

Comments:
a/  The tariffs introduced in May 1983 have never been changed since then.  No
subsequent adjustment in structure or diversification in levels were made, even at
introduction of new services or on account of technical, social or developmental
considerations from the study. The impact of the study was thus limited. ONATEL
is currently updating the study with assistance from UNDP/ITU.
