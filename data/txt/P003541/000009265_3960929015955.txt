MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TIHE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE MID-YANGTZE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.     The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit for
SDR 48.6 million (US$64 million equivalent) to the People's Republic of China
is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 35 years maturity and would help finance agricultural development in
Sichuan and Hubei Provinces and Chongqing Municlpality.
2.      Rackaround.  Agriculture in China, including crops, livestock,
forestry and fisheries, provides sustenance for over one billion people; it is
an important source of income for some 190 million farm families and accounts
for about 30% of the country's GDP. Only about 137 million ha of China's land
area of 960 million ha are arable. Farming systems are intensive with heavy
inputs of labor, chemical and organic fertilizers, small machinery and water.
Nearly half of the fJropped area is irrigated. Foodgrains occupy about 70% of
total cropland and account for about one-third of the agricultural output.
Intensive farming has allowed China to meet the basic food requirements of its
population, about 22% of the world's total, and to produce an increasingly
sophisticated mix of cash and commercial crop from less than 11% of the world's
arable land. China's decade-long rural reform program has revitalized the
agricultural sector, provide an impressive growth and structural change through
the introduction of the production responsibility system, increased producer
prices and enlarged the role of the market. The gross value of agricultural
output (GVAO) increased by 83% in real terms during 1978-88 at an average
annual rate of 5%, substantially more than that of the previous 25-year period
(3.2').  While significant growth has been achieved, the Government's central
concern in recent years has been stagnating grain production, which peaked at
407 million tons in 1984. Production, thereafter ranged between 391-402
million tons.   Major efforts have been made to bring the production back to
the 1984 level and grain production rebounded in 1989 to reach 407.9 million
tons an historical record.
3.        Recent government strategies to increase grain production include
diverse measures such as increasing state investment in agriculture, mainly in
*      irrigation expansion and rehabilitation, and introducing partial reforms in
grain procurement, distribution, price and subsidies. Local governments in
particular have placed high priority on investments in uplands, natural
pastures, and water surfaces for expanding production and productivity of
nonstaple food and commercial crops to meet growing demand for these
commodities, increase local entity profits and farmer incomes, and help
alleviate the pressure on the demand for grains. Unlike In the past,
government policy increasingly emphasizes that cropping must be commercially
oriented and match with local agro-ecological conditions. This has enabled
China to achieve significant increases in the sown area, productivity and
output of major industrial crops and fruits.
4.        The Government's long-term objectives for the agricultural sector are
to increase the production of food, feed, industrial crops and animal products
to meet the requirements created by population and inacome growth, and i.



-2-
increase income and employment opportunitles in rural areas. Given China's
shortage of arable land (0.1 ha per capita), development plannere have focused
on the need to increase the productivity of presently cropped areas and to
efficiently develop the few remaining areas of unutilized lands. Steps are
also being taken to stabilize grain outputs and to raise the the value-added in
the farm sector - by increasing the production and quality of food crops,
animal feed, livestock, fruit, fish and industrial crops - and also in agro-
processing, which is undergoing rapid expansion.
5.        The Bank Group's strategy for lending to China's agricultural sector
has been to support the Government's objectives outlined above. Lending to
date has included 25 operations involving a total assistance of about US$2.5
billion for land developmentt irrigation and drainage; support services,
including agricultural education, training, research, credit and seed
production; development of specialized product subsectors, including rubber,
forestry and fisheries; and area development projects combining crop and
livestock production, agro-processing and support services. Implementation of
most ongoing Bank Group financed projects in the agriculture sector is on
schedule. Future Bank Group lending would continue to support projects in
large and diverse subsectors, e.g., water resources development, agro-
processing, rural credit and forestry.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.   Bank Group participation would
support the Government'e objectives of increasing fruit production for domestic
consumption and exports, alleviating poverty by increasing farmers, incomes and
making productive use of hilly land unsuitable for grain cultivation. Bank
Group involvement would introduce important additional reforme to the
development of the already liberalized fruit markets. In particular, it would
(a) design financially independent, well-managed marketing corporations that
would have to compete for farmers' supply; (b) introduce a joint stock company
concept with shareholders and Boards of Directors, and encourage producers'
participation as shareholders; and (c) give farmers autonomy in managing
production by having a choice to sell fruit to the highest bidder, and to repay
loans in either fruit or cash, thus preserving a market relationship with
marketing corporations. Bank Group involvement would also give direct access
to international fruit industry experience and technology. It would have an
impact on fruit propagation techniques by establishing technical standards
through introducing modern virus indexing and plant certification programs. It
would introduce new technology by strengthening research and extension
facilities, by training farmers, researchers and extension agents and by
providing technical assistance. Bank assistance in the design of the project
includes soil conservation measures, e.g., terracing, contour planting, use of
green cover crops and efficient utilization of available water resources, and
would contribute to improved environmental conditions. The introduction of
efficient irrigation technology through Bank assistance would minimize the
effects of drought and stablilize production. Bank involvement in the project
would also assist in the introduction of modern post-harvest technology and
facilities for grading, fruit treatment and packing to improve the
marketability of the products and to extend the consumption season.
7.        Proiect Objectives.  The project objectives would be to increase
production, productivity and marketability of fruit in low income areas and,
thus, increase income and alleviate poverty. It would do this by structuring



-3-
the production side so as to satisfy domestic and export demand for quality,
variety and seasonality and by stimulating the development of effective
marketing institutions. The project would (a) establish new smallholder
orchards on presently uncultivated hilly slopes and rehabilitate existing ones;
(b) strengthen research and extension services to implement sound virus
indexing and budwood registration programs; (c) improve fruit quality and
increase fruit value at the orchard level by providing f&rmers with healthy,
disease-free seedlings of marketable varieties, helping them to improve their
cultural and post-harvest practices, and introducing clear price incentives for
graded, quality fruit production; and (d) improve fruit marketing by
establishing commercially effective county corporations to market quality fruit
in local, distant and export markets, introducing modern post-harvest
techniques, and providing investment in packing and storage facilities.
8.        Proiect Descriwtion.  The project consists of three major componentss
(a) The production comnonent would develop marginal hilly lands in poor
mountainous areas and finance investment in model fruit nurseries (77.5 ha),
budwood mother-tree orchards (120 ha), new production orchards (11,986 ha), and
rehabilitated orchards (2,473 ha). (b) The vost-harvest and marketina
component would establish and strengthen Provincial and County Fruit
Development Corporations (PFDCs and CFDCs) so that they would effectively
market quality fruit in local, distant and export markets by providing training
in modern management and post-harvest techniques, ensuring management autonomy,
subjecting them to market discipline by allowing farmers to sell to other
buyers, and providing investment in packing and storage facilities. (c) The
institutional sUDMort component would strengthen the Provincial Agriculture
Bureaus, capabilities to identify, propagate and distribute disease-free
planting materials, would provide technical assistance to institutionalize
virus indexing and budwood registration programs, and would train research and
extension staff in all aspects of fruit development. The project, to be
carried out over 5 years, provides funds for works; vehicles, machinery and
equipment; fertilizer, pesticides and materials; office furniture and supplies;
training and technical assistance. The total cost of the project is estimated
at US$136.9 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$63.8
million (47%). Retroactive financing of up to US$6 million is being
recommended for expenditures made after June 15, 1989. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively and
a map is attached. The country strategy statement for China is attached as
Schedule B. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7990-CHA dated July 17, 1990, is
also attached.
9.        Agreed Actions:  To ensure effective implementation of the project,
the national and local governments have agreed to the following: (a) adequate
counterpart funds would be provided in a timely fashion; (b) the training
components would be carried out in accordance with a schedule acceptable to
IDA; (c) CFDCs would have the authority to make independent and responsible
production and marketing decisions; (d) project funds onlent to beneficiaries
would be at interest rates no less than ABC charges on subloans for similar
purposes and with similar maturities and such rates would be reviewed from time
to time with IDA; and (e) all effluents from packing lines would be treated and



-4
the Provincial Bnvironmental Bureaus would clear the final arrangements for
waste disposal and set up and maintain a system to monitor effluent quality
throughout the life of the project.
10.       Benefits and Justification.   At full development, new orchards
developed under the project would produce annually 260,000 tons of citrus
valued at US$61.5 million and 48,000 tons of other fruits valued at USS15.3
million. Incremental production from rehabilitated orchards would be 42,000
tons valued at USS10.8 million. The economic rate of return for the project as
a whole is 34%. Per capita incomes would increase by an average of 180% for
130,000 poor small farm families who presently are cultivating an average of
only 0.4 ha and have an average per capita income of between US$50-S0 per
annum. This income increase would be significant in alleviating poverty in
some of the poorest areas in China. Beyond this, significant employment would
be created in all three project areas. The develcpment of hilly areas with
contouring and terracing would improve environmental conditions, and the
project would provide a replicable model for other fruit production areas.
11.       Risks.    The project faces no major organizational or technical
risks. The risks that do exist are either small initially or have been
effectively minimized. The risk of inadequate management capability in project
entities is minimized because management is essentially in place and would be
strenghthened under the project. There are no obvious agronomic risks. Fruit
production has been carried out in this region for thousands of years, and
farmers already have basic knowledge of production techniques. The small risk
of frost damage in the eastern part of Hubei is minimized by planting of cold
tolerant varieties and the use of sprinkler irrigation financed under the
project. Marketing risk is small since domestic demand is rising rapidly. The
major risks are that price differentials for high-quality grades may not be as
large as expected and that rail transportation may not be adequate to handle
the increased production. The former would be minimized by the grading system
introduced under the project, the autonomy of the CFDCs to set price
differentials and the ability of farmers to sell to alternative buyers. The
latter would be minimized by the extension of the consumption (and shipping)
season, due to the project's emphasis on early and late maturing varieties and
on storage facilities, and by setting up a liaison unit in the provincial
Bureaus of Transportation to work closely witA railway planners to effectively
manage and get priority for fruit transportation.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

CHINA: Country Policies and Bank Group Assistance Strategy
1.       This annex discusses China's development problems and prospects, the
key reform priorities at the macroeconomic and sector levels, and the Bank
Group's assistance strategy. It draws upon a country economic report entitled
'China: Country Economic Memorandumt Between Plan and Market7 (No.
8440-CHA), which was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 9, 1990.
Background.
2.       Beginning in 1978, China initiated economic reforms, first in rural
areas, followed by reforms in urban areas and in the external sector. These
reform policies have contributed significantly to China's rapid GDP growth,
averaging about 9.5 percent per annum over the last decade. High investment
rates (over 35 percent of GDP since 1985) and a strong domestic savings
performance, which contained the need for external borrowing, also
contributed. Industrial modernization increased the competitiveness of
China's manufactures in the international market and total merchandise exports
grew from $18.3 billion in 1980 to $52.5 billion in 1989, to reach almost
13 percent of GDP. China's share of international trade rose from 1.0 percent
to 1.7 percent during the same period. The average incomes of China's 800
million rural population more than doubled and absolute poverty receded
nationwide. In 1988, some 13 percent of rural households fell below the
poverty line, compared with 17 percent in 1981. Infant and child mortality
declined, the rate of population growth was slowed and universal five-year
primary education was achieved.
3.       The economic system reforms introduced (some on an incremental basis,
some on an experimental basis) after periods of local and regional experimen-
tation have served to magnify the growth impulse derived from China's high
rate of capital accumulation. In the state enterprise sector, industrial,
conmercial and transport enterprises now have greater freedom to determine the
composition and pricing of output, to retain after-tax profits and decide on
the disposition of retained earnings. Fiscal reforms have, in turn, allowed
resources previously annexed by the government to be retained by enterprises
and this, together with a large degree of fiscal decentralization, has given
provincial authorities more discretion in taxation and resource allocation.
Administrative decentralization has also transferred more authority to pian
and manage economic activity from the central government to provincial and
local bodies, more responsive to local conditions and strongly motivated to
promote development, although in some cases with very short-run or limited
horizons. Central control over the economy has been scaled back by reducing
the number of commodities subject to mandatory plan targets and the share of
key products distributed through state-controlled channels.
4.       Although China remains an economy where public ownership is dominant,
the government has permitted other forms of ownership (e.g., private, coopera-
tive, foreign joint venture, etc.). Product markets have been created, first
in the rural areas and then in the urban sector, which allowed producers to
trade their above-plan output at freely determined prices. Financial reforms
have dismantled the old monobanking system and increased the variety of finan-

and instruments. The pronounced shift away from budgetary support of invest-
ment has reinforced the importance of the financial sector in mobilizing and
allocating resources. Lastly, external trade and exchange rate reforms have
had a significant impact, and the creation of several Special Economic Zones
and legislation governing foreign investment and the rights of overseas busi-
nesses, paralleled by fiscal and wage incentives and now infrastructure, has
helped attract an increasingly large volume of foreign capital.
5.       Since the inception of the reforms, the government has emphasized the
role of incentives and market forces, especially prices, in improving economic
efficiency. In agriculture, a large proportion of output is sold at prices
that are free.  In the industrial sector, the government has allowed a growing
proportion of products to be sold at market prices outside the plan, and it
has raised the prices of major industrial inputs, including energy. This has
meant that, at the margin, most decisionts are being based on prices which
reflect relative scarcities. This is especially true of the collectives and
the township and village enterprises (TVEs). This liberalization of prices
has contributed significantly to the rapid growth of the agricultural and
industrial sectors in the post-reform period.
Economic Growth and Recent Developments.
6.       ln recent years, the government has experienced difficulties in
combining its growth and reform objectives with maintenance of economic
stability. China's success in achieving growth targets was accompanied by
emerging structural imbalances, but as long as fiscal and monetary policies
remained under control, rapid growth coexisted with stable prices. However,
industrial decentralization, accompanied by "investment hunger," credit
policies responsive to local demands, and a decentralized revenue policy
beginning in the mid-1980s, weakened the center's ability to control monetary
aggregates and began to erode the government's revenue base.
7.       More generally, the attempts at transforming such a complex economy
in fairly short span of time have inevitably resulted in macroeconomic,
sectoral as well as institutiowaal imbalances. During the course of the 1980s,
China experienced cycles in economic activity of increasing severity,
associated with the transition from a centrally planned system to one where
plan and market coexist. First, the lag between administrative
decentralization and the creation of an institutionalized capacity for
macromanagement gave rise to excessive monetary expansion over the 1985-88
period that stoked inflation. In the absence of new fiscal measures to offset
the decline in traditional revenue sources, revenues as a percentage of GNP
fell, and the budget deficit gradually widened from 0.5 percent of GNP in 1985
to 2.5 percent in 1987 and has remained at about that level during 1988/89.
The decisions to increase agricultural procurement prices an4 the larger state
subsidies to urban consumers, combined with rising enterprise losses, are
important ingredients in explaining the worsening budgetary picture. Second,
the dual pricing system that has evolved with the emergence of free markets
has led to distortions which reinforce the propenaity towards negotiation and
the possibility of corruption, and shelter enterprises from competition by
virtue of bureaucratic connections and advantages that "soften" their budget
constraint. Third, slow progress towards more competitive markets that
discipline enterprise behavior has allowed decentralized provincial

Page 3 of 13
bureaucracies to push ahead with unsustainable rates of expansion. As yet,
China has been unable to enforce financial accountability on the state
enterprises so that the effects of market forces to rationalize capacity or
achieve efficient resource allocation have been blunted.
8.       Finally, industrial and economic development in China has been
constrained by inadequate infrastructure. Investments in transportation,
telecommunications and energy have lagged behind those in industry. As a
result, serious bottlenecks in these key sectors have emerged, which threaten
to impede rapid future growth if not addressed.
9.       It was against this background of partial reforms that demand pres-
sures became pronounced in the first half of 1988, pushing the economy to the
limits of its productive potential. (For 1988 as a whole, GDP grew by
11.2 percent, led by industrial growth of 20.7 percent, and the consumer price
index rose 20.7 percent. See Economic Indicators Tables attached.) When,
under these overheated conditions, the authorities announced, in June 1988,
plans for a major price reform, inflation worsened as consumers switched in
panic from financial assets into durable consumer goods. Prices that had been
rising at annualized monthly rates of 10-15 percent in early 1988 soared to an
(annualized) monthly rate approaching 80 percent, in August. Faced with this
crisis, the government postponed further price liberalization and, in late
1988, adopted a series of stabilization measures, with inflation control
becoming the most important policy goal for 1989. The main elements of a
medium-term stabilization strategy began in late 1988 and policies were being
translated into actions by early 1989.
10.      The stabilization package included, first, administrative guidelines
to cut state investment by some 20 percent, to reduce the level of excess
demand. A contractionary monetary policy, relying mainly on the administra-
tive allocation of credit was also imposed, along with higher interest rates
and increased reserve requirements. There was also some tightening of state
control over price setting, and an increasing use of income policies to con-
tain the emerging wage and bonus spiral. This policy response is consistent
with recommendations in the World Bank's earlier 1989 Country Economic Memo-
randum (7483-CHA), which emphasized the need for a credible stabilization
policy but cautioned against a hard and prolonged application of austerity
measures that, in the Chinese context, could result in much dislocation and
large production losses, threaten economic vitality and risk stagflation.
11.      Evidence to mid-1990 suggests these measures have been successful in
stabilizing the economy but at the cost of a larger-than-necessary sacrifice
in growth. While inflation in the first quarter of 1990 has been brought down
to the low single-digit level (3.9 percent year on year), there was also a
marked slackening in the rate of industrial growth throughout 1989, which
became negative in the last quarter of 1989. By the first quarter of 1990,
industrial output had regained some lost ground, and recouped its level of a
year earlier. Urban registered unemployment worsened, although much of the
shock has been absorbed by the return of the large transient population to the
countryside.
12.      On the external front, there have been some positive developments.
The trade deficit widened significantly by June 1989 to $6.6 billion, and the
reduction in service income, especially tourism receipts and the abrupt



- 15 -                          Schedule E
Page 4 of 13
cessation of foreign direct investment commitments following the June
incident, threatened to become major burdens on the external accounts.
However, by year-end, administrative controls on imports and dampened domestic
demand, together with good export growth led tc a current account deficit for
the year as a whole of $4.6 billion (about 1.1 percent of GNP). The first
quarter of 1990 showed a surplus in the trade account of about $1.6 billion;
for the year as a whole the current account is expected to be in slight
surplus, aided by the 21 percent devaluation of the renminbi in December 1989.
13.      Since early 1989, Chinia has concentrated its efforts on regaining
control over macroeconomic developments, following the overheating of the
economy and rapid inflation of 1988189. In 1990, stabilization remains at the
forefront of domestic policy concerns; however, the government's reliance on
administrative measures to control the economy has significantly reduced
China's growth rate and overall efficiency. In the most recent stabilization
effort, however, the mix of instruments employed was different from those used
during earlier episodes of rapid price increases, with greater emphasis on the
use of indirect levers. The sustainability of maintaining acceptable rates of
economic growth in the coming decade hinges upon China's commitment to further
reform and the openness of its economy, as discussed in the recent CEM.
114.     As a result, while recent political and economic developments have
affected China's credit rating and have raised borrowing margins, China's debt
indicators have not been significantly affected, as both GNP and exports have
risen rapidly. The debt service-to-exports ratio has remained at about 9
percent, well below China's official policy ceiling for this ratio of 15
percent. Under a base case scenario, China's current account deficit could
average just under $3 billion per annum over the next five years,
significantly under 12 of GNP. Debt-to-GDP ratios are expected to remain in
the 10 percent range, while the total debt-to-exports ratio is about 75
percent. If China's exports grow more slowly than projected in the base case,
import growth would probably also be constrained by the authorities, because a
higher borrowing target, although feasible in market terms, might not be
comfortable in terms of the aforementioned debt service indicators. Current
estimates show China's total debt outstanding at end-1989 to be about $43.8
billion. Currency and gold reserves were equal to $17.5 billion, or about 3.5
months of imports, at end-1989.  Past trends and the current assessment
suggest that the country's growth as well as export potential are substantial,
and that savings behavior is likely to remain stable. The projected current
account trends described above, even in a low case scenario, do not portend
payment difficulties in the foreseeable future. China's creditworthiness for
international lending should not therefore be in question.
15.      For the future, with continued incremental reforms and macro-
stability, China's growth prospects are good. While growth in 1990 will be a
modest 2-32 because of the austerity program, the government's intention is to
achieve a growth rate of 62 p.a. in the next few years. At this rate of
expansion, China should be able to experience single digit inflation, and,
assuming domestic savings remain high, have only modest current account
deficits. This rapid income growth would be reflected in higher living
standards for the general population, as economic gains will not be eroded by
population growth. Projections based on current assessments of external
trends suggest the exports can grow at some 6-8Z p.a. over the 1990-96 period,
with imports growing at about the same rate as GNP -- 62. The current account
under this base scenario would remain well below 12 of GNP.

The Reform Experience.
16.      It is widely recognized that China's rapid growth over the past
decade is attributable largely to the economic reform policies initiated in
1979 and the resulting improvements in overall allocative efficiency. There
is also consensus that its future prospects will depend critically on
continued reform and openness to the outside world. Chinese leaders have
repeatedly reaffirmed, in the Fifth Plenum of the Central Committee Meeting of
November 1989 and more recently in the leadership speeches to the National
People's Congress in April, 1990 as well as in their meetings with the Bank's
senior management, that these policies remain the core of China's long-term
development strategy. There are indications that these pronouncements are
being translated into action. For instance, the NPC approved a new law for
Sino-foreign joint ventures, and new price adjustments have been announced for
cotton, and for rail and water transport freight tariffs.
17.      Commitment also remains to further reforms in the areas of enterprise
contract responsibility systems, taxation, and social security. Among the
reform achievements to date has been the broadening and delineating the
decision-making authority of firms through enterprise reform. Virtually all
state-owned industrial and nonindustrial enterprises in sectors such as trans-
port, commerce, and construction are now subject to a profit tax system, which
replaces the earlier system of remittance of profits to the government budget.
While further reforms are required in enterprise taxation, these fiscal
reforms have given enterprises and provinces significantly more autonomy.
Urban collective and individual enterprises, as well as TVEs, have also been
expanded, although very recent policies curtailed their growth (these have
experienced the highest growth rates in the economy over the past few years)
while the excess demand situation is brought under control.
18.      With respect to investment and financial policies, new banks have
been established, and a variety of financial instruments are emerging, broad-
ening the range of financing available to enterprises, beyond only bank
credit. Reforms were also introduced in the trade and payments regime, which
reduced the government monopoly on trade and foreign exchange, and a second
round of rerorms in agriculture (including land tenure contracts and leases)
was initiated in 1989. Finally, the dual price system has left a shrinking
share of goods subject to mandatory plan allocation and administrative pric-
ing; above-quota sales of the same goods take place at flexible or free-market
prices. Although in 1989, the list of state-distributed commodities was
slightly increased, the Government has indicated its commitment to further
narrowing the scope of physical allocation and administered pricing over time.
There is clear awareness that the dual pricing system risks becoming a barrier
to further economic progress: while initially boosting incentives and produc-
tivity especially in agriculture and light industry where most prices were
freed early on, the system now increasingly gives rise to distortions, since
key inputs such as steel, energy, cement and fertilizers remain controlled.
19.      As is inevitable, the reforms and the manner in which they have been
implemented have, in spite of their benefits, have had some unsettling
effects. For 30 years, China sought, and to a lsrge degree achieved, price
stability and distributional equity. Since 1979, the status quo has been



- 17 -                          Schedule E
Page 6 of 13
undermined in many wayss by freeing of agricultural and other prices, by the
growth of the collectives sector and by the larger autonomy of industrial
firms. Reforms have weakened monetary policy, on the one hand, as local gov-
ernments have been able to circumvent administrative credit controls, and on
the other, the tax system--only partially reformed--is unable to effectively
implement an effective revenue policy. Rigidities in enterprises continue to
put pressure on the fiscal accounts for ongoing subsidies. If China is to
resume its ascent to prosperous modernity, some of the problems that have
arrived with reforms must be settled.
Longer-Term Issues and Priorities.
20.      The criteria against which China's performance will need to be
assessed consist of a series of measures at the macroeconomic and sectoral
levels to promote growth, alleviate poverty and maintain stability. China's
continued growth performance is predicated on the success of macroeconomic
management, and the reconciliation of growth and stabilization objectives. In
this context, maintaining an adequate saving rate and avoiding inflation and
deep cyclical downturns will be major goals, but not the only ones. China has
tackled a serious macroeconomic crisis; whether inflation is being temporarily
repressed and will again become a threat when th\ economy revives in the post-
austerity period depends very much on how far the authorities are prepared to
go in developing indirect monetary instruments and engage in fiscal,
enterprise and price reforms. Indeed, the impact of recent administrative
measures on output growth has already led to pressures for a relaxation of
policy, particularly bank credit. Thus, unless steps are taken to develop
indirect instruments of economic policy -- instruments which do not rely on
administrative measures -- to enhance the effectiveness of stabilization
policies and strengthen the role of market forces, inflation and excess demand
could well resume when restraints are relaxed. The effectiveness with which
this is done will need to be monitored closely.
21.      To raise efficiency and to achieve the growth rates that are being
sought over the course of the Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-96) and beyond,
policy actions will be needed in several areas. Reform priorities include
continued strengthening of macro-economic institutions and of macro-economic
management and a rationalization of government finances and of the banking
system. Continued reforms in price adjustments and further emphasis on the
development of competitive markets are fundamental to the improvement of
resource allocation in China.  Trade reforms are another vital element of
productivity enhancing reforms and refinements to external reforms already
initiated should be pursued to ensure continuing competitiveness.
22.      The environment of austerity and restrained demand during 1990191
should make price reform easier to implement. However, other reforms in the
real sector, such as enterprise reforms, which are necessary to improve
resource allocation and ease supply constraints, should also be adopted.
Priorities for the 1990s also include strategies for sectoral developmentt,
liberalization and further progress with ownership reform. The first will
have a major influence on growth of the real economy, whereas the latter
together with price reforms will determine the gains in efficiency and
stability to be derived from the market system. If the balance between
planning and markets could be shifted towards the latter, the problems arising
from decentralized administration could be lessened, and the government would
be able to pursue firm macroeconomic policies.

Page 7 of 13
23.      Assuring an adequate minimum standard of living for the rural
population and an appropriate level of social services will also remain a
major challenge, as enterprise and rural communal responsibilities in these
areas are reduced. China's recent rapid income growth has led to a decline in
the proportion of absolute poor: in 1988, some 132 of rural households fell
below the poverty line, compared to 17Z in 1981; this proportion is projected
to decline further still. The problem of poor and backward rural areas in
various parts of the country will continue to require attention.
Redistributing financial resources to these areas through the fiscal system
and easing restrictions on migration out of the poorest areas are some options
for alleviating poverty. With respect to labor policies, inefficient
utilization of labor in the state sector of the economy also continues to be a
major problem and requires coordinated reforms in labor allocation, the wage
system, enterprise management, and social services. Reforms in the system of
education and training to further develop China's 'human capital" potential
are also crucial. And efforts to further modernize the industrial sector must
include greater efforts--in line with Chinese environmental policy and
regulations--to improve energy and resource efficiency and thus protect the
natural environment.
24.      Hitherto, China's rapid growth has relied heavily on high capital-
intensive investment; however, if growth is to be accompanied by parallel
improvements in standards of living, a decline in the share of investment over
the longer term and, above all, significant improvements in its allocation are
necessary. Continued investment in energy, transport and agriculture are also
necessary, as without new infrastructural investments and improved efficiency,
economic growth will lag. In mobilizing resources in all these areas, China
will require foreign resources and assistance. Finally, technological back-
wardness and inefficiency must be addressed by reforms that facilitate
transfer of advanced foreign technology.
25.      As incomes rise, there will be major structural changes over the next
decade, including a reduction in the share of agriculture, a rise in the share
of light industry. The rising income levels will also call for greater
development of the service sector (whose share of GDP at present is unusually
low), best achieved through removing restrictions on collective and individual
activity. Finally, the rapid aging of China's population and the concoibitant
demographic shifts related to the slowdown in population growth will take
place, and resources will have to be devoted to them, especially in the
decades after 2000. Finally, with respect to the environment, continued
action is called for. Continued progress on price reforms is among the more
effective means to reduce environment degradation; this approach also has the
advantage of encouraging a better balance between command-and-control
regulatory measures and economic incentives to encourage efficiency and
discourage pollution or unsustainable resource utilization.
26.      Finally, to mobilize the external resources needed fdr growth, China
will have to emphasize export growth and attract foreign investment and the
transfer of technology in an at least temporarily more adverse environment.
Continued borrowing on world capital markets, including increased but cautious
commercial borrowing, will be needed through the end of the decade. This
highlights the need for China to continue to emphasize export growth and



- 19 -                          Schedule E
Page 8 of 13
reform of the foreign exchange and trade systems in order to meet its economic
objectives and the role that flexible use of exchange rate and pricing
policies and trade reform can play in encouraging export growth.
27.      In sum, how China's economy fares in the 1990s depends substantially
on the institutional changes that are put in train and on the steady
implementation of reform already identified and of others to be introduced.
The explicit content, phasing and direction of these reforms remains to be
explicated and the preparation of this agenda for inclusion in the Eighth Five
Year Plan has been given the highest priority.
28.      Next Steps and Priorities.  The transition from centralized planning
to an effective integration of plan and market is a difficult process.
Expectations, both within China and abroad, have been pitched very high and
may have to be moderated in the next few years while China attempts to develop
appropriate indirect monetary and fiscal instruments, and implement the reform
program. China will continue to require external support in its development
efforts. Even with continued external reforms and good export performance,
China will require external capital to finance the current account through the
1990s, and access to concessional and official capital will continue to play
an important role in sustaining China's growth. China is still one of the
poorest countries of the world, and its access to concessional capital for
financing development and modernization is limited.
29.      In the short-term, the Government's success at keeping inflation
under control, while proceeding with the market, price and management reforms
that are key to stimulating efficiency and growth in the economy, will be the
main indicators of China's ability to pursue the reforms it has been
successfully carrying out for more than a decade. Paralleling its
reaffirmation of the need to rectify the economy and to deepen reform to
ensure 'stable and 'harmonicus' development, the Fifth Plenum's call for some
augmentation of the center's authority, particularly in selected areas of
macroeconomic management, is a prudent one, provided that it gives an enlarged
role to indirect policy instruments that can be employed more-flexibly than
administrative measures.
30.      Now that inflation has been reduced, the most urgent task facing the
government is to prepare an agenda of actions that will establish a sound
basis for strengthening macroeconomic policies and institutions to prevent a
recurrence of demand and price pressures, and for advancing towards the next
stage of price and market liberalization.  To support and sustain these
efforts, China will need to continue to strengthen the agencies responsible
for macroeconomic policy and management, while decentralizing further many
planning and administrative decisions. Looking further ahead, longer-term
structural changes, including a reduction in the share of agricultural
employment, greater urbanization and the associated rise in income levels,
will challenge China to develop and encourage the service sector, an area
which China's dynamic township and village enterprises, largely collective and
individual entities, have taken up with considerable success. China's
prosperity also depends on continuation of its remarkable success at
controlling population growth, while at the same time putting in place
efficient health and social services needed by an increasingly aging
population, with the resources to fund them adequately, and on improving the
management of China's natural environment.

Bank Groug Operations in China.
31.      Throughout this past decade, the fundamental objective of the Bank's
lending activities, economic and sector work and associated technical
assistance has been to provide support--materially and analytically--to
China's economic reform and modernization process. The policies the Bank has
supported have been a significant force in integrating China's economy with
the rest of the world; and, within China, the Bank's international experience
and perspective have made important contributions to both the design and
implementation of the country's reform and development efforts.
32.      The main elements of our country assistance strategy to date have
beent to support the implementation by the Government of its economic reform
program; to analyze the options for, and the consequences of proposed reforms,
their implementation, and the policy choices that confront the authorities
during the transition; to facilitate the modernization and rationalization of
the productive sectors of China's economy; and to assist in the further
development of the country's rural and urban infrastructure, specifically in
the priority agriculture, energy and transport sectors. While these strategic
objectives remain both sound and relevant, there is nevertheless a need to
strengthen the links between Bank activities and government reform priorities;
to help eliminate infrastructure bottlenecks that currently impede full supply
responses and stabilization; to support China's broader efforts to alleviate
poverty; and to help the country overcome severe environmental problems.
33.      Lending Operations.  Since China's change of representation in the
Bank Group in 1980, 83 projects involving lending of $9.1 billion have been
approved. As of June 30, 1990, $2.4 billion of IBRD and $2.3 billion of IDA
has been disbursed. Eleven projects have been completed and fully disbursed
and two Project Performance Audit Reports have been distributed to the
Executive Directors. Project implementation is generally proceeding well.
Most project agencies, as well as the Ministry of FLiance and the State
Planning Commission, have established and staffed offices to handle Bank
projects.  IFC has made five investments in China for a total of $44.0
milliont in automobile and bicycle manufacturing, in an investment company, an
electronics company, and a solar energy company.
34.      The sectoral distribution of Bank lending to date has been broad
based and is consistent with China's economic and social development
priorities and with the resource transfer needs of the sectors concerned (see
table below). Over 40 percent of total Bank Group lending to date has been in
the transport and energy sectors, to alleviate the serious infrastructure
bottlenecks which must be overcome to sustain economic growth, and about 25
percent to increase and rationalize agricultural production. Industry has
absorbed about 19 percent of lending, and Bank operations have focussed on
improving financial analysis and investment planning through support of
financial intermediaries providing credit to state and collective enterprises,
and on strengthening import-ant subsectors such as fertilizer and machine
tools. In total, the social sectors have accounted for about 14 percent of
Bank lending. The shortage of skilled manpower has been addressed through
investments in education. In public health, the Bank has supported programs
to improve the quality of care and efficiency of service delivery, and

Page 10 of 13
projects in rural and urban areas to improve water supply and sanitation. A
small share of lending has been allocated to technical assistance credits
which support investment planning and project preparation.

35.      Future country lending strategy and priorities are expected to give
more explicit emphasis to operadionsAdesigned to support or reinforce the
implementation of specific policy and institutional reforms and to support
operations with specific environmental, human resource development and poverty
alleviation goals. In addition, the Bank's lending priorities are intended to
reflect the sectoral priorities which underpin China's plans to improve the
economic efficiency of basic sectors and to undertake!the restructuring-needed
to meet its growth targets. An adequate pipeline of social projects is
desirable in light of the changes taking place as a result of refOrms, and
social sectors will continue to receive significant Bant  support; nonetheless
the bLlk of the Bank's commitments are planned'for the basic-sectors including
agriculture, industrial restructuring, energy and transport.

36.      With respect to adiustment lending, one such operation -- Rural
Sector Adjustment Loan %RSAL) -- a Bank loan of $200.0 million and an IDA
credit in the amount of SDR 72.24 million -- was approved in FY88 and has been
fully disbursed. There are, at present, no plans for further sector
adjustment operations in China.
37.      Maior issues in sectoral management will be addressed through the
orientation of the Bank's lending. The specific reform objectives and the
criteria by which progress would be judged will of course vazy by sector. In
agriculture, lending would be linked to, and designed to support overall
sector objectives including reforms aimed at strengthening the overall
incentive system, marketing institutions and the rehabilitation of the
irrigation infrastructure built up beginning in the 1950s and 1960s.
Operations are also planned in a variety of subsectors. Land and water
resource conservation and development would be assisted through interregional
and on-farm management and development, including a major irrigated
agriculture program soon to be appraised. The shift from grant to loan
finance and the increased autonomy of the rural banking system would continue
to be supported through rural credit projects. Lending to provinces is
expected to include multicomponent projects which incorporate specific market
possibilities as well as efforts to generate off-farm employment and alleviate
poverty.
38.      In energy, lending would assist expansion and modernization of both
production and distribution systems. Continuation of reforms which enhance
energy planning are key to the success of Bank involvement. In the power
subsector, the Bank would assist China in increasing generating capacity and
improving utility planning and management (including environmental assessment
and pollution control) through technology transfer, system planning, staff
training and institution building. Tariff reform in the power sector is also
a major focus of our sector strategy.
39.      In transport, operations would be linked to continued improvements in
long-term stretegic planning of the transport system to better utilize
existing capacity, take advantage of new transport technologies and move
toward a more efficient balance among the various transport modes. Improved
transport is key to the reform and further integration of China's domestic
markets. Increasingly, projects in transport are being undertaken directly
with provincial governments to support planning and development of integrated
regional systems. In roads, networks need to be expanded and major reforms in
organization and financing will be required, which the Bank would support.
The Bank has recently completed screening of several major highway projects
that wcould be important investments in the next Plan. In railways, the Bank
would not only help modernize railway lines, but will also focus on system
planning and management, as well as technologies to improve domestic
production of railway equipment and materials.
40.      Operations in industry would continue to support China's enterprise
reform efforts, particularly the development of new corporate structures to
enhance more diversified ownership, as well as assist financial intermediaries
providing credit to state and collective enterprises. Our focus also includes
support of key reform experiments and enterprise restructuring. Operations
would be linked to much needed ongoing reforms in investment planning and the
development of subsectoral investment strategies consistent with comparative
advantage.  Following recent sector work on long-term structural options for



- 23 -                           Schedule E
Page 12 of 13
the industrial sector, direct, subsector and ptovincial operations would help
upgrade technology, conserve energy, reform enterprise organization and
management, while supporting environmental assessment and pollution control.
In the financial sector, we aim to support reforms first through a program of
technical assistance to the central bank, a key institution for the
implementation of financial sector reforms and also through technical
assistance to financial intermediaries.
41.      Lending in education would be linked to China's ongoing efforts to
expand and improve the quality of higher education and advanced research in
science and technology, and raise the quality of teaching, school
administration, planning and finance at the provincial level, particularly in
poorer provinces.  Bank support in the health sector would emphasize
appropriate local technologies and improved operational efficiency and
financial management for both chronic noncommunicable diseases and infectious
diseases in poor areas.
42.      In the urban sector, Bank assistance is now expanding to address
urgent issues of resource mobilization, urban infrastructure, municipal
planning and environmental management.  A project with components in several
subsectors would assist urban reforms and support development in three medium-
sized cities. A major program of assistance would address urban management
reforms in Shanghai municipality, while urban transport, water and
environmental projects are under preparation in Liaoning, Zhejiang and Jilin
provinces, as well as Tianjin. The Bank is planning several free-standing
environment projects to help address China's priority to improve its air and
water quality, including in Beijing and in southern Jiangsu province, as well
as technical assistance to environmental bureaus at the local, provincial and
national levels.
43.      An important aspect of Bank support for China is the environment.
Attention will focus on environmental projects, including one for urban
infrastructure in Beijing, which supports strategies for air, water and solid
waste management, together with an industrial component to combat pollution.
A second project supports industrial retrofitting, efficiency and
modernization in an industrially advanced, but environmentally degraded
province. Technical assistance to improve environmental and ecological issues
is also envisaged.
44.      In the technical assistance area, an FY87 IDA credit provided
technical assistance to government agencies working on background studies to
aid in preparation of the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95), and, building on
long-time close collaboration with the IMF, preparation has begun on a free-
standing technical assistance for China's central bank. In addition, the Bank
will continue its close association with UNDP, particularly through its role
as executing agency for a second UNDP umbrella project in China and for a
project with the State Commission for the Reform of the Economic Systems. EDI
activities remain an important element of the Bank's program. In coming
years, EDI will increase training of trainers in sector-specific networks of
training agencies.
45.      Economic and Sector Work.  The Bank's economic and sector work in
China provides a basis for Bank lending and for dialogue with the Government
on development options and reform policies. The state of the policy dialogue
is active and open despite recent events in China.  Officials at high as well



- 24 -                           Schedule E
Page 13 of 13
as technical levels continue to seek out the Bank's advice on preparing policy
alternatives for implementing reforms. In consequence, the Bank's ESW has
moved away from the earlier large-scale studies of the Chinese economy to more
targetted, reform and issue-oriented studies.
46.      An important aspect of the Bank's Economic and Sector Work consists
of studies aimed at providing timely advice on macrosystemic elements of
economic refo.m. Recently concluded work includes a country economic
memorandum focused on macroeconomic management and emphasizing the need for
productivity-enhancing reforms as a basis for continued growth; a study to
identify options for tax reform; a study of alternative approaches towaras the
reforming the system of provision of social security; and a study of the
financial sector policy and irstitutional reform options. Forthcoming studies
include a review of labor market reforms and wage policies and a reform-
oriented review of a provincial economy. A second major area is sector
analysis to provide support to the reform process at the sectoral and micro
levels, to strengthen government sector planning and to underpin development
of the Bank's lending program. Emphasis is being given to sector work on
industry, transport, agriculture, energy, and housing reform issues. A third
area is continued collaborative economic study with Chinese research
institutions, including the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.l/   The fourth
area of ESW is preparation of "think pieces' on important reform-related
issues to help the authorities formulate their reform program for the Eighth
Five Year Plan.
47.      Aid Coordination and Relationships with the IMF. With respect to aid
coordination with other multilateral and bilateral agencies, the Bank has
frequent exchanges of views with Japan and other bilateral funding sources.
Collaboration with the Asian Development Bank has been increasingly
strengthened, with sharing of project and economic information and exchanges
on appraisal methodology. Close collaboration with the Fund has been a long-
time feature of the Bank's relations with China, particularly on fiscal and
financial sector issues and technical assistance to assist China in reforms in
these areas. Beginning in 1984, there has been frequent cross-mission
support, and Bank staff participated in the first (1986) DMF Standby
Arrangement for China. Bank staff have also participated in the Fund's
Article IV Consultations to China since 1987. Similarly, the Bank's economic
and sector work has benefitted from IMF cross-support: most recently, two IMF
staff participated in a Bank study of options for tax reform; IMF staff also
participated in the Bank's recent financial sector study and country economic
mission. There has also been collaboration in the technical assistance area.

I! A study of rural financial systems, currently ongoing, complements work
completed earlier in 1988 on rural township and village collective and
private enterprises, which have become increasingly important
industrial organizations in the reformed system. One on labor markets
and industrial productivity is planned for 1990.
