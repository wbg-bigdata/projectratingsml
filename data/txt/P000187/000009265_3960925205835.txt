MEMORANDM  TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Burundi - Third
Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1456-BIU)
Attached for information is a copy of the "Project Completion Report on Burundi - Third
Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1456-BU)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office. Part II
comprises a summary of a longer set of comments (in French) prepared by the Government of
Burundi
The project contributed towards preparation of a Bank-financed adjustment operation and
also a coffee project. Ihe PCR concludes, however, that the project 'generally failed to achieve
its two basic objectives, namely financing pre-investment studies to generate new projects and
strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministries of Planning and Agriculture in investment
programming and project monitoring.'
This failure is attributed to shortcomings in (i) project design; and (ii) performance of the
Bank and the Borrower. The project was a follow-up to two earlier projects with essentially the
same objectives and modalities. The main design shortcomings were the lack of participation by the
Borrower in preparation (with a consequent lack of ownership) and inadequate specification of (and
agreement upon) the roles to be played by the host institutions in managing the project. On the
implementation side, project management was poor. There was a lack of continuity in both the
Burundi project managers and Bank task managers. Furthermore, Bank supervisicn was inadequate.
As a result, the project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory, the institutional development
impact of the project is rated as negligible and sustainability is rated as unlikely.
The PCR provides an adequate description of the objectives anc. outcomes of most project
components. It does not, however, evaluate the quality of the studies produced, the advice
provided, or the training imparted. It also does not question how appropriate to the country's
circumstances were the objectives themselves.
An audit would not add greatly to the findings of the audits of the first and second technical
assistance projects. Hence, no audit is planned.

TIR  TECNICAL ASSISrANCE PROJECr
(Credit N. 1456&BU)
PREFACE
This is the project completion report (PCR) for the Third Technical Asntance Project to
Burundi, for which Credit 1456-BU in the amount of SDR 4.9 milion was approved on April 17,
1984. The credit became effective on November 26, 1984 an. was closed on December 31, 1990, two
yearn and nine months behind schedule. It was not fiuly disbursed, and SDR 589,155 was cancelled
on March 18, 1991.
The PCR was prepared by a consultant with assistance from staff of the Countzy Operations
Diviion of the South Central and Indian Ocean Dqeatment (AF3CO) of the Afica Region. lTere
was no completion mission. The Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and m with the request to prepare
Part 11, which was received in June 1992.
The PCR is based on ;:ne Memorandum of the President, the Development Credit
Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank
memoranda and interviews of related Bank statE

(Creit No. 145IBU)
Evaluatio Summay
Objectives
(i)    The Third Technical Assistance Project in Burundi was designed to continue the Bank's help
in improving the Borower's deopment planning capacity. Te projet focussed on improving the
capacity of the Ministry of Planning, the National Studies and Statistics Agency (SNES) and the
Ministry of Agriculture in project preparation, monitoring and evaluation The project also aimed at
stening the weak link between macroeconomic and project work in Burundi's plannig system,
and incaing the number of Burundianswith skills in project analyis, monitoring and management
(ii)   To achieve these objectives, provisons were made in the Credit to provide long-term adviors,
finance feasility and sector studies, and recruit speiaized consultants to assist with problem
projects A training program would be initiated in statistics, project preparation, rmonitoring and
project m ment, with special emphasis on improving agricultural statistics collection at the SNES.
Fimally, a documentation center would be built to centralize economic and technical information on
development projects.
(iii) A credit of SDR 4.9 milion was granted which was disbursed between 1984-91, with the
exception of SDR 589,155 (or 12%) which was cancelled.
Relts and Implemetai  Expienc
(iv)   The main achievements of the project were improved agricultural statistics and monitoring
of agricultural projects and contnbutions to the prepration of the Second Structural Adjustment
Credit, including public expenditure management and social aspects of adjustment Four long-term
advios were recruited, but the positions of project monitoring specialist and documentalist were
never filed. A total of 14 studies was carred out, some leading to invesatment in the coffee sub-sector,
others perining to the strucural adjustment process. Consttion of the documentation center was
completed, althugh it did not become fully operational until after the credit was closed. A number
of nationals underwent tiing, both locally and abroad; however, the impact of this taning and of
the institutional strengthenig activities could not be assessed.
(v)   Several problems arose with proement, auditig, and disbursements. Poor cordination
and management of proiect actvities were apparent, and the project rceived problem status in 1990.
Most implementation problems resulted from inappropriate institutional arrangements for project
management and monitoring (ie, the merng of responsibility for overall coordination of project
activities and day-to-day adminitration of the credit).



- iv-
Lesoms Learned
(vi)  Several lessons may be drawn from this experence Most importantly, the institutional capacity
of the ministries concerned must be given more weight in the determination of technical assistance.
An approprate organization and management structure for the project, to include a foimal
monitorng system, should be included in the iroject's design to ensure smooth implementation and
continuity in project supervision. National staff should be trained at an early stage of the project in
Bank policies and procedures and all aspects of project implementation should be reviewed dunng
supervision missions which should be staffed with sectoral, organizational and administrative expertise.

Backg,vund
1.    Burundi, a small landlocked country in Central Africa, has a per capita GDP of about US$215
(in 1991). In 1985, Burundi launched a structual adjustment program, and since then the country's
average GDP growth rate (5.1%) has been above the average for sub-Saharan Africa. With an
estimated populati=- of just over 5 million and a growth rate of 3 percnt a year, Burundi has the
second highest population density in Africa. About 90 percent of the people live in rural areas and
the economy is highly dependent on agriculture (more than half of GDP and 90 percent of
employment and export earn ), with coffee accountng for 80 percent of total expors The prnvate
sector is active in transport and in the production of export and food crops, while the public sector
enjoys a quasi-monopolitic position in manufaturi  energ, construction and in the procesing and
exort of primary commodities. The public sector also generates half of the country's formal
employment and Burundi's economic and financial situation has been closely linked to the
international price of coffee, which has fluctuated widely from year to year.
2.    Despite the progress achieved during the past decade, manpower limitations still pose a
serious constraint on Burundi's development efforts. At higher levels of responsibility, managers have
not always been trained for the tasks they are performing and many lack professional experience. At
lower levels, severe shortages exst for white-collar positions and for skilled craftsmen. Inadequacies
affect all sectors of the economy, but they are particularly felt in the public sector where low wages
make it difficult to attract the most qualified Burundians. Althoug'h this situation can only be
remedied over time, Bank technical assistance has attempted to fill the most obvious gaps by
strengthening the institutions responsible for investment planning pammig.
Bank-Reated Operation
3.    The first Bank-finced free-standing technical assistance (TA) project (Cr. 613-BU of March
19, 1976 in the amount of US$15 million) was initiated when Bank Group operations in the country
were still limited. It aimed at remedying the severe shortage of local skills by providing technical
assistance to identify feasible sectoral projects. The same assistance pattern was carried over to the
second TA project (Cr. 917-BU of May 24, 1979 in the amount of 2.5 million) at the time when the
volume of Bank operations was increasing. Activities financed under these credits covered a broad



-2-
range of endevrs, including assstance to macroeconomic planning and data coliection in the
Ministty of Planning, peat and nickel development in the Miistry of Energy and Mines, agrtural
planning in the Ministry of Agriculture, and ranagement of three financdal parastatals: CADEBU
(savig bank), CAMOFI (inmestment fund), and SIP (real estate firm).
4.    Long-term adviors assigned to t&r Ministry of Planning included.(i) a senior planning advisor
to set up a macroeconomic frmework for planning activities and to advise senior government officials
on policy issues; (ii) a general statistician to assist the statistics office (SNES) in its reorganization and
launching of a series of important survys; and (iii) an agricultural stadstician to help the agricultural
division of SNES to supervise data collection in various project areas and train surveyors le long-
term adviors recruited by the Ministty of Agriclture consisted of an agricultural economist assigned
to the Studies and Programs Division of the Diectorate-General for Agricultural Planning (DOPA),
and a management specialist in the Monitring and Control Division of DOPA The two credits also
financed a number of project feasibility and sector studies, overseas fellowships and local training
courses.
B. Objectie a" Compouets
Objecives
5.    As set out in the Memorandum of the President, the Third Technial Assistance Project was
designed to extend those activities initiated ander the frst two projects to improve Bunmdi's planning
capacity by emphasizing project preparation, monitoring and evaluation. In doing so, the project
focused on the Ministies of Planning and Agriculture in an effort to improve the quality of new
projects and the management of on-going ones. It also aimed at stengthening the link between
macroeconomic and project work in Burundi's planning system, while local traiing and overseas
fellowships would help incmrase the number of Burundis with project preparation and management
6.    Stdes (US$25 mfflion). The Project sought to strengthen the investment pipeiNne by
financing statistical surveys, sector studies, prefeasibility and feasibility studies, and specialed
consultants to help solve problems arbing in the course of project implementation. Twvice a year
durng the review of the investment budget, the Directorate-Gnral of P ming in the Ministy
of Planning was to submit to IDA a program of surveys and studies, established on the basis of
proposal from sectoral ministries and the county's development pririties. IDA was to give its
approval to the detailed term of reference for each of the studies, some of which would be carried
out by the local consulting fim, SOMBU.
7.    Project Monitoring Systn  (US$0.6 million). A project monitoring system in the Ministry of
Planning would be established, headed by a systems analyst who would be recruited for a period of
three yeas The system would enable the ministry to prepare quarterly reports on project
implementation and to compare the rates of physical implementation with incurred expenditus Iln
collaboration with project monitoring units in some sectoral ministries, the Project Monitoring
Advisor would develop standard forms for programming and monitoring project activities and
expenditures Tis exercise was intended to complement the existing computerized project list

(developed by the senior planning advisor financed under TA I and II), which would continue to be
refined and updted.
&     Stthenng SNES (US$0.7 million). TA m would continue previous techniceIl assistance
work aimed at strengthening the agicultural statistics and national accounts dmsions of the SNES.
An agricultural statistician would be recruited for three year to undertake the agricultural surveys
in those provnces not covered under TA IL This statistician would also be responsible for anabzing
the evolution of farms surveyed in 1980-81, and for undertaking an in-depth study of farming systems
which would include an analysis of yields and processing of agricutural products, a household
consumption survey, and a survey of non-farm activities in rual areas. The advior would also assist
SNES in studying the possibility of establishing a computer divion that would ensure that micro-
computers would be introduced in a concerted and systematic way. In addition, provisions were made
in the Credit to finance: (i) complementary epertise in ib; computer field; (ii) two vehicles; (iii)
computer equipment; (nv) two oneyear ovseas fellowships in the computer field, and related local
training, and (vi) short-term specialized consultants to carty out an organzational diagnosis of SNES
and to help strengthen it.
9.    National Documentaio  Center (US$0.3 miion). In order to centize the necessary socio-
economic data needed for prqect preparation and monitoring, the credit was to finance the
construction and furbishing of a documentation center of about 300m2 of usable space. After
constrution of the Center, a documentalist would be hired for a period of about 20 months to help
organize its operations which would consist of collecting and regularly updating the information
available locally pertaining to project preparation, identification, evaluation and monitoring as well
as maintaining a current set of studies on Burundi and the Region.
10.   S      b"ngwig DGPA (US$1.6 miin). The project would continue the work started under
TA II to reorganize DGPA into three divisions, namely: (a) management assistance; (b) monitoring
and evaluation; and (c) studies and program  Ihe work would be carried out by three long-term
advisors recruited under three-year contracts: (i) a management specialist to help set up accounting
and management systems in major projects and regional development corporations (SRDs), to
establish a system of annual p gming of activities and expenditures, and to study the
establishment of a project assistance division within DGPA,; (ii) an agricultural economist to set up
a project monitoring system and to carry out periodic evaluations of selected projects; and (iii)
another agricutural economist to help design agricultural policies, to identify and prepare new
projects, and to supervise ex-post project evaluations. The credit would also finance short-term local
and overseas training, vebicles, operating expenditures, computer equipment, and the equipment
necessary to operate the documentation center.
C Implemenon and Supeision
11.   Responsibility for the coordination of project implementation was vested in the Ministry of
Planning, with the Director-General of Planning as project administrato. This official was to be
responusble for recruiting adviors and consultants, purchasing vehicles and equipment, paying local
staff travel albowances, and submitting plans and bidding requests for the construction of the
docmentation center with the help of the Ministry of Public Works.
12.   The terms of reference of all long-term advisors were agreed upon during negotiations Each
long-term advisor was to prepare a yearly work program, which would be approved by his supervisor



-4-
and reviewed by IDA. The work programs weic to have included time-tables for the completion of
planned activities and to have specified the respective task of expatriate and national staf£ The
Government was expected to assign qualified national staff in appropriate number and with
appropriate prior training to work vnth the advisos
Overl Perfornnce
13.   Implementation began smoothly and continued relatively well with regards to the SNES and
DGPAcomponents. The studies and documentation center components, however, lagged behind and
remained problematic until the closing of the credit The borrower's performance vis-&-vis credit
covenants was mixed, with long delays in the selction of studies and in auditing project accounts.
Disbursements were generally vety slow. By June 1990, the lack of improvement in key project areas
and persistent delays in auditmg project accounts led supemsicn missions to declare the project a
problem project. The credit was closed on December 31, 1990 with over half a million dollars of
undisbursed funds cancelled.
14. Long-teWmAdviom Four of the six long-term advisors were in place before the credit became
effective in November 1984. Through renegotiation with the Institute of Resejrch and Application
of Development Methods (IRAM), the contracts of the management specialt and agricultural
economist provided by this Grm under previous TA credits to DGPAwere extended for anothr three
years each, and two additional adviors were hired, each for three years : an agricultural economist
for DOPA and a statistician for the Agricultural Statistics Division of SNES. Thus IRAM provided
four advisors for the agricultural planning sector, two of whom had been in place since 1980.
15.   The position of project monitoring specalist at the Ministry of Planoing remained vacant until
the closing of the credit, although a contract was signed in March 1986 wnth CEGIR-Canada to
provide a system analyst for that position. The reason for contract cancellation was unclear from the
fles. The documentalist positon had not been fiW at the time of credit dosing either, due to delay
in the construction of the Documentation Center. On the other hand, a number of long-term
advisors, wse positions had not been provided for in the Memorandum of the President were
recruited in 1989 three faculty members for the Graduate School of Business Administration pending
funding under a UNDP program; a monitoring specialist, for the Permanent Secretariat of Structural
Adjustment Programs, and a macroeconomist, for the Prime Minister's Office, pending the
effectiveness of the fourth technical asistance credit (Economic Management and Public Enteries
(1795-BU)).
16.   Sadks. The project's studies component made a significant contribution to the preparation
of the Second Structura Adjustment Credit (SAC II). The study on public expenditures and the one
on the social aspects of adjustment were important in revamping the economic reform program.
Nevertheless, this component was generaly caried out utictori. Contrary to the covenant, no
six-month progams of studies were proposed for IDA's review, despite repeated requests from Bank
supervision missions. By October 1986, two years after credit effectveness, only 2.2 percent of the
funds allocated to studies had been disbursed, while sectoral ministries complained that they had no
access to funds and that their proposals had not been tak  into account by the Ministry of Planning.
Only after much insistence by Bank missions and in preparation of SAC II did disbursement for
studies begin to pick up.



-5-
17. Several factors accounted for the long delays in funding studies. Frst, therv: was the necessary
but lengthy process of cotdination between the plnning and soctoral ministrifk, and between the
project taskl manager and concemed sectoral staff at the Bank. Secnd, therews the disagreement
between the Ministry of Plannig and the plannig units m sectoral mintries, in paticular DOPA,
as to who was responsible for the different phases of the study process, with the Ministty of Platnng
being tivolved in all phas of execution rather than playig the role of the coordinating agency. The
thirW constraint was the lack of cear and accepted citeria to guide study selection.
18.   The Baks supension missions were cogizant of these constraints and repeatedly urged the
Ministry of Planning to establish effective inter-ministerial decision-malkng mechanisms and
procedures, and to define criteria for selecting studies. One mission included an institutional specialist
from the Policy, Research and External Affairs (PRE) complex to review the orgamization of the
Ministry of Planning and to propose changes However, there was no follow-up to this proposal, as
the Mistry of Planning did not think changes were necessary. Thus despite seveal attempts to
clarify the selection mechanism, the implementation of this component remained problematic until
credit closing.
19.   Training  Training activities generally proceeded without probkm. Local seminars on
various phases of the project cycle and courses on agricultural planning and the use of computers
were organized for the staff of DGPA, SNES and other agricultural agencies Overseas training
activities exceeded the number and areas indicated in the Memorandum of the President and covered
disbursement procedures, management techniques, and other specialid subjects  Governm.-nt
officials sometimes complained about the slow response from the Bank to their "no-objection'
requests. The Bank's slow response was due in part to frequent changes of project staff; and in part
to objections to the project managers' piece-meal approach to trainig proposals.
20.   Docmentadon Center. The construction of a documentation center took a long time to
complete, due to several factos These included selecting a locaWl firm to prepare the design and cost
estimates, review and approval by IDA on the proposed designs, and technical review and contract
approval by the local Central Procurement Commission. As a result, constuction was not completed
until October 1990 - two months before the credit closing date and four years behind schedule- even
though the first draft of the architectural design was ready in July 1985 for ID)A's review. Because
of this delay, the center did not become operational during the disbursement period. It is currently
in use and staffed by three national documentalists and one expatriate.
21.   Disburments. Crdit disbursement extended over seven years, compared to the four years
projected. Tbi length of time is not unusual for a technical assistance credit in Sub-aharan Africa,
but considering that a large portion of the Credit was cancelled (SDR 589,154 or 12% of the total)
at the closing date and that this was a third-phase project with most activities already underway, the
pace of disbursement was indeed very slow. The disbursement rate was only 30 percent of projected
disbursements with regards to the study category, and almost nil with respect to civil works as of
January 1988, two months before the original closing date.
22. Disbursements proceeded well at the onset of the project, slowed down during 1985-86, then
picked up in 1987 and remained high until the closing date The closing date had been extended three
times from March 31, 1988 to December 31, 1990. Disbursement policies and procedures were
generally followed, and three national staff had attended disbursement seminars organized by the
Bank m Washington. The actual distnbution of expenditures departed from projections, with



-6-
overspending on studies and long-term advsos, and underspending on equipment, trang, and
operating costs.
23.   Audit andAccouning. The covenant on annual auditmg of project accounts was not respected.
The first independent audit wa carried out in June 1990,   ately five years behind schedule.
Although auditors were able to reconcile project expenditures with DA's disbursements, they fonmd
that project accounting was usatay. Ependiturs had not been properly reterod, the books
were not well kept, and the system of intemal control ws weaL The lng delay in carying out the
independent audit of accounts was largely due to the inability of the Ministry of Planning to keep
track of all expenditures inred and to gather the required documentation from various project
components in time and under usable forms.
24.   Prowwnen  This was another area which accounted for long delays and sometms
misunderstanding. Recruitment of consultants took a long time. For example, it took almost a year
to complete the recruitment of a system analyst for the Ministry of Planning; short-term consultant
contract often took over six months to clear through varous channels. Many contract were signed
before a 'no-objection was requested; and the Goerment often complained that the Bank's review
process took too long. Several factors contributed to the procurement problems. First, all matters
requirng deciions had to go through the Ministty of Planng as the project implementing agency,
second, since project management is part of a miistry strucure, clearance by the local Central
Procuement Commission was required; third, frequent staff changes, both in the Government and
at the Bank, brought some discontinuity in folow-up; fourth, the preparation of appropriate
documentation, in partcula tehnicha specifications, and their review afterards required speialized
expertise that neither the Government nor the Bank could provide in a timely manner, and finally,
there was a general lack of experience and famfliarity with Bank's procuement polcies and
procedures on the part of the Government.
Organkation and Managment
25.   Many of the problems in implementation refect deficiencies in project management and
monitoringo which in turn stemmed from an inappropriate implementation structure and the Ministry
of Planning's misconception of their role in the process.
26. Although the project involved different executing agencies and ministries, the Ministry of
Planning acted as the coordinator. Yet no project coordinating system was set up in order to program,
schedule and follow-up project activities in each component, and to define the relationships beteen
the agencies respk nsible for project components and the Mnistry of Planning as project coordinator.
The work programs developed for expatriate advisors and their counterparts were an improvement
over the previous TA projects, but they had limited usefulness as they were not effectively integrated
into the work programs and budgets of the components and units whose suppott they provided. Thus
the project did not have the proper tools to monitor important activities and ambiguity regarding the
role of the Ministry of Planning often led to conflicts and impasses. This problem is being tackled
under the follow-up TA credit, Economic Management and Public Enterpries (1795-BU), through
decentralization of the project management process.
27. The absence of a project accounting system was pointed out by the auditors in their 1990
report. Isb weakness accounted for the long delay in contract payments and in carrying out the audit
covenant, since supporting documents in usable form were nt readily available. Ihese had to be

gathered, analyzed and reconciled, from various project components long after expenditures had been
incurred.
28.   The poor implementation performance suggests that Project Administration Division J the
Ministry of Planning had insufficient capacity to handle the many complicated matters of
procurement, disbusement, and accounting of an IDA credit In addition, all procurement had to go
through the local Central Procurement Commission, which caused further delays.
Bank Supewwin
29.   Project supervision was generally inadequate. Only five formal supervision missions were
undertaken during the seven-year project life, with each mission lasting from four to seven days. The
last two missions were carried out in 1990, after the project had been given a problem rating. There
were no superision missions between 1986 and 1988, as these periods coincided with reorganizations
within the Bank and political unrest in Burundi Supevision reports generaly mentioned both
progress and pi blems in project implementation (e.g. hring of consultants, appointment of national
staffE status of studies selection). Reports only rarely made reference to the technical quality of
studies, to their contribution to investment generation, and to progress in institutional strengthening
and training activities. Tis was due to the short duration of supervision mission and in part to the
absence of relevant exertise in missions.
30.   Supervision missions repeatedly urged the Ministy of Plannig to submit six-month study
programs to IDA for review, to set up effective inter-ministerial mechanism for selecting studies, and
to carry out indeprondent audits of project accounts according to covenants, but without much success.
As indicated above, the main reasons for this lack of response were that this Ministry was not
institutionally equipped to carry out effectively al the different types of responsibilities involved in
proect implementation. It would seem that substantial help from the Bank would have been
necessary, especially to clarfy the Ministry's role as a project coordiatig agency and as a central
force in the planing system.
Donor Coordiation
31. Donor coordination appeared to have been ad hoc, as there was no overall institutional
framework to guide donors' actions Project files do not give a clear picture of what other donors
were doing in the planning area. As regards reinforcement of the country's planning capacity,
occasional references were made to GIZ (German Cooperation) involvement in project monitoring
and macroeconomic modelling at the Ministry of Planning, French cooperation with the SNES, and
the UNDP's involvement in the training area. No overall assessment is avaiable regarding the
adequacy of various donor actions.

(on public expenditure and the social aspects of adustment) were part of the prepmation of SAC IL

The remaning were complementary studies to address specific problems experienced by on-going

contributed to the socioeconomic data bank; it is not clear, however, whether they fit in with
Burundi's development priorities.

33.   Tran. Reporting on trainmg activities is sketchy, and only one supervision report
mentioned the training programs that were to be organized for the staff of DGPA and SNES in
March-July 1985. No further information eosts on the number of participants, other seminars, or their
resultsL On the basis of exchanges of telexes, it appears that about 20 staff from different ministries
attended short-term specialized courses overseas. Local training was provided on the job by lRAts
expatriate adviorss, who also organized semiars on agricultural planning, computers, and on various
phases of the project cycle. The impact of these trainng activities is not know  since there has been
no foliow-up evaluation; nor was there an overal institutional development plan to provide a basis
for assessing the progress
34.   S&menghng SNES and DGPA. SNES was assigned a statistician under the credit and was
the executing agent of a large agricultural household-budget survey. There is no indication in the fRes
on what were the resuts of the survey. The proposed institutional diagnosis of SNES's organization
and procedures, however, was not carried out. On the other hand, the DOPA component was
relatively successful, paricularly in the area of training. his can be attributed to several factors: (i)
the trainers had direct access to the three dvsion heads of DPA; (ii) training programs that were
prepared annually in collaboration with counterparts of the DWPA (ii) incentives were provided to
national staff and (iv) DGPA had a dynamic and competent Director-GeneraL It is, thus, not
surprising that the impact of project support under this component was positive during the project
life. Its sustainability, nevertheless, would raquire that working conditions in the civil service be
considerably improved.
K CondsIons nd Lessons Leaned
35.   Despite its sgnifict impact in the preparation of SAC II and the Coffee project, and some
modest results in the agricultural investment planning and statistics components, TA m generally
failed to achieve its two basic objecdves, namely financing pre-mvestment studies to generate new
projects, and strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministries of Planning and Agriculture
in investment programming and project monitoring. This lack of success stemmed largely fom the
centralist view of the Ministiy of Planng regarding its role in the planning process, and from its lack
of institutional capacity to coordinate and support project activities.
36.   Several lessons maybe drawn from this expeence. Most importantly, the institutional capacity
of the ministries must be given more weight in the determination of techmcal assistance. There is
also a clear need to desi  an appropriate organization and management structure for the project,
through careful analysis of the tasks to be carried out. A crucal distinction should be made between
overall coordination of project activities and day-to-day administration (procurement, accounting), and
a monitoring system should be included in the project's design (including requirement for annual work
program and budget, with indicators and timetables) to ensure smooth implementatin and continuity
in project supervision

37.   National staff should be trained at an early stage of the project in Bank policies and
procedures regarding disbument, procurement, and project accountiqg with periodic follow-up to
ensure that new staff are also properly trained in these areas. All aspects of project implementation
should be reviewed during supervision missions which should be staffed with sectoral, organizational
and administrative epertise.

PART I - BORROWR'S ASSESSMET OF PROGRAM  WIMPLEMETAT7ON
38.   The Govement's  ement of the Third Technical Assistance Credit is availabe from the
Africa Information Center (in French). It includes: (i) an introduction descnbing the different
catgories and obdcives of the project; (ii) an evaluation of the Govemnment's performance in the
execution of the project citing results obtained and constraints encountered; (iii) an evaluation of the
Bank's perfmance in the execution of the project; and (iv) conclusions and recommendations for
improving project performance in the future. Overal, the Government's assessment of the project
is more positive than that of the Bank but consistent with the Bank's findings.
39. Although the Government deemed the project to be satisfactory overall, it did point out some
problems with the different components. It was noted that a lack of traing on the part of Ministry
staff involved in the project inhibited their ability to cary out the tasks that had been delegated to
them (particularly staff of the DGPA and the SNES). Ihis is pardy due to insufficient prior
knowledge on the part of the staf and partly due to defects in the formulation of the trainig
component of the project.
40.   Other problems stemmed from poor project manag t, the turnover of project managers
and Bank task managers and the ifequency of supervon missions. The infrequency of these
missios inhibited the resolution of problems that arose during the execution of the project, such as
those associated with the establishment of a project monitoring system, could not be resolved in time.
Problems in project      twere largely due to: (i) absence of a defined strucre to monitor
projects and to ensure that Bank project management procedures were followed; (ii) a lack of
communication between the Govment and the Bank cnering the terms of reference for studies,
the recruitment of consultants and contract signature; and (iii) slow and burdensome administrative
procedures
41.   Following the supervision mission of October 1988, these problems were progressively
resolved. The pace of disbursements accelerated, criteria for the selection of studies were formulated
and agreement was reached on the principal elements and procedures concening the management
of the Study Fund. During the supervio mission of May 1990, the question of establishing a project
management structure was discssd. Tbis was implemented with the creation of the Unit in Charge
of Administation of Project Studies which is currently operationaL
42.   The recommendations fomulated are geared toward reinforcing project nmagement and are
based on the constraints encountered in the past. First, there needs to be an imprment in the
exchange of information between the Bank and the Government. This can be attained through
regular meetings of agency heads on external assistance, joint visis of projects and increased
supervision missions. Second, admiistrative procedures in procurement, selecton of consultants and
disbursements should be simplified and taiing and imational sessions should be conducted
regularly by the Bank on the procedures relafte to the moblization and utiliation of Credit funds
Fmially, traiing and local capacity building should be reioed tough greater participation of
national experts in apprabal missions and through renforement of the training component. The
latter could be achieved by according more importance to the development of human resources
through the ganting of fellowships, the integrtion of national experts in the project and of local
consultants in feasibility studie.
