MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF ANGOLA
FOR A HEALTH PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Angola for SDR 14.2 million (US$ 19.9 million equivalent)
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help strengthen the Ministry of Health (MOH)
capabilities in health policy, sector management, and services delivery in selected regions. No co-
financing is anticipated under this credit.
Country Background
2.    While Angola is potentially one of the richest countries in Africa thanks to its endowment in
natural resources (including petroleum, iron, manganese, diamonds and fertile soil), its economy is
one of the most distorted in the continent. Since independence in 1975, the country grew increasingly
dependent upon the petroleum sector which represents about half of GDP. The GDP per capita,
estimated at US$620 in 1990, is closely linked to oil prices. In 1990, oil export earnings amounted
to US$3 billion, equivalent to more than 90 percent of the country's total export earnings. On the
other hand, the non-oil sectors' performance has been poor; it is estimated that their per capita
growth has been negative since the early 1980s. The performance of agriculture is a case in point:
an important net exporter of agricultural products before independence, Angola has in recent years
been increasingly dependent on food imports and food aid to feed its urban population. The capacity
utilization of existing manufacturing industries has been severely affected by the lack of inputs, spare
parts and maintenance services, as well as by a distorted policy environment.
3.     Angola's economic decline since independence is largely explained by three factors: (a) the
civil war, which has made much of the countryside too insecure for agricultural production and
transport, required heavy military expenditures (contributing to chronically large fiscal deficits,
despite substantial revenues from oil), and destroyed a large part of the economic and social
infrastructure; (b) unusually severe human resource constraints, aggravated by the massive exodus
of Portuguese settlers at independence; and (c) misguided economic policies that have created a highly
distorted system, with a formal urban economy (largely public) managed by administrative controls,
and a large parallel economy. Several important political and economic steps have been taken since
1991, including the peace agreement in May 1991, significant devaluations of the local currency, and
the holding of the first round of general elections in September 1992. But, the loss by the opposition
of that first round led to renewal of major fighting in several areas of the country. Negotiations for
a cease-fire are now underway, but it remains uncertain how quickly a new peace agreement can be
put in place. In spite of those current political uncertainties, the proposed project, however, can be
implemented because its main components, including institutional development, training and facilities
rehabilitation, are located in safe areas, with easy access for project management and Bank
supervision.
4.     Social Indicators. The total population is estimated at 10 million, with an annual growth rate
of 2.8 percent. With 45% of the population under 15 years of age, the demographic momentum is
high. The social conditions are poor as compared to other Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries.
This is the combined result of the civil war, inappropriate social policies, rural-urban migrations, and
emigration of skilled manpower. The infant mortality rate is 172 per thousand, (the SSA average is
157); life expectancy at birth is estimated at 46 years (51 years for SSA); less than 30 percent of the
population has access to health services and safe water; the gross enrollment rate in the first year of



-2-
basic education is estimated at only 50 percent.  Regional disparities in social conditions are
substantial as a result, in particular, of war-induced destruction. Poverty in rural areas is acute as
revealed by high malnutrition rates among under-fives and pregnant women. In addition to the
stagnation in economic activity, the main factors contributing to rural poverty are the interruption of
normal links to the cities.
Sector Background and Issues
5.     The health sector is faced with three major inter-related issues: (i) the weakness of MOH
planning and management capacity; (ii) the limited coverage and quality of health services; and (iii)
the weakness of priority public health programs such as AIDS control and family planning services.
Until recently, the government has failed to establish a specific national health policy and has used
as a substitute the concept of health for all through primary health care, without translating it into
operational strategies and resource allocations. There is an almost complete absence of health services
in rural areas.  The war situation has led to direct destruction of health facilities and massive
migrations of health personnel to urban areas, particularly Luanda; as a consequence 70 percent of
the population do not have access to modern health care. The health personnel's lack of qualifications
for both service delivery and administration has led to poor quality of care at all levels of the health
system and major inefficiencies in the use of resources. The donor community and NGOs have
attempted to address these issues within the constraints created by the war and the lack of government
commitment. The European Economic Community (EEC) and Swedish International Development
Agency (SIDA) provide the largest support to the sector, including: major rehabilitation of health
facilities in Luanda; long-term support for health manpower training; supplies of essential drugs; and
technical assistance to MOH's coordination of donor activities. The United Nations Fund for
Population Activities (UNFPA) and World Health Organization (WHO) are supporting the family
planning program and AIDS control programs, respectively. The African Development Bank (AfDB)
is financing an essential drugs project and sectoral studies. The Catholic Church runs several
facilities in the country and several NGOs are also active in the sector. All these efforts have been
successful in avoiding a collapse of the health system but are insufficient for rebuilding an efficient
health structure. Reconstruction requires a good sectoral strategy and incremental resources. The
demobilization of military health personnel, if well managed, would greatly improve health service
delivery. It would double the number of health workers and physicians available to the population.
Sector Strategy
6.     The government has prepared a Policy Statement for the health sector based on a three-
pronged strategy to improve health care in the country: (a) immediate large-scale operational support
to basic medical care, with a focus on maternal and child health; (b) rehabilitation of the health
infrastructure, starting with the most dilapidated facilities; and (c) restructuring of the health system
to improve its coverage and efficiency. Part (a) of the strategy is aimed at addressing the most urgent
medical needs of the most vulnerable population groups through the provision of medical supplies in
adequate quantities for priority public health programs such as malaria control, immunizations,
treatment of communicable diseases, AIDS prevention and family planning. The health personnel
in charge of delivering these services will benefit from in-service training and technical assistance to
improve their performance. Part (b) of the strategy will complement and enhance the operational
support previously described. The rehabilitation program will be balanced between primary health
care facilities and hospital structures on the basis of the National Health Plan being prepared by the



- 3 -
MOH. Part (c) of the strategy will have a long term impact by addressing imbalances and structural
inefficiencies of the current health system.
7.     The restructuring of the health system will be guided by a reform  agenda defining the
respective roles of the State and the non-governmental sector in health care. The basic principles of
such a restructuring have been enunciated in the Health Policy Statement which stresses the
responsibilities of the State for financing and monitoring health programs with large externalities and
for ensuring equity in the access to health care. IDA will support the implementation of the national
health sector strategy, in close collaboration with other donors already involved in this sector.
Project Objective and Description
8.     The main objective of the project is to assist the government increase access to basic health
services as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  This requires immediate strengthening of the
government's policy making and sector management capacity. The project objective is coherent with
and complementary to other donor-supported activities in the areas of health, population and nutrition.
By focusing on specific areas of the country and limiting the interventions to selected programs, the
project will permit to test certain approaches and assess their replicability on a national scale.
9.     The project would support the above objectives through two components:
Strengthening Health Sector Policy and Management -- would assist MOH in making the
national health system more efficient through: (a) a technical assistance program aimed at
improving (i) health policy formulation, with a focus on delineating the specific roles of the
public and private sectors, defining a core package of health services for which the
government would guarantee universal access, and fine tuning health sector legislation and
its translation into effective programs; (ii) investment planning and donor coordination in the
health sector; and (iii) financial management and monitoring of expenditures; (b) a short-term
in-service training program in health planning and health economics for key staff of MOH
and other agencies involved in the restructuration of the health sector; and (c) prospective
studies in the areas of infrastructure rehabilitation, human resource development and health
sector financing.
Support to Selected Programs -- aims to: (a) strengthen the on-going priority National AIDS
Control Program (PNLS, executed by WHO) and the National Family Planning Program
(PNPF, executed by UNFPA) by providing technical assistance, training, equipment and
contraceptives; (ii) rehabilitation of selected health posts in the Huila Province in
collaboration with Physicians Without Borders (MSF - Spain); (iii) relocation, rehabilitation
and upgrading of the Health Professional School and its health center, two health posts, and
the pediatric center in Lubango; and (iv) rehabilitation of the Porto Amboim Hospital (the
only facility in the area able to provide primary and secondary health care) and two health
posts which will be implemented by the Catholic Church.
10.    The estimated total project cost is about US$22.2 million, with a foreign exchange component
of US$18.8 million (approximately 85 percent). Schedule A contains the project cost summary and
financing plan and Schedule B contains the amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements,
as well as a disbursement schedule. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
IDA operations in Angola are given in Schedule C and D respectively. A map showing the locations



- 4 -
of the project facilities is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10750-ANG is being distributed
separately.
Project Implementation
11.    MOH's Planning Department will be responsible for the implementation of this project. A
project implementation unit (PIU) has been put in place within this Department for financial
management and overall project coordination. The PIU is responsible for: (i) coordinating the
implementation of all components and monitoring progress in project implementation; (ii) facilitating
the liaison with the various technical departments of MOH; and (iii) reporting on procurement,
disbursement and auditing. Some field activities will be implemented through implementation
agreement with a foreign institution and by experienced agencies, including WHO, UNFPA, the
Catholic Church and MSF-Spain. These entities will submit quarterly and annual reports to the PIU
on the status of their activities. In addition, progress will be assessed on the basis of specific project
performance indicators set forth for this project. Soon after credit effectiveness there will be a
project launch workshop during which an implementation manual including sample bidding documents
and progress reports will be finalized. There will be annual project reviews and a mid-term review
is planned after two and a half years of project implementation.
Proiect Sustainability
12.    Annual incremental recurrent costs implications of the project are minimal and represent less
than 1 % of the total budget in the sector. The operational sustainability of the project will be
achieved by relying on qualified technical assistance, experienced NGOs and other decentralized
entities with field experience to implement the various project components at the periphery. The
sustainability of each of the project components will be reviewed during the mid-term review.
Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement
13.    The proposed project is the first health sector operation supported by the Bank group in
Angola. However, certain weaknesses have been taken into consideration on the basis of the findings
of the sector work currently being prepared by IDA, other donors' experience in the sector, and
consultant's work who assisted the government in the preparation of the project. In particular, the
lack of experienced managerial and technical staff has led to the establishment of a strong managerial
structure within MOH's Planning Department and the implementation of a comprehensive capacity
building program including training and technical assistance. In addition, NGOs active in the sector
have been selected for implementation of specific components.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
14.    The proposed operation is an important element of IDA's country strategy which was
discussed by the Board in January 1992 and aims at promoting economic growth, improving the poor
social conditions and ensuring that the country's environment is protected. In close cooperation with
other external aid agencies, IDA will provide resources needed to improve the dismal health situation
which constitutes a severe impediment to the country's rehabilitation. The project will complement
the education sector credit (approved in FY92) in a coherent approach aimed at promptly responding
to basic needs.  In addition, this operation will assist the government in better fulfilling its



- 5 -
institutional role in the health sector. It will set in motion a momentum which will lead to a better
investment strategy for health care development and to a more efficient use of financial and human
resources. It is anticipated that, if project implementation is satisfactory, a second operation will be
promptly prepared to speed up the recovery process and achieve major improvements in the health
status of the population.
Agreements Reached
15.   During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that: (i) the Policy Statement will be
updated during the mid-term review; (ii) each year of project implementation, the PIU will make
available to IDA the necessary documents related to project implementation and the status of the
works financed under the project; (iii) every calendar year, the MOH will present to the Association
for comments the draft annual recurrent health budget for the following calendar year, and by
October 31, 1994, the MOH will submit to the Association for comments a draft investment plan for
the period 1995-1999; (iv) no later than June 30, 1993, MOH will provide IDA with a document
defining the potential involvement of demobilized health personnel in the health sector; and (iv) IDA's
standard bidding documents for goods and works and IDA's standard letter of invitation for
consultants will be used by the PIU and NGOs for project implementation.
16.   For credit effectiveness, the Government will: (i) open a project account in a commercial
bank acceptable to IDA and make an initial deposit of US$200,000; and (ii) sign a contract with an
independent auditor responsible for auditing project accounts in accordance with technical and
contractual terms satisfactory to the Association. A satisfactory implementation agreement with
relevant implementation agencies is a condition of disbursement for each rehabilitation subcomponent.
Environmental Aspects
17.   The project is assigned environmental category "C". The project's support for improved and
expanded coverage of family planning services will help slow environmental degradation related to
population growth. The project is not expected to have any significant environmental impact with
regards to the rehabilitation of the proposed sites due to the small size of the works to be undertaken.
Program Obiectives Categories
18.   The project is expected to have a positive impact on health sector development (80%), women
in development (10%) and poverty alleviation (10%).
Benefits
19.   The main benefits of the project include: (i) improvement of MOH's policy making and
managerial capabilities that would contribute to a better planned and more focused development of
the health sector; (ii) contribution to the establishment of an effective and sustainable health care
system geared towards providing basic health care; (iii) improvement of human resource qualifications
needed to provide quality health services; (iv) reinforcement of the efficiency and management of
current expenditures as well as the relevance of investment expenditures within the sector and relative
to the macro-economic framework; (v) increased health care coverage in the areas which will benefit
from project support; and (vi) expansion of the AIDS and family planning programs.

Risks
20.   The main risks of this project are: (i) the weakness of MOH in planning and management and
the scarcity of qualified personnel with experience in IDA's implementation and procurement
procedures; (ii) the difficulties related to the execution of works because of a weak local
administration; and (iii) the political uncertainty. In order to minimize the first risk, the project will
strengthen MOH's planning, programming and implementation capacities through human resources
rationalization and training and the provision of equipment to the central as well as peripheral levels.
In addition, a project implementation unit staffed with technical assistance experienced in IDA's
procurement procedures will provide management training to nationals. Regarding the second risk,
the project will rely on NGOs that are experienced in implementing projects on the ground such as
the Catholic Church, and MSF - Spain to undertake the various activities and provide them with the
necessary funding for equipment, training and technical assistance. The third risk should be
minimized by the fact that all political parties agree on the urgent need for improving health care and
that the objectives and components of the project are not sensitive to policy changes.
Recommendation
21.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
1.     Angola joined the Bank, IFC and MIGA in September 1989. The Bank's initial approach has
been to nurture trust between Angola and the Bank so as to develop the type of mature partnership
that the Bank has with other Borrowers; to help strengthen the country's weak institutions; to assist
in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure; and to initiate a dialogue on policy reform
priorities and reconstruction needs. Concurrently, the Bank began an active economic and sector
work program to build knowledge of the economy and identify the main policy reform priorities.
2.     In June 1991, the Board approved the first Credit to Angola for Economic Management and
Capacity Building (EMCB). In FY92-93, it approved six credits for infrastructure rehabilitation
engineering, urban environment, education, power and transport rehabilitation, and financial
institutions modernization. Six credits are effective and disbursements have picked up in FY93,
despite the difficult country security situation. Disbursements are accelerating and, as of March 31,
1993, stood at US$8.7 million. The credit for the Transport Recovery Project, approved by the
Board in September 1992, is not yet effective because of the absence of security in main project
areas. Several projects are at an advanced preparation stage, but their final processing depends on
the evolution of the political and security situation and the government's ability to implement the
existing portfolio.
3.     EMCB became effective in December 1992. It was off to a slow start, partly because of
inexperience and lack of familiarity with Bank procedures and partly because of objective difficulties
in the working environment and logistical supports. The project is now staffed with a good team of
competent and dedicated professionals; the office is reasonably well organized; satisfactory work
procedures have been established; and implementation is underway. Some key components, notably
human resource development, are on. target, while others, such as the studies on economic
liberalization, are just starting. Credit disbursements continue to be behind appraisal projections, but
are expected to accelerate because commitments have increased. The Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Engineering Credit became effective in February 1992, and implementation has been satisfactory
though disbursements are about three months behind schedule because of delays in processing
payments and disbursement applications. The Financial Institutions and Modernization Project is on
schedule but other projects that include part of their activities in areas affected by hostilities will
continue to face delays until peace is reestablished.
4.     Project implementation is receiving the attention that the Borrower's relative inexperience and
institutional weakness require. Consequently, in order to compensate for the weak implementation
capacity, unfamiliarity with Bank procedures, and to help ensure that operations get off on the right
foot, the Bank has allocated about 21 percent of its Angola resources for supervision in FY94-96,
although the portfolio is young and still relatively small. The Bank has introduced the practice of
preparing draft implementation manuals for newly approved projects and finalizing these manuals
during project launch workshops. This was done for the Financial Institutions Modernization Credit,
approved by the Board in September 1992, which became effective in a record five weeks. A
country procurement assessment has been initiated, and procurement training is being carried out
under all three technical assistance projects financed by the Bank. The first Country Implementation
Review (CIR) is planned for FY94. As part of the CIR preparation, an Action Plan for improving
project implementation is being drawn. The new Bank's Resident Mission, established in August
1992, is expected to make a major contribution to project implementation and supervision.
