Executive Summary
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
East China Electric Power Group Corporation (ECEPGC) proposed to construct
Sijing and Hangdong 500kV Substations locate at suburban of Shanghai and
Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province utilizing the remaining loan of Tianhuangping Project
from the World Bank. The scales of two substations are both 1x750 MVA.
During the project preparation, substation site selection and preliminary design period,
ECEPGC closely cooperated with Shanghai and Hangzhou municipal governments,
and their planning and environmental protection bureaus. It solicited their opinions on
the substations' construction. During environmental impact assessment, the public
participation and survey were carried out to meet the requirement by the Chinese
governrnent and the World Bank.
According to the World Bank's Operational Directive of "Enviromnent Assessment"
CD4.01, this project is classified as category "B". The environrmental impact analysis
need to be caried out. Nanjing Environmental Protection Research Institute for
Electric Power, State Power Corporation of China (NEPRI), entrusted by the
proprietor, conducted the assessment, and prepare this report strictly following the
relative requirements of the Chinese government and the World Bank.

construction area of the substation is flat farmland. There is a small irrigation channel
around east and north sides of the substation. Its width is 20-40 m.
Ecological Environment
The region near Shanghai and Hangzhou is the earlier developed zone in China. The
human activity could trace back thousands years. Sijing and Hangdong 500 kV
Substations will be constructed on the suburban of the large cities. The sites are on the
developed and cultivated lands locating at the rural area near the suburban. There is
no rare or imminent danger species and primitive vegetation.
Social Environment
* Sijing 500 kV Substation
The position of Sijing 500 kV Substation is at Sijing Town of Songjiang County. It is
on the suburban of Shanghai. The population density is 816 (people/km2); the
cultivated area is 32,538 hectare. There are no nearby schools and hospitals.
* Hangdong 500 kV Substation
The location of Hangdong 500 kV Substation is at Qiaosi Town of Hangzhou,
Zhejiang Province. It is on the suburban of Hangzhou. The population density is 363
(people/kin2); the cultivated area is 190,560 hectare. There are no nearby schools and
hospitals either.
There are a lot of history cultural relics in Shanghai and Hangzhou. However, the
ES-2



Executive Summary
survey indicted that no history cultural relics exist within 2 km from Sijing and
Hangdong 500kV Substations.
The selection of the substation sites is as more as possible to keep away from the
villages, towns and planning zone. There are only some scattered residential houses.
However, they don't need to be removed. The nearest residential house is 120 m away
from the substation site.
Living Qualit) Environment
The National Gross Product in Shanghai is 22,275 RMB/year per person. The average
wages is 10,663 RMB/year for staff and workers, and 5,506RMB/year for peasants.
The total annual consumption of the electricity is 29.304 billion kWh.
The National Gross Product in Hangzhou is 15,095 RMB/year per person. The
average wages is 8,751 RMB/year for staff and workers, and 4,420 RMB/year for
peasants. The total annual consumption of the electricity is 47.934 billion kWh.
Environment Quality Status
Sijing and Hangdong 500kV Substations both locate at rural area near suburban.
There are no any factories around the sites. The natural environrnent such as
atmospheric and acoustic environment is very good.
POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENT IMPACT
The environment impacts during construction will mainly come from the construction
noise, the secondary rising dust, occupying land and cutting down trees, as well as the
effect on the transportation from the construction carriages. During the operation,
there will be no much waste gas, water and sediment emitted. The main impacts
during the operation will be electromagnetic radiation and noise.
Construction Period
* Water Pollution from the Water Utilization during the Construction
During the construction, water will mainly be used by the concrete mixing. The water
volume used by the construction of two substations is about 15 m3/day, respectively.
This is a very small number, and there will be no impact on the surrounding water
body.
The living sewage used by the construction workers will be treated by precipitation,
then discharged after meeting the discharge standard and utilized for irrigation. It will
ES-3



Executive Summary
be no impact on the environment.
* Rising Dust
Some stripped topsoil and sediment will become rising dust during the transportation
during construction period. It will have some impact on the environment shortly.
However, the affected scope will be very limited and environmnent will be
immediately recovered after the construction completed.
* Construction Noise
The maximum boundary noise level during the construction period predicted will be
82dB(A). Due to the high noise construction machines. e.g. excavator, bulldozer and
so on, will be restricted to be used on daytime, the noise level will meet the value of
65-85dB(A) required by the environment standard.
- Land Function
The land occupied by the station sites is cultivated farmland. The construction of the
substations will change the agricultural land into the industrial land.
* Vegetation and Trees
The construction of the substations will destroy some vegetation and cut down some
trees. This activity could not be recovered.
* Precious and Rare Animals
According to the survey, there are no precious and rare animals in the substation
areas.
* Agriculture Ecology
The total area occupied by the substations is 22.15 ha. It is all the farmland. The
growing and harvest of the crops on the occupied land will be affected by the
construction of the substations.
The construction access roads will temporarily occupy 0.72 ha land. The impact on
the crops is temporal and will be recovered after the construction finished.
* Transportation
The total construction cubic meter of earth and stone for Sijing and Hangdong 500kV
Substations is 79,565 m3 and 49,662 m3, respectively. The traffic flow on the nearby
ES4



Executive Summary
roads will increase by 145 trucks and 91 trucks each day.
* Culture Resources
Sijing and Hangdong 500kV Substations both locate in the suburban. The regions are
farmland right now. There are no any nearby schools, hospitals or culture and
entertainment sites.
* History Relics
There are no any known surface or underground history relics within 2,000 m from
the substations. The construction will be no harmful impact on the history heritage.
* Labor Force Input
There is no conflict in employment and culture between station construction
workforce and local labor.
Operation Period
-  Water Environment
The living sewage used by the operation staff in Sijing and Hangdong 500kV
Substations will be treated by waste water treatment system, then discharged after
meeting the discharge standard and utilized for irrigation.
The leaked oil from the transformer, the wastewater containing oil can be temporarily
stored on the accident oil pool located under the transformer. It will be treated
centralized and discharged after meeting the discharge standard. The oil contained in
the wastewater must be lower than 10 mg/I.
Chinese government has issued the standard "Control Standard for Waste Pollution
Containing Polychlorinated Biphenyl" GB13015-91. The facility containing PCB has
been prohibited in the substation. So, there will be no PCB pollution.
* Vegetation and Trees
Original vegetation and trees on the station sites will be destroyed permanently and
will not be recovered. But the trees, grass and flowers will be grown in the station
area forcefully.
* Transportation
The entrance roads, exit roads, as well as compensated roads will improve the traffic
ES-5



Executive Summary
status and increase the transportation capacity.
*  Agriculture Production
The station sites will occupy 22.15 ha farmland. Supposed 7.5 tons crops produced on
each hectare every year, the construction of the substations will decrease the crop
production by 166 tons per year. This will account 0.00004% of total crop production.
*  Electromagnetic Radiation (Electrostatic Induction)
The environment impact of electromagnetic radiation is only limited in the
operational period. The maximum electric field intensity outside the fence of the
substations will not exceed 4 kV/m during the operational period for Sijing and
Hangdong 500 kV Substations. It is lower than limited level of 5 kV/m at the fence of
distribution facilities. This meets the requirement by the Chinese standard. It will be
no impact on the ambient environment.
* Noise
During the operation, some machines and electric facilities will produce some noise.
However, two substations both locate on rural area, acoustic environment is very good
there. When the substations is put into operation, the impact of their operational noise
on the acoustic environment is very small. The noise will basically keep- at the
original level. The operational noise at the boundary of two substations is predicted to
meet the requirements of China and the World Bank which require the noise must be
lower than 55 dB (A) in daytime and 45 dB (A) at night.
* Historical Cultural Relics
There are no surface or underground history relics within 2,000m from the substations.
There will be no impact on the history heritage, historical sites and scenic spots in
operational period.
* Labor Force Input
The staff of the substations will come from local specialists. There is no conflict with
local labor on the employment and culture.
* Living Quality Environment
The construction of the substations is analogous to build a local electric power station.
It will mitigate the electricity shortage, and will supply adequate electricity. It is
beneficial to the development of regional economics and improvement of people's
living quality.

Executive Sunmmary
Resettlement
According to immigration resettlement survey results, there will be no immigration
and resettlement needed for two substation's sites.
Land occupation and purchasing of two substations will affect 87 persons and 140
trees will be cut down. The total budget of compensation in Resettlement is
41,833.194x103 RMB.
ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
No-action Scheme
In the view of electricity network, East China Electricity Network (ECEN) has a few
500 kV power supplying points, the capacity of supplying electricity is small, network
basis is weak, and the voltage quality is poor. It is urgent to build new nodes. If this
project is not newly built, the capacity of ECEN and its operational safety could not
be increased. The economical efficiency of electric power industry will not increase
either.
Sijing 500 kV Substation is component subproject of phase eight of Shanghai Wujing
Electric Power Plant. It will connect local 500 kV and 220 kV systems.. The
construction of Hangdong 500 kV Substation will mitigate seriously overload
problem of Pingyao 500 kV Substation. It will increase the load-bearing capacity of
500 kV network, and improve 220 kV network structure. If this station is not built, the
electricity from power plants can not be carried out. The electricity shortage situation
will not be improved. The safety of supplying the electricity and the voltage quality
will not be guaranteed. The socioeconomic development and improvement of
people's living quality will be seriously limited.
Substation is clean electricity supply site without pollution. Building new power
station instead of building substation will increase new pollutant source and raise the
pressure on the city's environment.
From socioeconomic point of view, network safety and environmental protection,
without building this project is unprofitable and is unfeasible. Therefor, the
construction of this project is absolutely necessary.
Scheme Comparison
During the site selection survey, the project sites were preliminarily chosen in
accordance with the opinion from local city planning and relative bureaus. After
comparing and expounding, the final sites of the substations were recommended.
ES-7



Executive Summar!
Recommended site for Sijing 500 kV Substation has no households to be removed. It
will not affect planning zones and highways. The site is wide open; the condition of
entrance and exit is very good. The investment of the substation is moderate.
Recommended site for Hangdong 500 kV Substation has no impact on Xiasha
Economic Development Zone. The entrance and exit roads are short. Construction.
transportation and living are all convenient. The investment is low.
RECOMMENDED MITIGATING MEASURES
In order to minimize and mitigate the environment impact on a maximum, the
recommended mitigation measures are as follows.
Construction Period
* Noise
During the construction of the substations, the low noise machines should be used so
that the noise impact on the environment will be decreased to a minimum level.
Utilization of high noise facilities (acoustic level of the source higher than 80 dB (A))
must be prohibited at night.
* Rising Dust
Dug earth during the construction must be refilled in time. Temporarily piled up earth
in the construction site must be sprayed with water regularly, covered with fabric to
avoid dust rising.
* Water Body
The wastewater sewage from the construction and living activity will be treated with
precipitating tank, and then will be used in irrigation.
* Agriculture Ecology
The construction of the substations, entrance and exit roads will occupy the
agricultural land temporarily. This will be compensated. The occupied land should be
recovered rapidly after the construction.
* Vegetation and Trees
During the construction of the substations, entrance and exit roads, some trees will be
cut down. Besides some compensation must be paid, the trees should be planted in
ES-8



Executive Summary
other places.
* Nearby Residential and Sensitive Area
The selection of the sites is as more as possible to avoid the sensitive areas such as
residential area and schools.
During the construction, protected fence and safety signs should be installed around
the construction sites. The occupied area by the construction materials should be as
little as possible to avoid the accident.
* Transportation
The refill and transportation of the construction materials during the construction
period should avoid the rush hour traffic.
* Land Occupation and Compensation
The period of land occupation by the construction sites, entrance and exit roads
should be as short as possible. The occupied area should be as little as possible also.
The land occupation must be compensated according to the relative regulation. After
completion of the construction, the temporarily occupied land should be recovered.
The land under the substation sites will be occupied permanently. It should be
purchased according to the regulations.
* Cultural Relics and Historic Sites
If the cultural relics and historic sites are chance found during the construction, the
sites should be defended and they must be reported to the local cultural relic
administration office.
Operation Period
* Noise
The proposed substations should adopt low noise facilities. The main equipment, for
exarnple transformers, high reactors and so on should meet the requirement whose
noise level is not higher than 7OdB(A). Around the noising equipment such as the
main transformers, fans, a closed sound insulation screen should be installed. Trees
and flowers should be planted to absorb the noise.
* Electromagnetic Field
The substations must adopt the equipment those meet the radiation standard. In design

4 Environment Impact by the Project
4.1 Recognition of Environmental Impact Factors
According to the features of substation project, the impact factors in construction and
operation periods are listed in Table 4-l and 4-2 respectively. This project is a
construction of substations; it is different from the construction of electric power plant.
The environmental impact from construction is also very important parts. As this
project, the main impact comes from the construction noise, secondary rising dust,
land occupation, cutting trees, and construction transportation. When the project is
completed and goes to operation. there will be no waste gas, wastewater and waster
sediment material discharged. The main environmental impact during the operation is
electromagnetic field and noise.

4.2 Environmental Impact during Construction Period
4.2.1 Natural Environment
4.2.1.1 Water Environment
4.2.1.1.1 Nearby Water Body
The width of the nearby rivers around two substations is less than 80m. The
substations need not to build the tows in the water for output lines. The construction
will not affect the water body.
4.2.1.1.2 Water Utilization and Pollution during the Construction
The water is mainly used for concrete mixing during the construction. The water
volume consumed is 15 m3/day for each station. It is very little. There will be no
effect on the water body.
The living consumed water by the construction persons will be treated by the
precipitate tank and discharged after it meets the discharge standard.
4.2.1.2 Rising Dust
Sijing and Hangdong 500kV Substations will be both new constructed. The
construction period will be one year. During the construction, transportation of some
14



Environmental Assessment Report
surface soil and sediment will possibly produce some rising dust. This will have
short-term impact on the surrounding environment, but the scope is not large. When
the construction is completed, this impact will disappear. According to the
construction management guidelines, a screen should be installed round the
construction site. The truck transporting sediment must be sprayed by the water and
covered by the fabric to avoid the dust dropped or rising. After doing so, the impact
from the construction will be greatly reduced.
4.2.1.3 Acoustic Environment
4.2.1.3.1 Assessment Standard
The assessment standards of noise for this project are listed in Table 4-3. These
standards are suitable for urban area. For the rural area they can be executed
accordingly.

4.2.1.3.2 Survey of Noise Level of the Construction Equipment
During the construction, the construction equipment will produce noise. According to
an analogy survey, the noise levels of the main construction machines are listed in
Table 4-4.
Table 4-4 Noise Level for Main Construction Machines
Machine Name             Distance (m)      Noise Level, dB(A)
Pile Driver                5-7                 90-100
Excavator                  1-2                 95-1 10
Bulldozer                  1-2                  105
Mixer                     1-2                85-100
4.2.1.3.3 Prediction and Analysis of Construction Noise on Boundary
Using noise levels of construction machines gotten in analogy survey as source data
and running prediction model, we can obtain the noise levels at I m outside the site
boundary. The results are listed in Table 4-5. The prediction details can refer to the
Appendix A.

Environmental Assessment Report
Table 4-5 Prediction Results of Noise Levels
Noise Level, dB(A)       Distance to Construction Boundary, m
1    1    50            100
Sijing 500 kV Substation      57-82       42-66        36-61
Hangdong 500 kV Substation    57-82       42-66        36-61
Among the construction machines, the highest noise level comes from excavator,
whose noise levels are as high as 95 - 1 1O dB (A). The noise levels of other machines
are around 85 - 100 dB (A). It can be seen from Table 4-5 that the highest noise level
on the boundary is 82 dB (A). When the high noisinp machines are limited to be used
only on daytime, it is predicted the noise level on construction sites will meet the
relative standards (Table 4-3).
4.2.1.4 Mineral Resources
There are no mineral resources on the station sites. The construction will have no
impact on mineral mining.
4.2.1.5 Land Function
The land occupied by the sites is all farmland. The construction of the station will
change the land from agricultural to industrial utilization.
4.2.2 Ecology Environment
4.2.2.1 Vegetation
The construction of the substations will destroy some vegetation and cut some man-
planted arbor (such as Chinese scholartree, willow. bamboo and so on). This is
unrecoverable.
4.2.2.2 Agricultural Ecology
The station sites will occupy 22.15 ha farmland. From the beginning of the
construction, the crops on the occupied land will be destroyed and production will be
affected.
The roads for the station construction will occupy 0.72 ha land. The impact on the
crops is temporary. When the construction completed, the occupied land can be
recovered.

Environmental Assessment Report
4.2.3 Social Environment
4.2.3.1 Transportation
Total cubic meter of earth and stone for Sijing and Hangdong is 79,565 m3 and 49,662
m3 respectively. The traffic flow on the roads near two station sites will increase by
145 and 91 trucks each day respectively.
4.2.3.2 Transmission Lines
There is a 500 kV Huangdu-Nanqiao transmission circuit line near Sijing 500kV
Substation. The design has followed SDJ3 "Design Technique Criteria for Elevated
Transmission Lines" and relative technique criteria or guidelines, and also followed
operational guidelines of crossing of high voltage lines. The construction will not
impact on the existing transmission lines.
4.2.3.3 Communication Cables
There is a communication cable that is named as 4201 and belongs to Shanghai
Communication Bureau (SCB) passed near Sijing 500kV Substation. According to
design criteria, they must keep a certain distance each other. The project proponent
has an agreement with SCB that the communication cable 4021 will change its route
and round the station. In this case, the construction of Sijing Substation has no impact
on the cable.
4.2.3.4 Agriculture Production
The construction of the substations will cut down crops on the occupied land. This
will reduce the harvest. The construction of the entrance and exit roads will also
occupied some land and will destroy some crops. However, occupied land is not much
and the period lasts not very long (one to two months), the impact is not very big.
4.2.4 Living Quality Environment
4.2.4.1 Culture Resources
Sijing and Hangdong 500kV Substations both locate in suburban where is farmland.
There is no school, hospital and cultural or entertainment spots.
4.2.4.2 Historical Relics
There are no surface or underground historical relics within 2,000m of the substation
sites.
17



Environmental Assessment Report
4.2.4.3 Scenic Spots
The two substations locate in suburban area and the construction of the substations
will have short-tern impact on local scenic spots.
4.2.4.4 Labor Force Input
The construction persons mainly come from a local professional construction
corporation. Because most jobs need special skill, local labor can not meet this
requirement. However, service persons will employ from local peasants. Coming of
the constructional corporation will not conflict with local residents in employment
and culture. Increased requirements for the construction materials, transportation and
service will directly or indirectly create some employment chances and will promote
development of local economy and improvement of local resident's living quality.
4.3 Environmental Impact during Operational Period
4.3.1 Natural Environment
4.3.1.1 Water Environment
The total number of the staff and workers in Sijing and Hangdong 500kV Substation
is 100 respectively. The water volume consumed by the operational persons is 15
m3/day for each station. The wastewater sewage will be 12.5 m3/day. The discharge
concentration of BOD5 is 160 - 280 mg/I; SS is 280 - 400 mg/l. The living
wastewater sewage will be treated by wastewater treatment system, then discharged
after meeting the discharge standards and utilized for irrigation.
In normal case, the transformers have no leaked oil and oil-water pollution produced.
Very little oil-contaminated water is possible discharged during the transformer
maintaining period (once every 5 - 10 years) or accident. This wastewater will be
treated and reused. In accident situation. the leaked oil and oil-contaminated water
will be temporarily stored on the accident oil pool located under the transformer. It
will be treated centralized and be discharged after meeting the discharge standards.
The oil contained in the wastewater must be lower than 10 mg/Il.
Chinese government has issued the standard "Control Standard for Waste Pollution
Containing Polychlorinated Biphenyl" GB13015-91. The facility containing PCB has
been prohibited in the substation. So, there will be no PCB pollution anymore.
4.3.1.2 Atmospheric Environment
Operation of the substations will have no impact on the atmospheric environment.

Environmental Assessment Report
4.3.2 Ecology Environment
4.3.2.1 Valuable and Rare Wild Animals
According to the ecology survey, there no valuable and rare wild animals exist in the
substation areas.
4.3.2.2 Agriculture Land
The land occupied by the substation sites is permanent. The land function is changed
from agricultural into industrial. This is unrecoverable.
4.3.2.3 Vegetation and Trees
Within substation sites the original vegetation and trees will be destroyed permanently.
However, in the sites new trees and flowers will be planted forcefully.
4.3.3 Social Environment
4.3.3.1 Transportation
The construction of the entrance, exit roads and some compensation roads will
improve the local traffic and increase the transportation capacity.
4.3.3.2 Agriculture Production
Occupied land by the station sites is 22.15 ha that is all farmland. This will reduce the
harvest by 166 tons each year if the production is 7.5 tons/ha. This will be 0.00004%
of total annual production.
4.3.3.3 Communication and Broadcast
The design of the station strictly follows the requirements of electromagnetic
environment and protection distance for weak electricity. The operation of the
substations will have no impact on wired or wireless communication and broadcast.
4.3.4 Living Quality Environment
4.3.4.1 Environmental Impact of Electromagnetic Radiation (Electrostatic
Induction)
The environmental impact of electromagnetic radiation is limited during operation
period only.

In the environmental assessment of Jiangsu 500 kV Power Transmission Lines Project
loaned by the World Bank, a field measurement has been carried out in Doushan and
Jiangdu 500 kV Substations that have same scale as this project has. The
measurement spots are chosen on the output side of high voltage distribution
equipment outside the station. The spots are on the farmland along the fence and 3m
to the fence. The origin point locates in the area where the maximum of eleciric field
intensity occurs. The instruments and measurement method follow the criteria of
"Monitoring Instruments and Methods of Electromagnetic Radiation" (HJ/TI0.2-

Above measurement results indicate that the maximum  of electric field intensity
outside the fence of Doushan and Jiangdu 500kV Substations is 2.92 kV/m and 2.87
kV/m respectively. These values are quite lower than 5 kV/m that is the restricted
maximum outside the station fence by the regulation (see Table 1-3). So the
electromagnetic radiation has no harmful impact on the environment.
4.3.4.1.2 Measurement of Background Electric Field Intensity at Proposed
Station Sites
The background electric field intensity at two proposed station sites has been
measured. The results are listed on Table 4-9.
Table 4-9 Background Electric Field Intensity on Proposed Station Sites
Substation Name         Background Electric Field Intensity (V/m)

Hangdong 500 kV Substation                   1.5
The measurement indicates that the background electric field intensity is very low.
4.3.4.1.3 Prediction of Electric Field Intensity on Proposed Station Sites during
Operation Period
From above analysis, it can be predicted that the maximum electric field intensity
outside the fence of two substations will be lower than 4 kV/m during the operation.
This value is less than 5kV/m, the restricted value outside the fence of distribution
equipment by the regulation. It meets the requirement by the Chinese standard and has
no impact on the environment (details can be seen from Appendix B).

Environmental Assessment Report
Operation of the substations will produce hearable mechanical and electric noise. In
the environmental assessment of Jiangsu 500 kV transmission lines project loaned by
the World Bank, a field measurement of the operational noise around the station
boundary has been carried out in Doushan and Jiangdu 500 kV Substations that have
same scale as this project has. The measurement method follows the criteria of
"Measurement Methods of Environmental Noise in Urban" (GB/T14623-93) and
"Measurement Methods of Boundary Noise in Industrial Enterprises" (GB12349-90).
Used measurement instrument is precision acoustic-meter. The measurement results
are shown in Table 4-10.

4.3.4.2.2 Prediction and Analysis of Operational Noise Level on Substation
Boundary
Sijing and Hangdong 500 kV Substations occupy land 115,194 m2 and 106,386 m2
respectively. According to the arrangement of the substations and utilization of
equipment, the operational noise level on the station boundary can be predicted with
relative model, analogy measurement results of relative equipment noise level in
Table A-3 and background noise measurement in Table A-4. The prediction results are
shown in Table 4-11.

Hangdong 500 kV Station   45       46        45       46       56
Sijing and Hangdong 500 kV Substation both locate in rural areas. The acoustic
environment is good. It can be known from Table 4-11 that the operational noise will
have no much impact on the acoustic environment during the operation period. The
noise basically remains on the original level. Compared with Class I in "Noise
Standard on Boundary for Industrial Enterprises" (GB12348-90) and standards of
Class I in "Environmental Noise Standard for Urban" (GB3096-93): daytime 55 dB
(A), nighttime 45 dB (A) (see Table 1-1), it can be predicted that Sijing and
Hangdong substations will basically meet the requirements in above standards during
the operation of two substations.

Environmental Assessment Report
4.3.4.3 Cultural Resources
The operation of the substations will have no harmful impact on the cultural resources.
The operation of this project will supply sufficient electric power and promote
development of culture, health and entertainment.
4.3.4.4 Historical Relics
There are no known surface or underground historical relics within 2000m from the
substations. The operation of the substations will have no harmful impact on the
historical relics.
4.3.4.5 Scenic Spots
The substations are built on rural areas. In design stage, it is as more as possible to
avoid villages, towns, planning zones and residential areas. There will be no impact
on the scenic spots.
4.3.4.6 Labor Force Input
The staff and workers of two substations will come from local professional
technicians. There won't conflict with local residents on employment and culture.
4.3.4.7 Living Quality Environment
The construction of the substations will equivalently build a new power plant. This
will relax electricity shortage and supply sufficient electricity so that it will promote
development of local economy and improvement of local people's living quality.
4.4 Resettlement
(1) According to immigration resettlement survey results, there will be no
immigration and resettlement needed for two substation's sites.
(2) Land occupation and purchasing of Sijing 500kV Substation will affect 87 persons.
140 scattered trees will be cut down. A part of communication cable has to be
moved. 12 km of 10 kV transmission lines, 2.5 km of 380 kV transmission lines, I
km of broadcast cable, 3 km of irrigation channel and one irrigation pump station
will be affected.

Environmental Assessment Report
5 Analysis of Alternatives
5.1 No-Action Scheme
From point of view of electricity network, East China Electricity Network (ECEN)
has forrned 500 kV single-circuit network. ECEN has very few 500 kV power
supplying points. The capacity of supplying electricity is not enough. Network basis
is weak. It is urgent to build new nodes. Because the construction of the substation
falls behind the economy development, the electricity is always in short supplied in
this area. If this project is not approval, the capacity of ECEN and its operational
safety could not be increased. The economical efficiency of electric power industry
will not increase either.
Sijing 500 kV Substation is component subproject of phase eight of Shanghai Wujing
Electric Power Plant. It can output the electricity to the main network. There is no 500
kV substation right now. The construction of Sijing 500kV Substation will connect
local 500 kV and 220 kV systems.
The construction of Hangdong 500 kV Substation will mitigate seriously overload
problem of Pingyao 500 kV Substation. It will increase the load-bearing capacity of
500 kV network, and improve 220 kV network structure. If this station is not built, the
electricity from power plants can not be output effectively. The electricity shortage
situation will not be improved. The safety of supplying the electricity and the voltage
quality will not be guaranteed. The socioeconomic development and improvement of
people's living quality will be seriously limited.
East China is one of economically most developed regions in China. Along with fast
development of economy, the capacity of electricity production and load in ECEN
will continuously increase. Annual increase rate of electricity consumption in this
region is 9%. Substation is clean electricity supply site without pollution. Building
new power station instead of building substation will increase new pollutant source
and raise the pressure on the city's environment. Sijing and Hangdong 500 kV
Substations both locate in suburban of large cities. Building new power plants there
will increase the pressure on environmental protection. Construction of power plants
will also bring another environmental problem of changing large amount of
agricultural land into industrial land.
From socioeconomic point of view, network safety and environmental protection,
without building this project is unprofitable and is unfeasible. Therefor, the
construction of this project is absolutely necessary.

A.2.2 Analogy Measurement of Operational Noise Level
Operation of the substations will produce hearable mechanical and electric noise. In
the environmental assessment of East China Jiangsu 500 kV Power Transmission
Project loaned by the World Bank, a field measurement of the operational noise
around the station boundary has been carried out in Doushan and Jiangdu 500 kV
Substations that have same scale as this project has. The measurement method follows
the criteria of "Measurement Methods of Environmental Noise in Urban"
(GB/T14623-93) and "Measurement Methods of Boundary Noise in Industrial
Enterprises" (GB 12349-90). Used measurement instrument is precision acoustic-
meter. The measurement results are shown in Table A-3.

A.4 Prediction Model and Result Analysis
A.4.1 Noise Prediction Model
The prediction is gotten with usual noise dispersion and attenuation model. The
construction noise and operation noise have been predicted using following basic
formula:
L  = L.i - TL+l10lg( Q  )-      i
47rr1' ) 100
Where Lpn -the nth receptor's noise level, dB(A)
A-2



L., -acoustic power of the ith noise source, dB(A)
TL - insulated noise level by the fence. dB(A)
Q - directive factor of noise source
r,- the distance from the ith noise source to nth receptor. m
M - air decay of sound wave. dB(A)/ 100
In order to guarantee a certain safety factor. meteorological decay and surface effect
will not be considered in the prediction. In the prediction. the equipment noise levels
used in this project. background noise levels and analogy noise levels of construction
machines are inputted into the model as acoustic source parameters.
A.4.2 Construction and Operation Noise Prediction
(I) Prediction and Analysis of Construction Noise Level on Station Boundary
Using noise levels of construction machines gotten in analogy survey as source data
and running prediction model, the noise levels at the site boundary can be predicted.
Sijing and Hangdong 500 kV Substations occupy land 115,194 m2 and 106,386 m2
respectively. According to the arrangement of the substations and utilization of
construction equipment, the construction noise levels on the station boundary can be
predicted with relative model and analogy measurement results of relative equipment
noise levels in Table A-2. The prediction results are shown in Table A-5.
Table A-5 Prediction Results of Construction Noise Level
Noise Level, dB(A)    Distance to Construction Boundary, m
1         50         100
Sijing 500 kV Substation   57-82      42-66       36-61
Hangdong 500 kV Substation    57-82   42-66       36-61
Among the construction machines, the highest noise level comes from excavator,
whose noise is high as 95 - 110 dB (A). The noise levels of other machines are
around 85 - 100 dB (A). It can be seen from Table A-5 that the noise level on the
boundary is 82 dB (A). When the high noising machines are limited to be used only
on daytime, it is predicted the noise levels on construction sites will meet the relative
standards (Table A-3).
(2) Prediction and Analysis of Operational Noise Level on Station Boundary
Sijing and Hangdong 500 kV Substations occupy land 115,194 m2 and 106,386 m2
respectively. According to the arrangement of the substations and utilization of
equipment, the operational noise level on the station boundary can be predicted with
relative model, analogy measurement results of relative equipment noise level in
A-3



Table A-3 and background noise measurement in Table A-4. The prediction results are
shown in Table A-6.
Table A-6 Operational Noise Level Prediction
Substation Name                Noise Level at I in outside Fence
East     Soutlh   West      North    Center
Sijing 500 kV Substation  1   44       46        45       47        57
Hangdong 500 kV Substation   45        46   !   45        46        56
Sijing and Hangdong 500 kV Substation both locate in rural areas. The acoustic
environment is good. It can be known fi-om Table A-6 that the operational noise will
have not much impact on the acoustic environiment during the operation period. The
noise basically remains on the original level. Compared with Class I in "Noise
Standard on Boundary for Industrial Enterprises" (GBI12348-90) and standards of
Class I in "Environmental Noise Standard for Urban"' (GB3096-93): daytime 55
dB(A), nighttime 45 dB(A) (see Table A-l). it can be predicted that Sijing and
Hangdong 500kV Substations will basically meet the requirements in above standards
during the operation period.

(2) Sample of Same Kind of Substation in East China
In the environmental assessment of East China Jiangsu 500 kV Power Transmission
project loaned by the World Bank, a field measurement has been carried out in
Doushan and Jiangdu 500 kV substations that have same scale as this project has. The
measurement spots are chosen on the output side of high voltage distribution
equipment outside the substation. The spots are on the farmland along the fence and
3m to the fence. The origin locates in the area where the maximum of electric field
intensity occurs. The instruments and measurement method follow the criteria of
"Monitoring Instruments and Methods of Electromagnetic Radiation" (HJ/TI0.2-
1996). The measurement results are shown in Table B-4 and Table B-5.

Above measurement results indicate that the maximum  of electric field intensity
outside the fence of Doushan and Jiangdu 500kV Substations is 2.92 kV/m and 2.87
kV/m respectively. These values are quite lower than 5 kV/m that is the restricted
maximum  outside  the  station  fence  by  the  regulation  (Table  B-I). So  the
electromagnetic radiation has no harmful impact on the environment.
B.1.3 Measurement of Background Electric Field Intensity at Proposed
Substation Sites
The background electric field intensity at two proposed station sites has been
measured. The results are listed on Table B-6.
Table B-6 Background Electric Field Intensity on Proposed Substation Sites
Site Name                Background Electric Field Intensity (V/m)
Sijing 500 kV Substation                        1.4
Hangdong 500 kV Substation                        1.3
The measurement indicates that the background electric field intensity is very low.
B.2 Prediction of Electric Field Intensity on Proposed Substation Sites during
Operation Period
From above analysis, it can be predicted that the maximtim  electric field intensity
outside the fence of two substations will be lower than 4 kN'/m during the operation.
This value is less than 5kV/m, the restricted value outside the fence of distribution
equipment by the regulation. It meets the requirement by the Chinese standard and has
no harmful impact on the environment.
