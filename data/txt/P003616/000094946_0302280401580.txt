3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project objectives are to: (a) alleviate an acute shortage of peaking power and enable more efficient



use of power plants in a predominantly coal-fired thermal power system by transferning off-peak energy to
peak with construction of the cost-effective and environmentally sound Tianhuangping pumped-storage
hydroelectric plant and associated facilities; (b) support economic reforms and enabling environment for
attracting foreign investments and promoting private sector development by improving the quality of the
power supply and enhancing socioeconomic conditions in densely populated East China regions; (c)
improve load management and promote energy conservation by introducing appropriate peaking power
pricing; (d) support institutional development of the beneficiary by strengthening its organization through
an advanced management and staff training program; (e) contribute to the development of an improved
power utility regulatory framework; (f) assist in transferning new power technologies for what will be the
largest pumped-storage hydroelectric plant in China, and in applying modem power system operation
optimization methods; and (g) extend technical assistance in project design and implementation, and in
promoting prudent financial management.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives of the project were not revised during project implementation.
3.3 Original Components:
The project's four main components and their estimated costs were: (1) Tianhuangping pumped storage
power plant (6 x 300 MW, $270 million); (2) pricing and operation studies ($1 million); (3) training ($3
million); (4) engineering services ($26 million).
3.4 Revised Components:
By end 1998, there were about $ 28.7 million of savings mainly from provisions for contingencies. At
ECEPGC's request, a new component, the Sijing and Hangdong 500 kV substations, was added in March
1999, with an estimated cost of $25.97 million. Its rationale was to: (i) reduce critical bottlenecks in the
delivery of the project output to Shanghai and Hangzhou; (ii) improve supply reliability; and (iii) help
establish a regional power market The total amount of the loan remained unchanged ($300 million). The
revision was appraised, reported to the Board of Directors of the Bank, and the Project Agreement
amended.
3.5 Quality at Enty:
The QAE was not rated by the QAG. Using QAG criteria, and on the basis of the Staff Appraisal Report
(SAR), the ICR rates it as satisfactory. The relevance of the objectives and components is satisfactory.
The project objectives were responsive to the Government strategy of modernizing the power sub-sector
and improving its efficiency. Power shortages, especially peaking power shortages were acute in the area
at the time of appraisal and were still significant at project completion. It was, and still is, a priority to
rationalize and expand peak load pricing and develop cost-effective and environmentally benign
pumped-storage plants such as Tianhuangping for peaking in the East China predominantly thermal power
system. The need followed for transfers of technical and managerial know-how and for institutional
development in the sector. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which focused on alleviating
infrastructure bottlenecks and furthering the market orientation of China's State-Owned Enterprises, had
also identified these priorities. The Project provided a vehicle for the Bank's continued assistance in
least-cost investment planning, demand-side management and improvement in power utility regulatory
franework. Objective (b) was however a little too vague and its achievement more in the nature of an
indirect impact that is difficult to monitor. Objectives (d) and (g) largely overlap one another.

The project was demanding on the Borrower both from technical and sector reform perspectives. The
technological requirements of the project were highly complex. Improving peak power pricing and power
utility regulatory framework involved the interplay of several government agencies and institutions. The
intervention for other objectives was focused on the project site and a limited number of project entities.
With its past success in building up smaller pumped-storage projects and implementing Bank financed
hydro projects, China had demonstrated its capacity to undertake major hydro-power projects, absorb
offshore technology and make the institutional adjustments needed with the help of international consulting
services. Therefore, the objectives were generally within the Borrower's reach. An exception is possibly
objective (c); as the implementing agency is a regional entity which does not deal with power pricing at the
retail level, achieving it required the central government to guide and cause provincial pricing bureaus and
utilities to adopt the reforms; this expectation became increasingly unrealistic with the decentralization that
took hold in the sector in the mid- 1 990s.
The components were closely related to achieving the objectives, except objective (e). The implementing
agency, the East China Electric Power Group Corporation (ECEPGC) had built up adequate administrative
capacity in the project company, the Tianhuangping Pumped Storage Power Station Construction
Company (THPCC) through appointment of competent managerial staff. Relevant lessons learned in prior
projects in the country were taken into account; in particular, experienced staff and consultants were hired
for design and implementation. The financial management capacity of the implementing agency was rightly
assessed as adequate.
Plant design was under-pinned by adequate technical studies. Alternative sites and layouts were screened
to minimize environmental impacts. World-class experience was tapped through a Special Board of
Consultants throughout the design process. * The design was technically sound and met all applicable
safeguard policies. The economic analysis established beyond doubt that the project was the least-cost
solution to meet peak power demand in East China, although it is not so clear how the plant factor was
optimized. Environmental analyses followed intemational standards and led to a well-defined Environment
Management Plan (EMP). Implementation preparedness was highly satisfactory in that all the tasks on the
first segment of the critical path had been well defined
The financial and institutional risks were well seen and mitigated, i.e. risk of delays due to multi-provincial
financing and ECEPGC's lack of experience in managing projects of this kind. Delays in unit
commissioning occurred due to powerhouse flooding and equipment supplier's deficiencies, but they had
little impact as demand growth stalled for two years following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR) could not possibly foresee the crisis. But it was too optimistic when rating low
the risk of delays for such a large and novel hydro project. It was also remiss in not identifying and
mitigating the risks looming over the expected regulatory and pricing reforms.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The overall outcome is rated satisfactory.
(a) Alleviate an acute shortage of peaking power and enable more efficient use of power plants in a
predominantly coal-fwred thermal power. The achievement of the objective is rated satisfactory. As
expected, Tianhuangping added 1,800 MW of capacity which can be mobilized in a few minutes at peak or
as a back-up in case of emergency. In 2000, it reduced by 3,400 MW or 32.44 percent on average the
-3 -



peak-valley load difference on the East China grid.
(b) Support economic reforms and enabling environment for attracting foreign investments and
promoting private sector development The outcome here is satisfactory. While it is hard to measure the
increased foreign investments and private sector development attributable to the project, it is a fact that
power system frequency stability was greatly enhanced and load shedding reduced. For example, in 2001,
Tianhuangping was called ten times for start-up under emergency conditions, and it corrected abrupt grid
frequency drops by 0.35 to 0.14 Hz thus bringing the system back to normal operation.
(c) Improve load management and promote energy conservation by introducing appropriate peaking
power pricing. The outcome here is unsatisfactorv. Efficient peak pricing was introduced only for the
project output sales to the grid, thus limiting severely load management and energy conservation by
end-users. However, with recent unbundling of the sector, there is increasing pressure on provincial
utilities to reflect wholesale price structure in consumer pricing.
(d) Support institutional development of the beneficiary by strengthening its organization through an
advanced management and staff training program. The achievement of this objective is rated highy
satisfactorv. ECEPGC has developed adequate capacity in managing the construction of this first large
pumped storage plant, in implementing Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), in power sales pricing and
marketing, and in managing the newly established East China Tianhuangping Pumped Storage Power
Company Ltd. (TPSPC), which has been operating the plant efficiently since December 2000.
(e) Contribute to the development of an improved power utility regulatory framework. The outcome
is rated partially satisfactory. The direct impact on regulatory reform was negligible. Indirectly, however,
the project did play a positive role through the study of the regional power market that it supported (see
details in paragraph 4.2), the sale of its output at economic prices and its regulation of peaks and response
to emergencies, the project helped the launch and success of the competitive power pool pilot in Zhejiang.
This in turn contributed to the Government's far-reaching reform launched nationwide in April 2002 that
requires unbundling generation from transmission and distribution, introducing wholesale power markets
and re-structuring retail tariffs.
(f) Assist in transferring new power technologies for what wil be the largest pumped-storage
hydroelectric plant in China, and in applying modern power system operation optimization methods.
The achievement of this objective is rated satisfactorv. The know-how transferred is being widely used in
other projects in China. East China Investigation and Design Institute (ECIDI) developed its competence in
pumped storage design, change order management and environment assessment (EA); it is now undertaking
six large-sized pumped-storage power projects including Taian (4 x 250 MW), Tongbai (4 x 300 MW),
Yixing (4 x 250 MW) and Baoquan (4 x 250 MW). It has also conducted EAs for several other projects
including Bank-financed small and medium sized hydro-power projects in China. Similarly, Chinese
contractors are now applying their new experience to other projects.
(g) Extend technical assistance in project design and implementation, and in promoting prudent
financial management The outcome here met and sometimes exceeded expectations; it is rated highly
satisfactorv. By importing financial systems from similar French and British companies, prudent financial
management including budget control, fund management, investment appraisal and credit guarantee
procedures was established. ECEPGC became highly skilled in large project implementation management
and plant operation and its financial performance more than met covenants.

4.2 Outputs by components:
The output is satisfactorv for all five components as these were successfully completed as defined in the
SAR.
(1) DAM & POWERHOUSE. Implementation of all sub-components (Annex 8) was achieved, albeit
modestly behind schedule, while meeting all relevant quality and safety standards. Unit commissioning
delays varied between five and twelve months but the project was completed on schedule in December
2000. All facilities have functioned well and were accepted by the State Safety Inspection of September
2001.
(2) ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. All three objectives of the program were
satisfied: the adverse impacts were properly assessed and mitigation measures formulated; the impacts were
mitigated or reduced to acceptable levels through implementation of a monitoring and mitigation program
(Annex 9); and a unit of 15 full time staff members was established for environmnent monitoring and
protection during implementation.
(3) CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING SERVICES. All procurement
processes were carried out on schedule. Implementation delays were generally due to a major landslide
which occurred in March 29, 1996 [1], heavy rainfalls in early 1995, uneven settlement of the upper
reservoir after impoundment, and quality problems with two main transformers. While some of the key
target dates were missed, the Project was still finally completed as scheduled and cost overrun minimized
through various measures including efficient procurement arrangements [2].
(4) TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND STUDIES. The study of the power market strongly supported
the launch and success of the competitive power pool pilot in Zhejiang and contributed to the successful
launch of GOC's far-reaching power sector reform (see details in Paragraph 4.1 e.). Studies of optimal
power plant operation and pricing were completed by an offshore consultant in June 1997. Because, by
1995, the likelihood of studies under the project being able to influence retail tariff reforms had strongly
decreased, the pricing study was re-oriented to cover tariff structure of the plant output. Recommendations
on the power plant dispatching and output pricing were fully implemented and those for optimal plant
operation procedures are being gradually implemented [3]. The TA and training for strengthening the
beneficiary's organization covered management training for construction, plant operation, environment
protection, human resources and finances as well as technical topics (298 persons sent abroad in 39
groups).  Technical capacity on mechanical and electrical engineering was also enhanced through
attendance at design liaison meetings, factory tests, and site erection and commissioning. For power plant
operation, training of operators (651 man-month) took place in other pumped-storage power plants in
China and as part of equipment supply and intemational consulting service contracts.
(5) SIJING AND HANGDONG 500 kV SUBSTATIONS. Sijing was commissioned in December 2000
and Hangdong in May 2001, respectively three and five months behind a very ambitious schedule, but still
in time to serve the winter peak demand in 2000-01.

Covenants. All covenants were met including those with respect to consolidated financial indicators for
the East China Grid, which were included in the 1993 Loan Agreement. But in 1997, de-consolidation
procedures were issued by Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) and followed by ECEPGC. Resulting
financial statements formed the basis of covenants for ECEPGC alone as part of the Bank financed East
China Jiangsu Transmission Project. In accordance with the most recent Project Supervision Report for
that project, compliance is rated satisfactory. With the establishment of TPSPC, it is proposed that
financial covenants be formulated for TPSPC alone. Discussions are under way and on the basis of
financial projections, TPSPC will make proposals on values to be inserted in model financial covenants.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The economic benefits of the project are quantified as the value of its power generation based on the 1404
hours of capacity utilization approved by state authorities. Gas turbines are the appropriate thermal
alternative for a capacity factor of 16 percent (1404 hours), and it is on that basis that the project
equalizing discount rate (EDR) was estimated at appraisal to be 23 percent and this was also used as proxy
for economic rate of return (ERR). The re-estimated EDR is 18.7 percent. With regard to ERR, two
valuation methods are used for the current evaluation: (i) the current two-part tariff equivalent to 70.05
fen/kWh (including VAT) and (ii) a willingness to pay (WTP) for alternative generation at peak load.
However, since no such turbines are presently operating in the grid, the WTP method conservatively uses
the price paid for the output of a combined cycle plant at a 35 percent capacity factor. The ERR is 13.9
percent with the current tariff and 17.7 percent with the WTP (90.09 fen/kWh [also including VAT]) .
Based on recent studies carried out for the Yixing Pumped Storage Plant in the same region, environmental
benefits are deemed modest and not included in the calculations.
The updated EDR and the ERRs exceed the opportunity cost of capital which is 12 percent or less in
today's China. Today, the EDR and the ERR with WTP to which it can be compared, are lower than SAR
values mostly because of the downward trend in thermal cost and changed methodologies. Delays in unit
commissioning had a much smaller impact given the slow down of growth that followed the 1997 Asian
financial crisis. The cost over-run is so modest in real terms that it also has a very small impact.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
The financial benefits are the sales at the current tariff as above but after netting out the VAT and cost of
sales. The tariff is 470 Yuan/kW per year for capacity and 26.4 fen/kWh for energy. With operating costs
including power purchase costs adjusted for inflation at two percent per year, the financial rate of return
(FRR) is 9.54 percent. If the tariffs are similarly adjusted, the FRR is 11.85 percent With no adjustment
for inflation, the FRR is 10.70 percent.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The impact on institutional development is rated substantial. It is high on Chinese technical know-how
(paragraph 4.1.g), modest on policy reforms and substantial on utility restructuring and corporatization.
THPCC was set up for project construction management and supported the set up of TPSPC for plant
operation and business management through input of experienced human resources.  ECEPGC's
development as a utility and TPSPC's as an Independent Power Producer are remarkable; they improved
efficiency, transparency and accountability, and the pool of human resources for future pumped storage
projects.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implemenitation and Outcome
-6-



5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Natural disasters. Excessive rainfalls in early 1995 and a major landslide of about 300,000 cubic meters
(m3) on March 29, 1996 delayed construction by 8 months and caused a direct cost increase of Y258.37
million [1].
Foreign exchange rate and inflation. The devaluation of the Yuan in 1992-96 and the high inflation in the
1993-96 period (14.7, 24.1, 17.1 and 8.3 percent) contributed to a substantial project cost overrun in local
currency (41.2 per cent).
Manufacturing defects. Delays of two to fourteen months in unit commissioning were partly attributable
to lapses in quality control during manufacturing for three of the main transformers. Foreign elements in
one of them caused a break-down of winding insulation and this was also suspected to be the cause of test
failure for the other two. The probable cause of the problem was traced to the transformer cooling systems
supplied by a subcontractor. One of the failed transformers was repaired and the other two were rejected
and re-ordered from a supplier in China. Compensation was paid to the transformer supplier.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Reform sequencing. The emphasis on sector decentralization at the expense of other reforms limited the
ability of the project to be used as a vehicle for peak pricing and regulatory framework reforms.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The performance of the implementing agency was a very positive and key factor to the outcome.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The appraisal cost excluding interest during construction (DC) was $547.3 million equivalent at late 1992
and early 1993 prices, of which $302.9 million (55.3 percent) were foreign costs. The actual cost was
$609.6 million, of which $263.0 million were foreign costs. The cost overrun is about 11.4 percent when
expressed in US dollars and 41.2 percent when expressed in local currency. Overruns in local cost terms
were caused mostly by a higher-than-expected inflation in China during the implementation early stages [4]
which coincided with currency devaluations in dollar terms from Y5.51 at appraisal at late 1992 and early
1993 to Y8.62 in 1994 and Y 8.30 in the ensuing years.
At late 1992 and early 1993 prices, i.e. after netting out the devaluation and inflation, the cost was
$526.03 million, of which $230.31 million were foreign costs. Compared to appraisal estimates (excluding
price contingencies), there was an overrun of 31.6 percent for local costs, and an under-run of 14.9 percent
for foreign costs. The overrun for total costs was 6.2 percent [5]. The local cost overrun can be attributed
mainly to costs of remedial treatment of the landslide. The foreign cost under-run was achieved due to the
under-run of mechanical and electrical equipment cost of $39.9 million (in current terms) as a result of the
intemational competitive bidding process, despite the overrun of $12 million for the upper reservoir
bituminous concrete lining.
Financing departed from the appraisal plan in two ways: (i) the Bank contributed less because prices of
procurement packages through intemational competitive bidding (ICB) were lower than appraisal estimates
[6]; (ii) local financiers increased funding in proportion to their shares in the project to cover cost overruns
[7].

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability is rated likelv. Tianhuangping has been constructed in a technically sound manner and all
necessary conditions for operating and maintaining it were, or are likely to be, achieved. The project is
financially sustainable as shown by its comfortable debt coverage ratio and FRR. Future sales revenues
are secure because of the tight supply and high demand for peaking power in East China. For the
environment, negative impacts were mitigated and minuimized, monitoring is continuing, and additional
measures can be devised and implemented as necessary. Resettlement associated with the new substation
component was well addressed and living standards of affected people were improved (Annex 10)
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
For project operation, the Tianhuangping Pumped-Storage Power Plant was set-up in March 1997 and
started to function in September 1998. It is staffed with 100 persons in three departments (production and
management, operation, and maintenance). Operating procedures were laid down with the help of
international consultants. The plant achieved good operating indicators: 97.4 percent success rate for
start-ups, about 78 percent plant round trip cycle efficiency in 2001. A Power Purchase Agreement was
signed specifying the two-part sales tariff and a power purchase price for pumping. The plant is directly
dispatched by the East China Power Grid (ECPG) control center as recommended by the operation studies.
Additional performance indicators to watch are the sales tariff as practiced, the revenue from energy sales
and ancillary services provided by the plant, the covenanted financial indicators and the environmental
impact indicators defined in the plan. All monitoring systems to that effect are in place except for the
financial covenants for TPSPP that are yet to be finalized.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The Bank provided adequate expertise in assisting the Borrower.
It foresaw the need for studies on plant operation optimization and power pricing and worked well with the
ECEPGC in preparing the EA, EMP and RAP and the program to strengthen ECEPGC's capacity. But
project design was not supportive enough of the objectives of improving power retail pricing and the
regulatory framework and it failed to recognize that without strong central government support, these
objectives were likely to become out of reach. Loan approval was timely.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision was satisfactor . It was regular and proactive with a focus on development impacts and
the Bank's safeguard policies and fiduciary duties. The Bank worked effectively with the Borrower in
detecting and tackling issues, modifying the components and the financial covenants as soon as needed. It
facilitated or provided world-class advice to ECEPGC for catching up on construction delays and
improving contract management and unit performance.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Overall performance is rated satisfactory. While the quality at entry left something to be desired, the Bank
helped ECEPGC resolve all the major physical and financial issues while not substituting for the Borrower
- 8 -



in making decisions and facilitated capacity building in all involved Chinese parties.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Government's performance is rated satisfactory. The Ministry of Energy supported the power sector
objectives. The central and provincial governments were very supportive to the Project financing through
their financial arms. It delegated fuil responsibility to ECEPGC for all the design and preparation and
employed foreign consultants as needed. It invested considerable resources to complete the preparation
works, the EA and EMPs in a timely and satisfactory manner.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government performance is rated satisfactory. The Government let ECEPGC take charge of the project
implementation, but was particularly supportive to the implementation of EMP and RAP; it approved the
innovative pricing structure for the Project outputs and the new project component. The Ministry of
Electric Power organized a panel of experts in a timely manner to advise on resolutions of problems caused
by the landslide. But it was not until after the project approached closure, that the Government became
really active in retail pricing and regulatory reforms.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
ECEPGC's performance was highly satisfactorv. Project management effectiveness was high especially
for scheduling, costing, and financial and quality controls due to the clear accountability of parties involved
and task assignment. Responses to construction delays and equipment defects were prompt and effective.
With Government support, ECEPGC ensured adequate local financing and a timely and justified change in
components. It was open to new technologies and construction techniques, made good use of TA, and
demonstrated commitment to national and intemational standards for resettlement and environment. Its
progress and implementation reports were timely and well documented.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. While it demonstrated scant ownership of some
policy objectives, it met all the covenants and showed a great commitment to build and operate efficiently
and sustainably the first large-sized pump storage in China while following strictly Bank procedures and
criteria.
8. Lessons Learned
The following are the key lessons learned from the project:
(a)    Be more thorough on geology. The bank instability in the lower reservoir and the excessive local
ground settlement in the upper reservoir were all unforeseen and delayed work progress.
(b)    Be more cautious in choosing the right supplier and ensuring that vigorous quality control
procedures are in place. Failures of very high voltage transformers have occured several times in China.
Great care must be taken to assess the capability of key equipment supplier's during contract award and to
ensure apppropriate quality control during subsequent shop inspections.
(c)    Focus consultants on well-defined issues. That was the case here and furthermore, using short-term
consultants proved very successful and efficient, as it made it easier to choose the right consultants and
-9-



ensure that their services were highly relevant
(d)    Pay special attention to broad objectives. Discard them when their achievement cannot be
monitored or achieved. And if the main implementing agency has little to do with them, include components
and agreements that are appropriate and fully owned by the authorities who are key to success.

10. Addidoinal linformatlon
Notes to the main text:
[11 Landslide. Construction of the upper reservoir started in November 1993 on schedule, but completion
was delayed by heavy rains in early 1995, which in turn delayed the start of bitumenous concrete lining and
then the reservoir impoundment by four months. A major landslide of 300,000 m on March 29, 1996, two
thirds of which went into the river bed within the future lower reservoir. The landslide was caused by
persistent heavy rainfall, which resulted in saturation of the mountain mass and a subsequent slippage. The
underground powerhouse was used to divert the Daxi River while dealing with the slide which resulted in
delays to equipment erection. The landslide also endangered another mountain mass of about 600,000 m
above the power intake and substation. Additional measures for treatment of the landslide and securing the
endangered bank areas caused a delay in construction of these facilities of eight months and a direct cost
increase of Y258.37 million. Initial commissioning of power generating equipment was also consequently
delayed.
[21 Proper procurement arrangement. The most technologically advanced parts of the project were
procured through ICB in 41 contracts, including the mechanical and electric equipment and the upper
reservoir bituminous concrete impervious lining. All other services and goods were procured through local
competitive bidding procedures. The most competitive local contractors were selected through local
competition. This way, local participation was maximized and costs controlled. The risks of the
performance of power generating equipment and upper reservoir lining were properly handled. But major
defects in three main transformers suggest the need for stricter qualification requirements and shop
inspection programs.
-10-



[31 Studies. The conclusion of the report recommended that THP plant should be operated under the grid
general dispatching with a two-part tariff (capacity tariff and energy tariff).  Following the
recommendations, the power plant is directed dispatched by the East China Power Dispatch Center and the
electricity is sold with a two-part tariff which is approximately in line with the grid long run marginal costs
at peak time. The report also recommended procedures for plant optimal operation, which are being
gradually implemented.
(41 Inflation rate: 8 percent for 1993, 7 percent for 1994, 6 percent for 1995-96, 5 percent for 1997-98,
and 4 percent thereafter were projected compared to actual rates of 14.7, 24.1, 17.1, and 8.3 percent in
1993-96 respectively.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
1. Economic Rate of Returns (ERR)
Common assumptions for calculation of economic returns:
1) Capital cost: economic costs at 2001 prices (taxes excluded) with a conversion factor of 1.08.
2) Tariff
a) WTP: 90.09 fen/kWh (including VAT) for the peak electricity generated by the project at a 16%
capacity factor, which is a conservative estimation of consumer's WTP based on the actual tariff paid
for a combined cycle plant at a 35% capacity factor in the saTne region.
b) Actual tariffs in 2001: 26.4 fen/kWh for energy sales and 470 Yuan/kW per year for available
capacity plus VAT.
Average tariff = (1+170/o)(Capacity Charges + Energy Charges)/Sales Volume
= l.l7*[l800*(l-0.4%)*470/l0 + 2527.2*0.996*26.4] / 2517.1 = 1.17*59.88 = 70.05 fen/kWh
3) Energy output: actual outputs for 1998-2001, and projected for 2002-2030 based on capacity
utilization of 1404 hours/year.
Energy output = Capacity * utilization hours = 1800 *1404/1000 = 2527.2 GWh
4) Plant overal conversion efficiency: 78% (energy generation / energy purchased)
5) Plant Service Power Rate: 0.4% of generation
6) Operating and maintenance cost
a) fixed cost: assumed at 2.0% of investment cost.
b) cost of pumping:
Variable cost = purchase price * energy output / plant efficiency
Purchase price = shadow cost of fuel (pumping is usually done during the night time)
Shadow cost of fuel = Coal consumption rate (300.0 gce/kWh) * Coal price (380.0 Yuan/tce)/1000000
Coal price is estimated based on economnic costs of port price, handling and transportation.

Note: Total investment outlays = 4994.7 million Yuan or 609.7 million USD equivalent
2) Plant Service Power Rate = 0.4% since 2002;
3) Energy Sales: actual figures for 1998-2001, 2517.2 GWh for 2002 and ensuing years based on 1404 hours/year
Energy generation = Capacity * Utilization Hours = 1800 *1404/1000 = 2527.2 GWh
Energy Sales = Energy Generation * (I-Plant Usage Rate) = 2527.2*(l-0.4%) = 2517.1 GWh
4) Available Capacity = Installed Capacity*(1- Plant Usage Rate) = 1800*(1-0.4%) =1792.8 MW;
Capacity Charges = Available Capacity * Capacity Tariff
Energy Charges = Sales Volume * Energy Tariff
5) Tariff (excluding VAT)
Actual tariffs are used for years up to 2001;
The two-part tariff in 2001 is used for future years: capacity tariff: 470 Yuan/kW/year; energy tariff: 0.264 Yuan/kWh;
Average tariff= (Capacity Charges + Energy Charges)/Sales Volume
= [1800*(1-0.4%)*470/10 + 2517.1*26.4] / 2517.1 = 59.88 fen/kWh
6) Plant Overall Conversion Efficiency: 78% (energy generation = energy purchased * plant efficiency 78%);
7) Cost = Cost of Power Purchasing for Pumping + O&M Cost + Overhead + Sales Tax & Fees = Operating Cost - Depreciation
Cost of purchasing electricity for pumping: actual expenditures for 1998-2001, and for ensuing years:
Energy Purchase = Energy Generation / (Plant Efficiency) = 2527.2/0.78 = 3240 GWh
Purchase Price = 0.1829 Yuan/kWh;
O&M Cost = (Material Cost + Maintenance Cost + Salaries) * Escalation Factor
material cost = 4.1 Yuan/kW of installed capacity (1800 MW);
maintenance cost = maintenance cost in 2001
+ 0.74% * (historically valued fixed assets at start of 2001 - that at start of current year)
Salaries = 32000 yuan/person * 150 persons * (I + 14%Welfare + 12% Housing + 17% Pension) / 1000000.
Operating Cost = Cost of Power Purchase + O&M Cost + Overhead + Tax & Fees + Depreciation
Cash Operating Cost = Cost of Power Purchase + O&M Cost + Overhead + Sales Tax & Fees
Overhead = [33.45 Yuan/kW * Installed Capacity (GW)] * Escalation Factor
overhead assumed at 33.45 Yuan/kW of installed capacity (1800 MW);

Note:
The implementation progress was rated HS in early stages of implementation because construction progress
closely adhered to SAR schedule (see Annex I Key Dates of Project Implementation). It was still rated HS
after the landslide and transformer problems occurred and caused delays as the Government's and the
implementing agency's response were prompt and efficient, and negative impacts were minimized (it
appeared that while first unit delays would be substantial then delays to subsequent unit commssionings
would be reduced and last units would be commissioned on schedule). However, transformer failures
resulted in subsequent unit commissioning delays from 5 to 12 months. Therefore the overall performance
of project implementation is downgraded to S by the ICR mission.

reservoirs, a water conveyance system, an underground power house, and a switchyard. This
component is rated satisfactory. Construction of these facilities satisfied all relevant quality and safety
standards. They have generally been in smooth operation since September 1998 when the first unit was
commissioned. Cracks due to uneven settlement were found in the upper reservoir bottom lining during the
initial impoundment in 1998 and were repaired. The State Safety Inspection in September 2001 rated the
safety of these facilities satisfactory and monitoring is continuing.
(c) Provision and installation of six single-stage 300-MW reversible pimp-turbine units and associated
equipment. This component is rated satisfactory. The first generating unit was commissioned in September
1998 (12 months delay), the last in December 2000 (12 months delay); delays for intermediate units varied
between 5 and 9 months. The project was completed in December 2000 (as scheduled in SAR), adding a
capacity of 1800MW (6x300 MW) for peaking, and an off-peak load of 1,900 MW to the ECPG,
accounting for. regulating 3,700 MW peak-valley load difference (33.24 percent) of the grid.
(d) Erection of 500-kV transmission lines (about 250 km long) and reinforcement of the existing
power transmission networks. This component is rated satisfactory. Two 500 kV transmission lines were
installed in length of 39.8 and 39.5 km respectively. The lines were put into operation in May 1998 and
have been functioning satisfactorily.
(e) Provision of elected equipment for civil works and dam safety. This component is rated satisfactory.
All necessary construction equipment was ordered and delivered to the satisfactory of civil works
construction. See Annex 13 of the Borrower's Completion Report for the list of equipment.
(f) construction of Sijing and Hangdong 500 kV substations. This is a new component and is rated
satisfactory. Sijing substation was commissioned in December 2000 and Hangdong substation in May
2001, delayed 3 and 5 months than scheduled respectively. But the commissioning of the first substation
served the peak demand need in the winter of 2000, as did commissioning of the later substation in the
summer of 2001.

Additional Annex 9. Implementation of Environment Management Plan
The program had three objectives: (i) to identify the adverse impacts of the project; (ii) to formulate a set of
measures to be taken during project implementation and operation, so as to mitigate or reduce the adverse
impacts to acceptable levels; and (iii) to set up an institution responsible for carrying out the mitigation
measures and the monitoring program.
Headed by THPCC with participation of Supervision Engineers, ECIDI, contractors and the power plant,
an organization of 15 full time staff members was established for environment monitoring and protection
during construction.
(a) Impact Assessment: The EIA studies of the Project had been carried out by ECIDI since 1986 and the
final Environment Assessment Report was prepared in April 1992, taking into account the Bank's
comments and suggestions. Possible adverse impacts identified are: (i) reservoir inundation; (ii) land
requisition and resettlement; (c) downstream effects; (iv)induced earthquake; (v) land slide; and (vi) impact
of construction on the surrounding environment.
(b)    Monitoring and Mitigation. This component is rated satisfactory
(b.1) Reservoir inundation and resettlement. An area of 186.2 ha was acquired for the facilities and
reservoirs inundation; 223.3 ha temporarily borrowed for construction. There were no inhabitants or
agricultural activity in the area except for some bamboo growing. Construction had little impact on
wildlife. Cost for the land acquisition or recovery of the vegetation of the borrowed areas was Y 61.3
million, about 16 times the annual production of the said areas.
(b.2) Water quality. Waste water was treated to meet standards before discharge. The lower reservoir
impoundment improved river water turbidity from 8.87 to 5.5 mg/l. The Daxi river was monitored by
ECIDI, and drinking water, by the Public Health Bureau of the local county government.
(b.3) Downstream effects. There was no shipping and fishing activity on the Daxi River. A total of 154,
000 m3 of bed load which accumulated during construction was removed and the river course enhanced to
handle larger floods. The lower reservoir is regulating inflows to the downstream Pancun Reservoir, which
is serving local communities for portable water and irrigation.
(b.4) Prevention of landslide. The materials of the landslide on March 29, 1996 were removed and
unstable slopes consolidated to prevent further landslides. Monitoring of these slopes is continuing.
(b.5) Seismic activity. This component was canceled because no possibility of reservoir-induced
earthquake existed as concluded by Zhejiang Provincial Seismic Research Laboratory after a seismic safety
evaluation conducted for both of the reservoirs.
(b.6) Hydrological and meteorological forecasting and monitoring. A forecasting station was set up
close to both the upper and lower reservoirs. It was operated by the-Meteorological Bureau of the local
county government.
(b.7) Bed Load. Bed load downstream of the lower reservoir was monitored by the engineering department
of THPCC.
- 37 -



(b.8) Vegetation. As the project has no impacts on wildlife, only changes in vegetation was monitored by
the Departnents of Land, Forestry Industry and Water Conservation of the Provincial government. More
than 20 staff from the departments and 2 from THPCC were engaged in the monitoring. Results show that
vegetation outside the project site remained intact. An area of about 200,000 m2 in total was reforested in
the affected areas. A soil and water conservation plan approved by the Ministry of Water Resources was
implemented to the satisfaction of relevant standards.
(b.9) Public Health. The sources of potential impact were dust and noise during construction. They were
monitored by Supervision Engineers. No related illness was detected.
- 38 -



Additional Annex 10. Implementation of Resettlement Action Plan
A resettlement action plan (RAP) for the added Hangdong and Sijing 500 kV substations component was
prepared by ECEPG, and was reviewed and approved by the Bank in late 1998. The overall resettlement
implementation for both substations followed the RAP and proceeded smoothly due to good planning,
adequate compensation policies, and available fannland resources for re-establishment of livelihood of
affected individuals. The per capita income among affected villages or companies has steady increased over
the past few years. A recent survey demonstrated the affected villages' and individuals' satisfaction with
the resettlement process and outcomes. The use of compensation funds among affected villages was closely
monitored by different levels of resettlement institutions and individual resettlers and is transparent to the
affected people.
1. Scope
According to the RAP, a total of 286 mu fannland needed to be acquired for the two substations (140 mu
for Sijing and 146 mu for Hangdong); no people needed to be resettled nor houses relocated; 143 rural
persons (134 for Sijing and 9 for Hangdong) were affected and needed full economic rehabilitation; and 93
affected rural labors needed compensation for lost jobs. But during implementation less land was acquired
and fewer people were affected (Table 1).

2. Implementation Status
Implementation of the RAP was initiated in September and November 1998 for Sijing and Hangdong
respectively. For Sijing, the land acquisition was completed in December 1998; same amount of fannland
as acquired had been re-allocated to affected village groups and all compensation funds disbursed to the
affected villages and individuals by the end of September 1999. The substation was commissioned in
December 2000. For Hangdong, the land acquisition was completed in early 1999; land compensation
funds were fully paid to an affected company, villages and individuals by the end of October 1999. The
substation was commissioned in May 2001.
3. Outputs and Outcomes
Some 269 mu land areas in total (vs. 286 mu in the RAP) were acquired in a timely manner, including 122
mu for Sijing and 147 mu for Hangdong. Due to reduction of land acquired, the number of affected people
who needed full economic rehabilitation was also reduced from 143 persons in the RAP to 127 persons
(118 for Sijing and 9 for Hangdong), and the number of affected workers was reduced from 93 in the RAP
to 84 (78 for Sijing and 6 for Hangdong) (Table 1). In terms of compensation rates, all compensation rates
delivered were either higher or equal to the amount in the RAP except for green crop compensation rate for
Hangdong. The green crop compensation rate was set at half of the annual output value for Hangdong in
- 39-



the RAP. The actual average yield was Y700 per mu for summer seasons and Y500 per mu for winter
seasons. Because land acquisition took place in a winter season, the rate of Y500 per mu was well
accepted.

Notes:
1. compensation rates were set as 40,000 Yuan/labor for Sijing and 9600 Yuan/mu for Hangdong.
Sijing Substation. The 122 mu land was acquired from Xiaochang Village. Compensation was made based
on the compensation rates negotiated with participation of affected villages (Table 2). The actual
compensation rates for individual items were either the same as (for land and job) or higher (for green crop
compensation) than the rates in the RAP. A total of Y17.1 million for compensation of 122 mu land were
fully disbursed to Sijing Town Government in 1998 while compensation for green crop was paid directly to
affected individuals. Out of the Y17.1 million, Y4.19 million including compensations for land
(Y8,800/mu) and for job (Y40,000/labor) were disbursed to the affected village in 1999 after the same
amount of paddy land (122 mu) from the village reserved land was re-allocated to the affected village
groups; (In Xiaochang Village, each farmer was allocated 0.4 mu for food grain and the rest was kept by
the village as reserved farmland. Use of the reserved fanmland was subject to majority approval by farmers
and income generated from the land was distributed among all village members.) about Y6.9 million was
used for setting up a pension fund to provide basic living allowance for all old people (male over 60 and
female over 55) in the affected village.
Hangdong Substation. A total of 146.5 mu of land was acquired, with 141.4 mu from Zhejiang Xinghai
Agricultural Development Company (ZXADC--a state farm), and 5.1 mu from Hongqi Village. Almost all
the acquired lands were paddy fields. Since these paddy fields belong to two different types of land tenures
(the state and the rural collectives), the compensation policies were quite different.
For ZXADC, which owned 45,000 mu farmland excluding the 141.4 mu acquired and employed 3,000
workers, compensation for land was negotiated at Y7.3 million in total, averaging Y51,700/mu, which was
much higher than that in the RAP (Y10,200/mu). Given such high compensation rate and sufficient
resources remaining, no major impacts were expected on the livelihood of the state farm workers. In
addition to the land compensation, the Project also paid YI.58 million to ZXADC to restore or improve the
affected irrigation, power line and other related infrastructure facilities.
For Hongqi Village, the 5.1 mu land was acquired for access road, including 3.7 mu paddy land and the
rest of road and canal areas. The compensation paid was based on the RAP with Y7,200 per mu for land,
Y9,600 per mu for lost jobs, and Y500 per mu for green crops. Compensation for young crops was paid
directly to the affected individuals while Y85,680 (Y16,800 x 5.1) for land and jobs compensation were
disbursed to Hongqi Village. Partial compensation (Y55,680) were distributed to all village group members
and the remaining (Y30,000) were used to improve village infrastructure facilities. Same amount of paddy
land (3.7 mu) was re-allocated from the village reserves to the affected farmers.
-40-



Income Restoration. The resettlement monitoring and evaluation report completed by ECIDI by the end of
2001 demonstrated that per capita annual income of the affected villages (in both cases) had steadily
increased over the past few years. In Xiaochang Village (Sijing), it increased from Y6,500 in 1998 to
Y7,300 in 2000 by 12.3 percent Growth of income from farming (by converting grain production into
vegetable production) and non-farming activities contributed to the increase. For (Hangdong), it also
increased over the same period by 21 percent in ZXADC from Y6,250 in 1998 to Y7,550 in 2000, and by
6 percent in Hongqi Village from Y4,697 in 1998 to Y4,979 in 2000. Rapid increase of non-agricultural
employment and income contributed to such increase. According to the survey in 2001, all the two affected
villages and 53 interviewed expressed satisfaction with the resettlement process and outcomes.

1. Project Description
1.1    General information
Tianhuangping Pumped Storage Power Plant, locating at Anji County, Zhejiang Province China, with a
total installed capacity of 1800 MW (6X300 MW), is the largest of its kind either operating or under
construction in East China Area. After putting it into operation, it mainly serves East China Power Grid,
which is a predominantly coal-fired thennal power system, to balance the load peak and valley, and also
has the functions of phase and frequency adjusting, emergency backing-up, etc.
The project mainly consists of the lower reservoir, upper reservoir, water conveyance system, underground
powerhouse and tail-water system, 500 kV switchyard and Control Center Building. See Table 1 for the
main characteristics of the Project.

1.2    Change of design
According to the original design, the 500 kV Switchyard was placed on the top of the mountain, North
West side of the upper reservoir, the elevation was about El 850 m. That place was far away from the
control center and the HV out-going lines of the main transformers, which is not convenient for operation
and management The construction cost was quite high. During the implementation of this Project, it was
discussed with the design institute and approved by the State Power Company of China, the 500 kV
switchyard was move to the current position (at El 350.3 m by the control center). The 500 kV dry cables
from the HV side of the main transformers were directly connected with the 500 kV GIS of the switchyard,
which reduced the investment of equipment and made the operation and management very convenient
-43 -



The 500 kV switchyard occupies an area of 208x35 m. It mainly consists of one GIS building and an
outdoor switchyard. Two circuits of 500 kV out-going lines were connected to the 500 kV TLANPING
(Tianhuangping-Pingyao) Line through GIS switches. The arrangement is compact and the operation is
flexible and convenient.
1.3    Project Investment and Financing
The total cost at appraisal excluding interest during construction was $547.3 million (excluding interests
during construction--IDC), of which RMBY 720 million was equity investment from the investors. Except
for the loan of $300 million provided by the World Bank, the rest were provided by the investors through
getting loans from domestic commercial banks in proportion to their investments.
2. Project Objectives
As same as the World Bank evaluated, the project objectives are to:
1)    alleviate an acute shortage of peaking power and enable more efficient use of power plants in a
predominantly coal-fired thermal power system by transferring off-peak energy to peak with construction
of the cost-effective and environmentally sound Tianhuangping pumped-storage hydroelectric plant and
associated facilities;
2)     support economic reforms and enabling environment for attracting foreign investments and
promoting private sector development by improving the quality of the power supply and enhancing
socioeconomic conditions in densely populated East China regions;
3)    improve load management and promote energy conservation by introducing appropriate peaking
power pricing;
4)     support institutional development of the beneficiary by strengthening its organization through an
advanced management and staff training program;
5)     contribute to the development of an improved power utility regulatory framework;
6)     assist in transferring new power technologies for what will be the largest pumped-storage
hydroelectric plant in China, and in applying modem power system operation optimization methods;
7)     extend technical assistance in project design and implementation, and in promoting prudent
financial management.
3. Project implementation
3.1    Construction conditions and main achievements
The Project construction was featured with large scale, tight construction schedule, and highly difficult
technically challenging. The preparation work for construction started from June 1992 and on March 1,
1994 the main project construction started. On Dec. 25, 2000, the last unit was put into production. The
total construction period is 82 months. The Owner (East China Electric Power Group
Company--ECEPGC) and the construction company (Tianhuangping Pumped-storage Power Plant
Construction Company-THPCC) tried their best to strengthen the project management, and to carefully
organize, timely coordinate, and to successfully overcome the great difficulties caused by the "3.29"
landslide in lower reservoir area in 1996, with joint efforts of all parties involved, the project was
completed as scheduled and the construction quality is good.
3.2    Resettlement Action Plan Implementation
-44 -



An area of 186.2 ha was permanently acquired for Tianhuangping project, among which 0.284 km2 was
inundated by the upper reservoir and 0.28 km2 by the lower reservoir. There was no farmland in the area,
in which only bamboos and bushes grew. Construction had little impacts on local inhabitants, wildlife and
ground layout. Cost for the areas borrowed and acquired was RMBY 61.3 million, about 16 times of the
annual production (bamboo) of the said area. An area of 233.3 ha was temporarily borrowed for
construction activities. The Owner paid compensation as agreed for reclaiming the area again. The local
government organized farmers to reclaim the areas after the project was finished.
There was no relocation caused by this project.
3.3 Implementation of Environment Management Plan
Headed by THPCC with participation of Supervision Engineers, East China Investigation and Design
Institute (ECIDI), contractors and the Tianhuangping Pumped-storage Power Plant (TPSPP--set up in
March 1997), an organization of 15 full time staff members was established for environment monitoring
and protection during construction.
3.3.1 Water quality. Waste water was treated to meet standards before discharge. The lower reservoir
impoundment improved river water clarity from 8.87 to 5.5 mg/l of mud. The Daxi river was monitored by
ECIDI, and addible water, by the Public Health Bureau of the local county government.
3.3.2 Downstream effects. There was no shipping and fishing activity on the Daxi River. A total of 154,
000 m3 of bed load accumulated during construction was removed and the river course enhanced to handle
larger floods. The lower reservoir is regulating the downstream Pancun Reservoir, which is serving local
communities for drinking and irrigation.
3.3.3 Prevention of landslide. The materials of the landslide on March 29, 1996 were removed and
unstable slopes consolidated to prevent further landslides. Monitoring of these slopes is continuing.
3.3.4 Seismic activity. This component was canceled because no possibility of reservoir-induced
earthquake would occur as concluded by Zhejiang Provincial Seismic Research Laboratory after a seismic
safety evaluation conducted for both of the reservoirs.
3.3.5 Hydrological and meteorological forecasting and monitoring. A forecasting station was set up
close to both the upper and lower reservoirs. It was operated by the Meteorological Bureau of the local
county government.
3.3.6 Bed Load. Bed load downstream of the lower reservoir was monitored by the engineering department
of THPCC.
3.3.7 Vegetation. As the project has no impacts on wild animals, only changes in vegetation was monitored
by the Departments of Land, Forestry Industry and Water Conservation of the Provincial government.
More than 20 staff from the departments and 2 from THPCC were engaged in the monitoring. Results
show that vegetation outside the project site remained intact. About 200,000 m2 in total were reforested in
the affected areas. A soil and water conservation approved by the Ministry of Water Resources was
implemented to the satisfaction of relevant standards.
3.3.8 Public Health. The sources of potential impact were dust and noise during construction. They were
-45 -



monitored by Supervision Engineers. No related illness was detected.
3.3    Achievement of Objectives
The overall outcome of the objectives is satisfactory except the one "improve load management and
promote energy conservation by introducing appropriate peaking power pricing", which was limited due to
gradually reforming of our state. While it is delightful that the policy of peak-valley power tariff has been
put in practice in Each China area though the price difference was still quite small. We have reason to
believe that this objective will be achieved along with continuous progress of our reform.
3.5 Actual Costs and Financing, and Overrun Reasons
The actual cost of the project was $609.6 million, with an overrun of $62.3 million comparing to the World
Bank's evaluation of $547.3 million. The cost overrun is about 11.4 percent. The local part had an overrun
of $102.2 million, while the foreign part had an under-run of $39.9 million. The plant cost is $338.6/kW.
Overruns were caused by: (1) higher-than-expected costs of civil works, especially treatmnent of the "3.29"
landslide in the lower reservoir area, (2) escalations of labor and materials prices due to adjustment of state
policy.
Excluding the capital of RMBY 720 million provided by the investors and a loan of $260 million from the
World Bank, the rest were supplied by the investors through getting loans from domestic commercial banks
in proportion to their investments. After the East China Tianhuangping Pumped Storage Power Co. Ltd
(TPSPC). was set up in December 1998 according to The Company Law of People's Republic of China,
all the bank debts for financing were transferred to it.
4. Comments on Relevant Parties

5. Future Operation
5.1 Operation Management System
For plant operation, the TPSPP was set-up in March 1997 and started to function in September 1998. It is
staffed with 100 persons in three departments (production management, operation, maintenance). Operating
procedures were laid down with the help of international consultant. The operation management system
became perfect gradually.
5.2 Achievements since Operation
The plant achieved good operating indicators: 97.4 percent successful rate for start-ups and 78 percent for
plant cycle efficiency. A Power Purchase Agreement was signed specifying the two-part sale tariff and a
power purchase price for pumping. The plant is directly dispatched by the East China Power Grid
-46-



Dispatching Center.
Inspection results show that the hydraulic structures such as dams, underground powerhouse, water
conduct and tailrace system, and also the landslide portion of the lower reservoir are safe and reliable.
The environment is in good condition now.
5.3    Financial Situation and sustainability
Actual sale price, power sale, rate paying, benefits from the plant's auxiliary services and monitoring to the
financial index in the agreement are suitable.
The estimated profit (including tax) of 2002 can reach RMBY 100 million and future financial situation is
optimistic.
6. Benefits of Project Execution
For East China Grid
1800 MW of peak capacity and 1900 MW of valley capacity were supplied to the East China Power Grid,
which improved the grid's operation conditions; back-up capacity of the grid was increased, which
improved the grid's reliability for safe and stable operation.
Construction Management System
Management system reform of hydroelectric construction was accelerated.
Human Resources Management
Human resources using system reform was promoted; staff quantity was reduced and staff's quality
improved.
Power Plant's Economic Benefits
The plant's economic benefits are good. According to operating of 2001 (including tax, the profit is
RMBY40 million), the estimated return rate of 80/6-12% can be achieved.
Social Benefits
The social benefits are remarkable after the project was completed. Local facilities such as traffic,
communications, etc. were improved; local economy (including tourism) was developed.
7. Lessons Learned and recommendations
The bank instability of the lower reservoir and local uneven settlement of the upper reservoir bottom caused
"3.29" landslide of the lower reservoir and local cracks in the bituminous concrete lining of the upper
reservoir respectively, which made adverse impacts on the project. The geological work shall be more
thorough to reduce the loss.
Equipment's quality
Two main transformers were rejected due to poor quality control of the transformer supplier and the project
progress was influenced. Shop inspections must be more careful for the key equipment during early stage.
Short-term consultants on special subjects
-47-
