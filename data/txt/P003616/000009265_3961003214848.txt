MEMORAINDUJM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A TIANMUANGPING HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandim and recommen-
dation on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent
of $300 million to help finance a Tianhuangping Hydroelectric Project. The
loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity
of 20 years, including five years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be
onlent to the East China Electric Power Ur.ited Corporation (ECEPUC) for a term
not to exceed 20 years, including a five-year grace period, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate. ECEPUC will bear the commitment charges and
foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background.  The adequacy of electricity supply is of crucial impor-
tance to China's economic growth and to improving the living standards of the
population. The Government of China (GOC) has given high priority to power
subsector development. Its policy is to promote energy conservation, acceler-
ate the pace of indigenous energy resource development, construct large and
cost-effective power generation plants, interconnect power systems to achieve
more economic and reliable operation, and replace obsolete and heavily pollut-
ing plants with more efficient and environmentally sustainable units. At
present, power subsector institutions are undergoing major reforms and
restructuring in order to improve their performance. To this end, GOC has
initiated a number of actions to introduce modern energy technologies and
methods, improve energy efficiency, assess environmental consequences and
mitigate adverse impacts, increase the financial and management autonomy of
power supply entities, and rationalize power pricing.
3.        Remarkable progress has been made in resolving issues in the power
subsector. More autonomous power entities are beginning to emerge. In addi-
tion to the transfer of state-of-the-art technology and institution-building,
particular attention is now being devoted to the development of an appropriate
regulatory regime and protection of the environment. The "new plant-new
price" policy has resulted in steady increases in overall tariff levels, and
average consumer power prices are now close to the long-run marginal cost.
While certain distortions still remain in the structure of tariffs, province-
wide agreements to develop and implement action plans to rationalize the power
tariff structures are being carried out under ongoing power projects. The
East China region (Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhuil Provinces and Shanghai Munici-
pality), where the proposed project is located, has the highest industrial
output value in the country. However, its further development is severely
constrained by serious electricity shortages, in spite of various measures
already taken to cope with these shortages, including adoption of up to three
working shifts in industry and rigorous energy conservation measures.
4.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  The lessons learned
from previous power projects, particularly the four hydropower projects
(Lubuge, Yantan, Shuikou and Ertan), have been taken into account in preparing



-2-
the proposed project. Based on these lessons, more attention has been given
to proper assessment of project costs, tighter technical and financial crite-
ria for the prequalification of bidder., improved and accelerated procurement
procedures, enhancement of the role of project construction management, and
timely appointment of engineering consultants.
5.        Rationale fir Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in the energy
sector, and specifically the power subsector, is to support national energy
development, transfer of modern technology, energy efficiency and conserva-
tion, iI.stitutional and utility management reform, and improvement of environ-
mental management. Through both project and sector work, the Bank seeks to
encourage policies which provide incentives for sustainable energy development
and efficient energy use. The Bank has been instrumental in recent initia-
tives to promote more modern management and greater enterprise autonomy and
accountability. The Bank has also launched a program of technical assistance
and sector work on institutional development and enterprise reform. 3ank
participation in the proposed project will particularly contribute to the
optimal development of power-peaking capacities, establishment of an efficient
power system and modern utility management, transfer of new technologies and
application of advanced construction methods. A novel feature of Bank support
for the proposed project is the promotion of interprovincial cooperation in
the pooling of financial resources for the joint development of a power proj-
ect. Moreover, in connection vith this project, improvement of the regulatory
framework in four provinces/municipalities of East China and the rationaliza-
tion of power pricing would be initiated.
6.        Proiect Ob1ectives.  The main objectives of the project are to:
(a) alleviate an acute shortage of power during periods of peak demand and
enable more efficient use of power plants in a predominantly coal-fired ther-
mal power system by transferring off-peak energy to peak energy with construc-
tion of the cost-effective and environmentally sound Tianhuangping pumped-
storage hydroelectric plant and associated facilities; (b) support economic
reform and establish an enabling environment for attracting foreign invest-
monts and promoting private sector development by improving the quality of the
power supply and enhancing socioeconomic conditions in the densely populated
East China region; (c) improve load management and promote energy conservation
by introducing appropriate power pricing; (d) support institutional
development of the beneficiary by strengthening its organization through an
advanced management and staff training program; (e) contribute to the develop-
ment of an improved power utility regulatory framework; (f) assist in trans-
ferring new power technologies for what will be the largest pumped-storage
hydroelectric plant in China, and in applying modern power system operation
optimization methods; and (g) extend technical assistance in project design
and implementation, and in promoting prudent financial management.
7.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project would includes  (a) con-
struction of a pumped-storage hydroelectric power plant in Zhejiang Province
together with upper and lower reservoirs, a water conveyance system, an under-
ground powerhouse, and a switchyard; (b) provision and installation of six
300-MW reversible pump-turbine units and associated equipment; (c) erection of
500-kV transmission lines (about 250 km long) and reinforcement of the exist-
ing power transmission network; (d) construction management and engineering
services; (e) studies of optimal power plant operation and its output pricing;



- 3 -
and (f) strengthening of the beneficiary's organization through the provision
of technical assistance and training. The project feasibility study and
design report were completed in 1990. Following the Bank's Guidelines, the
Chinese also selected international engineering consultants to assist in
finalizing designs, procurement of goodA and works, and construction manage-
ment. Furthermore, a Special Board of Consultants, consisting of eminent
foreign and local experts, has been established to review the project's con-
cept and designs, and advise on dam safety, engineering and implementation
matters. An Environmental Assessment Report has been prepared in accordance
with the GOC and Bank environmental review procedures and guidelines for hydro
projects, and its summary was distributed to the Executive Directors on
June 5, 1992. The design of the project is at an advanced stage, and was
found satisfactory in its overall concept. The Second Technical Cooperation
Credit (Cr. 1664-CHA) in the amount of $2.9 million was used to finance engi-
neering designs and project preparation.
8.        Project ImDlementation.  The domestic project financiers (para. 9)
have appointed ECEPUC to be responsible for the implementation of the project.
A specialized construction company has been created (within ECEPUC) to manage
project construction. ECEPUC is a well established power entity and has the
necessary capability and experience for carrying out large power projects.
Project implementation and management arrangements are appropriate. As-is-
tance will also be provided by international consultants (para. 7) during the
implementation of the project. Procurement arrangements for works, goods and
services will enable the implementation of the project in an efficient and
timely manner. Procurement activities have started, and bids for the generat-
ing units were opened on March 5, 1993. The project preparatory works are
progressing satisfactorily.
9.        Proiect Financina.  The total cost of the project is estimated at
$547.3 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $302.9 million
(54 percent). Total financial requirements, including interest during con-
struction (IDC), amount to $720.3 million. The State Energy Investment Corpo-
ration (SEIC), Shenneng Power Development Company (SPDC), Jiangsu Provincial
Investment Company (JPIC), Zhejiang Provincial Power Development Company
(ZPPDC) and Anhui Provincial Power Development Company (APPDC) have agreed to
share the financing of the local project costs, IDC, and principal repayments
of the Bank loan during the project construction period.  Their contribution
to the domestic project financing, reflecting the allocation of the project's
output, would be as follows: SEIC-1/3 of the total; SPDC-114; JPIC-1/6;
ZPPDC-1/9; ECEPUC-1/12; and APPDC-1118. Part of the total domestic financing
would be in the form of equity, and the balance in the form of loans. Terms
and conditions of domestic financing are satisfactory. The equity contribu-
tion will enhance the capital structure of the project entity and represents
an important step in enterprise reform in the power subsector. The Bank loan
of $300 million is expected to cover the foreign exchange cost of the project
exclusive of IDC. This will be the first time that more than one province
would be involved in financing and implementing a power project in China.
Furthermore, SEIC and ECEPUC contributions will come from their own revenue
earnings. A detailed breakdown of the project costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and of esti-
mated IBRD disbursements are shown in Schedule B. The project will be com-
pleted by December 31, 2000, and the closing date of the Bank loan would be



December 31, 2001. A timetable of the key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map (IBRD No. 24363) is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 11428, dated March 31, 1993, is being distributed separately.
10.       Project Sustainabilitv.  The institutional and financial sustaina-
bility of the project will be supported by the planned strengthening of the
beneficiary's organizational structure and the Government's policy of allowing
increased corporate autor.my in managerial, procurement, accounting and per-
sonnel matters. Financial covenants under this project will help to enhance
the beneficiary's capability for debt servicing and internal cash generation
for self-financing of future investments. Satisfactory arrangements have been
made to ensure proper coordination of all project participants, delineation of
authorities, and improvements in the related institutional framework. Pricing
of the project peaking power output will be devised ir. a manner to properl,i
reflect the costs and benefits of the proposed project as well as its role in
the power grid, including emergency power supply, and load-frequency and volt-
age control.
11.       Aireed Actions.  The GOC has agreed to onlend the proceeds of the
proposed Bank loan to ECEPUC under a subsidiary loan agreement for a term not
to exceed 20 years, including a 5-year grace period, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. Assurances were also obtained from ECEPUC that it
would: (a) furnish each year to the Bank a rolling eight-year financial plan;
(b) maintain separate accounts for the p=oject and furnish the audited
accounts and statements to the Bank regularly; (c) carry out studies of the
project power plant operations and its peaking power output pricing, and take
all steps required to implement their recommendations as agreed with the Bank;
(d) implement the management development and staff training program in
accordance with the timetable agreed with the Bank; (e) carry out the envi-
ronmental management program in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (f) take
all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments, to
ensure that its internal cash generation is sufficient to maintaln a self-
financing ratio of no less than 30 percent; (g) not incur additional debt
unless a reasonable forecast shows that its internal cash generation would
provide a debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 times; and (h) make
satisfactory arrangements for the management of project implementation.
12.       Environmental Asnects.  A full Environmental Assessment Report has
been prepared (para. 3) and reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. The
project has relatively benign environmental impacts; any likely environmental
problems are highly manageable, and there is no population resettlement
entailed. The lives of local inhabitants will remain virtually unaffected,
but their living standards will be improved by the provision of better roads,
communications, water and power supply, and employment opportunities. Several
small, heavily polluting, coal-fired power plants, currently used for peaking
power purposes, vill be retired after project commissioning. The area through
which the 500-kV transmission lines will pass is primarily rural. Route
selection is based on the principle that no villages will be overpassed or
houses relocated. Satisfactory arrangements for land acquisition have been
made through participatory processes with the owners and local authorities.
An environmental protection program and monitoring plans have been prepared
and an environmental management and monitoring unit will be established.

13.       Proiect Benefits.  This large hydroelectric power ;'oject will
greatly increase the critically needed peak-power generation capability and
improve the quality of the power supply in the East China power grid. Accord-
ing to comprehensive anAlyses, the project is clearly part of the least-cost
development program for meeting future power supply needs. The internal eco-
nomic rate of return is estimated at about 23 percent. Other intangible bene-
fits are also important, such as institutional development, promotion of
interprovincial cooperation for the joint development, improved power grid
operation, and the fcavorable influence on the social environment by helping
many people to reduce excessive night-shift work caused by the acute shortage
of the peaking power supply.
14.       Risks.  Project construction and implementation risks are within
reasonable limits and manageable with agreed supervision arrangements and the
involvement of competent engineering consultants as now envisioned. Particu-
lar attention will be given to the safety aspects of the project, and to the
capabilities and performance of major cont:ractors.
15.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan vould comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.

(a)  As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchane rate between the dollar and the SDR.
In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b) Credit fully disbursed.
(c) Not yet effective.
