Benefits and Riaks
The project's main benefits would be the expansion of the
rubber sub-sector in which CMte d'Ivoire enjoys a comparative
advantage. It would provide income to some 2,000 smallholder families
and agricultural workers in the forest regions and to some 50 rural
school graduates. New plantings adjacent to existing nucleus estates
would improve the use of existing available processing capacity. The
project would strengthen the managerial and technical capability of
SAPH.
The major risks would be: (a) a major shortfall in revenues
due to substantially lower than projected rubber prices and a further
decline of the US$ in relation to the CFAF; and (b) lower yields than
expected. The economic viability of the project would not be
jeopardized by a 20S decline in projected benefits. The project would
offer safeguards against yield-related risks through proper training
and supervJsion of farmers in crop establishment and tapping by SAPH
whose performance has been of high standard in the past. Risks from
unfavorable climatic variations are low. Financial risks to BNDA from
possible credit repayment default would be low as all outgrower production
would be channelled through SAPH managed processing factories.
Economic Rate of Return
The economic rate of return of all project components
combined is 16X, based on a cost/benefit stream of 30 years.

REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
FIFTH RUBBER PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of COte d'Ivoire has requested Bank assistance in
support of its policy of export crop diversification through the further
development of t'Se country's emerging rubber industry. In particular,
Government is seeking to respond positively to smallholders' desire to
participate in rubber production following the success of the previous
smallholder related projects (Third Rubber Project Ln 1633-IVC and Fourth
Rubber Project- Ln 2323-IVC). In addition, Government wishes to launch two
new vehicles to facilitate private Ivorians in rubber planting through (a)
the development oNf small and medium-scale rubber plantations ("Petites et
Moyennes Plantations H6v4icoles' - PMPH), i.e. mini estates owned and
operated by Ivorian farmers, and (b) the establishment of a professionally
managed rubber growing company ("Groupement de Moyennes Plantations
H6vdicoles' - GNPH), i.e. a form of condominium plantation through which
Ivorian investors could participate in the industry.
1.01      The Government recognizes that COte d'Ivoire enjoys considerable
comparative advantage in the cultivation of rubber and its plans call for
the establishment of a further development of 110,000 ha by the year 2000
as compared with the existing planted area of 45,000 ha. This necessitates
an annual planting rate of 10,000 ha per year by the early 1990s. The
Government therefore wishes the proposed project to include a number of
surveys and studies as well as the programs of applied research and
training needed to achieve these goals.
1.03      A preparation report on the proposed project was produced by the
FAO Cooperative Program and detailed documentation was prepared by the
Soci6t4 Africaine de Plantations d'Hevea (SAPH), the intended executing
agency, under tne guidance of the Direction de la Planification,
Budgetisation et Contr8le de Gestion (DPBCG) of the Ministere de
l'Agriculture (MINAGRI). Overall coordination was the responsibility of
the Direction et Contr8le des Grands Travaux (DCGTx). The Caisse Centrale
de Coop4ration Economique (CCCE) and the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC) have indicated their intention in the financing of the
proposed project. Both participated in the appraisal which took place in
May 1986.
II. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
2.01      The Country Economic Memorandum No. 6051-IVC, "The Ivory Coast in
Transitions From Structural Adjustment to Self-Sustained Growth," of
March 9, 1987 presents an in-depth analysis of the country's economic



- 2 -
performance (Project File No. B.8). The following is a brief overview of
the present constraints and growth prospects of the economy, emphasizing
the key role that agriculture will continue to play in the development of
the economy.
2.02      After the negative growth experienced from 1982 to 1984, the
economy improved markedly in 1985. C6te d'Ivoire may now be poised to
enter a more growth oriented phase of the structural adjustment process,
following four years of austerity under a stringent stabilization program.
However, growth will be conditioned by the pattern of supply responses in
the productive sectors and will be constrained by the necessity of
amortizing a large external debt. To achieve sustained growth in the
medium to long-term, a comprehensive adjustment strategy is required, based
on a major shift in incentives towards the production of tradeables for
export and towards efficient import substitution. It will be necessary to
reverse the lasting discrimination against agriculture in the system of
prices and incentives. The Government will extend to agriculture the
industrial incentive reform launched under the Second Structural Adjustment
(SAL II) Program. Appropriate measures will be implemented under SAL III,
through the extension of the tariff and export subsidy scheme to
agricultural products. Coffee and cocoa are excluded because of the
position of COte d'Ivoire in international markets for these two
commodities and in view of the crucial role they currently play in
Government's tax revenues (para 3.01).
III. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A.   Main Features
3.01      COte d'Ivoire's agricultural sector accounts for about 25? of the
country's GDP of US$6,731 million (1983). It also accounts for over 70% of
all merchandise export earnings and provides employment to about 77Z of the
total labor force. Taxes on export crops have recently increased to about
30? of Government's total annual revenues from their 1970s levels of 5-12Z,
to about 30X of Government's total annual revenues. A summary analysis of
the agricultural sector is contained in the recent Country Economic
Memorandum (para 2.01). A Sector Report providing a more detailed analysis
is now available. The following paragraphs present the sector's main
characteristics and emphasize those aspects that are relevant for the
proposed project.
3.02      C6te d'Ivoire can be divided into two fairly distinct regions
with different ecologies, agricultural systems and demographic
characteristics: the Savanna region in the North and the Forest region in
the South. The Savanna region has a more limiting climate, abundant
although fragile soils and farming systems dominated by annual crops.
Maize and yams are the main crops, each making up about 25? of the total
cultivated area (870,000 ha), followed by cotton and rice (14? each),
millet/sorghum (10?) and groundnut and cassava (10Z) respectively. The
Forest region has a richer resource base than the Savanna, better rainfall,
a denser population and larger farms (average of 6 ha against 3.6 ha in the
Savanna) typically dominated by perennial crops.



3.03      The higher rw,turns and lower risks from forest zone agriculture
have encouraged immigration. Rapid population growth (about 3.5Z p.a.)
coupled with traditional shifting agriculture, has increased the rate of
forest clearing. In 1960, there were about 14 million ha of primary
forest. Today, only 3 to 4 million ha remain, most of which as forest
reserves. About 2.8 million ha of tree crops have been established in the
cleared areas, with rubber amounting to only 45,000 ha (1985). Of the
remainder, much is under secondary forest (6 million ha) and fire climax
grasslands. The secondary forest is being exploited at a rate of about
400,000 ha annually for the production of subsistence food crops and about
80,000 ha are planted each year to cocoa and coffee. Land availability
constraints are beginning to emerge in some areas. There is also rising
concern that the slashing and burning of the secondary forest is emerging
as a serious threat to forest ecology. Forest fires during clearing are
further opening up the forest canopy and destroy valuable economic
resources. The Government recently set up a Task Force to develop a
National Forestry Plan with assistance provided under the Bank-financed
Second Forestry Project (IVC-2496). The main issues ares forest protection
and management, reforestation, wood marketing and fiscal policies. In
addition, there is an urgent need for better land use planning and for
intensification of agriculture, away from low yielding and environmentally
wasteful extensive cultivation methods. This would also allow a much more
remunerative agriculture enabling farmers to invest in more intensive tree
crop technologies.
3.04      Past agricultural growth was built on three main export crops:
coffee, cocoa and timber. Cocoa and coffee currently cover about 2.5
million ha in the forest area. Ivorian production represents 25% and 5%
respectively of the world supply of these crops. They continue to
represent about 90X of all new annual tree crop plantings with cocoa
accounting for over 50,000 ha. Cocoa and coffee cultivation is extensive
and crop husbandry poor. Other cash crops have also been encouraged in t.ie
interest of diversification, but oil palm (100,000 ha), coconuts (47,000
ha) and rubber (45,000 ha) still represent only 8% of the area covered by
coffee and cocoa. Their combined annual rate of expansion (about 15,000
halyear) is low and should be increased. However, their development
requires relatively high management skills, investments costs are high and
gestation periods long. Higher future growth rates in those crops will
require: (a) adequate investment incentive and pricing policies; (b) the
continuation of research efforts to improve yields and to translate
available research results into on-farm innovations and productivity
increases; and (c) the promotion of small and medium-scale individual
farmers to complement the existing State-controlled nucleus estates.
3.05      Government Development Strategy.  Agriculture will remain the
primary engine of Ivorian economic growth over the next decade.
Structurally, however, the circumstances for development appear less
favorable than in the past: timber exploitation potential is declining;
cocoa production is projected to grow at about 62 p.a., but may face
falling world prices as a result of such expansion; and coffee production
is on a declining trend. Against this background, Government development
strategy aims at: (a) optimizing the coffee and cocoa contribution to the



- 4 -
economy through a program to improve cocoa quality, rehabilitate existing
coffee plantations and plant new coffee; (b) promoting other export crops
to ensure diversification and greater stability in export earnings; and (c)
encouraging food crop production. Implementation of this strategy is
critically dependent upon a shift in incentives in favor of the
agricultural sector and an increase in rural incomes to motivate farmers'
initiative and permit investments in technological innovations. Such a
shift has already started under the Bank-supported Structural Adjustment
Program. SAL III incorporates major reforms aimed at promoting an
institutional environment more favorable to agricultural growth, as well as
price and incentive policies reversing the internal tems of trade in favor
of agriculture. However, for these measures to have their full effect, it
is essential that farmers have access to profitable crops and improved
technologies which in turn require effective extension services.
3.06      Bank Strategy and Assistance to Agriculture.  Since 1968, when
Bank Group operations started in C8te d'Ivoire, the Bank has financed 53
projects totalling about US$1,500 million. Of these, 19 have been directly
related to agriculture. Bank operations in agriculture have supported the
Government's policy of crop diversification and devalopment of exports with
increased emphasis on smallholders' agriculture. There are currently six
ongoing agricultural projects: a North-East Development Project (1827-IVC,
1980), a Center-West Development Project (2167-IVC, 1982), a Technical
Assistance Project (2059-IVC, 1982) with an important agricultural
component, a Fourth Rubber Project (2323-IVC, 1983), a Second Forestry
Project (2496-IVC, 1984) and a Fifth Oil Palm Project (2627-IVC) which
became effective in July 1986. In addition to the proposed Fifth Rubber
Project, five projects at identification/appraisal stage are directly
linked to Government's development strategy, which is fully endorsed by the
Bankt an Agricultural Extension Project; an Agricultural Sector Loan
an Agricultural Research Project, an Agricultural Marketing and Credit
Project and an Export Diversification Project. In general, implementation
of Bank-financed projects has been satisfactory and has improved
substantially over the past five years.
B.   Rubber Sub-sector
3.07      Development Strategy.  An important focus of the Government's
policy for the tree crop sector in the forest zone is to diversify
production towards activities with high comparative advantage and growth
prospects. Other essential aspects of this policy include privatisation
and intensification measures, with the objective of maximizing the rate of
expansion while ensuring high technical efficiency. The strategy for
rubber development Is consistent with the above policy for the tree crop
sector.
3.08      The Ministry of Agriculture's Master Plan of 1982 (Plan Directeur
Hevda) identified three phases in rubber development in COte d'Ivoires (a)
the 1955-65 period which saw the creation of several plantations in the
South-East totalling about 10,000 ha; (b) the 1972-79 period marked by the
establishment of a major rubber plantation in the South-West of some 13,000
ha (Grand Bereby); and (c) the post 1979 period when the development of
smallholder rubber became significant with 7,400 ha planted to 1986. By



- 5 -
1985, the total area planted reached 45,000 ha, for a production of some
38,000 tons of rubber. Following an October 1985 visit to the main areas
of rubber production in South-East Asia, an Ivorian study mission proposed
a major expansion of the planted area. The mission recommended a rubber
planting objective of a further 110,000 ha by the year 2000, which would
require a planting rate of some 10,000 ha per year in the 19909.
3.09      Financial and land constraints have led to the creation of
industrial plantation blocks of modest size (around 2,000 ha) with
smallholder growers participating in the development of the concession are,
rather than the establishment of a few large enclave plantations such as
Grand Bereby. Furthermore, the earlier concept of rubber development zones
with a 50:50 split of industrial plantations and smallholdings has now come
under question. The relatively high development and operating costs of
industrial plantations is a constraint as is the slow rate of smallholder
development (7,000 ha in the 1978-87 period). The latter however can be
expected to increase markedly with increased crop experience and additional
support. Accordingly, the concept of medium scale (25-50 ha) privately
owned estates - Petites et Hoyennes Entreprises H4v4icoles (PMPH) has been
developed in response to these concerns and financing of a pilot program
has been requested under the proposed project. About 1,200 ha of such
estates have already been established in recent years under private
initiative. It is anticipated that these smaller estates would have a
level of agricultural efficiency only slightly lower than industrial
plantations but considerably lower costs with a reduced need for extension
services compared with smallholders. In the proposed project, one-third of
the PMPH operators would be selected among youths with secondary education
and an agricultural background. This would respond to Government's policy
of retaining young people on the land. These operators would also serve as
part-time extension agents for smallholders. PMPHs may also be able to
offer certain support services such as the provision of planting materials
and, possibly, intermediate processing facilities under central
supervision. New industrial investments could be limited to crop
collection, processing and marketing together with extension, and the
production of planting materials.
3.10      Prior to implementing further organizational changes, the MINAGRI
proposes to examine, during the updating of the Rubber Master Plan such
topics as: the maximum implementation capacity of existing operators and
the possible entry of additional experienced plantation companies. These
could include oil palm companies established in areas which are also
suitable for rubber development. The total financing needs of the industry
would be considered along with the possibility of financing by commercial
banks, private Ivorian capital and other private sources of finance.
3.11      Some other important strategic questions will be reviewed during
the proposed project includings (a) the decentralization of planting
material production and processing possibly through the development of
small-scale nurseries and processing plants owned and operated by
smallholder groups and smaller estates; and (b) the designation and
allocation of land suitable for rubber cultivation. The latter will
require a remote sensing survey of the forest zone (para 4.16) and improved
decision-making for land allocation. Under the proposed project, new



- 6 -
rubber growing areas will be developed in the interior (Gagnoa, Soubre and
Guiberoua) away from the current concentrations along the coast.
Government wishes to encourage rubber planted in areas of secondary
forest/bush fallow resulting from ongoing shifting cultivation, as most
smallholders do.
3.11      The general direction of the proposed strategy is one of
progressive disengagement of the State froix production; densification of
rubber in existing areas along with major developments in new areas; much
wider private participation in rubber development and decentralization of
production operations to the extent appropriate. The involvement of the
State would eventually be limited to: (a) land allocation; (b) rural
infrastructure; (c) research and development; (d) training; and (l) general
policy co-ordination.
3.13      Experience in Past Lending.  The Bank together with CCCE, has
financed four rubber projects in C6te d'Ivoire. The European Development
Fund (EDF) also participated in the first two, while CDC co-financed the
latter two. The first two projects (Ln 938-IVC, 1973 and Ln 1575-IVC,
1977) involved the SOGB plantation, a 13,500 ha development created on a
new site at Grand-Berebv in the South-West. The third project (Ln
1633-IVC, 1978), supported SAPH's smallholder activities and the creation
of the Bettie nucleus estate. The fourth project (Ln 2323-IVC, 1984)
provided (a) further financing for the SAPH and SOGB managed programs; (b)
expansion of rubber research into the South-West region of the country,
which is particularly suited to rubber, and (c) a study of potential areas
and approaches for future rubber development. With regard to field
operations, the fourth project included maintenance of existing rubber and
planting of 7,400 ha of new rubber. Details of the four rubber projects
are shown in the following table:

3.14      To-date, the performance of the operating agencies has been
exceptionally good. Overall project performance has been highly
satisfactory, as was confirmed by the PPAR by OED on the Third Rubber
Project. 1/ After some initial setbacks during the first project, the
Grand-Bereby estate was completed ahead of schedule and yields are
satisfactory. There are now 11,000 ha (81X) in production. The
smallholder programs executed by SAPH have exceeded their targets and the
general standard of planting achieved has been outstanding. The Bettie
estate commenced tapping in October 1985 and 485 ha of smallholder rubber
in the South-East is now being tapped. These achievements are all on, or
ahead of, their project schedules. Two aspects of the fourth project have
incurred delays. The site of the nucleus estate in the West was changed at
negotiations and this resulted in a one year delay in implementation. The
research component which involved the establishment of 500 ha for rubber
trials and a 1,000 ha experimental/industrial plantation at Go in the
South-West was delayed by 3 years because of legal and administrative
delays in setting up of a new research institution. The executing agency,
HEVEGO is only now being created and operators have not yet been able to
commence work on the site. This component is vital for the future
development of the Ivorian rubber industry. Hence, the establishment of

HEVEGO and the fulfilment of the other conditions of disbursement for the
Go component under the Fourth Rubber Project was a condition of
negotiations of the proposed project.
C.   Institutional Environment
3.15      Rural sector responsibilities are split between four Ministries:
MINAGRI which handles export crops and sea fishing, Ministry of Rural
Development (MDR) which looks after food crops, livestock and fish
production (rivers and lakes), Ministry of Water Ressources and Forestry
(MEF) and Ministry of Scientific Research (MRS).  Responsibility over the
rubber sector .s vested in MINAGRI.
3.16      Socidt4 Africaine de Plantation d'Heveas (SAPH).  SAPH was
established in 1956 by a group of foreign companies which earlier operated
in Vietnam and Cambodia. Ini1964, it became a mixed public/private entity
and its present capital of US$20.8 million equivalent is shared between the
Government-owned Societe Nationale de Financement, (SNF) (60.4Z), a private
foreign company, Societe Internationale de Plantation d'Hdvdas (SIPH) with
36.7Z and various Ivorian investors (2.9X). SAPH owns four plantations
totalling 17,000 ha, and has over 6,700 personnel. Technical assistance is
provided by Societe de Developpement des Cultures Industrielles (SODECI), a
subsidiary of SIPH.
3.17      Because of its managerial skills and technical knowledge, SAPH
has been entrusted by Government with a first contract to establish and
manage, the Government plantation of Anguededou (1,400 ha) and with a
second, the Bettie nucleus estate (2,000 ha) the smallholders programs of
Bettie (600 ha) and South-East No. 1 (3,000 ha) around Anguededou, Toupah
and Bongo nuclei (2,000 ha). This management contract was extended to the
Cavally nucleus estate as well as to the South-East No. 2 outgrowers
program. It would be further extended to cover the development component
of the proposed project.
3.18      Soci4te des Caoutchoucs de Grand Bereby (SOGB).  SOGB was
established in March 1979 as a mixed public/private company with an initial
capital of CPAF 1,000 million held by Government (90?) and a wholly-owned
Michelin subsidiary (10?). SOGB has about 3,700 staff. Under a 1979
contract with Government, SOGB is responsible for managing the 13,500 ha
Grand Bereby Government estate and the rubber processing plant. SOGB has
been supported under the first, second and fourth rubber projects. About
80? of the estate is already in production. The proposed project does not
cover SOGB.
3.19      APROMAC.  The 'Natural Rubber Producers and Manufacturers
Association* is a non-profit industry association representing estate
owners, outgrowers, processors and manufacturers in the Ivorian rubber
sector. Presently chaired by SAPH's General Manager, the Association
operates as the advisory body for all parties involved in rubber
development. It has developed the formula used in determining the price
paid by processors for outgrower rubber. APROM&C also calculates and



- 9 -
proposes a floor price (para 5.08) which is subject to the approval of the
Minister of Agriculture.
3.20      The Rubber Research Station - Bimbresso.  Until recently, rubber
research in C6te d'Ivoire was performed by the French 'Institut de
Recherches sur le Caoutchouc' (IRCA) under the joint auspices of French and
and Ivorian Ministries of Scientific Research. MRS has recently taken over
responsibility for all agricultural research including rubber research at
Bimbresso. However,.France continues to provide scientists from IRCA to
assist with rubber research.
3.21      HEVEGO - Soci4t4 Heveicole de Go.  Because the land area
available at the Bimbresso Station is inadequate for the future rubber
research needs of C6te d'Ivoire, Government requested assistance under the
Fourth Rubber Project to create a new research facility at Go in the
South-West. This was to comprise 1500 ha for research trials and
industrial plantations, mainly for testing new hybrids derived from the
International Amazonian Collection. HEVEGO has Been established as a
corporation whose shareholders comprise Government and the main rubber
operators in the country. The institution is to be managed under a
technical assistance contract with IRCA. Ultimately both facilities at
Bimbresso and Go would be operated under a single legal entity.
3.22      Banque Nationale pour le Ddveloppement a2ricole  EBNDA).  BNDA is
the principal source of formal credit to outgrowers. It provides mainly
short-term credit backed by the rediscounting facilities of the Central
Bank of West African Countries (BCEAO). In the rubber sector, BNDA is
operating in close cooperation with SAPH. Under the proposed project,
arrangements would be made to improve further the efficiency of BNDA's
activities in the rubber sector by establishing a separate credit unit
attached to SAPH. The Direction des Plantations Villageoises (DPV) within
SAPH would maintain all records of farmers'loans.
D.   Project Formulation and Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.23        Rubber is one of the few tree crops in Cote d'Ivoire whose
yields are comparable to, or better than, those found in the main
production areas of the world, including South-East Asia. Under earlier
Bank financed projects (para 3.13) plantations have been managed with
levels of efficiency which match international standards. The technology
is advanced, reflecting the innovative capacity of management and the work
of IRCA. Under the Third and Fourth Rubber Projects smallholders have
received intensive technical support through the extension service of SAPH
and have achieved very satisfactory performance, arguably the best obtained
by Bank rubber projects. Returns per man day are estimated at about CFAF
5,000 compared with returns on traditional coffee/cocoa of about CFAP 3,000
and CFAF 2,000 respectively. Unlike these two crops, rubber provides a
year-round source of income.
3.24      The need for export-led growth and diversification of
agricultural exports militates for a rapid expansion in rubber production
(paras 3.07-3.11). Government sees the project as an important step



- 10 -
towards its policy of developing a further 100,000-110,000 ha of rubber by
the turm of the century.
3.25      In requesting the co-financiers' support of the project,
Government has three primary objectives. The first is continuation of
existiag operations, i.e. to maintain the material already planted, to
support the management and extension efforts, and to proceed with the
important experimental facilities at Go. The second, and most vital from a
policy point of view, is to develop a series of new initiatives in rubber
growing which will have important implications for the Government's rubber
st-lRagy for the remainder of the century. These include the establishment
of new poles of development in the South-West and, most interestingly, in
the new area of Center-West. The third objective is to broaden
participation in the rubber industrys the development of medium-sized
estates by farmers and by school graduates. The objective is also to
attract investment by urban savers, in professionally managed condominium
estates as a means of mobilizing private capital participation in the
industry.
3.26      Finally, Government proposes an important program of applied and
adaptive research. This is expected to help develop rubber growing and
processing techniques directly applicable to smallholder needs (paras 4.12
and 4.13). The project will also assist in formulating sector strategies
for the 1990s through an external assistance program and series of specific
studies (paras 4.16 and 4.17).
3.27      The Bank's proposed participation in this Fifth Rubber Project is
relatively modest (TJS$ 11.9 million) but is justified by the need for
continued support of the already successful diversification of agriculture
into rubber production and by the project's innovative features.
Specifically, these features include an increasing participation of private
capital in development and the introduction of cost recovery measures (para
5.11).
E.   The Project Area
3.28      The project would be located in the humid forest zone of the
southern COte d'Ivoire (IBRD Map). Project plantings would be located in
three main areas, the South-East and South-West where rubber has already
been successfully developed under previous Bank-financed projects and the
Center-West where rubber development has been equally successful but has so
far been restricted to the operations of an estate by a subsidiary of SAPH.
3.29      The topography is generally regular.  There is little variation
in temperature which averages 25 - 26 degrees centigrade while sunshine
lies in the range of 1,700 - 1,900 hours/year. Soils are upland ferralitic
with texture varying from sandy loam to silty clay. Soils subject to
waterlogging or with excessive quantities of lateritic gravel or shallow
hardpans would be excluded from planting. Rainfall is concentrated in two
wet seasons - March to June and August to September, and varies from 1,400
mm in the Center-West to 1,700 mm in the South-West. Experience at Rapid
Grah (South-West) and Bettie Estate (South-East) have shown that the lower
rainfall levels are adequate for satisfactory rubber growth and yields.



- 11 -
3.30      Good access by paved or unpaved roads exists to all project
areas. Radio communications are established at the estates which serve as
headquarters in each project area.- Most smallholders and small estates are
located on or near feeder or farm roads. Accessibility by crop collection
vehicles will be one criterion of project participation.
3.31      Land Tenure.  At Bettie Estate, arrangements for acquisition of
600 ha of land for industrial estate planting have been made. At
negotiations, SAPH has provided documentation satisfactory to the Bank
demonstrating: (a) the status of occupation; (b) the rates of compensation
to be provided if appropriate; and (c) evidence that the land is available
for use by Bettie Estate. Smallholders participating in the project would
be required to justify that they have either title to the land or certified
permission from the local authorities to plant rubber. PMPH estates would
need a satisfactory title providing evidence of ownership of land. This
requirement should not pose a problem as demonstrated by the high number of
eligible requests which have already been received.
3.32      Labor.  The availability of labor will be adequate for the small
expansion envisaged at Bettie Eetate. The PMPH estates would be located in
the South-East where the additional labor need of about 1,000 workers can
be readily found. The type of labor used on smallholdings would include
family members, permanently employed workers and casual labor in peak
periods. It is anticipated that the labor supply would be ample in all
project areas.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Summary Description
4.01      The project would be implemented over a five-year period by three
executing agencies: SAPH and HEVEGO and BNDA. Disbursements would be
spread over six years. It would establish 14,900 ha of new plantations and
bring to maturity around 6,700 ha planted under previous Bank-financed
projects. These investments would be complemented by a research program, a
staff training program, effluent control measures, and studies on future
rubber development strategy. The project would consist of three main
components: plantation, research activities and support activities.
4.02      Plantations.  Provision of inputs and financial assistance to
participants in the following programs:

B.   Detailed Features
1.   The Plantina Program
4.05      The total planting program consists of close to 15,000 ha of
rubber equivalent to 562 of the areas planted under previous Bank-financed
projects or approximately 281 of the total area presently planted in Cote
d'Ivoire.
4.06      The executing agencies would be SAPH - 13,500 ha and HEVEGO -
1,400 ha. These targets are considered feasible over a five-year period
as: (a) nursery facilities for 1,000 ha have already been established in
1986; (b) the bulk of the program would be executed by a relatively large
number of participants - 3,400 smallholders over 5 sites; (c) the
agricultural techniques are well established; (d) highly satisfactory
results have been achieved under the previous project managed by SAPH.
SAPH staff is experienced and is supported by appropriate infrastructure
and equipment (para 3.16). Annual physical targets and individual
participants are tabled in Annex 4-1.
4.07      Smallholder Plantations.  The program covers new plantings of
9,700 ha of smallholder rubber and their maintenance to maturity in areas
in the South-East, South-West and Center of COte d'Ivoire (IBRD Nap). The
program also involves the continued maintenance of 4,400 ha in the
South-East which were planted under the fourth project. Farmers would
benefit from a well proven technical package as well as, administrative and
logistical support from SAPH (para 3.16). Credit package financed through
BNDA (para 5.13) would involve the provision for plantirg material and
agricultural inputs (para 4.29), farmers providing labor for all
agricultural operations equivalent to approximately 402 of total investment
costs. Cash credit would be limited to the first year (land clearing and
planting) and to farmers in new development zones.
4.08      Medium-Scale Individual Plantation (PMPH).  This component would
assist existing land owners in establishing 2,500 ha of medium-scale
estates in individual blocks of 25 to 50 ha in the traditional rubber
planting areas of th', South-East. The program involves the continuous
maintenance of 500 ha in the South-East which are being planted under the
Fourth Project. Prospective participants would be selected by a committee
made up of representatives of MINAGRI, SAPH, BNDA on the basis of ownershin
and demonstrable financial resources. Under the project's credit financing
arrangements, the participants would be required to finance approximately
40? of investments in addition to a security deposit with BNDA equivalent
to one year of maintenance costs. Qualified plantation managers would
receive appropriate agricultural and managerial training from SAPH.  Within
this component a rural youth development pilot scheme (essentially school
leavers) of 1000 ha in individual blocks of 15-20 ha would be developed.
Family land ownership would be a prerequisite to participation. Following
initial test and training, participants would be employed as extension
agents by SAPH and part of their salaries applied to the financing of
approximately 40? of their farm investments costs.



- 14 -
4.09      Medium-Scale Plantations under Single Management (GMPH).
The project would support the creation of a condominium type corporation -
GMPN with the objective of attracting urban savings into rural areas (para
1.01). Starting in Project Year 2, GMPH would develop 700 ha of rubber,
through a management contract with SAPH, within SAPH's own estate at
Rapides Grah in the South-West region so as to benefit from existing SAPH
physical infrastructure. The estate would be subdivided into individual
blocks of approximately 25 ha to be allocated to shareholders. Block
owners equity contribution into establishment cost financing would be
equivalent to 40Z of total costs the balance being financed under credit
arrangements with BNDA (p&ra 5.13). Half of the equity would be payable as
initial call, the remaining payable over the six-year establishment period.
Approval by Government of the GMPH statutes and fulfilment of the initial
call on capital would be a condition of disbursement for that component
(para 6.05 (a)).
4.10      Bettie Nucleus Estate.  The project would extend the area of
2,052 ha planted under the Third Project by an additional 600 ha to bring
the nucleus estate to full and final development. Processing would be
ensured by the factory financed under the ongoing Fourth Project. Because
of the need to reduce the relatively high cost of mechanical land clearing,
SAPS would test three different methods combining partly mechanical and
manual techniques; manual combined with chemical treatment to reduce the
threat of Fomes disease; and land clearing by food crop cultivators using
traditional shifting cultivation techniques two years ahead of felling.
4.11      Cavally Nucleus Estate.  2,000 ha planted under the ongoing
Fourth Project would be maintained to maturity. The estate's full
production potential would be 4,500 tons. Production of 400 tons of
Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR) block rubber would start in 1991, the
project's final implementation year. Construction of processing facilities
would start in the following year but would not be financed under the
proposed project. The relatively small initial volume of production would
be transported to SAPH Rapides Grah factory for processing. Additional
infrastructure, comprising the construction of an office block, a permanent
workers' village, four staff houses, replacement of vehicles and
agricultural equipment would be financed under the project.
2.   Adaptive Research
4.12      Five themes of particular interest to future rubber crop
development would be tested under an applied research program to be run by
IRCA: (a) control of noxious weeds; (b) testing of new clones (PB 217 and
PB 235); (c) prolonged intercropping beyond the first year of rubber
cultivation; (d) control of root disease (Fomes); and (e) processing of
outgrower latex. Signature of a satisfactory contact not later than June
30, 1988 between IRCA and SAPH specifying the work program, personnel to be
employed and budget ceilings would be a condition of disbursement against
this component (para 6.03 (b)).



- 15 -
3.   Applied Research
4.13      The applied research program currently managed by IRCA at
Bimbresso would be expanded under HZVEGO's responsibility (para 3.21) the
corporate structure created under the Fourth Project. It would establish
400 ha of experimental fields and 1,000 ha of industrial plantations. The
latter would provide HEVEGO in the long-term with revenue sources to ensure
its financial independence. The project would also finance physical
infrastructure (office, housing, tracks) vehicles and equipment.
4.   Studies and Institutional Development
4.14;     Institutional Development.  A Rubber Credit Unit (RCU) would be
created within SAPH. Management of the RCU would be assumed by BNDA
relying on SAPH farmers' accounts which are fully computerized. The RCU
(essentially a two-man team) would manage credit activities related to this
project and coordinate other credit recovery currently handled through the
BNDA's agencies where rubber sales proceeds are deposited. The project
would support the cost of operating the RCU and one credit officer at two
BNDA rural agencies. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
qualifications and experience of the credit officers would be satisfactory
to the Bank (para 6.01 (a)).
4.15      Training.  SAPH's existing core of managerial and supervisory
staff is satisfactory. However, persisting skill gaps would need to be
filled through an intensified training program. In-house training for
senior managers would be complemented by external training in agro-
industrial management at suitable rubber growing institutes in Africa and
South-East Asia coupled with short courses at local technical and research
institutes. In.-house training for extension staff is managed by a
professional trainer, functions well and is directed towards a Training and
Visit (T & V) type system. SAPH's administrative staff would receive
additional training in accounting, financial and budgetary control, and use
of micro-computers.
4.16      Studies.  To orient Government in its decision-making within the
framework of the Rubber Master Plan (1992-2000), updated studies in the
following areas would be requireds (a) land identification survey by remote
sensing methods during the first year of the project covering 100,000 ha to
provide data on land availability and determine the potential for expansion
of the rubber sector (TOR on file); (b) the feasibility of decentralized
smallholder and medium-scale estate nurseries and small-scale processing;
and (c) analysis of the several clone trials established throughout the
potential rubber area.
4.17      Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation.  A Rubber Planning and
Monitoring Unit (RPMU) has recently been created within MINAGRI's own
budgetary control unit, the DPBCG. The unit would function as a planning
unit, organizing and coordinating the strategic studies defined under the
project (para 4.16). It would also be responsible for submitting to
Government proposals for the future strategy in the rubber sector. To
ensure high technical performance of RPMU in the execution of the strategic
planning exercise, the employment of an experienced agro-economist as a



- 16 -
tree crops planning specialist, would be required (para 4.18). The RPMU
will also functi,on as a supervisory unit, responsible for vetting the
Project's annual implementation programs and budgets, monitoring project
execution and collecting technical data. Agreement was obtained at
negotiations that Government would employ at all times during the project
implementation period as the Head of the RPCU, tecbnical staff whose
qualifications and experience are satisfactory to the Bank (para 6.01 (b)).
4.18      Technical Assistance.  Rubber development operations at Cavally
will necessitate a continuation of the technical assistance provided under
the Fourth Rubber Project. An agro-economist whose terms of reference have
been agreed with Government is also required for the RPMU (para 4.17). The
technical assistance schedule is in Annex 4-2.
C.   Project Cost and Financing
1.   Cost Estimates
4.19      Total project costs including taxes are estimated at
CFAF 18.0 billion (US$58.9 million) with a foreign exchange component of
CPA? 7.2 billion (US$23.5 million) or about 39X. Taxes amount to CPA? 3.4
billion (US$11.3 million). Project costs include 'Financial Charges during
Immaturity Phase' corresponding to the financial gap created by the
mis-match between BNDA's own borrowing terms from external financiers (para
4.22) and the terms of its credits to farmers (para 5.13). Specifically,
the grace period granted to farmers is seven years as against the five-year
grace period to BNDA 21. The Government would provide BNDA with the
necessary resources to cover this gap. Project costs are summarized below.
A breakdown by project component and costs is given in Annexes 4-3 and 4-4.
2/   Foreign loans to BNDA would not permit capitalization of interest
during the grace period while interest would be capitalized for loans
to farmers.

1/   Fbreign loans to BNDA would not permit capltalization of interest during the grade period while interest
wvould be capitalized for loans to farmers.
4.20         Base costs are valued as at June 1987.  Price contingencies on
foreign costs are based on the Bank's projections of international price
increases (MUV 1987 6.&2; 1988 6.8S; 1989 7.0; 1990 7.12; 1991 4.0X).
Price contingencies on local costs are based on the Bank forecast of
domestic inflation (GNP deflator 1987-1991 of 2.52 per annum). Physical
contingencies vary over a large number of items with a project average of
about 61.

4.22       IBRD, CCCE and CDC would finance approximately 25X each of the
net of tax project costs excluding 'Financial Charges during Immaturity
Phase'. The latter would be funded by the Government. Government
financing would represent 23Z of total net of tax costs. This contribution
would include the financial charges during the immaturity period described
above (US$1.49 million) and all credit supplied in cash to farmers (US$1.71
million). The foreign lenders would fund credit for input supplies.
Private investors in the GMPH component would finance 2Z of total project
cost (US$1.11 million). The proposed terms of the loans from co-financiers
are indicated as below. Detailed Financing Plan is in Annex 4-3.

a/ Variable
In order to facilitate the timely implementation of the project, the
Government would establish Revolving Funds into which would be deposited
upon effectiveness: (a) an initial amount equivalent to US$ 1.2 million
into a Special SAPH Account at the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA)
representing six months' financing of project costs; (b) on October 1,
1988, the expected start up date of the Hevego component, US$ 300,000 into
a special HEVEGO Account at CAM; and (c) US$500,000 into a special BNDA
Account at CAM representing 3 months advance funding credit in kind.
Government would deposit into a Project Account for BNDA an initial amount
of CFAF 25 million (US$82,000) at CAA representing six months' financing of
cash credit to farmers. Government's share of project costs would be
financed from the Annual Investment Budget (BSIE) in accordance with the
project's annual budgets. Government would release into the Project
Account for SAPH counterpart funds equivalent to four months expenditure
one month prior to October 1, the start of the project's financial year.
Subsequent releases would be made on the basis of statements of
expenditure. Deposit by Government of CFAF 25 million into the BNDA
Project Account at CAA would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank
Loan (para 6.02 (a)). The fulfilment of the conditions of effectiveness of
CCCE and CDC loans would also be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank
loan (para 6.02 (b)).
4.23      Loans by external financiers would be made to the Government
which would onlend to BNDA on the same terms and conditions the portion
needed to cover credit to farmers.   Government would assume the variable
interest risk and CAM the foreign exchange risk on the credit component
(para 6.01 (c)). Government contribution to BNDA for the funding of loans
would be passed on as a grant. The weighted average cost of external funds
and Government financing to BNDA would be 4.82 and would allow a sufficient
spread to BNDA on its loans to farmers (para 5.14). A subsidiary loan
agreement for external funding and a protocol agreement satisfactory to the
Bank would be concluded between the Government and BNDA which would define
the modalities of Government contribution to project costs while allowing
BNDA to maintain a minimum spread of 32 (para 6.02 (c)).
3.   Procurement
4.24      All goods and services financed under the project would be
procured in accordance with Bank guidelines except for vehicles and
equipment being financed by CCCE which would be procured under its own

4.25      All procurement would be grouped with SAPH requirements for
existing plantations where applicable. Contracts valued at
US$200,000 or more would be procured through international competitive
bidding. These contracts would include agricultural inputs. Contracts
worth less than US$200,000 equivaleint but more than US$100,000 would be
procured by local competitive bidd.ng. These contracts would include
vehicles and agricultural equipment. Contracts for goods of less than
US$100,000 would be awarded through iccal competitive bidding or local
shopping. 'When local shopping is used, a minimum of three quotations would
be obtained. Because of the dispersed nature of construction work,



- 21 -
procurement would be through local competitive bidding. Land clearing at
Bettie nucleus estate (para 4.10) and Zor the medium-scale estate (GMPH)
for a total of (US$1.7 million) would be carried out on force account by
SAPH which possesses the necessary equipment and experience and has
demonstrated during the ongoing Fourth Project that it can carry out this
type of work in a competitive manner. Land clearing at HEVEGO (US$2.6
million) would be carried out under local competitive bidding as the phased
period (3 years) of execution does not justify ICB. Budded stumps would be
supplied to farmers from SAPH nurseries. The costs of production of the
nurseries have been examined at appraisal and were found acceptable. These
costs would be reviewed regularly by Bank supervision missions. To ensure
maximum yields, project farmers would not be permitted to obtain stumps
from sources other than SAPH-managed nurseries. Adaptive research would be
carried out by IRCA under contract with SAPH under terms satisfactory to
the Bank (para 4.12).
4.   Disbursements
4.26      Following agreement with co-financiers, disbursement of foreign
funds wherever possible would be on parallel-basis except for agricultural
inputs where pari-passu financing would be applied (para 4.22). The Bank
loan would be disbursed over a six-year period. The SAPH accounting and
budgetary control system has been found adequate to record project
expenditures by type and by cost center. Disbursement requests for
vehicles, agricultural equipment, research and technical assistance would
be fully documented for SAPH, HEVEGO and BNDA. The disbursement of
expenditures whose value is less than US$20,000 would be made against
statements of expenditure (SOE), with documentation being retained for
inspection by supervision missions. Under the project's audit requirements
(para 4.27), annual audit reports would incorporate certification of (a)
expenditures claimed under SO0s; (b) origin and utilization of Bank
financed goods and services for project purpose. The disbursement schedule
of the proposed loan has been based on the actual disbursement profile of
the Third Rubber Project (Annex 4-5).

5. Reporting, Accounts and AuV t
4.27      SAPH financial management and internal control systems function
well. Periodic reports on both SAPH's own and on its managed operations
have been submitted to the Bank in a timely manner. Audited project
accounts for the last financial year (September 30, 1985) were submitted
within the Bank prescribed deadlines. Under the project, SAPH and HEVEGO
would be required to submit to Government for approval and to the Bank for
information, annual budgets for each project component at least one month
prior to the start of the financial year. This has been agreed at
negotiations (para 6.01 (d)). SAPH would continue to submit to the Bank
quarterly progress reports on project execution. SAPH would assist APROMAC
in the management of the farmers price guarantee fund (FPSH) (para 5.08).
It would provide financial data in support of movements of funds from or to
individual farmers' accounts from its own records. APROMAC would submit to
the Bank an annual report on the fund operations not later than three
months after the end of the financial year. HEVEGO would maintain an
accounting system and follow reporting requirements as agreed under the
Fourth Project. SAPH would assist BNDA's Rubber Credit Unit on
farmers'credit accounts making use of SAPH existing computerized accounting
system. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that SAPH, HEVEGO, FPSH
and BNDA would (a) maintain apprbpriate records and accounts; (b) have the
project accounts, the Special Accounts, and claims made under SOE
procedures (para 4.22) audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank; and (c) submit to the Banlg, audited annual accounts for the project
components under their management responsibility within six months of the
end of their financial year (para 6.01 (e)). Within six months after the
loan closing date, MINAGRI would prepare or have prepared a completion
report covering all components of the project for submission to the Bank
(para 6.01 (f)).
D.   Project Implementation
1.   Or2anisation and Management
4.28      The project would be implemented under the overall responsibility
of MINAGRI which would ensure proper planning and control of execution by
SAPH. HEVEGO would fall under MRS responsibility. The Project
Organisation Chart is in Annex 4-6.
2.   Smallholder Program (PVH)
4.29      The planting and maintenance program would be executed by the
smallholders themselves using mostly family labor or hired labor for land
clearing. SAPH would provide a comprehensive and intensive extension
service through its service facility for smallholders (DPV). Since the DPV
is currently involved in managing smallholders in t.e South-East only, a
sub-division of the DPV would be created at Rapides Grah in the South-West
to manage the proposed new development of 4,700 ha in the South-West,
Center and Center-West zones and the GMPH program in the South-West. This
sub-division would be headed by a Deputy Manager assisted by a Technical
Advisor.   SAPH would continue to run its extension service on a T & V type



- 24 _
system. SAPH would provide residential training courses to farmers joining
the project. The current high intensity of extension services (I monitor
to 30 farms) would be reduced to 1:40 in the new development zones and ls60
in established zones. SAPH would produce the planting material in
nurseries established for the project and provide all other physical inputs
to the farmers under the terms of a contract between Government and SAPH.
As conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan (a) the arrangements
agreed upon between Government and SAPH under the Fourth Project would have
been amended to include the new PVH development areas; (b) BNDA and SAPH
would have amended their existing agreement to include the new working
arrangements for credit management and (c) SAPH would have established and
staffed a new subdivision of the DPV to manage the smallholder program in
the new areas (para 6.02 (4)). The training and supervision program as
well as incremental extension staff requirements are shown in Annex 4-7.
3.   Medium-Scale Plantations
(a)  Individual (PMPH)
4.30      The conditions to be fulfilled by prospective participants in
this program would be: (a) satisfactory evidence of land title for the
block to be developed; (b) signature of a development contract with SAPH;
(c) signature of a credit agreement with BNDA, on the basis of a financial
plan approved by SAPH; (d) for non-resident participants, identification of
a manager to be trained by SAPH and signature of a contract for outside
labor approved by SAPH; (e) in the case of the pilot scheme for school
graduates: (i) a one-year field training program at SAPH remunerated at a
level equivalent to a clerk's salary (CFAF 38 000/per month), 30X of which
would be used as equity contribution; (ii) subsequently, during the
immature period of their own plantation, integration of participants in the
SAPH extension team (responsibility over 15 farmers only). Land
preparation would be carried out by outside labor hired with SAPH approval
and paid for under the credit; and (f) selection by a special committee
made up of SAPH, BNDA, MINAGRI and DMP staff. Establishment of such a
committee would be a condition of disbursement for this component (para
6.03 (d)).
4.31      SAPH would produce the necessary planting material in nurseries
created for the project. Input supplies for plantations would be financed
by BNDA credits (para 5.13). Extension services would be provided by a
special unit within the DPV. This unit would be staffed with one Techriical
Officer, two Sector Heads and two mobile teams of six staff each. A
condition of effectiveness for this component would be that Government
would have made satisfactory management arrangements with SAPH for the new
medium-scale plantation areas to be developed under the project including
approval of the contracts between PMPH participants; and BNDA and SAPH
would have concluded a satisfactory agreement for credit management
(para 6.02 (d)).
(b) Single Management (GMPH)
4.32      The program would be executed under the following conditions: (a)
a condominium type corporation would be created (statutes have been



- 25 -
prepared) with the objective of grouping for a limited period (now foreseen
as 20 years - the credit repayment period) investors interested in rubber
growing but with insufficient crop management experience. The GMPH would
be run through a co-owners committee meeting at intervals dafined under the
statutes; (b) GMPH would sub-contract with SAPH the management and
execution of the planting and maintenance program; (c) plantings (700 ha)
would be carried out on land now available within the SAPH allocation. The
cost of physical infrastructure common to all blocks (roads, etc.) would be
shared among co-owners; (d) GMPH would negotiate credit arrangements with
BNDA (para 5.13) on the basis of financing plans which would establish from
the outset the amount and timing of co-owners equity contribution. The
co-owners would thus be in a position to know the extent of their
commitments over the period. Provision would, however, be made to allow
subsequent revisions of the original investment costs. Conditions of
disbursement against this component would be (i) approval by Government of
GMPH statutes and granting of land rights to GMPH for subsequent
sub-division; and (ii) signature of a management contract satisfactory to
the Bank between SAPH and GMPH (para 6.03 (a)).
4.   Credit Arrangements
4.33      Under a contract signed between BNDA and Government under the
ongoing Fourth Project, terms and conditions of BNDA credits have been
determined. A subsidiary agreement between BNDA and SAPH is currently in
effect which sets forth SAPH's responsibilities over the technical aspects
of the development program. Credit to participants in the project's
smallholder, PMPH and GMPH programs would be managed by BNDA which would
select participants in agreement with SAPH. The system would be run by a
Senior Investment Officer of BNDA and one assistant using the
micro-computer facilitURs of SAPH. SAPH would be primarily responsible
for credit recovery from the proceeds of farmers' sales to SAPH.
Conditions of effectiveness would be the amendment of the existing
agreements between Government and BNDA, and between BNDA and SAPH to
include the project's new development programs and new working arrangements
between BNDA and SAPH (paras 4.29 and 4.31).
5.   HEVEGO
4.34      HEVEGO has been established as a research institute with equity
participation by Government, SAPH and SOGB. It will maintain its existing
technical assistance agreement with IRCA. Planting material for the
industrial and experimental programs would be produced by the estate
nursery.
6.   Nucleus Estates
4.35      The planting program at Bettie and the maintenance program at
Cavally would continue to be executed under existing management
arrangements between SAPH and Government. Under the land clearing test
program (para 4.10), SAPH would be required to submit to Government by the
end of Year 2, recommendations regarding the choice of alternative land
clearing methods to be used for the third (150 ha) and fourth (150 ha)
tranches of the Bettie planting program.



- 26 -
7.   Implementation Plan
4.36      The project's planting and crop maintenance programs would be
implemented over a five-year period. Because of the time slice nature of
the project, starting and completion dates of individual components will
not necessarily coincide. Thus, for plantations starting in Project Years
1 and 2, investments in nurseries have been made two years ahead under the
ongoing Fourth Project. Similarly, the Cavally nucleus estate and the
HEVEGO applied research components would start in Year 3 of the proposed
project but would be financed under the Fourth Project until end 1988. The
Adaptive Research program would run for a four-year period starting in Year
2. Because of the importance of an accurate assessment of land
availability for a future Sixth Project, the Land Identification Survey
which is part of the studies component would be executed in Year 1 of the
Project. The other studies would be executed over a three-year period.
The Project Implementation Schedule is in Annex 4-8.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETS. PRICES AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
1.   Technical Aspects
5.01      The planting program would involve the production of planting
material, land clearing, crop establishment and maintenance operations.
Planting material for PVH and PMPH holdings would be supplied by SAPH as
20-month old, bare root budded stumps. In the case of the GMPH and nucleus
estate plantings, the plants would be produced in polybag nurseries. Land
clearing on PVH holdings would be carried out manually as establishment is
usually after light bush or derelict former tree crops. In the case of
PMPH plantings where larger areas and logged forest are involved,
contractors equipped with chainsaws would be hired for tree felling. On
industrial scale plantations (GMPH and nucleus), a variety of manual and
combined mechanical/manual techniques would be used. The adoption of
manual clearing for industrial scale areas is now considered feasible with
the use of Calixin in the treatment of Fomes root disease. Planting
density and layout would be maintained at 513 plants per hectare in
triangular spacing for PVH and PMPH and 510 plants per hectare
(7.0 x 2.8 meters) for industrial plantations. Intercropping with rice,
groundnuts and maize as the last crop would be allowed in the planting
year, Pueraria cover crop being sown at the same time as maize. SAPH would
try intercropping in Years 2 and 3 on limited PVH trial areas as already
demonstrated by IRCA experiments. Fertilizers with phosphate as the main
component would be applied from Year of planting 0 to Year 4. In Year 6,
taRping in conjunction with tree stimulation would commence, carried out
mostly by family members in the case of PVH and by hired labor in other
cases. Tapping would be carried out twice a week for a maximum of 90
tappings per year.
2.   Production
5.02      Yields obtained would be 75Z in latex form and the remainder as
field coagulated lump. Yield estUmates for nucleus estate plantations are
based on SAPH's average mature area yields during the years 1983-85 of 2.3



- 27 -
tons per hectare. Yields for GMPH plantings (SAPH-managed) have been
estimated at 100? of industrial plantations.  P?.H plantations which would
benefit from SAPH trained managers are expected to reach yields of 2.0
tons/ha or approximately 85? of industrial crops.  Based upon current
experience smallholder yields in the form of field coagulated lumps have
been estimated at 1.75 ton/ha or approximately 751 of industrial crops in
the form of field coagulated lumps.
5.03      The project's increnental annual production estimates from new
plantings at the peak period (Year 12 of plantation) have been estimated at
26,570 tons including 3,450 tons from HEVEGO. Production estimates for the
project planting program are shown in Annex 5-1.
3.   Markets and Prices
5.04      The growth in world elastomer consumption is expected to average
around 2.62 p.a. in the 1985-2000 period. This rate is lower than the 4X
p.a. growth rate of the 1960-84 period. Throughout the 1970s, world
consumption of natural rubber (NR) grew more slowly than that of synthetic
rubbers (SR) leading to a decline in NR's market share. Since then, there
has been some recovery and NR's market share has stabilized at about 32?.
5.05      In the short run, NR prices are liable to fluctuate widely
because both demand and supply are relatively price inelastic. It is
projected that NR prices will change little in 1987 from the current level
of US$907/ton. From 1988-90, higher growth rates in the newly
industrialized countries as well as China and India are expected to spur
greater NR consumption. For the long-term, EPD projections show that, in
real terms, KR prices are likely to increase from US$1,075/ton in 1990 to
US$1,210/ton in 1995 (1986 prices). Detailed price forecasts are in Annex
5-2.
5.06      C6te d'Ivoire's projected annual production of 60,000 tons in the
1990s would represent less than 1.5? of the estimated world production.
The first year plantings financed under the project would start producing
in 1994 at a time when price levels are forecast to be 45? higher than
present day levels but lower than the levels of the 1970s.
5.07      The nricing reform supported under SAL III took effect for
agro-industrial products from December 1986. It ensures rubber producers
and processors the full world market equivalent value of their produce. In
practice it is translated into (a) removal of existing export taxes (4.6?
of FOB price) and (b) payment of an export premium of 21? of the FOB price
for an effective protection of 20? (SAL III Development Policy Letter Annex
V-A - III).
5.08      The current pricing system for outgrowers' rubber sales was set
up in 1983 under the Bank's Fourth Project. It is managed by APROMAC (para
3.19). The system functions well and has been used as a model for
establishing outgrowers'fresh fruit bunch prices under the Fifth Oil Palm
Project (Loan 2627-IVC). The outgrowers' price level is determined monthly
on the basis of the quarterly moving average of world prices for the three



- 28 -
categories of rubber 3/ produced in C8te d'Ivoire net of marketing,
processing and transport costs. The system also involves a floor price
fixed by Government decree so as to guarantee a minimum net income per man
day. The margin between the farmgate floor price and the realized price is
shared in the following proportions: 702 is paid to the farmer, 102 to the
factory and 202 to a price stabilization fund 'Fonds Professionnel de
Solidarite de l'Hevea' (FPSH) owned by the farmers and managed by APROMAC.
Under the proposed project's cost recovery recommendation (para 5.11) the
smallholders' and medium-scale farmers' margin of 70? would be reduced to
65? to accommodate the cost recovery cess. The floor price was raised in
May 1985 from CFAF 160/kg (UScts 52/kg) to CFAF 175/kg (UScts 57/kg) and
became operative for the first time in September 1985 when prices realized
were below the floor level. On the basis of projected world prices, the
pricing reform being put into place under SAL III (para 5.07) would ensure
that farmgate prices remain above the floor price resulting in a gradual
build-up of the FPSH.  Conditions for audit and management of the FPSH are
detailed in para 4.27. Monthly movements in world market prices and prices
paid to farmers between October 1983 and April 1986 are pictured
graphically in Annex 5-3.
4.   Financial Analysis
5.09      The underlying assumptions to the economic and financial analysis
are described in Annex 5-4.
5.10      Farmers Income and Return.  Comparative financial data from the
analysis of crop and farm budgets are presented in the table below.
Detailed analysis is shown in Annexes 5-5 and 5-6.

coagulated rubber; and SMR 20 - for bottom grade). Outgrowers' rubber
is graded as SMR 10.

a/ The IRRs after credit financing reflect the financial rate of return
to the investors capital and family labor for smallholders.
As shown is the above table, internal rates of return (IRR) estimates for
the different types of holdings are satisfactory. They are 21?, 24? and
15X for smallholders, PMPH and GMPH respectively. The higher investment
costs of PMPH relative to s-allholder plantations are more than compensated
by higher yields (para 5.02). On the other hand, the substantially higher
establishment and management costs of GMPH plantations relative to P1MPH
coupled with a relatively small difference in yields result in a
comparatively lower IRR for GMPH plantations. However the projected return
is still higher than the opportunity cost of capital. Return per man day
iD the full production year on smallholdings compares favorably with those
for traditional forest zone crops under intensive cultivation - coffee CFAP
2,716, cocoa CFAF 4,398, oil palm CFAF 5,900 and coconut CFAF 5,018. A
positive cash flow would be obtained with rubber six y -%rs after the
planting year, assuming an annual planting program of 2 ha and 10 ha for
smallholdings and medium-scale holdings respectively.
5.11      Recovery of Extension Costs.  While under the ongoing Fourth
Project, no extension costs are being recovered, Government would start
partial recovery during the proposed project on the following basis: (a)
for smallholders: a fixed annual levy of CFAF 16,000 (US$46) would be
charged during the investment period and capitalized in the credit package.
During the production period, a levy calculated at 5? of the margin between
farmgate and floor price (para 5.08) would be charged to the farmer's
rubber output. The cost recovery index based on this formula would be 21Z.



- 30 -
Because Government wishes to promote expansion of a relatively new crop,
full recovery is not justified. Agreement was obtained be sought at
negotiations that Government would authorize APROMAC to modify the internal
price structure to accommodate the levy for extension costs recovery.
Signature of a Government decree to this effect would be a condition of
loan effectiveness (para 6.04 (f)); (b) PMPHt the employment of a paid SAPH
trained manager would substitute for a levy during the investment period;
but the levy would apply on the same basis as for smallholders during the
production period. Since no production is expected during project
implementation agreement was obtained at negotiations that Government would
hold discussions with the Bank before Project Year 5 on a formula for the
extension cost recovery cess applicable to medium-scale estates (PMPH)
(para 6.01 (g)).
5.12      Nucleus Estates - Cash Flow Analysis.  Bettie and Cavally nucleus
estates' financial rates of return calculated on total investment are 1OX
and 7Z respectively. They reflect the high cost of establishing new
development poles in yet unopened areas. Spill-over benefits have not been
measured however. The use of a net of tax cash flow has been considered
more appropriate for Bettie and Cavally nucleus estates' financial
analysis. Both are 1002 Government-owned pilot estates created as regional
developwont poles for smallholder plantations. Debt servicing on
investment financed under previous projects and the proposed project is
assumed by Government. Cash flow indicators shown in the tables below
reflect Government ability to finance future capital replacement and debt
service from net of tax income.

In the full production year the ratio of operating costs to turnover would
be satisfactory at 53Z of project prices for both estates. In order to
maintain the financial viability of the estates, agreement was obtained
from Government at negotiations that surplus operating balances would be
applied to financing in the following order of priority: (a) working
capital needs; and (b) fixed assets replacement prior to distribution (para
6.02 (h)).

Investor's Equity Contribution (X)   37             38          30         40
The credit arrangements are based upon the following assumptionst
(a) a crop maturity cycle of six years after plantation; (b) a debt service
ratio not to exceed 20? of gross revenue during Years 7 to 12 when the full
production level is reached; (c) capitalization of interest during the grace
period; (d) a spread differential of 1.5? between interest charged during the
investment period when RCU operating costs would be minimal. As a result, the
debt service burden to farmers from capitalized interest would be substantially
alleviated; (e) deposit by medium-scale plantation farmers (excluding the pilot
scheme) into an interest bearing accoune. at BNDA of the equivalent of one year
of manpower costs (CPAF 45,000 per ha) as a guarantee towards the maintenance of
their plantations; (f) as equity contribution, downpayment by GMPH shareholders
of CFAP 200,000 per ha and subsequent monthly payments of CPAF 125,000 for six
years (per 25 ha). Lending rates would be broadly in line with Central Bank of
West African States (BCEA0) mandated rates for agriculture 8-10? p.a. These
rates would be positive in real terms as local inflation is forecast to be 2.5?
p.a.
5.14      BNDA resources for lending to farmers amounting to US$12.1 million
would be supplied by external co-financiers in the amount of 60? with the 40?
balance provided by Government. This would result in an average resource cost
to BNDA of 4.8?. The average BNDA lending rate of 8.5?, would give BNDA a
spread of 3.7? which would be sufficient to cover project administrative costs
and the relatively small lending risks. Farmers' repayments would be ensured
though rubber sales to SAPH-managed factories.
5.15      Because of mis-matching between borrowing and lending terms, a
financial gap of ClAP 453 million would accumulate at the end of the project
implementation period. Under the project, this financial gap would be financed
by Government as 'Financial Charges during Immaturity' and would add to the cost
of the project (Para 4.19).
5.16      SAPH.  Although SAPH is not directly involved in the project's
investment program, its financial performance during past years has been found
satisfactory and is expected to remain so under the project.

6. Proiect Benefits and Economic Analysis
5.17      The projected net foreign exchange earnings over the productive
life of the 15,900 ha of new plantations would be equivalent to US$828
million valued at export parity prices in constant 1986 US dollars.
5.18      The project would generate 3,700 man years of Incremental
employment and increase the income of farming families in the forest zone
by CFAF 6 900 per man day during the loan repayment period. Through the
PMPH and GMPH programs, the projects would transfer urban savings into the
rural area for a total of at CFAF 339 million (US$0.98 million) over the
six-year crop investment cycle. The project's indirect benefits' spillover
would accrue to the transport sector through the construction of rural
tracks, to the rural financial sector by making rural credit accessible to
farmers and by the mobilization of rural savings into the banking system.
5.19      Economic Analysis.  The project's economic rate of return reaches
16? which is within the norms for rubber plantation projects and higher
than the opportunity cost of capital in COte d'Ivoire currently estimated
at 11.5?. Rates of return have also been calculated for each separate
plantation component.  The MEs for nucleus estates and smallholders have
been calculated on the basis of total investments to-date as there is no
clear separation of benefits accruing from crop plantations during earlier
projects and maintenance of the same immature crop under the proposed
project. The rates obtained for the two nucleus estates (10? - Bettie and
7t - Cavally) reflect the high cost of establishing new development poles
involving heavy land clearing of dense forest, wells, the establishment of
a road network, and important social infrastructure (villages, hospital,
school). The benefit of replanting on cleared land at the end of the first
crop cycle has not been measured, but an EU on replanting would be
considerably higher. Smallholder plantings have lower investment costs as
they are created on land already cleared and do not include infrastructure
costs. The underlying assumptions to the economic rate of return
calculation is in Annex 5-7.

5.20      Sensitivity Analysis.  The projected economic and financial rates
of return have been tested against adverse price movements for output as
well as yield decreases and production cost increases. Tree crop projects
where benefits stretch over a long period are traditionally relatively
insensitive to cost increase and slightly more sensitive to decrease in
benefits. The sensitivity analysis of the project's economic rate of
return was carried out for a possible decline in world prices for rubber.
If prices of rubber remain at the 1986 constant levels, the project's ERR
will decline from 16X to 131.   In the economic analysis, the medium to
long term second best equilibrium exchange rate of 400 CFAF/US$ 41 has
been used. Further risk lies in yields lower than forecast due to poor
establishment or tapping practices. Project organization and management by
SAPH should offer reasonable protection against these risks as the same
high establishment standards would be maintained (para 3.17). SAPH has an
efficient training program for tappers and maintains strict supervision
criteria. Reduced yields in the last years of production would have
relatively little effect on the rate of return. Sensitivity curves for the
various components are illustrated in Annex 5-8.
7.   Proiect Risks
5.21      Agriculture.  The risk of disease outbreak (Fomes) would be
considerably limited by the use of a new cheaical compound (Calixine).
Tree densities (513 per ha) would provide an adequate stand of windfast
4/J  Derived from the updated country-wide macro model diFcussed in Country
Economic Memorandum of March 9, 1987 (6051-IVC).



- 35 -
trees during the tapping period. The risk of poor tapping would be reduced
by providing intensive training to farmers and regular tapping supervision
by SAPH. The crop is relatively insensitive to recorded climatic
variations in the project area. The project would finance an adaptive
research program which would complement the efficient applied adaptive
research program currently run by IRCA.
5.22      Managerial.  The annual planting program is relatively more
important than the previous projects (3,500 ha versus 1,500 ha) and would
tax SAPH managerial capacity. Under the project, an intensive training
program would be instituted for junior and senior managers of SAPH at
field, factory and administrative levels (para 4.29). In addition, SAPH
would make Lncreasing use of computer facilities for the monitoring of
performance data. Agreement was obtained from Government at negotiations
that prior to granting additional managerial responsibilities to SAPH or
making changes in senior management positions of SAPH related to project
management, it would consult with the Bank (para 6.01 (i)).
5.23      Financial.  Credit recovery risks would be considerably limited
as all outgrowers' production would be channelled to SAPH-managed
factories. Cash flow problems experienced by BNDA during the Fourth Rubber
Project would be corrected by creating a project revolving fund for credit
expenditure (para 4.22). Bridging finance would be provided to BNDA to
offset the financial gap created by the differing terms of its borrowing
and loans to farmers (para 4.22). The implementation of the pricing reform
adopted on October 1, 1986 will be important to provide farmers with an
added financial incentive to diversify.
8.   Environmental Effects
5.24        The project would establish tree crops in areas now used for
shifting cultivation. New plantation areas which border classified forest
in the Bettie and Cavally areas bordering the Songon and Tai classified
forests would act as a natural barrier against encroachment by migrant
cultivators. Establishment of leguminous cover crops (pueraria) would
reduce erosion and increase soil fertility. The small quantities of
chemicals used to control disease and pests would not have any significant
adverse environmental effects. Effluent control measures would be
established at Bettie estate with the construction of decantation ponds.
Construction of a processing plant at Cavally would be carried out after
the proposed project's implementation period. Accordingly, no provisions
for effluent control have been made under the project. Government has
taken strict measures to control pollution in COte d'Ivoire. The program

FIFTH RUBBER PROJECT
PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING ECONOMIC
AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Analysis
1.   General
(a) Period 30 years including 6 years plantation
establishment and 2 years nursery costs. Production
for 22 years;
(b) Exchange rate of 400 CFAF/US$ which is the updated
medium to long term second best equilibrium exchange
rate derived by the country wide macro-model discussed
in the Country Economic Memorandum of March 14, 1986
(6051-IVC);
(c) Adaptive research cost, strategic studies, H & E costs
are deemed to benefit the sector as a whole thus only
202 of these costs have been allocated to the Project.
2.   Costs
(a) Project Costs: include plantation establishment,
equipment, personnel and operating costs in constant
terms including physical contingencies (O to 15X).
They do not include 'Financial Charges during
Immaturity;
(b) Inputs would be purchased under competitive conditions
which do not warrant the use of shadow pricing of
domestic resources;
(c) Labor valued at actual costs;
(d) Incremental costs and revenue have been used for new
components, i.e. medium-scale estates (PMPH) and
medium-scale estates (GMPH). In the case of the
smallholders component, the pilot nucleus estates of
Bettie and Cavally components, the project involves the
maintenance of immature plantations created under
previous projects and separation of benefits accruing
from the proposed project is not feasible. The ERR has
been calculated on the basis of total investment costs
and revenue being inflated at an average rate of 5X
starting from 1978 to 1986 values.

3.   Benefits Assumptions
1.   General
30 years including 6 years plantation establishment and
2 years nursery costs. Production for 22 years.
(a) Inflation factors on foreign costs as in project
costs (para 4.22) 1987 - 6.8X; 1988 - 6.8; 1989 -
7.0X; 1990 - 7.1; 1991-1995 - 41. Inflation
factors on local costs 2.5Z annually;
(b) According to Bank (PAC) projections of September
1986:
1987      1988       1989      1990       2000
CFAF/$           318       314        310        306       338
2.   Outflow Assumptions
(a) Payment for goods and services through the life of
the project include taxes.
(b) Debt service on foreign loans have been estimated
as followst
IBRD - 20-year term at 8.22 -  5 years grace
CCCE - 20-year term at 8.0? -  5 yeare grace
CDC  - 15-year term at 8.0? -  5 years grace
GRCI - 30-year term at   oX - 10 years grace (for
loan to BNDA)
3.   Inflow Assumptions
(a) Disbursement of IBRD Loan is scheduled in
Annex 4-6.
(b) Sales revenue are based on timing and volume
assumed in the economic analysis. Price for dry
rubber is derived from world CIF prices IBRD-EPD
projections (August 1986) brought down to FOB to
which an export premium of 20? has been added in line
with the country's industrial reform policy agreed
under SAL III. Price increase assumptions are as in
the economic analysis.
