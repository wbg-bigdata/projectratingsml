IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
COTE D'IVOIRE
FIFTH RUBBER PROJECT
(Loan 2874-IVC)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Fifth Rubber Project in C6te
d'Ivoire, for which loan 2874-IVC in the amount of US$11.9 million equivalent was approved on
October 6, 1987 and made effective on October 18, 1988.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1993 instead of the original closing date of
December 30, 1992. Final disbursement took place on June 3, 1994, at which time a balance of
US$590,880.48 was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Anton M. Rychener, Consultant, AF4AE and reviewed by
Messrs. Claude Carlier and Surjit Singh of AF4AE, Mrs. Cynthia C. Cook, Division Chief,
AF4AE, and Ms. Irene Xenakis, Portfolio Manager, AF4PH, on behalf of Mr. Franz Kaps,
Operations Adviser, AF4DR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's completion mission in February
1994. It is based on material in the project file and findings of the completion mission. The
Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by presenting views which have been reflected in
the mission's aide-memoire. The Borrower and cofinanciers were asked to provide comments on
a draft ICR but to-date none have been received.

COTE D'IVOIRE
FIFTH RUBBER PROJECT
(Loan 2874-IV)
Evaluation Summary
1.   Introduction. The Fifth Rubber Project followed a series of traditional industrial
plantation and smaliholder projects that were all jointly financed by the Bank, the Caisse
Francaise de Developpement (CFD), the Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC) and the Government of C6te d'Ivoire (GRCI). Private sector cofinancing was
provided by the "Groupe Indochine".
2.    Cote d'lvoire was assessed to have a comparative advantage in rubber production
and it was logical to add on a fifth phase to previous projects that were all successfully
completed. The fact that the project attracted private financing was another sign of
confidence in the Ivorian rubber sector. This confidence was somewhat shaken during
project execution by low international prices for rubber and the overvaluation of the CFA
franc which resulted in a steady drain on the finances of Socidte Africaine des Plantations
d'Hevea (SAPH), the major executing agency of the Project. The investment was also a
recognition of the strides made by Ivorian research in the development of high yielding
clones.
3.    Project Objectives and Components. The main objective of the Project was to
assist Cote d'Ivoire to increase export earnings while diversifying agricultural production.
This was accomplished by establishing 14,900 ha of new rubber plantations and bringing
to maturity 6,700 ha planted under previous Bank-financed projects. These would be
complemented by investments in a research program, a staff training program, effluent
control measures, and studies on future rubber development strategy.
4.    The Project was to consist of three main components: (a) Plantations: provide
input and financial assistance for: (i) Small and medium-size holdings - 12,900 ha; (ii)
Nucleus Estate (SAPH) - 600 ha; and (iii) Research Societe Heveicole de Go (HEVEGO)
- 1,400 ha; (b) Research: rubber agronomy and pathology; and (c) Su1p2ort Activities: (i)
support to Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Agricole (BNDA) for smallholder
credit operations; (ii) strengthening technical and managerial capacities of SAPH; (iii)
identification and survey of around 100,000 ha of suitable land for further rubber
development, feasibility of decentralized small scale nurseries, small-scale rubber
processing, analysis of clone trials and up-dating of the 1990-2000 Rubber Master Plan;
(iv) support to the Rubber Planning and Monitoring Unit of the Ministere de
l'Agriculture et de la Production Animale (MINAGRA); and (v) continuing technical
assistance for Cavally estate begun under Rubber IV.

5.    Evaluation of Project Objectives. The project objectives were consistent with
the Govermnent's efforts at fostering economic growth through increasing agricultural
production and diversification in support of structural adjustment and economic
stabilization efforts started in the early eighties. The successful implementation of earlier
rubber projects and the country's comparative advantage in rubber production were
important considerations in setting the objectives. The erosion of the comparative
advantage because of the overvaluation of the CFA franc had a negative impact on
growth. However, with the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in early 1990, the
situation has now reversed.
Implementation Experience and Results
6.    Assessment of Project's Success.  Project implementation was generally
satisfactory, in spite of long delays between negotiations and Board presentation (five
months) and effectiveness (one year), which could be attributed somewhat to the
increased power accorded to Direction de Contr6le des Grands Travaux (DCGTx) acting
as the overall monitoring and coordinating ministry in Cote d'lvoire. In fact, the planning
and monitoring functions of MINAGRA for the project were taken over by the Rubber V
Supervision Unit of DCGTx at an early stage of project implementation. After some
teething problems, the Rubber V supervision unit of DCGTx performed its function
rather well throughout the period of project execution.  The appraisal estimate of
establishing 14,900 ha new plantation was substantially met with actual plantings being
14,097 ha. While the physical development of research plantations and the results of
smallholder field trials were exceptionally good, the effective dissemination of research
findings to smallholders remains to be demonstrated. Although the project did provide
support to the rural credit system, the major conduit for rubber smallholder credit
operations, the BNDA, became insolvent and was dissolved in 1991.
7.    Summary of Costs. Total project costs over the implementation period were
CFA franc 17.3 billion compared with CFA franc 17.5 billion appraised costs. This
praiseworthy performance reflects considerable discipline on the part of project
implementation authorities in following agreed budgets and work plans. It also reflects
well on the appraisal team which, obviously, worked very closely with SAPH in
estimating the costs both for industrial plantings and smallholdings. The concerns of the
appraisal mission on the credit arrangements were borne out when BNDA was unable to
provide credit to smallholders for farm inputs in 1988 and 1989 and was later dissolved.
The overvaluation of the CFA franc led to SAPH having high production costs in an
export market with declining prices. SAPH also had to prefinance project costs for the
first two years and as a result its financial condition deteriorated severely. Just how
important a factor was the overvaluation of the CFA franc for project outcome is
demonstrated by the fact that barely half a year after the parity change in 1994, it was
possible to privatize SAPH in spite of it being in financial distress.



iii
8.    Performance of the Bank. The presence of the Bank's resident mission in
Abidjan facilitated the supervision of the Project. Accordingly, contact with the
executing agencies was permanent and virtually on a daily basis during the initial stages
of implementation. Follow-up by the Abidjan mission prevented further delays in loan
effectiveness which could have happened with cross-conditionalities with co-financiers'
loans. Problems along the road to completion were identified and dealt with in a timely
manner by the Bank.
9.    Borrower Performance. After initial difficulties with the DCGTx were
overcome, Government gave the executing agencies a relatively free hand to manage
project activities. This was an important factor in the successful implementation of the
rubber planting program. However, GRCI did not always contribute its share of project
financing in a timely manner.
10.   Assessment of the Project's Outcome. Overall project outcome is satisfactory.
95 percent of the rubber planting target has been met, but the typical rubber tree only
starts yielding when it is about six years old, therefore, results in physical production
terms are not yet known. However, judging from the growth of trees in randomly
selected smallholdings as well as SAPH estates, there is a good basis for assuming that
yields will match expectations. Societe Heveicole de Go (HEVEGO) field trials on
smallholdings have demonstrated that a number of food and other cash crops (yams,
cassava, banana/plantain, cocoa, coffee, and citrus) can be planted as inter-crops in the
first five years without detrimental impact on yields attainable under sole-cropping of
rubber. This optimizes the use of land and brings in a revenue stream at an early stage.
These findings are being disseminated to new smallholdings for adoption.
11.   Sustainability. The major parastatals in the rubber sector have been privatized
and would be servicing client farmers on a cost recovery basis. It is in the area of
research and extension that there is some uncertainty, particularly in respect of
technology dissemination to smallholders. Processes and responsibilities will have to be
worked out within the context of the ongoing Agricultural Services Support Project (Cr.
2636-IVC) and its successor (FY97). Otherwise the sustainability of project investments
is good. The climate of CMte d'lvoire favors rubber production. The fact that the Bettie
and Cavally estates border protected natural forest areas--and thus act as buffer zones--
preventing encroachment by migrant cultivators and reinforces the ecological benefits of
the investments. However, the majority of planters are of an older generation and the
Project was not very successful in drawing young farmers from  urban areas.  A
somewhat encouraging factor is the attractiveness of the crop, given the recent parity
change in the CFA franc and the subsequent rise in the farmgate price. This improves
the economic dimension of sustainability; nonetheless, continued vigilance will be
required to assure good maintenance of smallholdings as well as industrial estates. The
SAPH and SOGB rubber factories have been equipped with decantation ponds, and with
this technical dimension of pollution control and its sustainability has been put in place.



iv
Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
12.   The Project achieved its overall objectives of growth and diversification in the
country's agriculture production and has provided the potential for increased rural
incomes. Ivorian institutions, mainly parastatals, operating in the rubber sub-sector and
smallholders have demonstrated a capacity to undertake efficient production of rubber.
However, the long gestation period of the crop can create financing difficulties for both
the grower and the credit provider, and in this case the latter became insolvent. The
overvaluation of the CFA franc led to high production costs, relative to international
costs and depressed domestic prices for which support pricing mechanisms had to be
operated but were difficult to sustain. A 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc has
given an instant 80 percent rise in the producer price and although the full effects of the
parity change have yet to be seen, rubber production in Cote d'Ivoire has certainly
become more attractive.
13.   Lessons Learned. The main lessons are as follows:
(a)   support pricing mechanism  for an export commodity are difficult to
sustain over an extended period particularly when competitiveness is
affected by exchange rate maladjustment; this can lead to a debilitating
impact on the institutions that finance the expansion of cultivation of such
crops; and
(b)   the structured nature of the processes for World Bank financing may
create disadvantages for executing agencies which desire to implement the
project expeditiously; in this particular case, delays in loan effectiveness
and the dissolution of BNDA, both of which were beyond the control of
SAPH, led to SAPH providing prefinancing for CFA franc 1.4 billion
(US$ 4.5 million) for the first two years of smallholder plantings through
expensive commercial bank overdrafts.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
COTE D'IVOIRE
FIFTH RUBBER PROJECT
(Loan 2874-IVC)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
1. Introduction
1.01  National economic growth and the performance of the economy had been
disappointing since the middle seventies.  Consequently, in 1981 the Government
launched a Structural Adjustment Program to restore macroeconomic equilibria and lay
the basis for the resumption of growth. The focus of the program was on internal
demand adjustment and the initiation of structural reforms fostering growth.  The
program was supported by three Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs) from the Bank in
1981, 1983 and 1986 and by an Extended Finance Facility (EFF) and two Stand-By
Arrangements (SBA) from the IMF in 1981, 1984 and 1986.
1.02  With regard to the agricultural sector, the three SALs concentrated their efforts in
the areas of pricing and taxation policy, and parastatal reform. In pricing policy, the
general thrust was towards raising producer cocoa and (especially) coffee prices to
correct for past discrimination against agriculture. This had a favorable supply response
until 1986, when prices of these two commodities fell on world markets making it
impossible to maintain producer support prices. Export subsidies were also granted to
non-traditional exports, but this reform was not implemented in a consistent manner.
Institutional reforms involved increasing efficiency and accountability of a number of the
major crop and forestry parastatals. Finally, sectoral adjustment was complemented by a
series of projects designed to continue the promotion of export crops cultivated by
smallholders. The Fifth Rubber Project, was one of several projects undertaken in
support of these agricultural sector adjustment measures.
1.03  The Project with a loan amount of US$11.9 million equivalent is a part of the
Government's long-term rubber development program launched in 1973, supported by
four previous Bank Loans (938-IVC, 1575-IVC, 1633-IVC and 2323-IVC) for a total of
US$68 million equivalent. The First and Second Loans financed the creation of a 13,500
ha rubber plantation industrial estate at Grand-Bereby in the South West region of the
country. The Third Loan financed the establishment of new industrial and smallholder
plantations around the existing industrial estates. At the closing of the Fourth Loan,
13,526 ha were in production at the Grand Bereby industrial estate. At the Bettie and
Cavally estates, the total planted area of 2,041 ha each was brought in production. The
current Project added 14,097 ha (95 percent of the appraisal total of 14,900 ha) to the
country's rubber plantations. These rubber development projects were designed to
diversify the country's agricultural production and increase rural incomes.



2
1.04  The area under rubber plantations was developed in the two main phases: (a)
from 1956 to 1974, planting in mainly industrial estates (35,500 ha); and (b) from 1975
to 1992, planting mainly in smallholdings of 5 ha or less (26,000 ha), plus another 1,000
ha of industrial plantations to support research under HEVEGO.
1.05  The second phase was supported by Rubber Projects III, IV and V. These three
projects aimed at creating some 4,000 smallholdings around the previously planted
nucleus estates in which GRCI had an outright and majority ownership. Rubber V was
designed to further expand smallholder cultivation, provide support for HEVEGO (a
company created for expanding research), and assist with some minor consolidation of
industrial plantations belonging to SAPH. Rubber plantations, as in the oil-palm sub-
sector, generally fulfill a larger developmental role, usually taking responsibility for
public schooling, health, water supply and road maintenance.
1.06 Rubber tree yields in Cote d'lvoire are comparable, and in some instances even
superior to those found in the main production areas of the world, including South-East
Asia. Earlier Bank-assisted projects managed by SAPH have shown good performance
in yields and production efficiency. Advance technology has been matched by sound
management practices of Ivorian institutions operating the rubber sub-sector. At appraisal
in 1986, a total of about 45,000 ha had been planted in the country. The Bank-assisted
Rubber III and IV projects smallholders had been benefiting from intensive technical
support provided by SAPH's extension service. Returns per man-day of CFA franc
5,000 (1985) from rubber production were not unusual; this compares very favorably
with returns on more traditional Ivorian crops, i.e. cocoa and coffee, of CFA franc 3,000
and 2,000 respectively. Moreover, unlike these crops, rubber provides a continued,
almost a year-round source of income. Given these favorable conditions, GRCI's
objective has been to increase the area under rubber plantations to 150,000 ha by year
2000. In view of the high development and operating costs of industrial plantations, since
the mid-80's focus has been on smallholder development with planting targets of about
10,000 ha per year.
2. Project Objectives
2.01  The main objectives of the Project were to assist Cote d'Ivoire in increasing its
export earnings, further diversify the agriculture sector and in the process raise rural
incomes and contribute to economic growth. This was to be accomplished through
creating new smallholder rubber plantations; continuing support to bring to maturity
plantations already planted under previous Bank financed projects; investment in
research, staff training, and effluent control measures; studies on future rubber
development strategy; and support for rural credit operations. The Project had the
following main components:
(a)   Plantations: (i) provide input and financial assistance for new development of



3
smallholder and medium-size (DHE): 12,900 ha, Nucleus Estate (SAPH):
600 ha, Research (HEVEGO): 1,400 ha, and (ii) input and financial assistance to
existing 6700 ha;
(b)   Research: investment and recurrent expenditure support for rubber agronomy and
pathology;
(c)   Support Activities: (i) support to BNDA for smallholder credit operations; (ii)
strengthening technical and managerial capacities of SAPH; (iii) identification
and survey of around 100,000 ha of suitable land for further rubber development,
feasibility studies of decentralized small-scale nurseries, small-scale rubber
processing, analysis of clone trials and updating of the 1990-2000 Rubber Master
Plan; (iv) support to MINAGRA's Rubber Planning and Monitoring Unit; and (v)
continuing technical assistance for Cavally estate which was begun under Rubber
IV.
2.02  The Project was identified by SAPH and Government in 1985 and the project
proposal was prepared by the FAO/CP in 1986; detailed project documentation and
calculations were prepared by the MINAGRA's Planning and Control Department under
DCGTx's overall supervision. Appraisal took place in May 1986 by a team fielded by
the Bank's Agricultural Team in Abidjan and included representatives of CFD and CDC.
The signing of a contract for the land identification survey, to provide data on
availability of up to 100,000 ha of suitable land for rubber cultivation, was a condition of
Board presentation. The project was essentially a repeater project fitting into an existing
relatively well set-up institutional framework and did not contain any unusual or
innovative element.
2.03  The long lead time between the negotiations and Board presentation (154 days)
and effectiveness (365 days) was mainly due to the discussions on: (a) rationale for Bank
involvement as some Bank staff held the view that the Project would be a good candidate
-for commercial bank financing rather than Bank financing; (b) the potentially over-
lapping objectives of the newly created rubber research company HEVEGO and the
Institut de Recherches sur la Caoutchouc (IRCA); (c) credit to smallholders and cost
recovery; and (d) the role of DGCTx. The Loan Closing Date of December 31, 1992 was
extended by one year to December 31, 1993.
2.04   Achievement of Project Objectives. The Project is expected to achieve its
objectives of growth and diversification in agriculture production and exports, and
increased rural incomes. 14,097 ha of new rubber plantations against an appraisal
estimate of 14,900 ha have been planted and mainly by smallholders. Although only a
small portion of the newly-planted rubber has reached maturity, the general condition of
the trees indicates that yields forecast at appraisal will most likely be met and overall
anticipated project production will be attained at a future date. As for improved rural
incomes, there is much evidence of continued and more extensive exploitation of existing
rubber trees in response to higher prices after the January 1994 devaluation and thus



4
should result in higher rural incomes. The research component has laid the foundation for
developing a self-financing research facility. Available research findings on inter-
cropping of rubber hold good potential for adoption by smallholders for whom one of the
main disincentives is the 6 years or so they have to wait for first yields. However, the
dissemination of the findings to smallholders and their adoption are a major challenge
and at this point it is difficult to assess whether IRCA would have the resources to pursue
this important objective.
3. Implementation Experience and Results
3.01  Table 5 of the Statistical Tables shows that 95 percent of the planting target was
met. The planting program, both for smallholders and industrial plantations, was
implemented over the years 87/88 to 90/91. No plantings were carried out beyond 1992,
the originally envisaged closing date of the project (December 31, 1992). However,
HEVEGO which had continued to draw from Loan 2323-IVC (Fourth Rubber Project)
until late in 1991, only utilized its portion of the Loan under this Project in the latter
years including the one-year extension period of the Loan.
3.02.  The Project included the creation of a research plantation at Go near Rapide Grah
which would at the same time produce revenues and help HEVEGO become a self-
financing, independent company. Although it is too early to measure results, there is no
reason to believe that the concept will not succeed with 1,500 ha of various clonal
material already planted and showing excellent growth. Amongst the research trials
carried out at the newly established research station are those concerned with inter-
cropping of rubber with a series of food crops and cash crops (bananas, plantain, yams,
cassava, cocoa, and coffee) during the unproductive years without sacrificing yields.
3.03   The Rubber V Supervision Unit of DCGTx took over, at an early stage, the
planning and monitoring function from MINAGRA and performed it rather well
throughout project execution. The DCGTx assigned to the unit a permanent staff
member (an agro-economist) who accompanied virtually all supervision missions of the
Bank. The unit is a very reliable source of information about the project and the agro-
economist is charged with writing Government's completion report of the project.
BNDA, which was to be the main vehicle for smallholder credit, because of poor cash
flows, could not play its role fully in this area and this in turn adversely affected SAPH's
activities for providing inputs to smallholders on credit to be funded by BNDA.
3.04  Assessment of Project Outcome. Given that the typical rubber tree takes about
six years to go into production, results in terms of physical rubber output for the whole
project will only be seen after several more years. However, judging from the growth of
trees in randomly selected smallholdings, as well as SAPH estates, there is good reason
to believe that yields will match expectations. Also, smallholders as well as SAPH- have
begun to tap 87/88 and 88/89 plantings in 1992 and 1993 respectively and yields are
within expectations. HEVEGO field trials on smallholdings have demonstrated that, with
the normal density of rubber trees and inter-rows filled with a number of food and cash



5
crops, optimization of land use can be obtained without sacrificing yields during the first
5 years. Some new smallholdings are already adopting the findings of HEVEGO. The
infusion of an early income stream for a crop with a long investment and gestation period
is particularly important to small investors, especially in terms of credit requirements.
3.05  The biggest boost, however, to rubber producers in Cote d'Ivoire was the January
12, 1994 change in parity of the CFA franc. The impact of the devaluation was an instant
rise in the floor price (payable to smallholders) of some 83 percent, i.e., from CFA
franc 120 to 220, making rubber a very attractive cash crop once again. As can be seen
from the Crop Budget below, marketing, processing, extension and collection costs
exceeded the difference between floor and CIF prices before devaluation and the
"Federation Inter-professionelle de Solidarite HEVEA" (FISH) was required to absorb
the deficit. After devaluation in spite of a higher floor price, there is still a margin for
distribution to FISH. Although the effects of the parity change in the CFA franc have yet
to work themselves fully into the system, it has certainly made rubber production in Cote
d'Ivoire more attractive.

3.06  Project Sustainability. Given the favorable climate in C6te d'Ivoire for rubber
trees, the environmental dimension of sustainability of the Project is good. The fact that
the Bettie and Cavally estates border protected natural forest areas--and thus act as buffer
zones--preventing encroachment by migrant cultivators, reinforces the ecological benefits
of the investments. The human dimension of sustainability--although assured at the
present time--remains much more fragile. The majority of planters are of an older
generation and the Project was not very successful in drawing young farmers from urban



6
areas. A somewhat encouraging factor is the attractiveness of the crop, given the recent
parity change in the CFA franc and the subsequent rise in the farmgate price. This
promotes the economic dimension of sustainability; although continued vigilance will be
required to assure good maintenance of smallholdings as well as industrial estates. An
unknown factor is the international demand and its impact on the price for natural rubber
in the coming years when production from the project increases. Competitiveness would
continue to depend on production efficiency and a conducive macro-economic regime
including an appropriate exchange rate for the domestic currency. As for environmental
pollution considerations, SAPH and SOGB rubber factories have been equipped with de-
cantation ponds, and thus the technical dimension of sustainability has been put in place.
3.07  Project Costs and Financing. At appraisal, the total cost of the Project was
estimated at US$58.9 million of which the Bank was to provide US$11.9 million or 20
percent of total project costs. At closing, the total cost was equivalent to US$58.3
million (98.9 percent of appraisal estimate). Out of the Bank's share of US$11.9 million,
an undisbursed amount of US$0.59 million was canceled (US$0.36 million in May 1992
and US$0.23 million in July 1994).
3.08  Total project costs over the implementation period were CFA franc 17.3 billion
compared with CFA franc 17.5 billion appraised costs, as indicated in Table 8A of the
Statistical Tables. This reflects good discipline on the part of project implementation
authorities in following agreed budgets and work plans. It also reflects well on the
appraisal team which, obviously, worked very closely with SAPH when working out
costs both for industrial plantings and smallholdings. The only cost related problem that
the Project failed to tackle was the high cost (CFA franc 1 6/kg) of extension. Field visits
have revealed that the extension service is much too much involved in day-to-day
activities of smallholders instead of just providing technical advice. This problem,
however, will automatically be resolved as the executing agency (SAPH) has been
privatized.
3.09  Owing to the dissolution of BNDA, in late 1993 the "Association Professionnelle
pour la Promotion d'Hevea" (APPH) took over as the credit institution for smallholders.
It still holds 6,280 credits to smallholders representing outstanding amounts of CFA
franc 4.1 billion. That sum, prefinanced by Government (through funds onlent from
SAPH, the Bank, CFD and CDC) is expected to be recovered between 1994 and 2003
through direct deductions from payments for latex collected from smallholders. In most
cases the smallholders also have similar borrowings for growing oil palms and might
resent paying back if both crops are not treated in like manner in terms of repayment
requirements.
3.10  Prefinancing US$4.5 million for project expenditures for the first two years
through bank overdrafts, supplier credits and own funds, plus the steady erosion of world
market prices of rubber and the overvaluation of the CFA franc, all contributed to a
gradual decline of SAPH's fortunes. In addition, the floor price payable to producers
was always set too high (para 3.05). Thus, by 1991, liabilities exceeded liquid assets



7
(fonds propres) for the first time. In fact, average production costs of rubber during
project execution amounted to CFA franc 315/kg whereas export prices were around
CFA franc 280/kg for average quality, thus leading to production losses of CFA franc
1.75 billion annually. Concurrently the steady erosion of the working capital resulted in
an unhealthy financial situation, as summarized in the table below.

3.11  It needs to be stressed that the causes for these losses were mostly beyond the
control of SAPH. In late 1992, a new management team of the company undertook
drasfic cost cutting measures which almost kept pace with the erosion of world market
prices. Between 1991 and 1992 ex-factory costs per kg declined by over 30 percent
while the median rubber world market price declined by 22 and 13 percent respectively
in 1991 and 1992. Nevertheless, in 1991/92 SAPH's self-financing ratio was negative
for the first time in its history (4.1 percent). However, SAPH and SOGB have now both
been successfully privatized with the Government holding a minority interest in the share
capital. The devaluation of the CFA franc was a critical factor in making this transition
possible as it immediately increased the profitability of rubber production operations.
3.12  Production from project plantings has only just begun and will not reach its peak
before the year 2002. Thus the rate of return calculations for both smallholders and
SAPH would have to be based on projected yields, prices and costs. SAPH did not
provide the mission with its actual overhead costs for the 560 ha it planted at Bettie as
well as the costs associated with assisting smallholders. It was therefore not possible to
work out the financial and economic rates of return.
3.13  Major Factors Affecting Achievements.  The project design was straight
forward, fitting into an existing, relatively well set-up institutional framework and did
not contain any unusual or innovative element. The only questionable element in project
organization at the time of appraisal was the BNDA. Because of its high transaction
costs and poor credit recovery, the appraisal mission was obviously uneasy about
entrusting this institution with the management of credit. Risks associated with credit



8
under the project are particularly high. The relatively long gestation period of 6 years for
rubber trees, meant an 18-year loan period, with up to 9 years grace and highly
subsidized interest rates. The subsequent dissolution of BNDA, by decree dated October
16, 1991, did not simplify matters, but it confirmed the appraisal mission's concern about
credit arrangements.
3.14 According to the negotiated Loan Agreement, MINAGRA's Direction de la
Programmation was to be in charge of project execution and supervision as well as
Monitoring and Evaluation. These responsibilities were subsequently transferred to the
DCGTx and entailed a lengthy exchange of correspondence as appropriate amendments
had to be included in the Loan Agreement. In fact the role accorded the DCGTx by the
Government in 1987 turned out to be harmful to project execution initially. Firstly, it
delayed Board presentation and loan effectiveness, and secondly at the early stages
DCGTx kept interfering in day-to-day management of HEVEGO, and to some extent
SAPH, by questioning technical decisions thereby delaying procurement of goods and
services.
3.15  Co-financing, rather than parallel financing, had to be opted for given the highly
integrated nature of the operations. This was obviously more difficult to administer on
the part of executing agencies, as cost centers and codes had to be established to account
for five different sources of financing: GRCI, CFD, CDC, IBRD and own funds. To
make matters even more complex, different codes had to be developed for different
expenditures as not all types of costs were eligible for financing by individual lenders.
3.16  In spite of the above difficulties, the project was successfully completed which is
a tribute to the commitment and the professional competence of the executing agencies.
3.17  Performance of the Bank.  The presence of the Bank's office in Abidjan
facilitated the supervision of the Project.  Accordingly, contact with the executing
agencies was permanent and virtually on a daily basis during the initial stages of
implementation.  Constant contact with Abidjan prevented further delays in loan
effectiveness arising from cross-conditionality with the co-lenders loans. Problems along
the road to completion were identified and dealt with in a timely manner by the Bank.
3.18  Bank may not have been forceful enough in getting the Government to reimburse
SAPH, some CFA franc 0.9 billion owed on its behalf, as well as provide timely
counterpart funding of CFA franc 1.2 billion. This adversely impacted SAPH's finances
(para 3. 10).
3.19 Borrower's Performance. After initial difficulties with the DCGTx were
overcome, Government policy througlhout implementation can best be characterized as
one of 'hands off. Executing agencies were left with a relatively free hand to rnanage
project activities. Given the range of macro-economic problems the GRCI had - and still
has - to cope with, this is not surprising. GRCI, however, was tardy in meeting its share of
project financing.



9
3.20  Since the Bank Loan did not become effective until October 18, 1988 (CDC and CFD
credits on February 9, 1989), operations were prefinanced on SAPH bank overdrafts and
counterpart funds from GRCI. SAPH decided on this course of action in order not to lose one
planting season because of bureaucratic delays caused by DCGTx. This up-front initiative on
the part of SAPH characterized its approach throughout project execution: a straightforward
approach of an enterprise heavily influenced by private sector interests.
3.21   Both  SAPH  and  HEVEGO, throughout project implementation, prepared
comprehensive progress reports that provided ample information about the status of the
Project from their perspective. Such reports were regularly prepared prior to arrival of
supervision missions, thus greatly facilitating their work. Moreover, the DCGTx regularly
provided the Bank with a summnary of progress reports and, as a matter of fact, availability of
data was never a problem, except that SAPH was unwilling to provide to the closing mission
with its actual overhead costs for the 560 ha it planted at Bettie as well as the costs associated
with assisting smallholders. This may be due to the fact that SAPH was financially distressed.
4. Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
4.01   Overall the project achieved its objective of further growth and diversification of
agricultural exports. Rubber is amongst the world's commodities with reasonable prospects
for continued demand. C6te d'Ivoire has suitable climatic conditions and its yields are
competitive with those in South East Asia. Maintaining a competitive cost structure will
require continuation of good technological practices and a well-adjusted exchange rate for the
CFA franc. As there was insufficient data, no rate of return calculations were made.
4.02  It may be assumed that because of its financial difficulties, SAPH was not always
forthcoming with the information needed to complete this report.  Although SAPH
technically ran into bankruptcy during project execution, its holdings have generated enough
interest to attract foreign investors.  SAPH has now been privatized and smallholder
promotion is being taken over by the professional organization APPH. The latter has also
been able to generate funds (partially from the private sector), some CFA franc 2.0
billion, for lending to smallholders. The CFA franc 4.1 billion in outstanding credits to
smallholders is being collected by APPH, but there is a danger that the smallholders who also
have borrowed for oil palm planting may be reluctant to honor their debts if repayment terms
for both crops are not made consistent.
4.03   Lessons Learned. The main lessons are as follows:
(a)  support pricing mechanism  for an export commodity are difficult to
sustain over an extended period particularly when competitiveness is
affected by exchange rate maladjustment; this can lead to a debilitating
impact on the institutions that finance the expansion of cultivation of such
crops; and



10
(b)  the structured nature of the processes for World Bank financing may
create disadvantages for executing agencies which desire to implement the
project expeditiously; delays in loan effectiveness and the dissolution of
BNDA, both of which were beyond the control of SAPH, led to SAPH
providing prefinancing for CFA franc 1.4 billion (US$ 4.5 million) for the
first 2 years of smallholder plantings through expensive commercial bank
overdrafts.

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
Given that production has only just begun and shall not reach peak before the year
2002, the financial rate of return calculation for both, smallholders and SAPH, would have to
be based on projected yields, prices and costs. SAPH refused to provide the mission with its
actual overhead costs for the 560 ha it planted at Bettie as well as the ones associated with
assisting smallholders. No rate of return calculations were thus made. The estimated ERR at
appraisal was 16%.

Appendix A
REPUBLIQUE DE COTE D'IVOIRE
CINOUIEME PROJET D'HEVEACULTURE
(Pret no. 2874 IVCI
MISSION DE SUIVI
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.    Une mission de la Banque Mondiale comprenant MM. Claude Carlier
et Ousmane Sissoko a effectue le suivi du CinquiAme Projet
d'H6veaculture en Cote d'Ivoire au cours de la semaine du ler f6vrier
1994. La mission a eu pour objectifs principaux, do passer en revue lea
actions du projet suite a la cloture du pret ci-dessus intervenue le 31
decembre 1993, de slinformer sur les perspectives d'avenir des
op6rateurs du secteur, et de prendre connaissance des progres en cours
dans le cadre de l'elaboration du rapport d'achevement du projet.
2.    La mission a proc6d6 a des rencontres et seances de travail avec
lee representants du Minist6re de l'Agriculture et des Ressources
Animales (MINAGRA), du Hinistere de la Recherche Scientifique, de la
Direction et Controle  des Grands  Travaux  (DCGTx),  de  la Socl6t6
H6v6icole du Go (HEVEGO), de la Societ6 Africaine des Plantations
d'H6v6a (SAPH) et de l'Association Professionnelle pour la Promotion
Hdv6icole (APPH). Des echanges de vue ont egalement eu lieu avec les
responsables de la Caisse Frangaise de D6veloppement (CFD), et une
reunion de synthese e'est tenue avec Monsieur le Directeur de Cabinet
du MINAGRA.
3.    Lee membres de la mission remercient vivement lea autorit6s
ivoiriennes, les responsables de HEVEGO, SAPH, APPH et DCGTx pour leur
collaboration fructueuse ayant permis le bon deroulement de la mission.
Lee observations de la mission sont brievement pr6sent6es ci-dessous.
Elles ne repr6sentent que la position des membres de la mission et
pourront faire l'objet d'amendement de la part de la Direction de la
Banque.
Recherche h6v6icole et Encadrement
NEVEGO.
4.    La premiere phase du projet eat terminee avec la plantation de
1.519 ha dont 517 ha de cultures exp6rimentales, 1.002 ha de cultures
pour l'application industrielle de la recherche et la construction du
village comprenant les logements, bureaux et infrastructures sociales.
La qualit6 exceptionnelle des plantations permettra d'obtenir des
rendements 6lev6es estim6s a 2.200 kg a lihectare soit une production de
3.350 tonnes de caoutchouc en phase de croisiere. Environ 300 ha seront
en exploitation en 1994 et devraient produire envlron 120 tonnes de
caoutchouc qui, du fait d'absence de moynes d'usinage A HEVEGO, seront
vendues a un industriel (SAPH ou SOGB) A un prix qui reste a negocier.
Le pret de la Banque Mondiale no. 2874-IVC a ete cl8tur6 1Q 31 Decembre
1993. Lea d6penses engag6es avant cette date seront remboursables mais
devront Gtre soumises A la Banque avant le 30 avril 1994. Le financement



-2-
des op6rations durant l'annee 1994 pourrait 6tre assure avec lea
reliquats du pret de la CDC et du fonds de contre-partie de l'Etat.
5.    Le r6le et lea objectifs d'HEVEGO en terme de recherche et
developpement hev6icole devront etre confirmes lora de la mise en place
de la deuxieme phase du projet en accord avec la politique
gouvernementale,   en   ce   qui   concerne,   le   developpement   de
l'h6v6aculture. La recente devaluation du franc CFA associe aux
excellents rendements obtenus va permettre la relance de l'heveaculture
en Cote d'Ivoire. La relance de l'hev6aculture en milieu villageois
n6cessite des recherches sur les clones adaptLe a ce milieu, des
systemes de plantations associ6a avec cultures intercalaires ainsi que
des systemes d'exploitation simples. En plus de son support A
l'Association des Producteura et Manufacturiers du Caoutchouc
(APROMAC), 1'APPH et le DPL/IDEFOR pour le developpement heveicole en
Cote d'Ivoire, HEVEGO aura egalement un r6le important a jouer dans le
cadre de l'Association du Caoutchouc Naturel Africain (ACNA) en ce gui
concerne la d6finition des normes de sp6cifications techniques des
caoutchoucs    africains.    La    recherche    devra    alintensifier.
particulierement pour am6liorer la qualit6 des produits et mettre un
terme aux decotes sur lea caoutchoucs en provenance d'Afrique. La
poursuite des activites et du programme d'investissement d'HEVEGO dans
le cadre de la deuxieme phase n6cessitera une recherche de financement
aupras de l'Etat et des bailleurs de fonds. La participation financi&re
de la filiere A la recherche pourrait 6galement etre consid6r6e.
SAPH.
6.    Le processus de privatisation des entreprises d'Etat, dont la
SAPH, se poursuit. En vue de cette privatisation, la SAPH a entrepris
une reorganisation  interne. y compris une r6duction  importante du
personnel. Le contrat de gestion par la SAPH du Domaine Hev6icole de
l'Etat, lea plantations de Betti6, Cavally et Anguededou, eat maintenu,
en attendant la privatisation de ces unit6s. De meme, la SAPH continue,
A  la  demande  de  l'APPH,  d'assurer  l'encadrement  des  planteurs
villageois mais avec des effectifs r6duita afin d'en diminuer le cout.
Ces services prendront fin le 30 septembre 1994. Par la suite l'APPH
lancera un appel d'offres aupres des op6rateurs industriels pour
assurer lea services d'encadrement des planteurs. Avec la d6valuation
du franc CFA qui laisse entrevoir des meilleurs resultats financiers,
la SAPH pourrait acc6l6rer son programme d'investissement, plus
particulierement, la replantation de ses plus vieilles cultures.
Proar6s r6alises en matiere de privatisation du secteur
7.    La mission slest entretenue avec  le responsable du  secteur
hev6icole au Comit6 de Privatisation des Entreprises du Secteur Public
et  a eu  connaissance  des progrea r6alises  dans  le cadre de  la
privatisation en cours. Il eat apparu et a ete confirme clairement que
le programme et lea objectifa de privatisation sont maintenus. Lea
dispositions  legales  seraient  meme  en  train  d'etre  prises  pour
accel6rer le processus. Aussi, a-t-il 6t6 confirme que le contexte
nouveau de la devaluation du CFA survenue le 12 janvier 1994, meme s'il
devrait exiger la r6actualisation des 6elments financiers, ne remet
nullement en cause les d6marches en cours.
8.    Le  sch6ma  initial  de  l.actionnariat  dans  le  cadre  de  la
privatisation pr6voit une repartition de 20% pour l'Etat, 31% pour les



prives nationaux et 49% pour lea priv6a 6trangers. Cette base a permis
d'attirer des offres quoiqu'une plus grande flexibilite a 6t6 conced6e
par ailleurs. La situation pour lea entreprises a privatiser & savoir
la SOOB, la SAPH et le Domaine Heveicole de l'Etat est brievement
d6crite ci-apres.
SOGB. Apras les negociations avec le groupe Michelin, partenaire
technique de la SOGB, une offre du personnel de cette derniare
constitu6 en societ6 anonyme et appuyee par un groupe financier eat &
1'6tude. Les 6l6ments techniques en complement du dossier devraient
Atre recus pour permettre la poursuite de l'instruction dudit dossier.
SAPS. La restructuration financiare suivie de la privatisation de SAPH
a 6t6 d6cid6e depuis novembre 1993. La restructuratLon financiere est
en cours. L'operation de privatisation sera mat6rialis6e suite a
l'obtention de l'aval de l'Etat.
DHE. I1 comprend trois unit6s, encore entretenues par SAPH qui desire
s'en d6charger. Il s'agit de Betti6, Angu6d6dou et Cavally. Suite a
l'appel d'offres lance en juin 1993, une offre a 6te recue par des
investisseurs ivoiriens, a savoir, IMCAI et SAPHIC pour Betti6 et
Angudd6dou respectivement. Lea negociations sont en cours avec ces
acqu6reurs.
cavally. Contrairement A Betti6 et Angu6dedou, il n'y a pas d'unite de
traitement du caoutchouc a Cavally. Le dossier d'appsl d'offres pour la
cession des plantations est en cours d'6laboration par la DCGTx. La
SOGB aurait 6te approchee par le Gouvernement pour reprendre Cavally.
Cette derniere semble etre interessee vu la poseibilit6 d'y produire
environ 1400 tonnes de caoutchouc en 1994 qui sera usine A la SOGB.
Aspects institutionnels
9.    Sur ce plan,  lea progres enregistres et qui meritent d'etre
soulign6s concernent l'APPH (Association Professionnelle pour la
Promotion H4v6icole), notamment la signature effective des statuts de
cette association, l16volution et le financement de sa structure
d'encadrement et lea problemes li6e au cr6dit agricole.
10. Encadreoment. Dans l'organisation actuelle de la profession
hev6icole, l'APPH reste la structure responsable de l'encadrement des
planteurs. Elle a ainsi d6cid6 de lancer prochainement un appel
d'offres aupres des professionnela ayant l'expertise et lea ressources
humaines n6cessaires a un tel encadrement. Cependant, pour l'exercice
en cours (Octobre 1993 a Septembre 1994), 1'APPH a maintenu le contrat
d'encadrement existant avec la SAPH dont le financement serait approuv4
par la CFD dans le cadre de son Projet Hevea V Bis. Le budget global de
l'exercice 1993/94 porte sur 543,5 millions de PCFA dont 419 millions
de FCFA pour l'encadrement propre, 121 millions de FCFA pour le cr6dit
agricole et 3,5 millions de FCFA d'investissement.
11.   Il est important de noter que le coat de l'encadrmeent qui couvre
prAs de 5.800 planteurs a subi des r6ductions consid6rables rendues
possibles par un plus faible ratio moniteurs/planteura encadr6s. Le
nombre total des moniteurs vient ainsi d'etre r6duit de 93 A 57 et
l'effectif total ramene A 178 contre 276 dana l'ancienne formule
d'encadrement. I1 y a 6galement lieu de noter que cela a 6t6 rendu
possible par le fait quo le systeme d'encadrement eat d6sormals une



-                -~~~~~~4-
formation th6matique assur6e dans chaque village par le chef de secteur
a partir de d6monstrations sur le terrain.
12.   Par ailleurs, la politique d'encadrement a suivre mettra l'accent
sur lea 6l6ments suivants :
- densifier lea zones d6jA plant6es dans le cadre des projets H6vea IV
et V dans un rayon de 30 kilomAtres autour des plantations Industrielles
(Plantation Nucleus) dans le but de diminuer les coOts de transport et
d'usinage et d'6viter Le saupoudrage des actions;
- faire de la vulgarisation en mettant l'accent sur la formation de
Groupements de Planteurs. Le systeme de formation-visite (T&V) sera
tres facilement applicable en utilisant les jeunes agriculteurs
modernes d'h6v6a (JAMH) et autres planteurs priv6s de moyenne
importance. La structure do l'encadrement qui comprend la vulgarisation
et la gestion du credit doit rester l6gare; a titre d'indication, elle
eat en moyenne de 1 personne pour 80 planteurs au Ghana. L'accent doit
Atre mis sur la formation de Groupements d'int6r&t 6conomique (GIE) ou
A vocation coop6rative (GVC). Cette formation doit avoir pour but
principal la valorisation et la commercialisation des productions
(caoutchouc et autres); et
- la fourniture de mat6riel v6g6tal sous forme de stumps greff6s et/ou
en sac pourrait etre confi6e a des planteurs "moyens" ou des groupements
de planteurs. Ceci cr6era des revenus suppl6mentaires aux planteurs qui
pourraient se sp6cialiser dans co domaine.
13.   Cr6dit agricole. Il eat pr6vu que cette activite sera 6galement
reprise par l'APPH. L'enveloppe pr6vue pour son financement dans le
cadre du Projet H6v6a V Bis porte sur 2.200 millions de FCFA (22
millions de FRF a la parit6 actuelle) A mobiliser aprAs avoir rempli
lea conditlonalit4s li6es & la reconstitution des encours de cr6dits
ant6rieurement mis en place par la BNDAI la signature de la convention
entre 1'APPH et la Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) pour
l'adminiatration et la r6trocession du cr6dit et la mise en place des
proc6dures informatiques et de gestion a concevoir par une mission
d'experts propos6e par la CFD, a savoir le cabinet ICEA.
14.   Il est a noter, cependant, qu'un excellent systeme informatique
de gestion de cr6dit a 6t6 mis en place sur le mdme type de projet au
Ghana. Ce systame a 6t6 test6 depuis plus de 4 ans et donne entiere
satisfaction. PlutOt que "d'inventer ou mettre au point un autre
logiciel/systeme il serait bon d'6tudier la possibilit6 de se procurer
ce logiciel.
15.   Concernant la situation des prOts,  l'APPH aurait termin6 le
recensement des encoura de cr6dit et appr6t6 le texte de la convention
APPH/CAA. Par ailleurs, le Fonds do  ev6loppement de l'H6v6acuLture
Villageoise (FDEHV) a et6 cr66 pour recevoir les remboursements par les
planteurs de cr6dits existants. Aliment6 6galement par des dotations de
l'Etat et des financements ext6rieurs 6ventuels, ce fonds pourrait
conatituer un dispositif et une alternative importants pour relancer le
cr6dit agricole dans le secteur.



Raport d'ach6vement du i,roiet
16.   La mission tient a rappeler ici que le rapport d'achevement du
projet, a elaborer par le Gouvernement, sera dO au plus tard le 30 juin
1994, soit six mois apras la date de clotiare du pret. Au vu de la
proximit6 de cette ech6ance, il s'avere donc n6cessaire de faire
activer lee travaux de preparation du rapport par lee diff6rents
intervenants dans le cadre du projet afin que le rapport puisse
parvenir bien avant la date limite.
