APPRAISAL OF 1rfE
TACHIEN HYDROELECTRIC DVELOPMENT
CHINA
SUMMARY
i.        Taiwan Power Company has requested a Bank loan to finance the
foreign exchange costs of the Tachien hydroelectric development and
associated transmission facilities. The Project has been thoroughly
engineered, and under current economic conditions represents the least
cost means of meeting the requirement for dependable peaking capability
in the mid-1970's.
4k bii.                 The estimated cost of the Project is the equivalent of about
US$89 million including interest, engineering, ano an allowance for contin-
gencies.  The foreign exchange component is US$5O million.  Preparatory work
was started early in 1968. The first contracts for major civil engineering
works and permanent equipment will be awarded during the second quarter of
1969. Commercial operation is scheduled for mid-1974. The Government has
agreed to change legislation and to take executive action to remove restric-
tions on Taiwan Power Company's earnings. On July 1, 1969 measures will
become effective which will be equivalent to increasing tariffs by about
10%. Thxese steps, together with Government-supported arrangements for
assuring the availability of adequate local currency funds, were necessary
to complete the financing plan for the period of construction of the Project.
Furthermyore, both the Government and the Company have agreed that the Company's
earnings should be sufficient to produce a rate of return of not less than
10%.  The estimated future financial performance of the Company is satisfactory.
iii.      During tbhe construction of the Project, Taiwan Power Company will
also be engaged in other construction activities which will require an
investment of about US$470 million equivalent. The Company management and
personnel, assisted where appropriate by consultants, is generally capable
of executing this large program.
iv.       The Project would form a suitable basis for a loan of $50 million
for a term of 25 years including about six years of grace on amortization
payments.

APPRAISAL OF THE
TACHIEN HYDROLECTRIC DEVELOPMENT
CHINA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) approached the Bank in late 1965
concermning the possibility of financing the Tachien hydroelectric development
on the Tachia River. The Tachia's potential is already being exploited at
three sites downstream of the proposed Project's. The possibility of locating
a reservoir in the general area of the Project appeared to have considerable
merit, aaci the Bank indicated it would be prepared to consider financing the
Project ,provided Taipower's preliminary design and cost estimate were con-
firmed b; an independent review. In March 1967, Taipower engaged ELC-
Electroconsult (ELECTROCONSULT) of Milan to carry out this review, and for
engineering services in connection with design and construction.
1.02      ELECTROCONSULT confirmed the Project cost estimate in November 1967,
and Taipower submitted a formal request for a loan of US$50 million equivalent
to finance the foreign exchange costs of the Tachien dam and powerplant; an
extension to the plant immediately downstream; and general extensions to the
transmission system. The Bank sent an appraisal mission to Taiwan in mid-
January 1968.
1.03      During the course of the appraisal, a site investigation and a
detaiLed review of the cost estimate with EIECTROCONSULT's Chief Engineer
revealed that the cost estimate for the Project should contain larger allow-
ances for the treatment of certain difficult geological aspects of the site
selected. Accordingly, the estimated cost of the civil works of Tachien
proper was increased about 11%. A further review of the Project's economic
justification employing the higher estimated costs confirmed that it continues
to represent the least cost alternative under current economic conditions in
Taiwan. An intensive study of transmission requirements, particularly with
respect to the additional peaking capability which Tachien would make avail-
able, indicates the need for the construction of extra high voltage (EHV)
transmission facilities in connection with Tachien. The total cost of Tachien
and these EHV facilities will be about US$89 million equivalent, of which
US$gC5 million equivalent woula be foreign exchange.
1.04      Design and planning of the proposed project has been satisfactorily
carried out by Taipower and its consultants, and preliminary works were
*             started in March 1968.  The consultants estimate the Project should be
completed by July 1973, but for planning purposes Taipower is using a target
of J:me 1974.  Concurrently, Taipower has underway or will shortly start
other' works which with Tachien will add an additional 1,400 MW in generating
capacity to the system, and which will require average annual investments in
plant of about Us$95 million equivalent during the next 7-8 years.

1.05      During the course of the field appraisal, it became apparent that
the financing plan in Taipower's loan application was unrealiEstic, in that
it relied too heavily upon relatively short-term local borrowings, Arrange-
ments have been made or are underway to (i) raise the legal limit on
Taipower's earnings; (ii) increase Taipower's tariffs; and (iii) provide
local currency credits at reasonable terms.
1.06      This report was prepared from information collected and anaLyses
made by F. H. Howell and Giovanni VacchelLi, assisted by R. L. Bloor. It
is based upon a continuous exchange of views with Taipower since mid-L965;
visits to the Bank by key Taipower management personnel; a field appraisal
in January and February 1968; and negotiations in August and September 1968.
II. THIE BORROWER
2.01      The Taiwan Power Company was organized in 1946 by the Chinese
Government to take over and operate the system previously controlled by
the Japanese. It is a stock corporation almost wholly owned by the National
(61%) and Provincial (33.2%) Governments, and comes under the general super-
vision of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. An eleven-man Board of Directors
is elected for a three-year term and members may be re-elected. The C'ompany's
principal officers are the President, and eight vice presidents who have
functional responsibilities for adninistration, commercial activities,
engineering, purchasing, personnel, planning, operations, and finance.
There were 10,336 employees at the end of 1967.
2.02      Taipower provides the only public electric supply in Taiwan, and
operates throughout the entire Island. Some key operating and financial
data for 1967 are:
Peak system demand               1417 MW
Sales                            7470 Gwh
Electric plant - gross           US$482 million equivalent                   0
Operating revenues               US$ 96 million equivalent
Customers served                 1,859,000
of which rural                   108,000
2.03      Following World War II, Taipower began an expansion which has
increased system capability five-fold in the past 15 years. ALs the Island's
available hydroelectric resources were exploited -- none of which is associated
with sizeable storage features -- increasing emphasis was placed upon thermal
generation so that the thermal contribution has increased frcm 13% of produc-
tion in 1952 to 69% in 1967. The system is operated to optimize to t]he extent
possible the use of water resources, which are variable and difficult to manage
owing to the lack of substantial storage. Thus the expense for fuel in a given
year is a function not only of market requirements, but also the amouat of
rainfall from the season's typhoon storms.



- 3 -
2.04      Because thermal production has played an increasingly larger role
in meettag market requirements, expenditures for fuel have increased sub-
stantialLy, and at a faster rate than sales. Whereas in 1958 fuel required
only 22% of revenues, in 1967 its share had risen to 34%. Fuel oil, light
diesel o:l, and gas are supplied by the Government's Chinese Petroleum
Corporation at prices determined by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Taipower
also burns considerable indigenous coal at its major plants in the northern
regions. (Coal occurs only in the north, and transportation costs to the
south exceed the differential in price between coal and fuel oil.) Coal
resowrces are, however, limited as are natural gas reserves. Thus the prin-
cipal fossil fuel in the future will be heavy oil. The Government has
recently reduced the price of fuel oil burned by Taipower from US$20.50
equivalent per m/ton to between U.116.50 and US$17.60 equivalent depending
upon the volume.
Tariff Ragulation
2.05      The Company must annually prepare budgets of both operating expendi-
tures and capital investments, which are subject to the approval of the
Legislative Yuan. A review of Taipower's performance to ascertain whether
or not the policy guidelines have been met is made by a special Commission
of the Executive Yuan. The Commission's function is fact-finding, not making
juu'gments on tariff adequacy.
2.06      The guidelines use the rate of return as the measure of earnings
adequacy, and provide for the test to be made on assets whosT/value is adjusted
to prasumed current price levels by a wholesale price index.-   The rate base
employed is the net plant in service adjusted as stated plus an allowance for
working capital, less any outstanding debt incurred to finance plant in service.
The guidelines establish as a "standard" a six per cent return as measured
by dividing net income after taxes and interest by the rate base. Any net
income above the six per cent must be credited to a special sequestered surplus
account. If the rate of return exceeds eight percent in a given year, the
S 4          tariffs in the following year will be lowered to a level estimated to produce
no more than eight per cent in that year.  Should earnings fall below six per
cent, the special surplus account is charged an amount equal to the shortfall,
but tariffs may not be increased as long as there is any balance in the account.
A six per cent return is clearly inadequate in Taiwan's economy, and even the
eight per cent return ceiling does not result in an acceptable level of internal
cash generation.  (,e Note lOto Annex 7 for a discussion of the shortcomings of
applying the current formula.) Taipower's historical sales realization and
rates ol return are shown in Annex 2, page 3.
2.07      The introduction of appropriate reforms in the current tariff policy
was one of the major issues of the negotiations. Taipower and the Government
agreed to achieve rates-of-return of not less than nine and one-half per cent
in 1970 and 10% in later years, measured on the more usual basis of
1/ The book value of assets is not changed.



- 4 -
"operating income"P/net plant in service".  The plant values woula be
adjusted by the price index device for purposes of this calculation.
Acceptance of these targets requires changes in the Legislative Yuan's
policies, and an increase in tariffs. It is now expected that an existing
tax on electricity sales will be allowed to revert to Taipower July 1, 1969.
This will be in effect an increase in tariffs of nearly 10   from the Company's
viewpoint, although the price to the consumer will remain unchanged. The
projections in this report indicate that a further increase in. tariffs of
about five per cent will be required in 1971 to reach and maintain in the
following years the agreed-upon 10% return target.
2.08      Present book values of assets reflect an appraisal in 1954 at then
current prices, and a revaluation in 1961 by means of price indices.  3irther
adjustments to book values have not been made since 1961. (Price levels
have since been increasing at about two per cent annually.)  Depreciation
charges are adjusted for changing price levels.  Depreciation charges against
income and accumulated reserves for depreciation are made up of two components_
(i) Charges related to the book value of assets; and
(ii) Adjustments to such charges according to changes
in price levels since the assets were acquirec.
During the five years 1963-1967, annual charges have averaged about 2.8 per cent,
and reserves about 29%. These levels are satisfactory.
The Present System and Development Plans
2.09      The Taipower system at the end of 1967 had an installed capacity
of 1580 MW, in eight thermal plants and 26 hydroelectric installations whose
aggregate capacities of 858 MW and 721 MW represent 54% and 46% of the total,
respectively.  The thermal capacity is concentrated in two plants:  4100 MW
at Shenao in the north; and 205 MW at Nanpu in the south where 102 MW of
diesel-fueled gas turbines are also installed. The hydroelectric installa-
tions are located principally in the central and northern regions, the largest
being Kukuan on the Tachia River. System capability has frequently been
inadequate to meet demands without reserve, even in non-adverse hydro periods.
Industrial growth has simply outstripped Taipower's ability to plan, finance,
and construct new plant.  It is expected that with present con.struction
programs, adequate energy will be available by 1969, but reserve margins
will be inadequate until 1970. Annex 4 lists the major powerplants.
2.10      The generating plants and load centers are interconnected by an
extensive 154-kv transmission network.  The market is concentrated in two
regions:  Northern, including Taipei and Keelung; and Southern, including
the Kaohsiung area. By planning capacity additions in such wEty as to
minimize regional load/generation imbalances, the requirements for lonlg-
distance, north-south transmission facilities have also been minimized.
Subtransmission systems are operated at 34.5 kv and 69 kv. Distribution
voltages include 3.3 kv, 5.7 kv, and 11.4 kv. The 34.5-kv systems are being
converted to 69-kv operation, and 11.4-kv distribution is replacing the lower
voltages. At the end of 1967, rural distribution systems were serving
108,000 customers from 51.0 k-o of line, representing only six per cent of
residential customers and 11% of distribution lines.



2.11      A major capacity addition was completed in the summer of 1968
when the system's first 300 MW coal-fired conventional steam unit became
operational at Linkou, on the seacoast southwest of Taipei. Another major
addition is c-rrently under construction: a 360 MW hydroelectric installa-
tion at L,ower Tachien just downstream of the proposed Tachien reservoir
site. Taipower is also committed to two 300 MW oil-fired steam units for
installal.ion at Talin near Kaohsiung and is completing arrangements for
another to be installed at Linkou. As a stopgap measure, another 60 MW
of gas turbines are also nearing completion.
2.12      The next addition will be the proposed Project, the Tachien peaking
developrnnt which is discussed in Chapters III and IV. Beyond that, more
baseload capacity will be needed, and Taipower is seriously considering a
nuclear imit in the 500 MW range for operation in 1974. The decision to
4b ^install a nuclear plant is not yet firm as the economics cannot be demon-
W           strated in the absence of bona fide commercial offers for the plant.  As
suggested in 1966 by Lord  tio_n,7Chinese engineers are being trained in the
U. K. and acquiring experience in the evaluation of commercial offers.
Taipower has retained as consultant in this connection Bechtel (U. S.) and
intends to solicit offers for a nuclear plant. It would then be determined
whether the new base load capacity should be nuclear or conventional.  Should
a nuclear plant appear unattractive, there would remain ample time to procure
conventional thermal plant.
2.13      Concurrently with the expansion of generating facilities, there
will hava to be an expansion. of the transmission system. In mid-March 1968
Taipower completed a planning and operating study of bulk transmission require-
ments which indicated it would be desirable to start an EHV network in connec-
tion with Tachien. The logical choice of voltage class is 345 kv, in view
of the distances and blocks of power involved, and the considerable operating
and manufacturing experience available in this class of equipment. Accordingly,
Taipower plans to construct 345-kv circuits from the Tachia valley to the
northern and southern load centers of Taipei and Kaohsiung. These transmission
OD           lines and appropriate terminal facilities will be incluaed in the Project
proposed for Bank financing.
Management
2.14      As noted in paragraph 2.01, Taipower is organized functionally, with
the principal functions headed by eight vice presidents. The vice presidents
and the heads of several special committees report directly to the President,
which gives him a considerable but not unmanageable span of control.  Almost
all members of top management are career employees. The principal officers
on the whole are competent and well-experienced in their respective fields.
A clearer definition of the functions of the accounting department and the
finance department is desirable.  At the present time, insufficient forward
financial planning is carried out aside from preparation of the following
year's budget. Taipower has agreed to obtain outside assistance to imDrove
financial planning.



-6
2.15      On balance, Taipower's management is capable of carrying ouit the
large and ambitious expansion program now underway. Suitable consulting
engineering arrangements exist for assuring the necessary specializecl skills
will be available in connection with the major construction programs.
Taipower has currently retained Harza Engineering Co. International for
Lower Tachien; Burns & Roe for Linkou #2; Gibbs & Hill for Talin; Bechtel
for the nuclear studies; ana ELECTROCONSULT for Tachien. Except for
ELECTROCONSULT of Italy, all are American.
III. THE PROJECT
Location and Description
3.01      The Project includes the Tachien generation developmnent, and
associated EHV transmission facilities.  The Tachien development will be
located on the 124 km-long Tachia River, about 87 km upstream from its mouth.
The general area is reached by the East-WGest Highway, which is suitable for
delivery of heavy powerplant equipment.
3.02      The site is a narrow gorge 20 m wide where stream-bed is at elevation
1236 m, with the canyon walls reaching to over 2000 m on the right bank, and
1500 m on the ridge forming the left bank at the dam location. The gorge is
a good site for a thin arch dam, in spite of difficult geologic conditions.
Site investigation was begun under the Japanese occupation, has been quite
intensive, and is continuing. Extensive foundation treatment will be required,
and the tunnels are likely to require considerable support. rhe geologic
situation is such that generous allowance must be made in the cost estimate,
and substantial contingencies provided for. During the field appraisal the
site was inspected, and the cost estimate reviewed in detail. Taipower and
ELECTROCONSULT increased the estimated cost of the civil works from US$35.9
million equivalent to US$h0.2 million equivalent before contingencies.
3.03      The Project will consist of:
(i) a thin arch concrete dam 180 m high with a gated
crest spillway and two gated sluiceways;
(ii) a 6.0 m diameter pressure penstock;
(iii) a free-flow tailrace tunnel;
(iv) an 11.7 m diameter free-flow spillway tunnel;
(v) an underground powerhouse in which would be
installed three 78 MW turbine-generator units
operating under a design head of 143 m;
(vi) an outdoor substation located at the top of the
left abutment of the dam, above the powerhouse;



(vil) 17 km of double-circuit 154-kv transmission line,
Tachien-Kukuan;
(vii:L) 120 km of double-circuit 345-kv transmission line
from Tienlun (near Kukuan) to Panchiao (near Taipei)
with one circuit strung;
(ix) 165 km of double-circuit 345-kv transmission line from
Tienlun to Kaohsiung with one circuit strung; and
(x) appropriate 154-kv terminal facilities, and 345/15h-kv
transformers, located at Tienlun, Panchiao and Kaohsiung.
3.0o      The dam will create a reservSir with a gross capacity of 232 million
m3, with live storage of 175 million m  at maximum water level.  This reser-
voir wilL provide the only storage on the Tachia River, and so will enhance
the value of downstream installations. The average annual flow at the site
including the diversion of Chiloh Creek, whose natural outlet is downstream
of Tachien, is about 35 m3/sec based upon observations since October 1953,
but monthly flows vary widely from the annual average. The complex spillway
system is required to develop adequate capacity without exceeding the safe
limit of discharge through the gorge downstream of the dam. The maximum design
flood of 6h00 m3/sec is based upon severe criteria for typhoon rains derived
from 60 :fears' rainfall records and 30 yearst river flow records. It corres-
ponds to a flood frequency of less than once in 10,000 years. The maximum
flood recorded at the site has been 2500 m3/sec.
Cost Estimate
3.05      The estimated cost of the Project is shown below in condensed form,
and in mDre detail in Annex 3. The cost estimate was prepared by ELECTROCONSULT
and Taipower from quantities based upon the preliminary design, unit prices
developed for the specific works, and the proposed construction schedule.

The direct civil works cost of Tachien includes US$5.6 million equivalent for
foundation treatment.  The contingency allowance includes a provision for in-
creases in price levels during construction, and is equivalent to almtost 22%
of the direct cost of US$53.6 million equivalent. This is prudent in view of
the geologic conditions at the site, and the estimate is reasonable under the
circumstances.  The estimated costs of the transmission facilities asszme that
the line elements will be imported and erected by Chinese labor under the super-
vision of a foreign contractor. The contingency allowance is modest but adequate.
Construction Methods and Schedule
3.o6      The construction, and to a certain extent the design, of the Tachien
reservoir and dam are governed by the restricted work area, t1ae need for exten-
sive foundation treatment, and the weather. Work was started in 1968 with a
local contractor extending access roads and beginning preliminary work at the
portals of the access and diversion tunnels. After international bidding, a
general contract would be placed about May 1969 for all the civil engineering
works. This contract would be placed among bidders selected after prequali-
fication, ana woulu have a value of about US$ho million equivalent. It is
estimated it would be completed by mid-1973.
3.07      The permanent powerplant equipment for Tachien will be procured after
international competitive bidding. Erection of this equipment will be by
Taipower force account under manufacturers' supervision. Taipower personnel



-9 -
are well qaalified to carry out this work, having erected all equipment in
the hydroeLectric plants constructed since 1952. All transmission system
materials -nd equipment included in the Project will be procured through
international competitive bidding. Scheduling of engineering, design, pro-
curement, (etc. is coordinated with that for Tachien dam.
Engineering, Arrangements
3.08      In March 1967 Taipower retained ELECTROCONSULT of Milan as consulting
engineer, with general responsibility for design, procurement advice, and con-
struction ;supervision in connection with Tachien. The estimated cost of these
services is reasonable, ELECTROCONSULT having arranged to make considerable
use of appropriate Taipower design and engineering personnel while accepting
full engineering responsibility. Engineering and supervision for the trans-
mission works will be carried out principally by Taipower staff, who are
competent to do so.  A modest provision has been made in the cost estimate
for foreign engineering services of a specialized nature which might be
necessary.
Tachien Op-ration and Contribution
3.09      By 1974, when the proposed Tachien plant would be in operation,
there will be three other hydroelectric plants in operation downstream, as
follows:
Installed             Initial
Capacity             Operation
'Lower Tachien           2 x 90   MW            1970
Kukuan                   h x 45  MW             1962
rienlun                  3 x 26.5 MW            1952
h39.5 MW
Two add:LtiDnal 90 MW units are scheduled for installation at Lower Tachien
S4        in 1973, and a fourth 26.5 MW unit at Tienlun in 1976.  The Lower Tachien
and Tienluri headponds are suitable only for daily regulation.  Kukuan has
a sizeable headpond, which would permit operation of the full 180 MW
installed capacity for a five-hour period for five days. Taipower must also
respect the rights of agricultural interests downstream of Tienlun where a
re-regulating afterbay has been provided. The present lack of storage and
the wide fluctuations in river flow make water resource management a complex
problem. During the wet season, the plants are generally operated as run-of-
river to minimize water spillage.  During the dry season they are operated at
the top of the load curve during peak hours. Dispatching must also be
coordinated with water conditions on the other watersheds, and with the
scheduled maintenance of thermal plant.
3.10      The proposed Tachien reservoir would permit Taipower to operate
the Tachia River plants with greater freedom from restrictions imposed by
natural flow conditions, and to concentrate their production into the actual
system peak hours. During both wet and dry seasons they would operate at the
top of the load curve. Initially, they would provide a considerable portion



- 10 -
of system spinning reserve, but as system load grows they will occupy an
increasingly smaller proportion of the system peak ana operate for fewer
hours. This changing mode of operation has been taken into account in the
operation and economic studies discussed in the following chapter. The
ultimate capability of the Tachia valley system after the expansion of
Tienlun ana Lower Tachien will be over 800 MW dependable pealcing of which
some 600 MW are attributable to the reservoir.  Average annual energy pro-
duction will be about 2100 Gwh, about 700 of which are attributable to the
reservoir.
TV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATICX
The Power Market
4.01      As of December 31, 1967, Taipower was serving about; 1,859,000
customers of whom 1,786,000 were residential or small businesses, 72,000
industriai with contracts for demands less than 500 kw, and 370 were larger
industries with demands in excess of 500 kw.  Sales to all industrial con-
sumers accounted for 79.1% of all sales, and produced about 61% of all
revenues. Sales to large power customers alone were 64% of call sales but
produced only 36% of all revenues. It is apparent that although over 95% of
Taiwan's population has electric power, market requirements (if not revenues)
are determined principally by the major industries. Large power sales have
grown at an average compound rate of nearly 16% during the past 10 years, and
became a slightly greater proportion of all sales, a trend expected *to continue.
4.02      The use of electric power is clearly in support of industrial
development. GNP stated in real terms and adjusted for changed terms of trade
has been growing at about eight-nine per cent per annum over the past 10 years,
while industrial production has been increasing at nearly 141; per annum, and
industrial use OI electric power at 16% per annum as noted.  Since the propor-
tion of future electricity production expected to be required by commerce and
industry is not less than at present, there is a prima facie case for power
system expansion provided the country's general economic development is soundly
conceived.  Both peak demana and energy sales are forecast to increase at
about 10-1/2% during the next five years and at about nine per cent the follow-
ing five years. In view oI the present level of economic activity in Taiwan,
and the almost universal failure of past market forecasts to anticipate real
growth achieved, it is likely the current projections understate future demand.
4.03      The system annual load factor has been high -- 65 to 70% duiring
1958-1966 -- and was 67.8% last year. To a minor extent this high level
results from curtailment during peak hours from time to time (particularly
in adverse water years) but is fundamentally due to the overwhelming:Ly
industrial nature ot the market. Historical and forecast data on sales,
generation and peak loads are presented in Annex 2, page 1.
Tariff Structure
4.04      Taipower's tariff structure distinguishes between customers: accord-
ing to the amounts of power and energy they consume, anra the voltage at which
service is rendered. Smaller consumers are billed only for energy consumed,
residential customers at a level rate, and small businesses at a stepped rate.



- 11 -
Industria:L and commercial consumers pay both a demand charge and a stepped-
rate ener7y charge. Tfn 1967 the current tariff structure, shown in Annex 2,
page 2,1/ resulted in a realization on industrial sales equivalent to
US 1.0 cent, and a realization on residential sales the equivalent of
about US 2.2 cents. The average realization was US 1.2 cents. (Sales
classifiedl as commercial accounted for less than three per cent of all
sales.) 1,hile it is imprudent to make comparisons with other public utili-
ties in other societies, it can be said that the price for electric energy
in Taiwan is, by global standards, low rather than high. Nevertheless, it
would appear that the prices paid by the several classes of consumers do
bear a close relationship to Taipower's costs to serve them.
4.05      A very crude calculation taking into account Taipower's gross
investment in different types of facilities (i.e., generation, transmission,
and distribution) and expenditures for operation and maintenance, but exclud-
ing depreciation, indicates that the average revenues from residential and
large md:nstriel custcners are in line with the average costs to supply them.
Thus the c-alculated cost of serving the average residential load (assuming
25% load factor) comes to US 2.1 cents equivalent, and the average large
industrial load (at 80% load factor) to US 1.1 cent. The calculation assumes
that a:Ll investment in distribution facilities is allocable to residential
custcmers, and that out-of-pocket operating expenses are invariant with the
cuistomer class or the volume of sales. Capital costs based upon an average
35-year 'ife for plant and eight per cent return on investment were used,
reflecting Taipower's depreciation policy and recent earnings record. It is
to be appreciated that the assumptions inevitably introduce distortion, neg-
lecting as they do the effects of economies of scale, etc. The general level
of revenuas might be considered somewhat low in view of the eight per cent
return being earned, but there would not appear to be any substantial amount
of inter-class subsidization.
The Role of Tachien
4.o6      Just prior to mid-1974 when the Tachien reservoir will be completed,
the system will have the following capabilities:
---------  MW  -------------
Hydro    Thermal      Total
Installed                1081       2109       3190
Continuous                248       1748       1996
Dependable Peaking        593       2052       2645
Currently untler construction, or firmly planned, are 360 MW at Lower Tachien;
56 FNU of gas turbines; and 900 MW of new 300 MW steam units at two new sites.
1/ Tn Taipower's nomenclature, "Lighting", "Combined Lighting & Power", and
"Power" correspond closely to the more common "Residential", "Commercial"
and "Industrial".



- 12 -
Thus the 1973 system before completion of the Tachien reservoir will have
over 1700 MW in modern large steam units, and 214 MW in gas turbine units.
The system average and peak loads are estimated to be 1973 IMW and 2570 MW,
respectively. There will be an excess of energy available, but a shortage
of peaking capability taking into account the need for 300 ]MW of reserve
against the loss of one of the large new steam units. The need in the mid-
1970's is first more peaking capability followed by more energy capability.
Tachien will fulfill the requirement for short-duration peaking capability
and initially spinning reserve ana frequency control. Towards the end of
the 1970's, it will be primarily peaking, with frequency control probably
being shifted to steam units. The peaking capability of the Tachia River
plants, as increased by Tachien reservoir, will be wholly utilized by the
end of the 1970's.
4.07      The alternative to the Tachien reservoir development could be
either more gas turbines for peaking coupled with some more base-load units,
or base-load units alone which would allow some older, smaller and higher
cost steam units to be operated for peaking purposes only. There is appar-
ently not a marked initial cost advantage in either choice since Taipower's
experience with buying large (33 MW) gas turbines uncer competitive bidding
has been about US$110 per kw including customs and taxes. The 300 MW series
of steam units has cost about US$125 per kw on the same basis. A study carried
out by Taipower in November 1967 to determine the least-cost choice between
Tachien and base-load steam units indicated that the present valueo of the
costs oI the alternatives were equal at a discount rate of nearly 12%.
However, when the cost estimate for Tachien is increased as discussed during
the field appraisal, the discount rate is reduced to about 10.5%. Substitu-
tion of part of the alternative base-load capacity by gas turbines assumed
to cost US$90 per kw, and using the revised cost estimate for Tach:Len still
does not reduce the equalizing discount rate below nine per cent. The Tachien
development, including appropriate transmission facilities, can be considered
to be a practical least-cost solution to the mid-1970's peaking requirement
if capital costs in Taiwan's economy are less than about nine per cent.
4.o8      An estimate of the economic return on the investment in rachien
and the EHV facilities was made, based upon the Project's contributions to
system energy requirements, and to system peaking capability and spinning
reserves. These latter will vary with time and with growth in the power
market. When this effect is taken into account and the contributions valued
at present tariffs, the return is somewhat greater than 12%. This understates
the true economic return insofar as consumers are in all likelihood prepared
to pay more than the prices resulting from the current tariff structure.

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
The Current Situation
Auditing Arrangements
5.01      Taipower's accounts are subject to the control of the Ministry of
Audit., At present, the Ministry's audit is cursory, and while the quality
of Taipower's accounting is generally acceptable, the accounting department
would benefit from the advice of experienced auditors. As noted in para-
graph 2.L1, financial planning should be improved. Taipower has agreed to
retain external auditors not only for regular audits, but also for advice on
accounting practices.
S4          Fixed Assets and Depreciation Policy
5.o2      Gross Fixed Assets in Operation as of December 31, 1967 were
NT$19.4 billion, about US$484 million equivalent. Taipower calculates
depreciation on a straight-line basis according to realistic estimates of
the life of specific classes of assets. The composite rate was 2.74 per
cent in 1967. Although assets have not been revalued since 1962, additional
depreciation (recorded separately) is calculated on "unrecorded appreciation"
as measured by the ratio between the current level oI the wholesale price
index, and the level prevailing in the year of acquisition of assets. In
deternining the Net Fixed Assets Taipower subtracts both the actual depreciation
and additional depreciation reserves. Only the actual depreciation reserve is
deducted from Gross Plant in the projections in this report, and in calculations
of rate of return.
Customers' Contributions
5.03      All new customers are required to pay a modest connection charge,
unless construction of substantial new facilities is required to provide
service   In such cases, the customer must contribute 70% of the actual cost
of the rnew facilities, plus a fixed fee based upon Taipower's overheads. On
the other hand, rural electrificaticn, which was started in 1954, has been
supported by the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction (JCR?R) and, later,
the Provrincial Government. Consumers could borrow from JCRR to reduce their
initial cash outlay. In recent years customers have contributed 35% and the
Company 50% of the cost of facilities, the balance being grants from the
ProvincLal Government. In 1967 sales to rural customers represented 0.87 per
cent of total sales ana provided 1.5 per cent of total revenues.
Capitalization
5.04      Taipower's presently authorized capital is NT$2.0 billion represented
by 40 million common stock shares of NT$50 par value. It has been the policy
of the 'Tovernment under a 1953 agreement with Taipower to reinvest dividends
received on its shareholdings, as well as taxes on income, and some other taxes.
These anounts are accrued in an account called "Advances to be Converted to
Capital Stock", together with 2-1/2 per cent interest in lieu of dividends on
the -unconverted "Advances". At the end of 1967 this account totaled about



- 14 -
NT$2.8 billion. It is planned to convert these "Advances" to capital stock
during 1969, offering the few private shareholders a proportional amount of
shares at par value. This procedure will be followed from year to year in
the future.
5.05      Another Balance Sheet account, "Revaluation Surplus, Grants and
Others" (NT$3.0 billion at 1967 year end), is composed principally of amounts
which arose from the asset revaluations mentioned in paragraph 2.08, as well
as from U. S. grants, and some special contributions such as -the Provincial
Government's subsidy for rural electrification. Three "Reserve"l accounts,
totaling at year end about NT$1.3 billion (described in more detail in Note 7
to Annex 7) complete Taipower's equity. The following table summarizes
the capitalization as of December 31, 1967:

Total capitalization         19,088            476.0           100
Long-Term Debt
5.06      At December 31, 1967, Taipower's long-term debt amounted to about
NT$9.2 billion (US$230 million equivalent) net of a current portion of some
NT$521 million (US$13 million equivalent). NT$7.9 billion consists of obliga-
tions under various US aid program financings. The U. S. Agency for Inter-
national Development (AID) and its predecessor agencies, have made three types
of credits available:
(i) U. S. dollar loans repayable in local currency with
Taipower bearing the exchange risk;
(ii) Local currency loans (from the proceeds of counterpart
operations and repayments of (i) above) repayable in
local currency; and
(iii) U. S. dollar loans repayable in U. S. dollars.



- 15 -
The AID program was terminated in 1966. Funds accruing from repayments of
U. S. aid financing are now known as the Sino-American Fund for Economic
Development (SAFED), and are administered by the Council for International
Economic Cooperation and Development (CIECD), the Chinese Government's
agency for administering foreign-aid programs in Taiwan. These funds will
play a major role in Taipower's future financing plans as discussed below
in paragraphs 5.10 - 5.18. The debt structure as of December 31, 1967, is
summarized as follows:
(a) Local currency loans, payable to CIECD, with maintenance of
value: about NT$2.9 billion (US$72 million) outstanding;
interest is five per cent, repayment 20 years.
(b) Local currency loans, payable to CIECD and SAFED, under a
number of different accounts corresponding to various U. S.
4b                     aid programs.  Interest is 10.08% and terms of payment are
25 to 30 years. The total outstanding was NT$3.0 billion
(US$75 million);
(c) U. S. dollar loans, four from AID (terms varying between
15 and 30 years, interest three and one-half per cent) and
two from U. S. Export-Import Bank (10 to 14 years, interest
five and one-half - six per cent). The aggregate outstanding
was about NT$2.4 billion (US$60 million); and
(d) Foreign currency credits from U. S., Japanese, German and
Italian suppliers, repayable over 5 to 10 years at six per
cent. The total outstanding was about NT$470 million
(US$12 million).
5.07      Taipower is liable for customs duties on imported materials and
equipment, but is permitted to pay its obligations over a long period, in
monthly installments of not more than NT$l million. At December 31, 1967
4,            these obligations amounted to NT$460 million.
Current Position
5.08      The ratio of current assets to current liabilities has been
satisfactory. Taipower maintains regular accounts with the more important
local banks including the Bank of Communications, the Bank of Taiwan, and
the Land Bank of Taiwan.
Billing and Collection
5.09      Taipower maintains customer relations through 14 district offices.
The Company is gradually applying electronic data processing to customer
accounting ana billing, and conversion is scheduled to be completed by the
end of 1969. Five districts (about 350,000 accounts) are now handled in
this way. Taipower's record of collections is excellent: at the end of 1967,
accumulated uncollected bills amounted to less than 0.2 per cent of revenues
for the year. With the authorization of the Ministry of Audit, uncollected
bills are written off after three years.



- 16 -
Financing Plan
5.10      Taipower's expansion program for the eight-year period 1968-1975
requires investments totaling NT$30.2 billion, or about US$750 million
equivalent, excluding interest during construction (see Annex 6). The
Company's original plan for financing this program was found unsatisfactory
on a number of counts, all related to the constraint imposed on earniigs by
the regulations described in paragraph 2.06. Niet cash generat,ion wouLd have
been equivalent to less than 11% of construction expenditures. Taipower pro-
posed to finance construction by borrowing over 80% of its requirements:
the foreign exchange requirements in toto (which is not unreasonable); and
unrealistically large amounts from omestic sources.  From the viewpoint ot
both the Company's financial management and that of the national economy,
Taipower's investment was not earning a reasonable return.
5.11      As noted in paragraph 2.07, agreement was reached during negotiations
that the Government would take measures to provide Taipower with adequate
revenues.  Assurances were also obtained as to the availability of funds needed
from domestic lending sources.  The resulting satisfactory financing plan is
summarized below.

5.12      Internal cash generation net of debt service and payment of cash
dividends to private shareholders represents 37% of construction expendi-
tures. This is a satisfactory level of self-financing. New equity will be
obtained from sales of stock to private shareholders and reinvestment of
income taxes (see paragraph 5.04). The reinvestment of dividends on Govern-
ment shar'eholdings has been considered as part of internal cash generation.
5.13      Foreign borrowings would includes
(i) the proposed Bank loan of U $50 million equivalent,
for a term of 25 years, including about six years
of grace (a rate of 6-1/2 per cent has been assumed);
(ii) drawings under existing loans and suppliers'
S4                         credits; and
(iii) new loans and suppliers' credits at terms comparable
to thne existing ones.
5.14      The financing plan includes local borrowings from SAFED and the
Bank of Taiwan. SAFED funds will be available at 10% interest, with amorti-
zation over 25 years after one year of grace. The original arrangements
between the U. S. and Chinese Governments which brought SAFED into existence
expire in 1972, and although it is likely that they woula be renewed, no
commitments have been assumed for later years. Taipower has negotiated a
substantial line of credit with the Bank of Taiwan, with an interest rate of
10% and a term -- subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance -- of
5 years.  The forecast in this report shows that with the increased level
of earnings orojected, only modest use of this credit facility will be required.
Debt finamcing woulo be completed by the deferred payment of customs duties,
in line writh current policy of the Ministry of Finance (see paragraph 5.07).
5.15      The financing plan would be completed by modest contributions from
p 4         customers and the Provincial Government, as well as the expected salvage
value of retired assets. Provisions have been made in the plan for maintain-
ing an adlequate level of supplies and materials and for increased fuel
inventor'Les, commensurate with expanding thermal operations. During the
latter years covered by the projections, what appears to be surplus cash
is generated. This situation reflects the inability accurately to forecast
future construction expenditures, which are very likely understated in the
projections.
5.16      The rate of return test required by the Loan Agreement would be
calculated on a base which includes currently-valued net average fixed assets
in operai;ion plus a working capital allowance.  This test will be met throughout
the period, although by a quite narrow margin. On the other hand the market
forecast, which appears reasonable, may well be exceeded and hence revenues
may be higher than projected.

5.17      As a consequence of higher revenues and reduced borrowings,
equity is expected to increase substantially and debt as a percentage of
total capitalization would fall from 54% in 1968 to 41% by 1975. The ratio
of current assets to current liabilities would be satisfactory-, averaging
1.4. Taipower has agreed not to borrow unless it meets an objiective current
earnings/maximum debt service coverage test of 1.5 times. Forecast annual
debt service coverage would be acceptable, with the average coverage estimated
at 1.7 times for the period.
5.18      In summary, as a result of the tariff reforms requizing a higher
level of earnings, together with the arrangements for local borrowings,
Taipower's projected financial performance may be considered satisfactory
from all viewpoints: earnings, debt service coverage, and licquidity.
VI. CONCLUSIONS                                            0
6.01      The Project has been soundly conceived and carefully designed
following exhaustive site investigations, and remains economically attractive
in spite of the increase in estimated cost to cover possible foundation diffi-
culties. The economic rate of return is estimated to be greater than 12%.
6.02      Taipower's management assisted by consultants is capable of executing
the Project as well as the concurrent program described in Chapter II.
6.03      Past financial performance has been satisfactory, and the current
position is acceptable. The Company's projected performance -s also satis-
factory, and suitable arrangements are underway for financing the ambitious
expansion program of the next several years.
6.o4      The Project would be a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$50 million
equivalent, for a term of 25 years including a grace period of 6 years. During
negotiations in August and September 1968 agreement was reached on the follow-
ing major issues:
(i) A rate of return of 10% on currently-valued net assets
has been established as the principal performance criterion
for 1971 and later years. The requirement for the transi-
tional year of 1970 is 9.5 per cent.
(ii) Appropriate reforms will be instituted in the Government's
regulatory policy to assure that Taipower will achieve
these performance criteria.
(iii) The present tax on electricity sales will revert to Taipower
beginning July 1, 1969. This is equivalent to an increase
of nearly 10% in average tariffs.
(iv) Independent auditors will be retained to carry out the
usual review of accounts; assistance in improving coor-
dination between accounting and financial planning will
be provided by the auditors or other qualified consultants.

ANNEX 1

Tachien Site
1.        The Tachia River rises in the Central Mountains and flows 124 km
west to the Formosa Straits.  The steepness of the drop from headwaters to
discharge; the lack of vegetation in the upper catchment area; and the
extremely heavy concentration of rainfall accompanying the seasonal typhoon
storms a:Ll combine to produce exaggerated variations in flow and sharply
peakecd fLoods. Model studies have demonstrated that the safe evacuation
capacity of the gorge below the damsite is somewhat less than half the
design fLood. This requires an elaborate spillway system, the principal
feature of which is a 700 m long 11.6 m free-flow tunnel in the left bank
discharging downstream of the Lower Tachien pond located immediately below
the Tachien Dam.
2.        A considerable amount of subsurface exploration has been carried
out --- dating back to the Japanese occupation -- and more is currently pro-
ceedirng mnder the consultant's direction, focused at the site now selected.
The PiLtan Creek enters the river from the left just above the damsite, and
forms by a sharp left turn of the river proper downstream of the damsite
a narrow spur known as the Pitan Ridge, which will serve as the left abutment.
The Ridges imposes a limit on the height of the dam, fixed at lhll m after
geomecha:aical bi-dimensional structural model tests. Riverbed level at the
site is 1L236 m.
3.        The rock systems in the damsite area are primarily quartzite forma-
tions, and slate formations. The quartzite is interbedded with slate in
places, anu the slate contains clay seams. The dam will be founded on quartz-
1te laye rs separated by thin beds of slate.  The strata strike normal to the
gorge axis, and dip upstream at about 600. These conditions are favorable to
the thin arch structure. Below about 1300 meters the gorge walls are fresh
and compact, but above there are weathered joints and stress relief cracks
which penetrate deeper into the abutments with increasing height.  There is
a fauiLt in the right bank running parallel to the river, and the thrust of
the darn. This fault and the stress relief cracks will require extensive
treatment.  This has been provided for in the revised cost estimate.
4.        There is a fault in the left bank running along Pitan Creek, as
well as a wide zone of fractured rock crossing the alignment of the spillway
tunne'L. This major tunnel will be excavated by driving a pilot tunnel along
the upper alignment, supporting where necessary and concreting the roof.  The
remaining section will then be mined out and concreted. Considerable diffi-
culty has been experienced in a smaller tunnel at the Lower Tachien site,
and tle cost estimate for the Tachien spillway assumes 50 percent supporting,
and 50 psrcent bolting. The intake structures for both the spillway and the
pressure tunnels are located on the upstream face of Pitan Ridge, the stability
of which is marginal. Provisions have been made for additional excavation,
bolting, and backfilling to assure sound seating of the intakes. The estimate
reflects this extra work. Pitan Ridge itself will be treated by establishing
a drainage curtain using existing exploratory audits, and additional drill
holes. An extensive grouting program is anticipated.



ANNEX 1
5.        Excavation for the dam will be kept to a minimum.  A grout
curtain will be placed upstream, ana a drainage curtain downstream.
A total of some 37 km of grout holes will be involved in foundation treat-
ment, and the cost estimate reflects this.
6.        It is apparent that the geologic conditions at the site leave
much to be desired.  As a matter of fact, geology has been difficult
throughout the Tachia valley, and in other valleys as well.. The 'rachien
gorge is situated so as to produce a sizable reservoir, situated on a
relatively impermeable and thick slate formation. The strata orientation
at the gorge is eminently suitable for seating an arch structure. The need
to take such extensive foundation and abutment treatment measures inevitably
increased the cost, but the allowances for contingencies included in addi-
tion to conservative estimates should assure adequate fund availabilities.
7.        Studies of alternative structure designs have indicated a thin
arch to be the optimum choice. For example, a rockfill structure which
would not require such extensive foundation and abutment treatment would
be quite expensive due to cramped work space. A major technical problem
of spillway capacity will also exist, and a tunnel would probably be involved
in any event.

Notes to Income Statement
1/ The principal conmponents of this item are meter rentals and 5% of
accrued customerst contributions, including the year's addition; only
net amounts are therefore shown in the Funds Statement and. the Balance
Sheet.
2/ "'Maintenance" is inclusive of materials, labor, and otner allocated
costs; they represented about 67%, 22% and 11% respectively of the whole,
in 1967.
3/ The principal taxes paid by Taipower are:
(a) Sales tax: 0.6% of revenues from power and
other sales, plus 1.5% of other revenues, plus
an additional 30% of the amount of the tax so
determined;
(b) Stamp tax: 0.4% on all revenues and customers'
contributions;
(c) A number of property taxes on land, buildings,
and net fixed assets, at rates varying between
6% and 2%.
(d)  Taxes and surtaxes at various rates on mctor
vehicles.
4/ Income tax is paid at an effective rate after adjustments of 15-16%
of net income.  The proceeds of the tax accrue 80% to the NationaL Govern-
ment and 20% to the Provincial Government. They are reinvested in Tai-
power.
5/ The figures shown in the Income Statement for depreciation include the
additional depreciation for unrecorded appreciation of assets described in
paragraph 5.03. Depreciation allowances for the coal mine! are treated as
part of the coal cost and therefore included under "Fuel".  They are pro-
perly taken into account in the funds statement and in the balance sheet.
6/ Taipower charges to plant the interest accruing during construction on
the loans financing the specific projects; the amounts so determined are
added to the work in progress at year end.
7/ Taipower follows rather rigid rules for the appropriation of net income.
The legal reserve is credited 10% of the sum of net income and income

tax. All Income above the 6% return as defined by existing regulations
of the Legislative Yuan must be allocated to a special "Reserve for
Rate 9qualization". (See paragraph 2.06) The balance, after deduction
of the Reserve for Exchange Adjustment, is available for distribution
as dividends to private stockholders (in cash) and to the National and
Provincial Governments and is in fact all distributed.  Distributions
e(u.al to 6% of par value are called "regular", and that portion above
6%, "bDonus".  In the period 1963-67 the total distribution has been
between 15% and 20% of par value, but would sharply decrease in the
future, if all appropriations would continue to be made out of the 6' 
return. It is expected that this feature of the present regulations
will be abolished, and, therefore, for the purpose of this forecast,
it has been assumed that, starting from 1969, dividends would be dis-
tributed at 10% of par value, and that onlv the residual income would
be allocated to the "Reserve for Rate Equalization".
8/ Inzludes NM638.5 million of unappropriated earned surplus carried
over from 1962.
9/ The formula used to calculate the rate of return is verv similar to
the one used by Taipower in preparing internal statements for manage-
ment information according to what they call 'F.P.C.'  method, a re-
ference to the U.S. Federal Power Commission. It consists of comparing
operating income to the average net plant in service increased by a
working capital allowarce (2.5% of average net plant in service and
11.5' of cash operating expenses).  It differs from the system followed
by Taipower in the definition of cash operating expenses, but primarily
45 4in not subtracting from gross assets the additional depreciation for un-
recorded appreciation.
10/ Talpower's formula is described in detail in paragraph 2.06. The main
argument against this concept of rate of return is based on the fact that
the rate base is substantially affected by past financing patterns. A
high proportion of debt financing would result in a smaller rate base,
thus limiting permitted earnings and creating the need for continuing
heavy reliance on borrowings to finance expansion.  On the other hand, no
relation is maintained between permitted earnings and the size of the ven-
ture as represented by its net fixed assets in operation. Consequently,
earnings are unlikely to provide a reasonable proportion of selfinancing.
This has proven to be the case for Taipower.

Notes to Balance Sheet
l/ It has been assumed that the Government Advances as of December 31,
1968, would be converted in Capital Stock during 1969, and that fur-
ther Government equity (equal to the dividends on its shareholdings
plus the reinvested income tax) would be converted in stock at the end
4-                of' each year.  Consequently, additional shares would be offered at the
samE time at par to private shareholders, so as to maintain unchanged
the proportion between public and private ownership (about 95% and 5%
respectively in 1967).
2/ Although these loans, counterpart of U.S. aid, are repayable in
local currency, Taipower bears the exchange risk.  Therefore, from
the Company's point of view, they are to be considered as foreign
exchange liabilities.
