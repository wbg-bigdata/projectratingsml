Fiscal Year
January 1 to December 31
1/ Appraisal estimates have been made at the 18 lei/$ exchange rate. During
negotiations, the Romanian delegation was not able to confirm that the
exchange rate would be changed from 18 to 15 lei/$ on January 1, 1981.
Subsequently, the Bank was officially informed that such change will be
made and the Romanian equalization fund abolished as of January 1, 1981.
The estimate of foreign cost in equivalent $ is not affected by the new
rate. Other effects from the change are minor. They would reduce the
total cost estimate in equivalent lei marginally by about 4.5%, have a
somewhat favorable effect on cash generation and improve the return on
investment by about 0.4%.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
MINISTRY OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY (MEE)
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR 1/
A. Sector Organization
1.01      The State Planning Committee (SPC) coordinates energy planning and
expansion in Romania, carried out by the following Ministries with regard to
the respective subsector concerned:
Ministry of:                            Area of Responsibility of Subsector
Mines, Petroleum and Geology            Extraction of oil, natural gas,
(Ministry of Mines - MM)               anthracite, coking coal, coal, lignite,
bituminous and carboniferous shale.
Electrical Energy (MEE)                 Electrical energy and heat.
Chemical Industry (MChI)                Petroleum refining and petrochemicals.
Metallurgical Industry (MMI)            Coke and coke-oven gases, coal-tar.
Forestry Economy and Construction       Wood.
Materials (MFCM)
Operating efficiencies in the power subsector are some of the highest anywhere
notwithstanding multi-responsibility for sector planning, due to an integrated
approach to the use of energy at national and Romanian regional levels (para
1.03) and the legal obligation to comply with the plans.
1.02      The MM (Chart l.l)--with the Industrial Centrals for coal and other
mining activities directly under the Minister, and with seven directorates for
oil and gas, geology, technical development/planning, finance, organization/
training, investment and international economic cooperation--has responsibility
for production of fuels and their processing and transport. The fuels are
delivered to the end users at set quotas and fixed prices. For natural gas
1/   Further information on the sector is given in Report No. 1601-RO of
March 31, 1978 entitled "Romania - The Industrialization of an Agrarian
Economy under Socialist Planning" - mainly in Volume II, pages 267 to
288, Chapter XIV - "Consumption and Production of Energy Resources".



-2
the MM ensures compliance of individual consumers with assigned quotas
(paras 2.18-2.20). The MEE (para 2.03) is responsible for planning of system
expansion and the design, construction and operation of generating plant and
transmission and distribution systems. It receives coal and gas for its
production of heat and electricity from the MM and fuel oil from the MChI.
The MMI supp;ies waste heat in form of industrial gases for electricity and
heat production by the MEE thermal plants. The MChI processes all crude oil,
associated natural gas liquids and part of natural gas supply into petroleum
products and chemicals for sale in domestic and foreign markets. Similarly
the MMI and MFCM are in charge of production and marketing of the products
under their responsibility.
1.03      The 1973 oil crisis had led to establishing the "Permanent Commission
for the Coordination, Guidance and Control of Fuel, Electricity and Heat
Consumption" late in 1973. The work, under its coordination, has produced
the strategy and policy discussed in paras 1.09-1.11. The Commission is also
instrumental in expediting the ongoing revision of the 1981-1985 Five Year
Plan (FYP) for the sector, precipitated by Romania's recent loss of oil supplies
from Iran and Iraq.
B. Energy Resources
1.04      The primary energy sources of Romania consist of crude oil, natural
gas (including that associated with oil extraction), coal, anthracite, coking
coal, lignite, brown coal, bituminous and carboniferous shale, and hydropower.
Wood for fuel is still available in the countryside. There are important
hydropower resources, and there is a geothermal potential, probably of low
temperature, that could possibly be developed for space heating.
1.05      Regarding thermal energy, Romania was one of the world's early
(since 1857), large-scale producers and exporters of petroleum. Before World
War II it ranked among the five largest producer countries. But in recent
times consumption caught up with supply and it has had to import crude oil
from OPEC sources to maintain its traditional and profitable export of refined
products. While no figures are published by the Government, it is likely that
present known producible petroleum reserves amount to around 100 to 200 million
tons (Mt) 1/, and gas reserves could be of the order of 500,000 million m.  2/
Coking coal in exploitable quantities is limited 3/; with 3,600 to 4,700
kcal/kg it has about half the heat value of imported hard coal. To feed mainly
its steel industry demand, Romania has a long term joint investment with a
coal supplier in the eastern USA. The main, economically exploitable lignite 4/
1/   About 700 to 1,400 million barrels; production of oil in 1979 was around
14 million tons (Mt).
3
2/   1979 production of gas was around 2,800 million m.
3/   Total hard coal production in 1979 was around 6 Mt.
4/   1979 production of lignite was around 15 Mt.

deposits are in the south-western part of Romania. The lignite has only about
a quarter of the specific heat content of imported hard coal, has a high ash
content and is uneconomical to transport over some distance; most of it is,
therefore, used in large power plants to produce electricity and, in accelerat-
ing degree, heat (para 4.05). Carboniferous shales are found in the Anina-
Oravitsa region together with coal deposits; ash content is very high (up to
85%) and specific heat content only about 1/4 of imported hard coal. While
the mineable coal reserves could be considerably less and no figures for
bituminous shales (assumed to be in the order of 200 Mt) are available, the
official estimates of the coal reserves are as follows:
-----------Million Tons---------
Proven      Probable    Possible
Anthracite                               14.0           1.3          8.2
Coking Coal                              18.7         325.6         52.7
Bituminous Coal                          39.0         711.3         85.2
Lignite and Brown Coal                  360.4         386.2         68.1
Source: MM.
1.06      The hydropower resources of Romania are estimated to be 12,300 MW,
capable of generating 37,000 GWh per annum from some 630 sites. 1/ Only 75%
of this is economically feasible for development at the present time, the
remaining 25% being described as technically feasible . Also, Romania's five
plants on the Danube, being developed jointly with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria,
should produce 2,400 MW and 12,300 GWh per annum. About 2/3 of the economically
feasible hydropower capacity has been developed. The government expects the
full hydropotential to be tapped by the end of the 1990s.
C. Energy Supply and Use
1.07      Romania became a net importer of energy in 1972/73 and of oil and
oil products in about 1976. Currently, the country still meets more than 80%
of its energy needs from domestic oil and gas resources. Natural gas has been
and is the most important source of primary energy; it accounted for 44% of
total consumption in 1975, oil for 33%, coke and coal for about 19% and
hydroelectricity for only about 3%. Domestic production of crude oil is
slowly decreasing despite intensive secondary and tertiary recovery efforts.
1/   1979 production of hydroelectric energy was 11,239 GWh or 17.3% of total
electric energy generated.



- 4 -
The increase in the supply of other domestic sources of primary energy--coal,
lignite, bituminous shales and hydropower, consequently, continues to be given
priority. Low productivity and labor unrest in the coal mining sector have in
the past affected low-grade coal supply and consequently the power sector
performance. To fill the energy demand/supply gap, Romania will have to
import substantial amounts of its commercial energy needs by 1985, mostly in
the form of crude oil and increasingly of high grade coal. The use of wood as
a household fuel is still widespread; local peat deposits are not regarded as
economically exploitable. Although the discovery of oil and gas off-shore
in the Black Sea has been announced, the size of the resource is not yet
known. Figure 1.1 shows projections to 1990 of the net primary energy produc-
tion, indicating the strong reduction in hydrocarbons and the gap between
requirements and domestic resources.
1.08      Despite Romania's successful energy conservation program, energy
demand in Romania increased rapidly from 6.8 million tons of oil equivalent
(Mtoe) in 1950 to about 61 Mtoe in 1977, as a result of rapid industrialization
and may reach 78 Mtoe in 1980. Efforts since 1974 had reduced energy consump-
tion as reflected in the energy/GDP ratio. By 1980, Romania was planning to
save 8 Mtoe in the industrial sector and 5 Mtoe through increased waste heat
recovery. Further savings are resulting from the measures introduced in July
1979. However, to cover the additional petroleum supply gap resulting from
the loss of contracts with Iran, Romania concluded a limited supply contract
with the USSR in 1979. The oil supply situation has worsened further due to
the Iran-Iraq crisis.
D. Energy Policy and Strategy
1.09      Since the mid 1960-s, the Government's most important energy policy
objectives continue to be:
(a)  to increase output of primary energy to cover the requirements to a
maximum from internal resources, primarily coal and hydropower;
(b)  to intensify efforts in conservation of hydrocarbon resources,
including likely through retrofitting of industrial boilers to burn
coal in addition to those for power and heat of MEE included in the
FYP; and direct their use to production of petrochemicals;
(c)  to increase efficiency in the utilization of plant capacity
and also in the consumption of users; and
(d)  to expand oil and gas exploration, particularly in offshore
areas.
The Government's strategy continues to be to make fullest use of indigenous
resources and, more recently--with Canadian help--to develop nuclear power. A
first 600 MW unit of Canadian supply is planned to be commissioned about 1985.
Canada is expected to provide financing in the order of Can $1.0 billion to
assist the first phase of Romania's nuclear program. The total program is
expected to provide about 2,840 MW by the end of the 1980s.



-5-
1.10      In the power subsector, because of the integrally-planned approach
to expand and operate the economy, Romania has reached an exceptionally high
level of integrated multipurpose use of primary thermal energy for the produc-
tion of electricity and heat which is mostly centrally produced and rationally
distributed for consumption; this seems to be the reason for the very high
efficiency in the countrys use of such energy. The recent worldwide concern
for energy conservation is now leading other parts of the world to increasingly
adopt an integrated multi-purpose energy use (including of normally "wasted"
heat) which is planned to be further expanded in Romania under its 1981-1985
FYP. Some 35% of central heating is derived from co-generating plants in the
country and it has exported this technology to other countries, as Romania
manufactures co-generating units up to 150 MW.
1.11      The centrally-planned system has allowed Romania to take drastic and
very early steps (in comparison with most other countries) to conserve energy
on a large scale. The 1979 measures, strongly enforced by quotas, have led to
immediate reduction of energy use. Heating and lighting of factories and
offices were lowered to minimum levels; use of private and official passenger
cars was drastically curtailed and the cost of petrol increased; heat that
would usually be wasted in conventional condensing power plants is recovered
and channelled to provide process heat, hot water and space heating. For the
latter, new users are found in large scale greenhouses, when a power plant has
to be located away from industry and population near low-grade coal deposits.
To reduce hydrocarbon use in existing, older vintage electricity and heat
generating stations, the Government plans now to provide for further fuel oil
savings by adding new coal based co-generation stations.
E. Sector Issues
1.12      In addition to growing energy imports, the major issue is the need
for a speedy improvement in specific energy consumption in order to reduce the
relatively high per capita consumption of energy which has resulted from the
structure of industry and its high share in the Romanian economy. In the
1981-1985 FYP period, the Government intends to reduce per capita consumption
but the reduction will be slow because: (i) the technology used in the Romanian
industry is relatively energy intensive as, until recently, domestic energy
sources were relatively abundant and imported technology was also energy
intensive ; and (ii) much plant and equipment uses less efficient processes
than the more advanced technology in other countries. Also, until recently,
physical production targets were the over-riding concern of the plan under the
gross production concept; it had been generally more important to produce the
goods than to produce them efficiently. Beginning in 1979, Romania introduced
a net production concept into the Plan which emphasizes value added. This,
and Romania½ energy conservation programs, are expected to have a significant
impact on lowering specific energy consumption as capital stock is replaced
over time. The industrial projects which the Bank is helping to finance are
introducing processes to Romania that are more energy efficient. The above
issues are being addressed in the 1981-1985 Draft FYP. In this connection it
should be noted that the level of energy consumption in Romania is a result of



- 6-
high gas, oil, coal and lignite consumption, and not of per capita consumption
of electric power which is fully in line with comparable countries.
1.13      The bulk of the economy's additional energy requirements to 1990
will have to Je provided increasingly by electrical energy based on lignite,
hydropower, nuclear and shale, in that order. A lignite production increase
of the targeted size can only come, however, from a rapid growth of open-cast
mining, and the whole planned program is geared to a very tight delivery
schedule for new equipment. The development of new mines must also be
integrated with the construction of new power stations that will use the
lignite. The open-cast mining system employs very large electrically-powered
mobile bucket-wheel excavators largely manufactured in Romania in cooperation
with a West German firm. Delay in commissioning such new excavators would
result in a large loss of production of lignite, equivalent to large amounts
of oil or hard coal, which would presumably have to be made up in imports.
Thus any substantial delays in commissioning of new mining machinery, or of
new power stations in which the lignite is to be burned, will have economic
repercussions. Past setbacks in lignite production have led to increased oil
and gas consumption and caused the highest Government levels to intervene.
To confirm that adequate action is planned for the needed lignite/coal supply
for electrical energy production, the Romanian authorities have provided an
acceptable statement on the measures being taken to expand coal production and
coal production forecasts.
II. THE POWER AND HEAT SUBSECTOR I/
A. Subsector History Overview
2.01      Electrification in Romania began in 1882, providing in Bucharest
one of the first public electric lighting systems in the world. But electri-
fication grew slowly, mainly in urban centers, and in 1938 the installed
capacity was only about 500 MW for a population of 19.8 million, e.g., about
25 watts per inhabitant. In 1979, it was 15,000 MW and 740 watts, respectively.
After World War II, with the rapid development of the economy, electrifica-
tion of the countryside was emphasized. In 1949, the subsector planning and
design institutes and the specialized enterprises for manufacture, construction,
1/   In Romania, electricity production is strongly linked, through "co-
generation", to the production of heat (steam and hot water). Both are
commercially supplied, and in part distributed, by MEE's Centrals and
enterprises to the users. The Romanian energy "subsector", therefore,
includes electricity and heat.



installation and operations accelerated their activities. The subsector's
current high level of capability and performance (paras 2.07-2.14) makes it one
of the most advanced in the less developed countries. The rapid evolution was
helped particularly in the postwar period by a national industry built up to
produce equipment and materials for the fast growing needs of the subsector.
2.02      Since 1950 the FYPs have stressed the rational utilization of all
indigenous resources for subsector development, including oil and gas in the
earlier years. The activities concentrated on:
(i)  development of complex hydro-projects on river cascades;
(ii)  construction and use of large thermal generating units
combined into very large power plants, and locating nearby
the new, large consumers of heat (district heating) and
industrial "platforms" needing heat and process steam; and
(iii)  establishing a single interconnected electric power system,
connected to the national systems of neighboring countries;
the former helped the accelerated electrification of villages
and urban areas without electricity service.
B. Subsector Organization
2.03      The activities of MEE are controlled and coordinated by the
Minister and his three Deputies, reporting to the MEE Executive Bureau which
is directed by the MEE Managing Council (Chart 2.1). The Bureau, consisting
of the Minister, Deputies and Directors of subordinated departments and units
of MEE, manages the subsector. The MEE organization follows the national
pattern set for the Ministries for industrial production. The Minister and
the heads of MEE's organizational units have executive authority. MEE has its
own statutes and regulations on tariffs (para 2.18), conditions of supply and
instructions on the application of the regulations. The organizational units
of the MEE, including its two Industrial Centrals (para 2.05) and, in turn,
their enterprises, are subject to legislation 1/ which regulates and controls
all economic units in the Romanian socialist system. Legislation, implemented
through Ministry of Finance instructions in the financial area, covers such
matters as depreciation rates, classification of accounts and distribution and
payment of benefits and the preparation of financial reports for the Centrals.
1/   Law No. 11/71 - covers organization and management of the Centrals and
Enterprises. Decree No. 76/73 - covers organization and management of
the Ministries and other State Bodies.



- 8 -
Each enterprise submits monthly operational results and quarterly balance
sheets to the respective Central which supervises its activities and co-
ordinates finances.
C. Subsector Activities
2.04      MEE is responsible for the overall performance of the subsector;
coordinates its activities (para 2.05) through other central organs with
the rest of the economy; translates national economic objectives and poli-
cies for electrical energy and heat into specific physical, financial, and
efficiency targets for its organizational units; and approves their respective
specific investments. Through its research, design and engineering institutes;
construction trusts 1/; enterprises; and other units MEE is also responsible
for the design and execution of its projects to provide for the future public
demand for electrical energy and heat. It controls its foreign trade
operations (import and export) through its foreign trade enterprise -
ROMELECTRO - in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Inter-
national Cooperation.
2.05      MEE and its dependencies employ a total force of about 130,000 (up
from 106,000 in 1970; an increase of 2.6% p.a.). MEE's two centrals, four
institutes, five construction trusts, three enterprises and several other
units have so far very capably performed their assigned activities. This they
can be expected to continue to do. Their activities under active direction of
staff of MEE, provide for the subsector (and also for other subsectors):
research, planning, design, engineering, construction, commissioning, opera-
tion, maintenance, repairs 2/ and training for electrical energy and heat
supply. The responsibilities and activities of the central departments
(Directorates) of MEE, headed by their Directors, are stated in Chart 2.1.
Annex 2.1 provides a summary of the main activities of MEE's main subordinated
units.
1/   The term "trust" is applied only to construction and agricultural enter-
prises in Romania.
2/   The repair activities are widely spread throughout the different organiza-
tional levels. This is a particular feature of the economy where the
ministries for industrial production own special machine building and
spare parts manufacturing enterprises, which supply the sizeable cen-
tralized repair enterprises. Within MEE, capital repairs are carried out
by such enterprises and similar ones owned by the two Centrals and
operating enterprises.



D. Achievements After 1960
(a) Overview
2.06      During 1961-1965, MEE started the construction of important hydro-
power projects, including the multi-purpose Iron-Gates I project on the
Danube, jointly with Yugoslavia. With a total of about 2,100 MW (50% Romanian)
Iron-Gates I produces run-of-river hydropower and improves river navigation by
a system of locks. MEE also expanded thermal power plant rapidly. Most
expansion was accomplished with goods and services increasingly produced in
the country. This substantial effort required channeling about 12 to 15%
annually of all industrial investment into the subsector.
2.07      Total demand for electrical energy, which has been 75% industrial,
increased annually at 15.3% during 1965-1970, 9.4% - 1970-1975, and 7.1% in
1975-1979. During 1965-1978 MEE carried out a large construction program to
meet this growth in demand. The following shows the remarkable achievements
of the subsector:

(b) Hydropower and Generation-Mix
2.08      The share of hydropower generation, has grown dramatically since
1960 as demonstrated by the share of installed capacity (11.8% in 1960 and
21.2% in 19 9) and net electric energy supplied (5.7% in 1960 and 19.5% in
1979). The major hydropower installations in operation during 1979 were on
the rivers: Danube - 1,050 MW (Romanian side of Iron-Gates I); Lotru - 510 MW;
Somes - 265 MW; Arges - 220 MW; and Bistrita - 210 MW (Bicaz plant)--with the
largest units of about 170/175 MW at Lotru/Iron-Gates. Riul Mare-Retezat,
with 369 MW, is under construction with Bank financing.
2.09      The remainder of the electricity generation is thermal.  The composi-
tion of the net supply to the system has developed as shown below, showing a
substantial increase of hydro and oil-based energy production, a substantial
reduction of the share of natural gas and a level participation of lignite
since 1970.

Among the largest and most important thermal power stations are the lignite
fired:  Turceni - 2.64 GW (under construction with Bank financing), Rovinari -
1.72 GW, Craiova - 0.98 GW, and Ludus - 0.80 GW; the oil and/or natural gas
fired:  Braila - 1.62 GW, and Borzesti - 0.65 GW; the carboniferous-shale fired:
Anina - 0.99 GW (one 330 MW unit each to be commissioned annually 1981-1983).
The largest unit sizes had been standardized and are in use at 220 MW and,
more recently, at 330 MW.



(c) Transmission System Growth
2.10      While until the 1960s the predominant transmission line voltage was
110 kV, the rapid growth of the system has required the doubling of the voltage
level each decade: to 220 kV during the 1960s and 400 kV, since 1970. Combined
with building up a substantial and meshed transmission network (Map 10830 RI),
this has greatly increased the reliability of electricity supply and decreased
the losses in transmission and distribution (para 2.12). The security of
electricity supply is, appropriately, one of the main concerns of the Romanian
power system planners and of the centrally directed national load dispatch
system which reports directly to the Minister. A modern national load dispatch
system (supplied by Siemens-West Germany) has recently been successfully
commissioned to increase the reliability of operation.
(d) International Interconnections
2.11      An important achievement, benefitting in growing degree the regional
(eastern European) economies, are the interconnections of the MEE power system
with the national systems of Romania's neighbors: with Bulgaria at 220 kV,
Yugoslavia at 110 kV 1/, Hungary at 400 kV (initially operating at 220 kV
since 1972) and Czechoslovakia at 400 kV 2/, with the latter through USSR
territory. (A 750-kV line also connects the Bulgarian with the USSR power
system across Romanian territory.)
(e) Electric Energy Savings
2.12      A major achievement of the subsector has been in energy conservation
through increased operating efficiency, resulting in some of the lowest energy
losses in electricity production (Annex 2.2) when compared to other European
countries of similar size and location of load centers in relation to main
generating areas.
(f) Access to Service and Rural Electrification
2.13      Romania has achieved a remarkable degree of electrification and
access to electricity service for its population in a relatively short time.
Urban areas are electrified 100% and villages about 93%. Residential annual
consumption per capita has more than doubled since 1970 (at 10.5% p.a.); in
the same period the disparity in rural/urban consumption has also been
drastically reduced (Annex 2.3). However, the residential per capita con-
sumption is still one of the lowest in the eastern European region. During
1977 it was about 222 kWh/yr when it ranged from 629 (Bulgaria) to 62 (Turkey)
1/   As a regional intertie, at the Iron-Gates I hydropower station.
2/   This 1965 connection tied the MEE system to the 400 kV Mukhacevo substa-
tion which in turn serves as tie for the systems of Hungary, Czechoslovakia
and USSR.



- 12 -
with 555 for Yugoslavia, 492 for Czechoslovakia, 447 for Greece, 375 for
Hungary, and 246 for Poland. In line with the general population ratio, about
half of the residential customers are rural. In 1978, only 5 counties (judets)
out of a total of 40 (including the Bucharest municipality) did not reach 88%
of village electrification indicating a very low regional dis-. arity in access
to electricity service. The major beneficiaries of the electrification
efforts by the subsector are industry and the fast growing Bank supported
agroindustry.
(g) Current Status of Subsector
2.14      In 1979, Romania's interconnected generating capacity was 15,087 MW;
3,192 MW in hydro and 11,089 MW in thermal plants belonging to MEE. The
balance, 806 MW, were chiefly captive thermal plants operated by isolated
autoproducers. System peak was 9,900 MW and total gross generation and
purchases 66,085 GWh. With 95% of the country's installed capacity inter-
connected, MEE plants generated 61,529 GWh and autoproducers 3,345 GWh.
Imports and exports amounted to 1,241 and 1,959 GWh, respectively. MEE sales
in 1979 were 51,884 GWh, an increase of only 2.25% over 1978 compared to an
average annual increase of 10.9% for 1970-76, 4.4% for 1976/77 and 6.1% for
1977/78. Based on national planning targets which take into account energy
conservation and efficiency improvement efforts, average annual load growth up
to 1985 was expected in 1978 to be 6.1% and is now expected to be around
5.o%.
E. Subsector Policy and Strategy
2.15      Since 1950 the Government's electrification planning has had two
main objectives:
(a) to increase domestic primary energy production (since
1975 primarily of coal and hydropower) for meeting the
rapidly growing industrial requirements for electrical
energy, through a national electrification program; and
(b) to develop an energy infrastructure in terms of personnel,
research, study and design institutes and enterprises
to exploit national energy resources.
MEE has succeeded in implementing this basic policy in the framework of
national energy policy (para 1.09). During the 1981-1985 FYP MEE aims
specifically, through its investment program (para 5.02), to
(i) Widen its primary energy resource base by:
- increasing the use of hydropower on national
rivers and on the Danube;
- undertaking the construction of small and mini hydro-
power plants on the swift flowing mountain rivers;



- 13 -
- increasing the use of solid fuels (lignite,
carboniferous and bituminous shale, brown coal)
not well suited for other uses; and
- constructing nuclear power plants.
(ii) Continue the vigorous energy and cost savings program by:
- increasing the recapture and sale of waste heat and
by expanding co-generation facilities;
- further reduction of transmission and distribution
losses;
- concerted reduction of the use of oil and gas in
electrical energy and heat production;
- increasing thermal efficiencies of plant producing and
transporting heat for supply to industry and municipal
systems;
- reducing the consumption of energy intensive mate-
rials in construction and equipment for subsector
expansion using most modern technologies;
- optimally locating new plant in relation to load and
primary energy resource; and
- reducing energy use in power station auxiliaries.
(iii) Improve the subsector's institutions by:
- better organization and more effective operation of the
national interconnected system; and
- transfer of technology.
(iv) Prepare for future application of non-conventional energy
sources by:
- systematic study of the economic application of
solar, wind, biomass and ocean energy.
The above policy and strategy is very comprehensive and will strain MEE's
human and material resources.

F. Planning of Power and Heat Supply
2.16      The expansion planning for electricity and heat supply is carried
out under th_ overall responsibility of the Planning and Development Department
of the MEE. It assigns, contracts, and directs the more detailed studies and
work, undertaken on its behalf, by the specialized research, planning, design
and engineering institutes (Central Research Institute, ICEMENERG, ISPE,
ISPH). This planning activity is efficiently carried out and has produced
very good results, considering the material and equipment supply constraints
existing in the country at times. The specifics of the current planning and
its methodology are not available. However, MEE has used mathematical model-
ling techniques for more than 10 years, including computer programs, which it
has developed and which are geared to arrive at a development program based on
using the least mateLial resources combined with least financial costs. The
approach complies with the national energy policy objectives (para 1.09) which
emphasizes the use of domestically produced lignite, and also places limits on
the import of oil and gas, and provides for the development of nuclear power
on a long term basis.
2.17      The planning for the subsector is carefully coordinated with
the country's central plan preparation 1/ for the FYPs, the mid-term FYP
update and the annual budget setting exercise. Taking into account the very
high incidence of industrial load, MEE has established and follows appropriately
conservative criteria for planning system reserves, reliability, security and
performance. MEE participates in the elaboration of five-year and longer term
plans, in the drafting of the FYP directives and the establishment of the
Annual Plan. Within the bounds of the November 1979 approved general directives
MEE is now finalizing, for early 1981 approval, the plans for the subsector
for the 1981-1985 FYP. Because of the long lead time required for most power
projects about 90% of the subsector investment program (para 5.02), to
be implemented by the two Centrals, has been approved already under the
revised FYP (1976-1980) and the plan for 1981.
G. Tariff Levels and Structure
2.18      Tariffs for electricity and heat are subject to regulation by the
State Committee of Prices (SCP); they are approved by the Council of Ministers
and are uniform-throughout the country. The principal functions of prices in
Romania are stated in Law No. 19 on Prices and Tariffs of 1971, updated
January 1, 1977. Prices are only one of the instruments for planning and
1/   An extensive treatment on this subject is provided in Chapter III of
Report No. 1601-RO referred to in the footnote on page 1.



implementing development objectives 1/. They are established at fixed levels
or narrow ranges. Resources for development are allocated to a large extent
on the basis of physical indicators and quotas and--under the "New Economic
Measures"--increasingly, by indicators of value. The Government maintains as
stable a level of prices as possible; each FYP contains a target for the
maximum permissible increase, the fulfillment of which is the responsibility
of the Council of Ministers, the SCP, and the People's Councils. Since 1977,
electricity and heat tariffs have been set to reflect not more than the cost
of supply and a margin for specified purposes. These low level electricity
and heat prices allow the agricultural, industrial and manufacturing enter-
prises to increase their profits which are then taxed at the end of the
chain. For this reason, the subsector's tariffs and financial performance
(paras 6.01-6.04) cannot be viewed in isolation from the rest of the economy.
However, these tariffs are being reviewed presently in connection with the
finalization of the 1981-1985 FYP. During negotiations, the Romanian delega-
tion stated that the modifications envisaged are likely to result in substantial
tariff increases (possibly 40% for power and 55% for heat).
2.19      In the revenue earning enterprises the disposition of their surpluses,
under the "New Economic Measures", is in the following order of paying:
(i) to the respective Industrial Central, up to 10% of annual surplus,
to reimburse investment funds previously received;
(ii)  to the enterprise's own economic development fund;
(iii) to the productive working fund (working capital fund);
(iv)  to the fund for workers' housing and other social investment;
(v)  to the participation of working people in profits;
(vi)  to the social and cultural fund; and
(vii) to the State Budget.
Electricity costs are tightly controlled and have been virtually unchanged
since 1974 in terms of cost per unit sold. Savings, through increased
efficiency, have been a major factor in holding down cost increases.
2.20      While tariffs produce only a small margin over operating and
administration costs, they provide a reasonable portion of future investment
needs (para 6.03). The tariff structure for electricity includes time-of-day
rates, differential peak and off-peak demand and energy charges and other
1/   See Chapter IV of Report No. 1601-RO, referred to in the footnote on
page 1, for an extensive discussion of the pricing system.



- 16 -
elements of marginal cost pricing conducive to economically efficient alloca-
tion of resources. To control electricity consumption, penalties amounting up
to 200% of the normal bill are imposed on those who exceed their planned
electricity allocation. It has not been possible to establisb that the
tariff structure reflects the marginal cost of supply 1!. in che absence of a
comprehensive study of tariffs and of actual and planned system component
costs in Romania for the power and heat subsector. However, the elements of
the tariffs, the quota system and the penalties imposed for excessive use
contribute to the efficient use of electrical energy.
H. Subsector Performance and Issues
2.21      Clearly, the electrical energy-heat subsector expansion has been
handled by the country's planners and authorities astutely. In contrast to a
remarkable growth performance in the past in all areas of the subsector, the
present trends point to a slowing down of growth, in part a sign of maturing of
the economy and also of coming saturation of industrial demand for electricity,
as ought to be expected. Remarkable are the very high annual load factors
(for a country with cold winters and a continental climate) and the consequently
higher than normal capacity reserves needed; nevertheless, an acceptable level
for the use of the capacity is achieved.
2.22      The country's subsector planners seem to have anticipated the
current world-wide energy problems before they developed and initiated the
concerted early national action in a direction now increasingly taken by other
national economies, that is:
(a) conservation by increasing efficiency and reducing losses;
(b) optimal use of economies of scale by appropriate sizing of
generating units for the right primary energy type and of
system interconnections, taking advantage of load diversity
and raising the load factor;
(c) coordination of generation and industrial plant expansion and
location; and
(d) extensive use of co-generation and use of waste heat from
industrial processes (e.g. coking gas) and using more abun-
dant primary energy sources (lignite).
1/   On July 31, 1979 the Government instituted a new, progressive tariff
structure, but only for domestic consumers as part of its energy con-
servation. The impact is still being evaluated.

The very rapid growth of the Romanian power system over the last decade has
strained the staff of the enterprises which appears to be capable and experi-
enced and competently exercises delegated authority and responsibility. There
have been consistent productivity gains also in the past decade, reflecting
the general growth of economies of scale in the sector and increasing effi-
ciency. The design institutes and the construction trusts of the MEE have
gained substantial experience as shown by their proven performance record on
projects in Romania and many other countries.
2.23      The main subsector issues are that major technical modernization
will be needed in the longer term in power plant control and automation.
Other technological advances could cover such areas as updating the design of
lignite and shale fired thermal generation, distribution and transmission
equipment, study of the availability and use oi geothermal resources (if not
for power, then for heat), and design and production of equipment for efficient
low cost small hydro plants. Because of the advance in the capability of the
subsector, foreign consultin'.g knowhow is not used in subsector planning,
design, engineering, procurement, implementation of expansion, testing,
commissioning and operation. H1owever, in view of the FYP program to update
Romanian technology, MEE, in cou-junction with national research and engineering
institutions, is developing a plan for learning about the most modern methods
used in other countries in such anJ other sector activities. These plans are
not sufficiently advanced to be considered for Bank financing. The amount of
foreign exchange needed for the techn-logy transfer for the subsector is not
significant; less than US$200,000 had been indicated during negotiations.
I. Role of the Bank in Subsector
2.24      The Bank has made three loans for power in Romania:  (i) the Turceni
Thermal Power Project - Stage I, with 1,320 MW and associated transmission
(Loan 1028-RO of US$60 million on July 5, 1974); (ii) the Riul Mare-Retezat
Hydropower Project, with 355 MW at Retezat and 14 MW at downstream Clopotiva
and associated transmission system (Loan 1242-RO of US$50 million on July 13,
1976); and (iii) the Turceni Stage II doubling the capacity (Loan 1652-RO of
US$70 million on January 11, 1979). None of the above projects has been
completed, although Loan 1028-RO was closed on June 30, 1979.
2.25      The status of project execution for the above three projects is as
follows: Turceni Stage I: Unit No. 1 was started up in June 1978 and commis-
sioned in December,  unit No. 2 in the first quatter of 1980, and units No. 3
and 4 are scheduled for commissioning by 1981. The estimated 15-month delay
is due to skilled labor shortage and late deli-veries of equipment. Riul
Mare-Retezat:  The Project, about 37% complete, is about 12 months behind
schedule mainly due to the chronic lack of tunneling manpower. Works at the
rock quarry and the earth dam core have been delayed also by heavy rains and
severe winters. Some geologic problems had led to substantial water infiltra-
tions in the pressure gallery. A tunnel boring machine was ordered December
1978; late delivery delayed the full operation to mid-1980. Combined effort
of this machine with conventional tunneling should help avoid further delays.
The bulk of the Bank financed procurement has been completed and disbursements



- 18 -
are relatively close to appraisal estimates. Turceni Stage II: Design
engineering and construction of the second stage is proceeding immediately
following the first stage. Contracts have been awarded for about 97% of the
goods being financed from the loan. The project is expected to be delayed by
about 15 mon_hts on account of delays in the first stage.
2.26      The Bank's assistance to the subsector is relatively modest 1/
as lending is to a relatively sophisticated sector:
(a) it is one more means to meet the general objective of providing
convertible currency transfer to Romania;
(b) it has played and will continue to play a role in introducing
the sector's associated supply industries to international
competition and International Competitive Bidding (ICB);
(c) it has helped and should continue to help transfer up-to-date
technology; and
(d) it has made and, in connection with the preparation of further
projects, should continue to make a useful contribution to planning
by inducing Romania to modernize its system expansion planning by
the use of modern computer programs.
2.27      MEE has expressed an interest in expanding its analytical and
planning capability and has requested access to the latest WASP 2/ (III)
computer program from the IAEA 3/ in Vienna. The Bank plans to continue its
dialogue with MEE on improving computerized subsector expansion planning as
part of the preparation of the next power project for possible Bank financing.
III. THE BORROWER AND PROJECT ENTITIES
A.  Investment Bank (IB) - The Borrower
3.01      The Borrower for the proposed loan would be the Investment Bank
(IB). The loan would be guaranteed by the Republic of Romania. The IB is
1/   Bank financing, including the proposed loan, represents approximately
6% of Project requirements during the period July 1, 1980-June 30, 1983
(see para 6.05).

the specialized agency, under the Ministry of Finance, for dealing with
investment projects in all sectors of the economy except agriculture and food
processing. IB has staff for dealing with technical and economic matters at
its headquarters and its branch offices in all districts of the country. The
IB's involvement in investment projects begins in the preparation phase of a
project; its staff appraises all major investment projects technically and
financially according to Romanian norms. All investment funds for an approved
project are channeled through the IB. Projects up to 30 million lei are
approved by the Centrals; projects between 30 and 70 million lei by the
MEE; projects above 70 million lei by the State Council. IB authorizes
all payments for the execution of a project in accordance with the approved
plan. It is IB's obligation to ensure that a project is executed according to
the financial and technical data and indicators included in the final technical
and economic study (Project de Executie) as approved. IB's inspectors supervise
the projects to ensure progress according to the approved schedule.
B. Project Entities
(a) Ministry of Electrical Energy - (MEE)
3.02      MEE's direct dependency (DEN) 1/, its two Centrals, CIPEET and CIRE,
and its Trust for the Construction of Hydropower Projects (TCH) would be the
project entities for the proposed project (para 5.03). Only some of the
enterprises of CIPEET and CIRE would be the final beneficiaries. MEE and
its Centrals are expected to be able to administer the loan proceeds and
related procurement competently, based on the Bank's experience with its
previous three loans. The loan documents with the Borrower provide for an
undertaking to enable the Bank to carry on a direct dialogue at the respective
technical and financial staff levels of MEE, the above project entities, the
ultimate beneficiary enterprises, and the other units participating in the
proposed project.
(b) National Electrical Energy Dispatch System - (DEN 1/)
3.03      DEN--reporting directly to the Minister of the MEE and organized
hierarchically (Chart 3.1) by levels of responsibility and authority--effi-
ciently and effectively controls and supervises ("on-line" since about mid-1979)
the national interconnected system of CIRE, its connections to neighboring
country systems, and the operation and production of electricity by the CIPEET
enterprises. The national center in Bucharest controls five regional dispatch-
ing centers. DEN has a computer system and a teleinformation system for the
dispatch function. While the system is adequate for the near term, DEN plans
to study the adoption of a new system for the late 1980s in view of the
limited expandability, capacity and dated technology of the current facility.

(c) Industrial Central for the Production of Electrical Energy and Heat -
(CIPEET 1
3.04      CIPEET is competently managed and, as one of the tw- MEE Centrals
(para 2.03), controls and coordinates the activities of (a) its electricity
and heat producing enterprises; and (b) its enterprise for capital and other
repairs. The latter manufactures the machinery needed by the former for
maintenance and repairs, and almost all necessary spare parts. CIPEET has
also a centrally coordinated organization for the use by the enterprises for
installations and repairs needed in connection with normal and forced mainte-
nance and not carried out by MEE's specialized entities. The producer enter-
prises of CIPEET are organized along the lines of CIPEET itself (Chart 3.2)
and are headed by their Assembly of the Working People (generally meeting
twice a year) and managed by a Working Peoples Council and the Council's
Bureau (functioning as an Operating Management Committee). The producer
enterprises are charged directly with responsibility for:
(a) production of electrical energy as ordered by DEN, and
of heat, and according to contracts concluded with their
customers (e.g., industries, local governments);
(b) maintenance and repairs of facilities under their control;
(c) saving of energy and fuel according to conservation plans;
(d) expansion of their facilities through investments;
(e) meeting their technical and financial/economic plan
targets; and
(f) recruiting, selecting and training of employees to operate
and repair facilities under their control.
(d)  Industrial Central of Power Network Enterprises - (CIRE2)
3.05      CIRE (Chart 3.3) competently controls and coordinates the 17 trans-
mission and distribution enterprises--IREs 3/--which usually provide services
in several counties. The IREs have specialized organizations for the trans-
mission and distribution for (a) design (up to 110 kV) and construction of
transmission and distribution facilities 4/; and (b) operation and maintenance

of substations and transmission lines. The transmission and distribution
enterprises' internal organization and functional responsibilities follow
closely those described for the producer enterprises, except that:
(a) all their operational activities are under the control of
the DEN system;
(b) they control the delivery of electricity according to contracts
concluded and quotas assigned; and
(c) they carry out the design and layout of transmission and distribu-
tion lines which are implemented by their own construction units.
(e) Trust for the Construction of Hydro Power Projects (TCH)
3.06      TCH, an organization within MEE, was established in 1950.  It has
built more than 3,000 MW of installed hydropower capacity. Its scope of work
covers the full range of civil engineering of hydropower facilities (construc-
tion of dams, tunnels, underground and surface power houses). During the next
5 years TCH is expected to install an additional 3,000 MW of hydropower and
almost double its work force of 27,000. TCH has a shortage of large capacity
construction equipment (including that required for earth moving and tunneling)
which will be accentuated by this large program. This shortage and of materials,
such as reinforcing steel, bitumen and special cement for dam construction
have contributed to construction delays in the past. The proposed loan
provides financing for some of the heavy equipment and materials, and TCH is,
therefore, included as a project entity.
(f) Staff Training Facilities
3.07      The high level of professional competency in the subsector is the
direct result of a long range approach and program for preparing all staff and
workers for the increasingly sophisticated requirements of the Romanian power
and heat networks. While direct contacts of professionals with advanced
western power technologies remain limited, local professional skill is
periodically updated at the MEE Professional Staff Training Facilities with a
center in Bucharest and branches throughout the country. This training
concentrates on staff with experience, but additional facilities exist in the
technical institutes at university level.
3.08      In addition, 18 specialized industrial schools under MEE train
workers, foremen and technical staff in the special skills needed by the
CIPEET and CIRE enterprises and the trusts and enterprises of MEE for the
construction and operation of facilities. This training is reinforced through
training provided by the enterprises in courses and on the job.

IV. THE DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY AND HEAT AND MEANS OF MEETING IT
A. Planning and Forecasting
4.01      Planning and forecasting are the responsibility of MEE's Planning
and Development Department. Its specialized agency, ISPE, has mathematical
models for the study of the economic development of the power system e.g.
system demand forecasting, analysis of plant reserve margins and optimization
of development (para 2.16). The models are based on techniques as used in
other countries having power systems of similar complexity. The results of
the MEE planning are shown in Annex 4.1 which summarizes the generating
capacity, energy production, peak load and load factor for 1976-1985;
Annex 4.2--sector generation and sales for 1972-1985 maximum annual peak load
periods; Annexes 4.3 and 4.4--planned generation reserve for end and mid-year
peak load during 1980-1985; and Annex 4.5--MEE's interconnected system--planned
net capacity additions to 1985.
B. Load Growth Forecast
4.02      The annual growth of electricity sales during 1960-1970 was rapid at
some 16%; during 1970-1975 it fell to about 9.4% on average; and after 1975
it was still lower at about 6.4% because of the impact of the energy saving
measures enforced since November 1973 and for the reasons stated in para 2.22.
In the Romanian system, the estimates of future requirements are derived from
statistical trend analysis, analysis of the electrical energy requirements to
achieve the industrial targets for the next FYP period, and the socio-economic
indicators for the period considered. This has led to the judgment that, on
average, the 1981-1985 annual growth would be 5.3% for electricity sales and
4.7% for electricity production (the latter being lower due to change in
generation mix). However, load growth is not uniform, slowing down somewhat
midway through the FYP period. The forecast is shown in Annex 4.2; it
may well be on the low side overall.
C. Power and Electrical Energy Balances
4.03      The power sector development program (para 5.02) as prepared by MEE
and its institutes would meet the predicted load. They use data supplied by
the generating, transmission and distribution enterprises of CIPEET and CIRE.
The expansion plans are closely coordinated with the FYPs and reviewed annually.
As shown in Annexes 4.3 and 4.4 the system reserve capacity during annual peak
in 1981 will be 37.2% and reduce to about 27.0% in 1985; during mid-year peak
load in 1982 it will rise to 44.1% and reduce to about 38.8% in 1985. While
these reserves are on the high side, being the result of planning for higher
load growths and the addition of co-generation plant based on burning indigenous



- 23 -
coal, the reserves would reach more normal levels should the rate of develop-
ment of electrical energy consumption exceed the relatively low growth assump-
tions or the construction program be delayed which could happen in the early
years of the 1981-1985 FYP.
4.04      The construction program through 1985 would provide for maximum
utilization of indigenous lignite and hydro resources. By 1985 lignite
fuelled plant will annually consume about 62.6 Mt. With the exception of the
Danube river schemes (about 1,670 MW by 1985) the hydro power additions are
best suited to meet the system demand during peak load periods.
D. Heat Supply
4.05      MEE's sale of heat earns about 10% of revenues in the subsector.
Total MEE heat production grew at about 6.3% p.a. during 1975-1979. During
1981-1985 it is expected to increase at about 7.0% p.a. (Annex 6.1). The heat
supply, now predominantly from gas and oil burning plants, would be provided
in the future by the new co-generating plants burning lignite and/or coal
coming on line in the next FYP period. The existing gas and oil burning
plants would provide a standby reserve for unforeseen peak demands (e.g.
during cold winters), outages and other contingencies.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
5.01      The proposed project is a time-slice 1/ of the investment program of
CIPEET, CIRE and DEN (para 7.01) representing the July 1, 1980 to June 30,
1983 period. The project would include all power and heat subsector investment
consisting of the facilities for which financing and procurement commitments
would be made in that time-slice period. Its objective is to provide the
facilities for the production and supply of electrical energy and heat, as
required for the Romanian economy under the 1981-1985 FYP. The major aim will
be to help implement the subsector policy and strategy set out in detail in
paras. 2.15 (i) to (iv), i.e. (i) widen the use of the primary resource base;
(ii) continue energy conservation efforts; and (iii) improve subsector institu-
tions. This would be the first loan of such nature to Romania; hopefully it
would improve the dialogue with the subsector institutions and the Government
on the future energy development plans with a view to identifying suitable
future projects.
11   The proposed Bank loan would finance only items for which contracts
are awarded during the time-slice--for projects ongoing or to be started
in the time-slice period--and would exclude the facilities under construc-
tion in Turceni Stages I and II and at Riul Mare-Retezat.

B. The 1980-1985 Subsector Program
5.02      The list of individual projects in the program is impressive.  In
addition to some 80 MW in 7 small hydro plants (of 1 MW to 25 .±W) the program
can be summed up as follows:

C. Project Description
5.03      The Project comprises:
The tranche of the MEE investments in the time-slice period
(para 5.01) in:
(i) hydroelectric power plants;
(ii)  thermal plants for production of electrical energy and heat;
(iii)  heat transport and distribution;
(iv)  high voltage transmission lines and substations;
(v) medium and low-voltage networks;
(vi)  heavy construction equipment for the subsector; and
(vii)  other items, such as special automation equipment and instrumen-
tation for power system operation and control.

D. Engineering and Status of Project Elements
5.04       MEE's design institutes and other dependencies have capably prepared
internally the detailed planning, economic and other studies; designs;
and engineering of the project. Their specific responsibilities, described
in Annex 2.1, are expected to continue during the proposed Project. According
to MEE supplied information, over 93% of the total list of projects (para
5.02) is at the "Project de Executie" 1/ level of preparation (corresponding
to about 90% of the investment).  The rest of the large list of projects in
the program is at least at feasibility level. MEE's monitoring of them is
mainly based on technical and economic indicators (Annex 5.4) which are a
large list of specific parameters to be achieved by and in the final design of
the equipment and complete works of each project. IB has supplied a selected
number of such indicators and has agreed to supply the balance of such indi-
cators in the first semiannual project progress report for the more important
power plant projects included in the program to 1985 and approved after field
appraisal. For the remaining project, not yet authorized, the relevant
indicators will be submitted as soon as approved. These indicators and those
in Annex 5.4 will be used by the Bank to monitor the progress of the proposed
Project.
E. Cost Estimates
(a) Program (1980-1985)
5.05       Investments of CIPEET, CIRE and DEN (Annex 5.1) represent the
bulk of MEE investments during 1980-1985 and would amount to about US$6,666
million equivalent (using 18 lei/US$ 2/) including about US$1,279 million of
foreign cost. These estimates are low but reasonable as they exclude the
multibillion dollar nuclear program and also the investments of all the
other parts of the MEE active in the power sector, such as research, planning,
design, engineering, construction, erection, tooling, procurement, warehousing,
and training. The program cost estimate was computed by MEE from detailed cost
estimates which were prepared in connection with the approval of each indi-
vidual Project de Executie included in the Plan and the feasibility studies
1/   Corresponds to about bid level design.
2/   Appraisal estimates have been made at the 18 lei/$ exchange rate.  During
negotiations, the Romanian delegation was not able to confirm that the
exchange rate would be changed from 18 to 15 lei/$ on January 1, 1981.
Subsequently, the Bank was officially informed that such change will be
made and the Romanian equalization fund abolished as of January 1, 1981.
The estimate of foreign cost in equivalent $ is not affected by the new
rate. Other effects from the change are minor. They would reduce the
total cost estimate in equivalent lei marginally by about 4.5%, have a
somewhat favorable effect on cash generation and improve the return on
investment by about 0.4%.



- 26 -
for the rest of the projects in the program. For the plant constructed after
1979, the capital costs for hydro-electric stations range from US$606/kW for
an 8-MW run of river plant to US$1,700/kW for a storage type plant with a
large reservoir (median cost is US$1,300/kW); for steam electric stations
the range i-: US$430/kW to US$550/kW (median US$470/kW) for a lignite-fired
straight condensing plant and US$830/kW to US$1,050/kW (median US$900/kW) for
a lignite-fired heat and power producing plant. For the same period the costs
of single-circuit transmission lines range from about US$72,500/km to
US$132,000/km (median US$117,000/km) for 400 kV lines; and from US$46,000/km
to US$104,000/km (median US$65,000/km) for 220 kV. The specific investment
for substations ranges from US$7.50/kVA to US$15.50/kVA (median US$12.00/kVA)
for 400 kV; and US$8.00/kVA to US$11.00/kVA (median US$9.00/kVA). The above
estimates are based on prices from Romanian suppliers. While realistic, when
compared with similar plant costs in south-eastern Europe, they are--on
average--on the low side compared with costs in other developing countries or
in central Europe. The projected expenditures for distribution (medium
and low voltage networks), while low in terms of total investment, appear
appropriate considering that the industrial loads are supplied at high voltage
and the residential and commercial loads represent only about 25% of total
consumption.
(b) Project (mid 1980-mid 1983)
5.06     The cost of the time slice of the subsector investment would be about
US$3,193 million. The summary of the cost estimate (prepared by MEE), by
major investment groups, is:

The underlying cost estimate for the sector investment for the January 1, 1980
- December 31, 1985 period is shown in Annex 5.2. It is reasonable and based
on Romanian internal prices. The above subtotal includes physical contingen-
cies as they had been included in the project costs at feasibility and Project

de Executie level estimates. An allowance of 5 to 8% is built into MEE's
estimates in accordance with Romanian practice and legislation; it appears
reasonable in view of the advanced preparation (at "Executie" level) of
projects before the Government approves them for inclusion in the Five-Year-Pa.
and for implementation. Price contingencies are not included in MEE's
estimates, they are assumed above for local costs at an annual 1% during the
period shown, and for foreign cost at 10.5% for 1980; 9.0% for 1981; 8.0%
for 1982; and 7.0% for 1983; on this basis they were estimated overall at 6%
(21.7% on foreign and 2.3% on local costs).
5.07     The estimated foreign expenditures, US$703.4 million, cover the cost
of direct imports, the foreign exchange content of local supplies and the price
contingency. The proposed loan, combined with the remaining anticipated
disbursements under Loan 1242-RO and 1652-RO, would finance about 27% of the
above foreign exchange required and only about 6% of the total costs of the
mid-1980-mid-1983 program. The foreign exchange cost was estimated to consist
(on the basis of typical plant costs, including of Turceni and Riul Mare-Retezat)
of directly imported items; imported components incorporated into Romanian
manufactured equipment; indirect foreign exchange expenditure equivalent to
the depreciation of imported manufacturing and construction equipment used by
Romanian suppliers of goods and works for the supply to the construction
program of MEE; fuels and lubricants used in construction; and materials such
as reinforcing steel and bitumen for which Romania is a net importer. However,
the financial forecasts (Annex 6) are based on the costs for the goods and
services in local currency which are fixed and controlled by the State Pricing
Committee, with the price escalation on the imported components and materials
of the Romanian manufacturers being absorbed by other than MEE under the
Romanian pricing system. In the financial forecast, therefore, the costs
without price contingencies are used.
F. Financing
5.08       A detailed financing plan is shown in para 6.05.  The local costs
of the program are expected to be met out of the cash generation of the
electric power enterprises, loans from the IB and the State Budget. At the
present time, the only known external sources of foreign exchange would be the
proposed IBRD loan of US$125 million and about US$63 million expected to be
disbursed from previous Bank loans during the program period. Together, these
amount to 27% of the estimated foreign exchange cost of US$703.4 million. 1/
The indirect foreign exchange costs of local supplies represent the bulk of
the US$703.4 million. IB has agreed that the project is suitable for
(commercial bank) co-financing and proposes to seek co-financing, if necessary,
1/   While the impact of the proposed Project on the foreign exchange require-
ments would be US$703.4 million, the financial analysis is based on the
expected foreign exchange financial needs of US$578 million for the
Project by MEE, CIPEET, CIRE and DEN. The difference had been assumed
to be absorbed mainly by the Romanian equalization fund.



- 28 -
to the extent required for carrying out of the project. In any event,
the Government is obligated to provide the balance of the foreign exchange
needed for the investment program, since, as indicated in para 6.06, the
guarantee agreement, as usual, requires the Government to mak- the necessary
funds available. The IBRD loan is, however, not conditional on the conclusion
of co-financing arrangements, which, as in other lending operations with
Romania, could follow signature of the Bank loan. The Romanians have been
informed that the Bank would be willing to amend the loan agreement and
exchange the normal memorandum with co-financiers on the normal cross default
clause if it would be of assistance to obtain co-financing.
G. Implementation
(a) Responsibility for Program/Project Implementation
5.09      In MEE the technical project administration (design, engineering,
execution) is assigned, according to their specific function and activity, to
ISPE, ISPH, ROMELECTRO (for imports), CIPEET, CIRE, DEN, and the individual
enterprise which, in the end, will operate the new facilities. Foreign
consultants are only used to the degree urgent transfer of recent technology
requires. The MEE organization is capable of organizing rationally and
adequately all necessary activities to carry out the proposed project. In
light of the multitude of projects and of their status (para 5.02) it is not
practicable to show a meaningful estimated implementation schedule.
(b) Procurement
5.10      The proceeds of the proposed loan would finance the items in the
agreed List of Goods (Annex 5.3) estimated to amount to US$125 million. The
estimate is based on a List proposed by IB/MEE, of suitable items amounting to
US$160 million for procurement under a reasonable timetable. All equipment
and materials listed in Annex 5.3 would be subject to ICB 1/ except as noted
below. The items would be grouped to form sizable bid packages for bulk
procurement to the degree possible. Repetitive items may be bid once under an
annual delivery program. Minor quantities of shelf items or standard equipment
could be procured under "international shopping" after inviting and receiving
quotations from at least 3 foreign suppliers. The aggregate amount of
contracts to be awarded under such shopping will not exceed US$1,250,000
and, unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, each such shopping will not exceed
US$200,000. For purposes of bid comparison, a preference limited to 15% of the
c.i.f. price of imported goods, or the customs duty, whichever is lower, would
be extended to Romanian manufacturers.
5.11      The total cost of items not produced in Romania and proposed by
IB/MEE to be financed by the proceeds from the proposed loan as direct imports
under ICB, amounts to about US$4.1 million equivalent (or 3.3% of the loan).
1/   "ICB" stands for International Competitive Bidding fully consistent with
Part A and, as applicable, with Part B of the Bank's latest "Guidelines
for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits".



- 29 -
This amount excludes the directly imported items amounting to about US$5.3 mil-
lion already Bank-financed under the Turceni and Riul Mare-Retezat projects
still under construction during the execution of the proposed project and
recently ordered items amounting to about US$2.7 million. The total of
US$12.1 million corresponds to about 1.7% of the estimated foreign cost
requirements of the time-slice of the program. This reflects an expectation
that direct financing of imports by the proposed loan will not be substantially
different from the ICB procurement experience gained under the Turceni II and
Riul Mare-Retezat projects. Because of the capability and the competitive
prices expected to be tendered by the Romanian manufacturers and suppliers,
direct local participation in the supply of equipment materials and civil
works is expected to amount to about 96% of all investment under the project.
About 10% of the heavy equipment for civil works construction (excavators,
crawler and wheel tractors) may also result in imports after ICB.
H. Disbursements
5.12      The proceeds of the proposed loan amount of US$125 million would be
disbursed as follows:
US$ Million                 % of
Category                   Equivalent               Expenditures
(a)  Equipment for hydro and            48.1              100% of foreign and ex-
thermal power stations and                           factory local
the transmission system
(b)  Equipment for civil works          30.0              100% of foreign and
(for construction of                                 of ex-factory local
hydropower facilities)
(c)  Construction materials /1          46.9              100% of foreign and ex-
factory local
Total                             125.0
/1   Materials and supplies would be only those for which Romania is a net
importer (reinforcing steel and bitumen).
Based on these allocations and the agreed List of Goods, disbursements are
estimated as shown in Annex 5.5.
5.13      The proposed loan closing would be June 30, 1984, one year after the
time-slice period, to allow for payment of retention moneys.

I. Environmental Aspects
5.14      Tbh  strategy of reducing the use of domestic and imported oil and
domestic natural gas in thermal power stations and expanding production of
hydro-electricity and use of low grade solid fuels is likely to have adverse
environmental consequences. Atmospheric pollution in Romania is accentuated
by the frequent temperature inversions experienced, especially in the Danube
basin. Fortunately the lignite to be used increasingly in the power stations
contains low free sulfur (around 0.3%,and in Turceni 0.5%). Fly ash emission
will be controlled by electrostatic precipitators having a 99% efficiency.
Most of the lignite is open-cast mined, resulting in the temporary loss of
agricultural land. The reservoirs for the hydro-power will also inundate
agricultural land.
5.15      On the other hand, the Romanian legislation to provide environmental
protection, which was promulgated as Law No. 9 on June 20, 1973, is compre-
hensive. It defines the responsibilities of the various departments of the
Government; obliges the Ministry of Health to establish hygienic norms" for
concentrations of pollutants; provides for measures to limit atmospheric
pollution and obliges agencies which withdraw land from agriculture or forestry
temporarily (as in open-cast mining) to restore it to its original condition.
In line with this legislation, measures continue to be taken to reduce the
environmental impact from power stations. High smoke stacks and electrostatic
precipitators are being installed at power stations to reduce the concentration
of pollution to levels corresponding to the legislated standards. In addition,
cogeneration of heat and electric power at MEE thermal stations reduces use of
solid fuels for heat production. Furthermore, the directives for the imple-
mentation of the 1981-85 Five Year Plan call for strict observance of the
admissible limits in processes which produce pollutants. A member of the Office
of Environmental Affairs (OEA), after discussions in Bucharest, visited the
Mintia (Deva) power plant, as well as several pollution monitoring stations.
Romania has now 40 such stations including 3 in Bucharest. Their records show
that S02 and particulates- concentrations are well below Bank guideline and
maximum allowable limits set in the Romanian standards. In the Turceni case,
the S02 concentrations vary between 5xlO   g/m  (most of the time) and
30xlO   g/m  (once) as measured by the monitoring station at the closest town.
Most of the S02 observed is probably due to domestic heating. As Turceni,
after completion, will burn 22 million tons lignite per year, the future
emissions have been modelled based on actual Mintia conditions. The results
show that all emissions will still be well below Romanian and Bank limits.
5.16      The monitoring of pollutant and enforcing of Romania standards are
the responsibility of two institutes. The first one, IMH (Institute for
Meteorology and Hydrology) is in charge of 6 monitoring stations dealing with
the general Romanian conditions and located far away from cities. The results
are regularly communicated to WHO (the World Health Organization). The second
one, IHPH (Institute for Hygiene and Public Health) monitor the other stations
and control industrial pollution at the emission sites. Their findings are



- 31 -
sent regularly to WHO and UNEP (the United Nations Environmental Program).
They monitor not only S02 and particulates, but also NOx, acid rain, and, for
certain locations, heavy metals and other toxicants. The equipment in the
stations and in the institutes is up to date and well kept and the personnel
well versed in physical and chemical methods of analysis as well as environmen-
tal and pollution control. The institutes are ready and willing to supply the
Bank with their results on a trimester or semester basis. The Borrower has
agreed to supply the Bank recorded pollution monitoring data, regarding
emissions of S02 and particulates from the facilities included in the project
at the facility sites and at the surrounding areas.
J. Project Risks and Uncertainties
5.17       For the proposed time-slice project, physical risks in the execution
of the individual projects are similar to those of the ongoing Bank financed
projects; the subsector has a demonstrated capability to cope with them.
However, because of the large size of the projected expansion to switch
thermal generation from the oil/gas to a lignite/shale base (and after
1985--increasingly to nuclear) it is uncertain that the Plan targets (on which
the appraisal is based) will be fully met. Delays in increasing coal supply
and completing the hydropower plants on time could lead to a temporary higher
use (a) of gas and reactivation of power plants normally to be in standby and
also (b) of imported coal in new coal burning plants. This delay would bring
with it a reduction in the proxy for the rate of return, but probably not down
to the 4.5% level discussed in para 7.08. The situation would be aggravated
should the load forecast for the period prove to be on the low side. In view
of the close monitoring of progress on projects, the Borrower and MEE are
expected to make timely and specific provisions to cope with these risks. For
the longer term, the target of the Government s program to reach energy
self-sufficiency in 1990 will depend on (a) fully implementing the nuclear
program and (b) further expansion of the lignite and shale supply. A comparison
of targets set for both in the past and actual results indicates that the
target may not be fully reached.
5.18       A load growth in 1980-1981 lower than projected would not have a
very substantial financial impact (Annex 6), particulary if the construction
program should be delayed somewhat. Both events are most likely to occur,
particularly in view of the Government's current reassessment of the energy
consumption and energy savings efforts, and the tightening of measures
to arrest the worsening balance of payment situation by a further reduction of
imports, including of those needed for manufacturing equipment and machinery
for the program.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Past Financial Performance
6.01      With electricity tariffs set as described in paragraph 2.18, their
role as a signal to the consumers or in the allocation of funds is less
important than in other countries, and the financial rate of return of the
subsector is predictably low (between 1% and 3%--see Income Statements for
1977-1985 in Annex 6.1 and Notes to the Financial Statements in Annex
6, Attachment 1). Since the subsector's indebtedness and interest charges
are very low, and since it is not expected to produce more than a nominal
return to the State by way of taxes and other distributions of income, it does
in fact not require as high a rate of return as utilities with more important
obligations to lenders and stockholders.
6.02      Cash generation, which is considered a more appropriate criterion,
has been satisfactory, because of the subsector's low debt service (loan
repayment obligations and interest charges) compared with depreciation. One
objective guiding the operations of the subsector, as confirmed by the Govern-
ment under Loan 1652-RO, has been that the subsector would generate on average
at least 30% of its own investment capital each year. This target has been
met consistently until now as the internal cash generation has been 40% in
1977, 47% in 1978 and 34% in 1979.
B. Future Financial Performance
6.03      On the basis of current MEE projections, the 30% cash generation
objective is expected to be met, with 34% in 1980 and 30% in 1981 (Annex 6,
Attachment 1). MEE projections for 1980-1985 assume average tariff increases
of about 10% for heat sales in 1982 and 8% for electricity sales to non-
domestic consumers in 1984 (Annex 6.1). However, because the projected
capital expenditure during the years 1982-1985 is considerably higher than
that during the preceding years, the cash generation contribution, with these
increases, is expected to amount to only 27%.in 1982, 23% in 1983, 26% in
1984, and 27% in 1985, significantly below the actual level achieved in
1977-1979 and the expected level in 1980-1981. As stated in paragraph 2.18
the tariff increases required during the next FYP period (1981-1985) are still
under review, as is the FYP as a whole.  During negotiations the Romanian
delegation indicated that the power and heat tariff increases are likely to
result in higher cash generation percentages than reflected in the financial
projections shown in Annexes 6.1 and 6.3. The Romanians also agreed to share
their thinking about electricity and heat tariffs by giving an assurance that
the Bank will receive relevant information, not later than December 31, 1981
on tariffs covering, inter alia, criteria used in establishing the levels of
tariffs.



- 33 -
6.04      The previous power loans provided that in any year (after 1981) the
sum of the annual benefits of the beneficiaries and the annual provision for
depreciation would be at least sufficient to cover the sum of the equivalent
in lei of the aggregate payments of the principal of, and interest on, the
loan and prior loans which the Borrower is required to make to the Bank in
that year. The proposed loan agreement contains a similar provision.
C. Project Financing Plan
6.05      The forecast sources and applications of construction funds for
CIPEET, CIRE and DEN are given in Annex 6.3; they are based on the tariff
increases mentioned in para 6.03. A condensed version representing the
financing plan for the Project is given below:

including 2-1/2 years grace period. (See Annex 6, Attachment 1 for
further details on the loan terms and on-lending conditions.)
6.06      Except for the existing and proposed Bank loans, the MEE expects to
finance the investments of the beneficiaries (CIPEET, CIRE, DEN and TCH)
during the years 1981-1983 essentially out of internally generated cash
and State Budget allocations. The total foreign exchange cost of the invest-
ment program during the Project period is about US$703.4 million. As stated
in paragraph 5.08, IB has indicated that the Romanian authorities are still
considering how the additional foreign exchange needs can be met. In any
event, the proposed Guarantee Agreement contains the usual language obliging
the Romanian Government to make the necessary funds available.



- 35 -
D. Accounts and Audit
6.07      As described in greater detail in Annex 6, Attachment 1, the
financial statements of CIPEET, CIRE and DEN are shown essentially as prepared
by the MEE and as reported upon in the audit report of the Ministry of Finance
to the Bank for the years 1977 and 1978. These financial statements are
proforma, combining information in the individual official financial state-
ments of the beneficiaries with other information.
6.08      The previous power loans require that the combined financial state-
ments of CIPEET, CIRE and DEN and the financial statements of the IB be
audited each year by the State General Finance Inspection of the Ministry of
Finance and be furnished to the Bank within six months of the end of each
fiscal year. The MEE and the Investment Bank have agreed to the audit covenant
under the existing loans being repeated in the proposed loan.
E. Insurance
6.09      In Romania, normal business risks are not insured with outside
insurers. The Government acts as its own insurer supporting enterprises
which suffer major losses arising from events beyond their control. Where
normal budget provisions are not adequate to meet the cost of replacement
of a major asset arising from such events, specific provision is made in
the next State Budget. In addition, enterprises set aside a small share of
benefits to cover minor losses or damage to property from unforeseen events.
These arrangements are satisfactory. The loan agreement includes the Bank-s
standard covenant for the insurance of the imported goods to be financed
out of the proceeds of the loan against hazards incident to the acquisition,
transportation and delivery thereof to the place of importation into the
territory of Romania.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. General
7.01      The 1980-1985 investment program for the Romanian power and heat sub-
sector is an appropriate vehicle for Bank financing since:
(a)  the policy and strategy of subsector expansion is well and timely
conceived and performance has been found adequate (paras 2.15,
2.21 and 2.22);



- 36 -
(b)  the criteria used by the Romanian authorities to select, prepare
and approve individual projects are based on least cost and minimum
material and other resource requirements (para 2.16);
(c)  the proposed investment program is well suited for mLeeting the
needs for additional power and heat supplies of the national economy
(para 4.02-4.03), based on maximum use of indigenous primary energy
resources (para 4.04); and the supervision capability and projected
effort by NEE, its dependencies and by the proposed Borrower, as
well as the procurement procedures for items to be financed under
the proposed loan, all appear to be appropriate; and
(d)  the Government has taken and plans to continue to take (as stated
in the Directives for its 1981-1985 FYP) further specific and
timely measures to strengthen the subsector.
7.02      The Government has, for some time, planned and undertaken to
economize on energy use and to change the structure of energy production away
from oil and gas towards domestic coal and hydroelectric energy. This was
discussed in paragraphs 1.09-11, 1.13, 2.02, 2.08, 2.12, 2.22 and, particularly,
in 2.15. Large scale campaigns have been undertaken for saving energy since
1973 and 1977. More recently, in July 1979, in response to the increase in
prices for imported crude oil, new measures were taken to reduce use of
petroleum products in the transport sector. In August 1979, retail prices to
domestic consumers for electricity and also gas (the latter for heating and
other household use) were raised and new quotas set for consumption of
electricity for public lighting and heat. Also, the FYPs call for high rates
of growth of hydro-electric power and coal-based thermal generation (lignite,
carD)niferous shale).
7.03      The Government's program for energy development for the next 20
years was published in July 1979. The development strategy, in general, is a
continuation of the one adopted in December 1977 with the main difference
being in the reduced rate of growth. It is also planned to restructure the
industrial production output mix away from energy and electricity intensive
produzts; e.g. aluminum production is to be kept at current levels. The
1981-2000 energy program assumes that Romania could reach fuel and energy



- 37 -
self-sufficiency by 1990. 1/ To achieve this it calls for a further remark-
able reduction in the share of hydrocarbons in electricity production, as
shown below:

A July 1979 draft program for research established the task for the whole
economy to develop and introduce new technology with emphasis given to energy
and raw material resources.
7.04      The economic justification of the proposed project considers two
aspects: (i) the least-cost solution for the expansion of the electricity
and heat subsector (para 7.05); and (ii) the return on investment in the
facilities in the subsector expansion program which would be commissioned in
the period 1981 to 1985 (para 7.06). 3/ An analysis omitting sunk costs for
this "sector" project would not be meaningful. The expansion program would
yield a return on investment of at least 9.5% which is higher than the rates
estimated for the individual earlier Bank-financed power projects (8.6% for
Turceni I, 6.5% for Riul Mare Retezat, and 6.4 % for Turceni II). This is in
part due to the systems effect on the proxy benefits to be derived from the
1981-1985 program and the now higher cost of hydrocarbons. The above return,
being used as a proxy, understates the economic rate of return because
the revenues from the sales of electricity and heat do not fully measure the
social benefits to residential and public users or the indirect benefits to
the economy and industry which would not expand at the projected rate without
the reliable electricity supply to be provided by the facilities of the
expansion program.
1/   Draft Energy Research and Development Program for 1981-1990.
2/   Recovered energy (e.g. coking and furnace gas), solar, new sources.
3/   The period 1981-1985 was chosen because the systems  effect has to be
taken into account and the time slice for the project (mid 1980-mid 1983)
would be too short to allow for this.

B. Least Cost Solution
7.05      The need for subsector facility expansion is discussed in Chapter IV.
Being spread -ier a longer time, for a somewhat slower load growth, the
1980 proposed expansion (Annex 7.1), is essentially the same as the one of
1977 which provided the basis for the 1978/79 appraisal of the Turceni II
project. The program for the expansion of the power and heat subsector was
derived from a mathematical model (linear programming) whose objective is to
minimize the capital cost of future capacities and the operating cost of both
existing and future plants. In addition, the formulation of the expansion
program for generation is based on the installation of plants that would
operate using domestic energy resources but restricting the use of oil and
gas. This restriction is consistent with the long-term policy of the Govern-
ment which calls for the accelerated reduction in the quantities of oil and
gas used for the generation of power and heat in the future. As a result
of this policy, most of the existing oil and gas fired power and heat plants
would be retired or used for emergencies and their function taken over by new
plants that would operate on domestic primary sources of energy (coal, lignite,
hydro and later uranium). In the context of the Romanian economic policy, the
Bank agreed to the proposed 1977 development program as the least-cost option.
Because the 1980 changes in the development program are small (while petroleum
prices have actually more than tripled compared with the US$10.40/barrel used
in the 1977 study and minimizing oil consumption has increased in importance)
the least-cost development proposed in 1977 is even more valid today. The
continued applicability of the conclusions of the 1977 study is supported by
the relatively high sensitivity of the return on the investment program
(para 7.08) to further cost increases of petroleum. It is noted that the
scope for modifications in the program is reduced because about 90% of the
individual projects making up the current expansion program to 1985 have been
under construction, since at least 1978, because of the long construction time
they require.
C. Return on Investment Program
7.06      The Project is defined as a time slice in Romania-s mid-term program
(1980-1985) for the development of the power and heat subsector. However,
because the Project is an integral part of this program and the Project's
benefits cannot be readily separated, due to the systems effect, the return
on the program has been calculated instead. The return on the program is
defined as the discount rate which equates the present value of the projected
benefits and the present value of the costs associated with the investments
undertaken during 1980-1985. The program costs include the incremental costs
in investment in generation, transmission and distribution, in the operation
and maintenance and in fuel. The benefits encompass mainly the projected
revenues from the sale of electricity and heat and the value of the fuel saved.
Fuel saving is taken as the difference between the cost of oil and gas that
would be incurred if the existing plant continued their operation and the fuel
cost of the new plants that would take over the current function of the existing
oil and gas fired plants. Conversion factors for expressing the costs and
benefits associated with the Project (and program) in their respective border



- 39 -
values have not yet been derived for Romania. Consequently, in the calculation
of the return on investment, all costs and benefits are expressed in terms of
domestic prices, with the exception of oil and gas fuel savings which are
valued at their assumed equivalent border prices. The revenues from the sale
of electricity and heat are based on the actual and projected 1980-1985 average
tariffs (Annex 6.1) which are taken as a proxy for the consumers willingness
to pay; the effect of local inflation (pro forma at 1% p.a.) is negligible.
7.07      On the above basis, the return on the program is 9.5%, which clearly
understates its values to the economy. Prior to 1977, electricity consumers
were paying a higher average tariff (Lei 0.322/kWh) for the same service as is
currently being provided at Lei 0.255/kWh and projected for 1984 and thereafter
at Lei 0.281/kWh. If the prior to 1977 average tariff is taken (instead of
the actual and projected average tariffs) as a proxy for the consumers'
willingness to pay, the return on investment would increase to 10.7% which is
a better estimate of the value of the program to the Romanian economy than the
return associated with the actual and projected lower average tariffs. These
two returns, however, cannot be used to measure the efficiency of the resource
allocation process in Romania. Prices in Romania are not used to serve an
allocative function, and consequently, all rates of return based on these
prices are not comparable to rates of return on similar projects in economies
where prices serve such function.
7.08      The results of a sensitivity analysis are shown in Annex 7.2.  On
this basis an increase in investment cost by 10% would reduce the return to
9.7%. For the savings of fuel costs in the oil and gas burning plant,
an imported crude oil price of US$30/barrel was assumed; a change of 10% in
this cost would change the return by about 0.7%. If the savings resulting
from displacing oil by coal in the production of electricity and heat could
not be realized, the rate of return would reduce to 4.5%. A 10% change in the
cost of coal would change the rate of return by about 1%.
VIII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01 (i)   The Borrower and MEE have agreed to an undertaking to enable
Bank staff to have a direct dialogue with respective technical/
financial staff levels of MEE to facilitate Project supervision
(para 3.02).
(ii)   The Borrower has agreed to supply the relevant indicators in
the first semi-annual progress report on the projects approved
after field appraisal and for the remaining one as soon as it
has been approved (para 5.04).
(iii)   The Bank and the Borrower have agreed on the items to be financed
under the proposed loan on the basis of an agreed List of Goods
(para 5.10).

(iv) The Romanians have agreed to share their thinking about Romanian
electricity and heat tariffs and the criteria used for them by
giving an assurance to supply the Bank with relevant information by
December 31, 1981 (para 6.03).
8.02      The following agreements reached under previous loans are
repeated:
(i) Obligation of Government to make needed funds available (paras 5.08
and 6.06).
(ii) Obligation that annual benefits of beneficiaries and provision for
depreciation cover interest on and repayment of Bank loans
(para 6.04).
(iii) Obligation to submit annually reports of external auditors
(para 6.08).
(iv) Obligation to adequately insure goods which are in transit for the
project (para 6.09).
8.03.     With the above agreements the proposed Project would be suitable for
a Bank loan to the Investment Bank with the guarantee of the Republic of
Romania in an amount of US$125 million equivalent for a term of 15 years,
including 2-1/2 years of grace.

Notes to Financial Statements
Basis of Financial Statements
1.        The (combined) actual and forecast Income Statements, Balance Sheets,
and Funds Statements of CIPEET, CIRE and DEN given in Annexes 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3,
are based on statements prepared by the MEE.
2.        The presentation of the Income Statements and Balance Sheets follows
the standard Romanian format; under this the accounts are kept in three sepa-
rate self-balancing sections for Fixed Assets in Service, Fixed Assets in
Progress (in course of construction) and Operations. Movements between the
three sections are not recorded by direct bookkeeping transfer, but through
parallel entries in each of the sections concerned based, in the case of
transfer from Operations to Fixed Assets in Progress (of depreciation, profits
reinvested, etc.), on actual bank transfer payments (all investment funds
are kept on deposit with the Investment Bank, all operating funds with the
National Bank). In the case of Fixed Assets commissioned, the same assets may
temporarily be included twice in the balance sheet as a result of this method
of parallel recording: (i) when fixed assets are put in service before final
approval of the construction expenditure, and (ii) while there are outstanding
loans in respect of fixed assets put in service. Because of this it is esti-
mated that the total net fixed assets figures as given in the balance sheets
prepared by MEE may be overstated by about 4-5%. This would not, however,
significantly affect the conclusions based on the financial statements.
3.        Interest on loans for the financing of capital expenditure has been
shown as a proforma item on the Income Statement, but is in fact not charged
against operating income but to cost of construction or against construction
funds. Transactions between the Centrals, or between enterprises belonging to
the Centrals, are not systematically eliminated in the combined financial
statements.
4.        The Statement of Sources and Applications of Construction Funds
is partly based on statistical information rather than on the balance sheet
movements during each year (which cannot readily be reconciled with one
another). It does not reflect short-term loans and other current liabilities
for fixed assets in progress, nor the movements of funds for operations. It
does reflect certain revenues which are not accounted for in the operating
income, such as sales of materials and equipment resulting from retirement of
plant, transfers of depreciation from other enterprises, and allocations from
the State Budget.

5.        The financial statements are proforma statements, combining informa-
tion in the individual official financial statements of the three Centrals
with other information, such as the outstanding long-term loan balances and
annual interest charges forecast at appraisal of the projects concerned.
Projected Sales and Net Income
6.        Unit sales of electricity and heat are based on the MEE's forecast
of annual increases as follows:
Annual Increase
------------------%-------------------
1980   1981   1982   1983   1984   1985
Electricity          10.0    5.3    7.3    4.7    1.9    3.7
Heat                 19.0    9.2    5.8    6.0    7.5    6.7
While in the light of past experience the sales forecasts for the years 1982
to 1985 seem attainable, those for the years 1980 and 1981 appear to be
unrealistically high considering that electricity and heat sales increased
by only 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively, in 1979. However, the forecasts have
not been adjusted in this report since they are officially sanctioned in the
country. It would be more realistic to expect that only half the assumed
increases for 1980 and three quarters of those for 1982 will be achieved. The
effect of such a reduction in sales would be to reduce net income as follows:
Millions of lei
1980       1981
Net income projected by MEE              2,265       2,252
Reduction resulting from
decrease in sales                         393        108
Reduced Net Income                       1,872      2,144
The contribution to investment would decrease from 37% to 34% in 1980, but
remain at 30% in 1981. The rate of return would not be significantly
affected (decrease from 2.7% to 2.3% in 1980, from 2.4% to 2.3% in 1981).
7.        The increase of average sales prices in 1979, 1980 and 1981 is due
to the introduction in August 1979, of a new progressive tariff structure
for domestic consumers as part of the Government's energy conservation
measures. Because of the 3 months time lag between consumption on the one
hand, and meter reading on the other, the full impact is not expected to be
reflected in sales until 1981.

ANNEX 6
Attachment 1
Page 3 of 4
8.        The financial projections for the years 1980-1985 also assume that
heat tariffs will be increased by an average of 10% in 1982 and that industrial
electricity tariffs will be increased by an average of 8% in 1984. These
increases are still subject to review in Romania, as is the FYP as a whole.
The modifications envisaged for power and heat tariffs are expected to result
in higher tariff rates (some 40% for power and 55% for heat) and cash genera-
tion percentages than shown in the financial projections on Annexes 6.1 and
6.3.
Projected Fuel Costs
9.        Fuel costs have been projected on the basis of fixed prices, but
taking into account projected changes in production mix.  Fuel prices are
fixed, as follows:
Lignite                   106 - 112 lei per ton
Brown coal                198 - 210  "
Coal                      462 - 487  "
Carboniferous shale              101
Crude oil                        446
Natural gas                      220           1000 m3
Fixed Assets and Depreciation
10.       Fixed assets are valued at cost.  Revaluation of assets is not
considered necessary in view of the low inflation in the country (about 1%
p.a.). Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis. Average annual
depreciation rates used are reasonable and vary between 2.6% in 1977 and 2.4%
in 1985 assuming an average fixed asset composite life of approximately 40
years. The reduction is due to the substantial addition of longer than
average life hydro power plant in the period.
Equity Funds for Financing Fixed Assets in Progress
11.       In 1978 and 1979, economic reforms were introduced in Romania for
the purpose of associating the individual enterprises and their workers more
closely with the economic decision making process and to provide incentives
to them. One of the effects of the laws introduced under these reforms was
the creation, at the level of the enterprises and Centrals, of the following
equity funds for construction (referred to colloquially as funds 1, 2 and 3):
(i) Economic development fund (Enterprise-s fund);
(ii) Housing construction fund (Enterprise-s fund); and
(iii) New enterprise and important developments fund (this fund is under
the control of the Industrial Centrals).



- 71 -
ANNEX 6
Attachment 1
Page 4 of 4
These funds are built up from depreciation; share of net income; liquidation
proceeds of fixed assets; and State Budget allocations. The allocation of
depreciation and net income to the various funds, to the State Budget, and
to other destinations is regulated by law.
Outstanding Loans and Annual Interest Charges
12.       Details of the estimated outstanding IBRD loan balances and annual
interest charges shown in the financial statements included in this report
are shown in Annex 6.5. In the case of the proposed loan, the calculations
are based on an annual interest rate of 9.25% and a loan period of 15 years
including a grace period of 2-1/2 years. 1/ According to the IB, its on-lending
terms to the beneficiaries are identical with the terms of the Bank and it
charges to the beneficiaries the entire interest cost of the IBRD loans,
absorbing only the exchange differences. (The interest rates it charges on
other transactions do not exceed 2%; those of the National Bank, for loans to
operations, range between 2% and 5%.)
I/   The grace period on the proposed loans has been reduced to 2-1/2 years
in order to compensate a grace period above norm on the Danube Canal Loan
1794-RO.
