Proiect Description        The objective of the project is to implement the first 6-year phase of
the Strategic Plan for National Agricultural Research. The principal
objective of this Plan is to ensure that adequate technology will
become available to farmers as a means to increase agricultural
growth and to reverse the decline in the productive capacity of the
natural resource base. The proposed project will therefore aim at
improving the performance of the national agricultural research
system, by improving research coWterence, quality, relevance aad
accountability for results through:
Institutional Development:
(a)   transform  the National Agricultural Research Council
(NARC) into an entity which integrates user representatives,
and through which all official funding for agricultural
research is coordinated and screened;
(b)   support the transformation of IER into an autonomous
institution with an independent Board of Directors, and
reorganize and strengthen it;
(c)   regionalize research to bring it closer to its users;
Technology Transfer and User Participation:
(a)    develop interactive processes between farmers, extension
agents and researchers through farmer participation in setting
research objectIves and evaluating its results, to ensure
research relevance and to accelerate the dissemination of
research results;

NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
L. BACKGROUND
A. ProJect Background
1.01       Since 1971, IDA has been assisting the Government of Meli in the development of its
agricultural sector. Support to agricultural research was initially made through components in agricultural
development projects. In 1987 Government recognized that success in this field requires a clear overall
strategy and a long-term commitment. Following a first analysis by the International Service for National
Agricultural Research (ISNAR), the Institut d'Economie Rurale (IER) embarked on the preparation of
its Strategic Plan for Agricultural Research with ISNAR assistance, partly funded by United States
Agency for International Development (USAID). In October 1992, the Government presented its strategy
to a donor round table. In parallel, the Inst itm du Sahel (INSAH) and the Special Program for African
Agricultural Research (SPAAR), prepared with the national agricultural research institutions of the
CILSS' countries a strategic Framework for Action (FFA) to revitalize agricultural research in the Sahel.
During the SPAAR membership meeting in May 1991 in Abidjan, Mali and Tanzania were selected as
pilot countries for the implementation of FFA  recommendations.   Subsequently, an IDA
identification/preparation mission visited Mali in October 1991. In February 1992, Mali obtained PPF
financing of US$750,000 for the preparation of the proposed project by IER. In September 1993, a
supplemental PPF of US$750,000 was granted. An appraisal mission took place in April 1993.
B. Economic Resources and Management
1.02       With a per capita income of US$280 (1991), Mali is one of the poorest countries in the
world. Social indicators, such as life expectancy, primary school enrollment rates and access to basic
health services are among the lowest. Population, estimated at 8.5 million in 1990, is growing at the
estimated net rate of 2.5% a year. Eighty percent of the inhabitants live in rural areas, with population
density ranging from 22 inhabitants per km2 in Segou to I inhabitant per km2 in the Tombouctou and Gao
regions. A large area (140,000 km2 in the south of the country), previously affected by onchocerciasis,
has been partially cleared of this disease by a campaign launched in 1974, and is now being intensively
developed for cotton production.
1.03       Meager resources, the poor condition of the infrastructure, a low literacy rate (only 17%
of the population is literate) and a highly variable climate severely hinder Mali's economic performance.
Real growth has averaged about 3.4% per annum since 1985, most of it absorbed by population increase.
The average GDP also masks large interannual variations which are directly linked to climatic conditions
and Mali's heavy dependence on agriculture. This sector generates just under half of Mali's GDP, with
cereals and livestock production alone contributing more than one third of the total value added. Growth
in the agricultural sector is conditioned by low rainfall, fragile soils, and low-productivity, traditional
technologies.

1.04       The adjustment and stabilization efforts pursued by the Government since 1982 have
contributed to improved macroeconomic management. For the past four years. a sustained adjustment
program has received the support of the Bank, the Fund and major donors. Macro-economic targets
agreed under the first PFP (1988-90) were largely met, and a second PFP for 1990-92 was approved in
early 1990. Major structural reforms have been implemented over the period, in particular on the
regulatory framework, the tax system, foreign trade, the public enterprise sector, and the agricultural
sector. Prices have been fully liberalized, and export and most import monopolies have been eliminated.
Quantitative restrictions have been removed and import taxation greatly simplified. Export taxation has
also been abolished. A value-added tax has been introduced, and new investment, commercial and labor
codes have been adopted.
1.05       Economic performance was weakened in 1991 by politicai unrest. After the overthrow of
the former Government, the transition Government agreed with the Bank and the i7und on a revised
macroeconomic framework for 1991, which was implemented satisfactorily. In July 1992, negotiations
of a new PFP were finalized with the new Government and the PFP was approved by the Bank and the
Fund in late August 1992. Overall progress on structural reforms continued to be satisfactory in 1992.
However, there were severe slippages on the financial program due to extra-budgetary outlays (notably
related to public works), and malversation by the Treasury, under the transition Government. Although
the new Government took quick and decisive actions to end the illegal activities and recover part of the
losses, further significant slippages in revenue mobilization occurred in the last quarter of 1992 due to
the impact of fiscal concessions granted to various private sector interest groups under the transition
Government, and increased resistance from the population at large towards fulfilling their tax obligations.
The Government has identified measures in the 1993 budget to address this shortfall in budgetary
revenues.
1.06       The policies implemented since 1988, combined with relatively favorable weather conditions,
led to average annual real GDP growth of 3.9% per annum over the last four years. This growth was
achieved in spite of weaker macroeconomic performance in 1991, as a result of lower rainfall that year
and the disruption of productive activities due to social unrest. Fiscal management has improved, with
the overall budget deficit (excluding grants) falling steadily from its peak of 13.9% of GDP in 1985 to
7.7 in 1990, although it deteriorated to 11.7% in 1991 due to the disruption of economic activities. It
improved marginally to 11.3% of GDP in 1992. The current account deficit fell from 28.5% of GDP
in 1985, to 13.7% in 1991, but increased to 14.7% of GDP in 1992, due largely to the sharp drop in
world cotton prices. Capital inflows, largely to finance the public investment program, have increased
steadily since the mid-1980's, and the balance of payments has recorded surpluses since 1988, after more
than a decade of consecutive deficits.
1.07       The public enterprise sector, which despite its small contribution to GDP used to incur
annual losses of about US$30 million, was largely restructured: this included the privatization of the main
development bank and postal checking system, the liquidation of the largest unprofitable enterprises and
the divestiture of others. In the agricultural sector, cereals pricing and marketing were liberalized, and
in the cotton subsector, institutional, pricing and tax reforms were undertaken to increase efficiency and
thus maintain its international competitiveness. As part of this restructuring, a performance contract is
being implemented between the Government and the cotton company (Compagnie Malienne de
Developpement de Textiles, CMDT) as well as with the cerealR marketing agency (Office des Produits
Agricoles du Mali, OPAM). To improve revenue collection and management of public expenditure,
measures were also undertaken to strengthen investment budgeting. Continued reduction in the number
of government employees wiil reduce the weight of the wage bill and increase that of spending in priority
areas.

C. The Agricultural Sector
Sector _Proflel
1.08       Only about a quarter of Mali's 1.2 million km2 are arable. Climatic factors account for the
extreme ecological diversity characterizing the country's vegetation and agricultural potential.
Agroclimatic zones range from Saharan to Guinean (Map 24964). The Saharan zone in thie north covers
about 50% of Mali's total area; it receives less than 150 mm of rainfall, and supplies less than 10% of
the total grazing biomass. The Sahelian zone covers about 20% of Malian territory and receives between
200 and 600 mm of rainfall. lThe Sudanian savannah covers 25% of the country and receives good
rainfall (600-900 mm per annum), while the Sudano-Guinean zone (5% of total area) with 900-1200 mm
of rainfall has the highest agricultural potential of the country and the highest population density.
1.09       The Malian economy is based to a considerable, but declining, extent on the primary sector,
whose shf re of GDP dropped from 58% in 1981 to 46% in 1990. Since this falling-off was larger than
the decrease in the active population employed in agriculture, the result has been a decline in agricultural
income for the rural population as a whole. Livestock production contributes approximately half of the
agricultural GDP, and food crops another 30%.
1.10       Agriculture is based primarily on rainfed cultivation, although major irrigation schemes
exist. Cereals, mostly sorg..um/millet and maize, are the most important food crops. They are grown
by 90% of farmers and contribute about 25% of GDP. Cereals are primarily cultivated for home
consumption; only about 20% of total production is marketed. They are often intercropped with a
legume, either groundnuts or cowpeas. Rice is also a major item of consumption, but mostly in urban
areas. It is grown in large-scale irrigation schemes (mainly the Office du Niger, Operation Riz Mopti
and Operation Riz Segou) and in lowland plantations (particularly Mali-Sud Region). Cotton, the most
important cash crop, is also Mali's major export crop, representing 45 to 50% of foreign exchange
earnings.
1.11       Livestock is the second most important agricultural export, accounting for about 30% of
total exports, and represents a large component of all agricultural production systems. The Touareg and
some Peul tribesmen in the north of the country are pure pastoralists, while farmers in the central and
southern part of the country integrate livestock and crop production. Livestock production in Mali is
basically a low-input/low-output system, primarily depending on extensive grazing of the natural pasture.
There are only a few large-scale, intensive commercial dairy and poultry farms, and these are located
outside Bamako and other urban centers. Traditional transhumant grazing systems are encountering major
difficulties due to the shrinkage of rangeland areas and competition with crops. This has resulted in the
drift of herds from the Sahelian to the Sudanian zone, the transfer of stock ownership from herders to
farmers and traders, and the progressive collapse of traditional transhumant production systems.
1.12       The recent increase in sorghum and millet production (from an average of 763,000 tons in
1980-82 to 1,420,000 tons in 1989-91) is primarily due to increases in the cultivated area (from an
average of 1,411,000 ha in 1980-82 to 1,940,000 ha in 1988-89) and to improvements in yields (from
540 to 730 kg/ha), in part due to the higher fertility of new lands put under cultivation. Whether
productivity is improving on a sustainable basis is difficult to infer, given the fact that yields are so very
rainfall dependant. During the same period, cotton production increased from 104,000 to 249,000 tons,
an increase due to area expansion (from 98,000 to 193,000 ha) as well as yield improvements (from
1,060 to 1,290 kg/ha).



- 4 -
1.13        A crucial issue regarding Mali's luture developmetit is the on-going degradation of its
natural resources, characterized by: (i) mamsive erosion of agrivultural soils by wind and water, leading
to decline in soil fertility: (ii) accelerated degradation of forests due to overexploitation of t'uelwood; (iii)
overall degradation of rangeland due to overgrazing; (iv) soil salinization and acidification; (v) lowering
of the groundwater table; (vi) a declire in fish catches in the Niger; and (vii) accelerated loss of
biodiversity.
1.14        The major constraints affecting the management of soil, water, vegetation and biodiversity
in Mali are: (i) the population increase, which has resulted in unsustainable pressure on agricultural and
non-agricultural land (forest, rangeland, bush fallow) and pushed agricultural production into marginal
and fragile areas previotusly devoted to grazing; (ii) the coexistence of traditional land tenure
arrangements and of Government regulations which havejeopardized traditional practices, without leading
to the establishment of a reliable modern system; (iii) difficulties in marketing cattle which have led to
the accumulation of large numbers of underproductive stock; and (iv) certain production practices, such
as slashing and burning natural vegetation, which may have been relevant in the past, but have proven
to be ineffective and highly destructive of the resource base.
Government Sector Policy Obiectives and Strategy
1.15        In 1992, the Government prepared a Rural Development Master Plan that clearly sets
agriculture as the engine for growth. The strategy for the development of the sector is based upon: (i)
improved natural resource management to promote sustainable growth; (ii) the creation of a more
favorable socio-economic environment; (iii) further redistribution of responsibilities away from the public
towards the private sector and the rural communities; (iv) the restructuring of the public sector to increase
its efficiency and relevance.
1.16        Favorable socio-egonomic environment. Price liberalization is in effect since January 1991.
The Government will encourage contracts between producers and economic operators as in the case of
cotton. Agricultural inputs and equipment will benefit from import tax exemption. Investment laws and
regulations will he revised to promote the creation of rural enterprises. Public services management will
be streamlined and the share of public expenditures going to investment in infrastructure and equipment
will be increased. The policy of decentralization of public services will be pursued and major efforts will
be made to develop services, in particular health and education in small rural towns.
1.17        Sustainable development. Realizing the threat natural resource degradation poses for long-
term growth, the Government has shown a serious commitment to tackling the problem. Having prepared
a plan for desertification control in the late 1980s (Plan National de Lutte contre la Desertification), the
Government is now preparing an integrated resource management program for the agricultural, pastoral
and forestry sector. As part of this effort, the newly created research program on natural resource
management will use a multidisciplinary approach to tackle these problems in the three subsectors and
will aim at developing commmunity-based technologies using a participatory approach. T'he legal codes
for water, forests, rangelands, fisheries as well as the land tenure code, now in preparation will provide
the legal framework necessary for pronoting improved natural resource management. In particular, laws
governing land tenure and local aulholities will he instrumental to allow local communities t) manage
their own resources (gestion cles ierroirw v'illageoix).
1. 18       Relistribution of respOnsibilities away_rom the public sector. Most parastatal organizations
involved in productioni will be privatized. In additioni, the idea is to transfer development responsibilities
to grassroots organizations.  'o this el'fect, the Government will promote and empower village
communities or rural associations so that they can take on some of the activities performed in the past

by the public sector. The Malian government also recognizes that the greater participation of farmers,
especially women, and village associations in decisions regarding agricultural production and in the design
and implementation of agricultural policies is likely to be a key factor to promote rural development and
bring about further economic growth. This in turn will require better information, training, and
extension, as well as changes in land tenure legislation. The Government has already started to include
farmers directly in negotiations with the cotton company and the major rice producing parastatal, Office
du Niger (ON).
1.19       Streamlining of the public sector. In addition, the Government seeks to increase efficiency
in the agricultural sector by improving the management of public resources through streamlining services
provided by rural governmental organizations while increasing the share of investments in equipment and
infrastructure. The Office du Niger will remain a parastatal organization but will be given autonomy,
restructured and managed according to private sector rules. The irrigation network will be maintained and
re~habilitated rather than extended.
Bank Group Involvement in Agriculture
1.20       Past IDA assistance. IDA assistance to Mali became increasingly policy oriented over the
1980's, first through the inclusion of reform measures in investment projects and, since 1988, through
two adjustment operations in agriculture and education. At the same time, IDA continued to finance
investment operations, in support of the major sectors, in particular agriculture and human resources.
Out of the 12 projects currently under implementation, 4 are in agriculture, representing US$146.6
million or 39% of the lending portfolio.
1.21       Performance evaluation. PCRs have been produced for nine projects in the agriculture
sector. Five of these have been the subject of a PPAR. Out of the nine projects, four had an
unsatisfactory rating. Some of the lessons learned from the success of the Second Mali-Sud Rural
Development Project (Cr-1415-MLI) are relevant to the proposed project.  Success factors worthy of
note were in particular: (i) a profitable crop, cotton, and a strong institution, CMDT, which the project
contributed to reinforce; (ii) the fact that research responded directly to development needs as
iinplemented, under contracts between [ER and CMDT; (iii) the scientific back up that IER received
through its collaboration with the French cotton research institute; (iv) the trust developed between
farmers and CMDT which allowed for rapid adoption of technical packages; (v) the development of self-
managed farmers' associations which were able to take on tasks previously at Government's charge.
1.22       Research components in other agricultural development projects were mostly unsuccessful.
The ODIPAC Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 1174-MLI) demonstrated that research results could not
be expected in the very short life of the project period (3 years). It also showed that crop development
and related research endeavors should be considered within the framework of a sector-wide agricultural
context. A number of projects revealed that farmers' attitudes towards technical packages were dictated
more by agroecological constraints and the prevailing socio-economic environment than by ignorance or
irrationality. This suggests that constraint diagnostic and potential solution identification, the basis for
sound research programming, may not have been carried out in collaboration with farmers. In addition,
low f?rm-gate prices, to be expected in surplus years and especially in remote areas stood in the way of
farmers' adoption, highlighting the need for ex ante socio-economic evaluation of research proposals.
1.23       Priorities for IDA. The overriding objective of IDA's strategy in Mali is the alleviation of
poverty through growth in per capita income and improvement in social services. Given Mali's progress
in short-term economic management over the past few years, IDA's strategy is now to focus on key issues
for long-term economic development: (i) foster private sector growth; (ii) improve public sector



management; (iii) alleviate long-term physical and human resource constraints to growth, with the
ultimate objective to alleviate poverty and improve the standard of living. Two issues that cut across all
sectors and operations and are key to capacity building will receive particular attention in IDA's future
lending operations and sector work: (i) the promotion of women's activities; and (ii) capacity building
and greater focus on information, education and communication.
1.24       The policies pronoted through IDA operations in the agricultural sector, including research
and extension services that better serve the needs of the farmers, promote agricultural diversification and
provide incentives for farmers to increase agricultural production, should have a direct effect on food
security and rural income. The reorganization of extension and research services is taking place through
an on-going hybrid sector adjustment/investment operation and the proposed National Agricultural
Research Project; the promotion of private irrigation schemes through a planned Irrigation Promotion
Project; the development of the agro-industrial sector through a study of the agro-processing potential
and a planned future project. The multi-sectoral Natural Resource Management Project will introduce
a rational land use system with the aim of halting and then ieversing the process of degradation of the
natural resource base.
IDA Lending Strategy for Agriculture
1.25       The agricultural sector remains a priority. The operations under preparation include: the
proposed National Agricultural Research Proiect which aims at increasing agricultural productivity by
improving the responsiveness of research to farmers' and herders' needs, conserving the natural resource
base and establishing a more effective linkage with farmer organizations, Non-Governmental
Organizations, the extension services, agro-industries and the private sector. Given Mali's large irrigation
potential, a second operation in this area (after the FY88 Office du Niger Consolidation Project), the
Irrigation Promotion Project, would aim at exploiting this potential more fully by promoting the
development of small-scale private irrigation schemes. An agro-processing operation would enccurage
private investment in this most important part of Mali's small agro-industrial sector and at the same time
increase the value of agricultural production. Finally, a second agricultural services project would extend
the program started under the first project which became effective in 1991 and has already demonstrated
its positive effect on agricultural yields.
11. AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
A. Organization and Funding of Agricultural Research
2.01       Agricultural research has existed in Mali since the end of the nineteenth century when the
first ad hoc cotton experiments were conducted. It was formalized with the creation of the agricultural
research farm in Sotuba in 1927, and a few years later with a rice research station for the Office du
Niger. After the Second World War, the French research institutes developed a systematic network of
stations for cotton (Kogoni and N'Tarla) and for livestock (Sotuba).    Most agricultural research in
Mali is now carried out by the Institut d'Economie Rurale (IER). There are, however, a few other
institutions, with a multiple mandate, with research being one of them: the Agricultural Mechanization
Division (DMA) of the Ministry of Rural Development, the Central Veterinary Laboratory (LCV), the
Malian Cattle and Meat board (OMBEVI), as well as some applied research being done under

development projects. However, the new IER represents about 90% of national agricultural research
resources, with the other organizations contributing approximately 10% in very specific domains, not
covered by IER.
2.02        The Institut d'Economie Rurale (IER) was created in 1960 as part of the Ministry of
Agriculture. The mandate of this first structure was more to organize agricultural research than to
actually conduct it. It also had many other responsibilities, including economic studies, training, crop
protection, and control over agricultural processing. In 1968, its mandate was redefined to include the
conduct of agricultural research. In 1975, the Institute also became responsible for the planning and
evaluation of the Ministry's projects and programs. And, in 1979, the creation of the farming systems
research department gave a research-development focus to the Institute's mandate.
2.03        In 1981, following the creation of a Ministry of Natural Resources and Livestock, livestock,
fisheries and forestry research activities were transferred to a new research institute: the Institut National
de la Recherche Zootechnique, ForestiWre et Hydrobiologique (INRZFH). At the same time, the statute
of the new institutes (TER and INRZFH) was defined for the first time as that of a service rattachO, but,
in practice there was no difference with the previous situation or that of any other Directorate of the
Ministry.
2.04        The split soon proved to be rather inefficient and as early as 1987, discussions began to
regroup agricultural research activities under one single institute. To prepare for the merging, the Malian
government asked the International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR) to provide a
background analysis of its agricultural research system. The study took place in 1988. A new IER,
merging the previous IER and INRZFH, was created by law No. 90-99/AN-RM (26 September 1990),
mirroring the reunification of the two ministries. Still a service rattachM, its organization was defined
in the decree 90-432/P-RM of 31 October 1990.
2.05        Human resources. According to 1993 records, there are 260 scientists at IER, including
the managers; 240 are nationals and 20 are expatriates. In addition, 28 researchers are undergoing
training. Qualification levels are the following:
*     PhDIDoctorat                         55
*     DEA/Master US                        59
*     BSc/Engineering Diploma              126
A qualitative analysis carried out for the Strategic Plan (para. 2.28) enables to distinguish between senior
researchers, researchers, junior researchers, and interns. The first group (50 scientists) have Ph.Ds and
doctorates. They can be research project' leaders and be responsible for providing supervision and
guidance to junior researchers. In the second group (36) are scientists who can be responsible for
carrying out their own research but need some guidance3. The third group (107) are agricultural
engineers with a BSc. level of education whose work needs close supervision and most of whom should
be classified as technicians. The fourth group are mostly young agricultural engineers with a BSc level
2/    Research programs are made up of research projects; a research project is defined as a set of research
objectives, all necessary to solve a development problem - a research project has expected output(s),
duration, a location and scientific resources needed by discipline and scientist-year.
3/    They usually have a DEA, a master or a maitrise, or else an engineering diploma with 15 years of
experience in research.



- 8 -
of education undergoing an internship at IER (47).  According to the criteria used in this initial
evaluation, IER could rely on 124 qualified national scientists (the first two groups and some of the third
group).
2.06       Research station network. In 1992, 36 research experiment sites were listed ranging from
full-fledged stations with resident scientists to experimental sites, more than TER can manage adequately
given the level of resources. Because resources, scientists in particular, are dispersed over too many
research sites, providing adequate support services to them is not cost effective.
2.07       Research funding.  Over the three-year period 1988-90, agricultural research funding
represented an average of CFAF 2,244 million (approximately US$8.3 million) per annum, out of which:
*    National Budget               CFAF  866 million (US$3.2 million)
*    Direct Donor Contribution     CFAF 1,293 million (US$4.8 million)
*    Expatriate Researchers        CFAF   85 million (US$0.3 million)
Funding from the national budget represented therefore 39% of total funding, covering mainly salaries.
In the period 1991-93, public funding for operating expenditures decreased slightly (CFAF 825 million
or US$3.05 million), but in addition, public funding was available for infastructure building in the
regions, following the Government decision to decentralize. This level of funding corresponds to
approximately 0.3% of AgGDP. which is reasonable in comparison with other countries in Africa and
elsewhere.
2.08       Ongoing donor-funded research proiects. The most important externally financed ongoing
research activities are presented in Annex 1. Available funding is in Annex 9. The present project is
designed in close collaboration with USAID and the Dutch Cooperation: in particular, the USAID-funded
Supporting Research Planning and Research on Commodities Project (SPARC), and the Dutch funded
Regional Farming Systems Research Project (DRSPR) in Sikasso. The former has a strong institutional
development component and the latter has a 15-year experience in participatory and on-farm research.
The present project is designed to dovetail with these ongoing activities.
B. Past Research Results and Impact
2.09       Notable achievements in cotton research include the successful introduction of normal and
glandless varieties, though the main problem remains their susceptibility to bacteriosis and in addition,
for the glandless varieties, their poor fiber quality. Major achievements have been obtained in weed and
pest control. Soil preparation techniques to improve water and soil management have been studied but
work still remains to be done to adapt them to various agroecological zones. Norms for inorganic
fertilizer and dates of application have long been introduced. However, the formula (complexe coton)
remains to be adapted to each agroecological zone. Soil acidification, as a result of repeated fertilizer
use could become a serious problem, that research needs to address urgently. Performance of various
rotation alternatives for each agroecological zone have been determined, but there is a need to introduce
other crops for diversification purposes.
2.10       In irrigated rice research, three improved varieties, responsive to fertilizer, are presently
recommended with short cycle and short stems: Dourado precoce, Gambiaka and BG 90-2. Agronomic
practices, in particular planting, spacing, and dates are also well known. Fertilizer application -100 kg/ha
of P and 50 kg/ha of N- is recommended at two stages of plant development: planting and weeding. For



maize, introductions of varieties from IRAT, HITA and CIMMYT have enabled to propose more than ten
improved varieties, with various cycles. One of these, short cycle and resistant to bacteriosis, is
recommended in the CMDT zone.
2.11       Breeding of millet and sorghum has for a long time been a major focus of IER. However,
results so far have been disappointing. Three improved varieties from the local cultivars have been
transferred but their adoption is extremely low (less than I % of the area). Seed treatment has been well
researched. Though recommendations for herbicides are known, they are rarely adopted by farmers.
2.12       Most recommendations in animal production deal with animal feed production and
management for fattening and animal traction. Forage crops (dolique, stylosantes, leucaena and cowpea
in sole crops) are also part of the extension package. Little work has been done on animal production
systems which should become a major focus in the future.
2.13       IER has been most successful in the implementation of a farming systems program and the
development of participatory research methods, involving both farmers and extension agents. The
adoption of these research methods has enabled IER and CMDT to reach a close collaboration and
disseminate successful technologies in the Southern zone. These technologies deal mainly with cotton
and maize in rotation, livestock (animal traction and fattening) and soil fertility management using
compost and manure, combined with anti-erosion measures.
2.14       The farming system research program has extended its work to natural resource management
techniques and is now implementing a program of gestion des terroirs villageols in collaboration with
rural populations. Techniques which are being tested and recommended in collaboration with CMDT
include: anti-erosion bunds, either with stones or planted (Andropogon); live hedges with jatropha and
wind breaks with eucalyptus, Gmelina and Neem. For water harvesting, recommended techniques are
closed bunds, semi-circle catchments and dry land soil preparation.
C. The National Strategic Plan for Agricultu-ral Research
2.15       While the merging of the two institutes and the definition of a structure for the new IER
were underway, work for the elaboration of the Strategic Plan began in 1989 with ISNAR support. Of
paramount importance for planning and organizing research programs, was the decision to decentralize
research and to create regional research centers (Centres RNgionaux de Recherches Agronomiques, CRRA)
in each agroecological zone. The decision, enacted with the 1990 Decree responds to a concern for
establishing more effective and permanent relations with regional development agencies and improving
research efficiency by bringing together a critical mass of scientists. The regional center directors are
responsible for programming, coordinating and supervising all research activities and managing the
resources of the Institute in the area covered by the center.
2.16       The Strategic Plan provides the overall orientation and priorities for the evolution of
agricultural research in Mali over the long term (12 years), in terms of research content as well as
resources required. The implementation of the Strategic Plan is proposed to take place in two phases of
six years each. The Plan envisioned the implementation of seven research programs: cereals and
legumes, industrial crops, fruits and vegetables, animal production, forestry and fisheries, agricultural
production systems, and natural resource management. Each program was divided into sub-programs by
commodity.



- 10-
2.17        It was estimated that the implementation of the Strategic Plan would require CFAF 2,353
million (US$8.7 million) in constant 1990 terms, during the first year, a level of funding which would
follow the planned increase in scientific staff, to reach 2,686 million CFAF (US$10.0 million) in year
six. These estimates are based on a norm of CFAF 18.5 million (US$69,000) per scientist per year4.
2.18        During the first six year phase, only four out of the six regional centers would become
operational: Sotuba, Sikasso, Niono and Mopti. Sotuba would absorb approximately 38% of the
resources, Sikasso 32%, Niono 20% and Mopti 10%. The distribution of resources by program would
be as follows:
*     Animal Production                   23.4%
*     Cereal and Legume Crops             20.5%
*     Production Systems                  16.2%
*     Industrial Crops                    13.5%
*     Vegetable and Fruit Crops           10.6%
*     Natural Resources Management         9.8%
*     Forestry and Fisheries               6.1%.
2.19        Under the selected scenario, research would be carried out on cotton in the industrial crop
program (dah, tobacco, sugar cane and tea are suppressed). In the cereal and leguminous crop program,
the commodities selected were irrigated and floating rice, millet, sorghum, maize, cowpeas for the first
phase of the Plan. Groundnuts, bottom-land rice, wheat and flood recession sorghum would be added
during the second phase. Under the horticulture and fruit program, only research on vegetables, citrus,
and mango (processing) would be undertaken during the first phase. Root crops, banana and dates were
to be added during the second phase. For animal production, the first phase of the Plan focuses on cattle,
sma" ruminants and poultry. The second phase adds research on pigs and camels. For forestry and
fisheries, most projects are under the first phase and deal with wood products, arabic gum, shea butter,
honey and fisheries in the Mopti area. In natural resource management, all projects are under the first
phase, except for a dune fixation project. They include rangeland management, water and soil
conservation techniques in various agroecological zones, soil fertility management techniques, irrigated
perimeter rehabilitation (salinization and alkalinization), natural forest reserve management, and
conservation of phytogenetic resources. Finally, under the first phase, farming systems research would
be conducted only in the four established regional centers.
D. The Regional Agricultural Research Strategv of the CILSS Countries
2.20        In May 1990 the members of the Special Program for African Agricultural Research
(SPAAR) decided to sponsor the preparation of regional action programs to revitalize national agricultural
research in Sub-Saharan Africa. Through a series of workshops, jointly organized by SPAAR and the
Institut du Sahel (INSAH), the research leaders of the CILSS countries prepared a program which was
endorsed by the CILSS Council of Ministers and the SPAAR membership and published under the title
"Framework for Action (FFA) to revitalize Agricultural Research in the Sahel". In consultation with the
4/   The norm was established, taking as a basis research projects or programs considered to be adequately
funded. However, it seriously under-estimates experiment station operating and maintenance costs, and
general overheads. Also, the norm does not take into account the effect on the payroll of an improved
incentive system.



- I1 -
Sahelian research leaders, the SPAAR membership designated Mali as one of two pilot countries (together
with Tanzania) to implement the FFA recommendations. These recommendations can be summarized as
follows:
(a)   establishing regional collaborative research programs on millet, sorghum, maize,
groundnuts, cowpeas, vegetables, small ruminants and natural resource management
(including genetic resource conservation), to be implemented by lead national agricultural
research systems ("research poles") coordinated by INSAH;
(b)  revitalizing the national agricultural research systems through institutional reforms that
should: (i) strengthen the capability of governments to define agricultural research policy
and improve donor coordination through the introduction of consolidated funding
mechanisms; (ii) make national agricultural research institutions more dynanmic and
accountable for results by granting them financial and administrative management autonomy;
and (iii) promote greater institutional diversity and include the private sector, farmer
organizations, educational institutions and NGOs in the overall research effort.
2.21       During their meeting in Ouagadougou in July 1991, the directors of the national agricultural
research institutions decided that IER would become the lead institution for sorghum research. Together
with Senegal (lead institution), Chad and Niger, IER would participate in a collaborative program on
small ruminant productivity improvement and pathology; and together with Burkina Faso (lead institution)
and Senegal, IER would participate in a natural resource conservation and management program (soil
fertility management, soil and water conservation, village land resource management).  These
collaborative programs would be designed in such a manner that individual national institutions would
implement an agreed component of the program, which at the same time would constitute its national
program, thereby avoiding costly duplication of effort. The present project intends to support IER's
participation in these regional collaborative programs and to adapt the institutional reforms recommended
by the FFA to conditions in Mali and implement them, including the introduction of a consolidated
funding mechanism to strengthen donor coordination under Government leadership.
E. Current Issues of Agricultural Research
2.22       The National Agricultural Research Council (NARC). Under the 1990 Decree, a National
Agricultural Research Council, with two committees (one for resources and one for programs), formulates
agricultural research policy and strategy. It decides on research priorities; it reviews and approves
research programs and budgets; reviews research results and decides on their diffusion; monitors the use
of resources and establishes linkages between research and external research organizations as well as,
within the country, with development agencies. Under the direction of the IER Director, the Permanent
Secretary of NARC has responsibility to implement NARC's decisions.
2.23       While the idea is an excellent one, at present, the way NARC functions represents a series
of cumbersome and inefficient procedures. The representation is much too large and the mode of
representativity Cex officio) inappropriate for providing an adequate forum for informed discussions and
decision-making. In addition, each year, NARC is expected to review all the activities of the Institute,
much too large an agenda for adequate review of proposals and research results. Finally, it is not a
forum where the users of research (farmers and processors) can actively participate.
2.24       IER statutes. Under the 1990 law and decree, the new [ER remained as it was before, a
service of the Ministry of Rural Development, without administrative and financial autonomy. In
practice, it means that IER cannot open its own bank account and that it is subject to a priori control of



- 12 -
its expenditures. Its accounting system records only approximately 5% of total available funds, i.e., the
part of Government funding destined for operating expenditures. Civil servant salaries are directly paid
by the Public Administration, and the approximately 60% funded by external sources are recorded by
separate "project" accounting systems, or directly paid for by donor agencies. These "project accounts'
are audited by the donors according to thei. individual regulations. IER's accounts are kept by the
Ministry of Rural Development and are audited according to civil service regulations customary in Mali.
The Institute has never been audited by independent auditors.
2.25       JER organization and management. While there should be a clear distinction between the
scientific management of research content (i.e., the programs) and the management of research
installations and resources to carry out research (i.e., the experiment stations), the situation is presently
confusing as far as the prerogatives of each are concerned. The situation is further complicated by the
fact that the Strategic Plan envisions management of research by program while the 1990 Decree
instituted scientific departments. This has created a redundancy between research programs and
departments. Some departments already correspond to programs, others do not, thereby creating
confusion and inefficient bureaucratic overlays. The existing IER structure needs to be reviewed to
provide for a coherent management of research content on the one hand, and the management of
resources on the other, together with a mechanism to resolve unavoidable conflicts between the two.
2.26       Financial resources. At present, Malian agricultural research is highly dependent on outside
funding (para. 2.07). This dependence may not appear high when looking solely at the level of national
funding (39%). It is quite high however, when one considers that very little of these funds (15%) are
earmarked for operating expenditures and none for investments. External funding, on the other hand,
is mostly destined for directly identifiable research operating expenditures, technical assistance and
directly related investments. The result has been that for many years indirect research operating
expenditures, operation and maintenance of research installations, equipment renewal and general
overheads have been severely underfunded. Thus, the problem is not the level of government funding,
which is quite reasonable (para. 2.07), nor its stability. The problem is the enclave approach in funding
agricultural research, as practiced by the donors. De facto, government funding is in support of donor
activities by paying all local staff salaries, rather than the reverse. When government funds continue to
be earmarked for one category of expenditures across the board (i.e. salaries), it will be difficult to
spearhead the system by earmarking government funds for priority core research activities in accordance
with its own policies. The only way out of this dilemma is for government to change the system of
funding and better coordinate external funding.
2.27       Human resources management. There are a number of difficult issues that remain to be
resolved:
(a)   civil service regulations presently apply, whether for staff recruitment and transfer,
incentives schemes or lay off. These regulations are in general not compatible with the
performance requirements of a research institution, which requires flexibility in recruiting
and deploying staff as well as an incentive system that promotes and rewards excellence,
nor does it provide the grade and pay scales adequate for a scientific career path;
(b)  IER is faced with a difficult staffing situation. Almost half of the staff under the researcher
category have not been trained as scientists (para. 2.05), they only have BSc. level
education and many of them would not qualify for higher level training. At the same time,
a number of well-trained scientists will be returning from overseas. IER should be able to
offer them a position in the Institute, provided it has not already filled all its scientific slots;



- 13 -
(c)   within the context of the civil service reform and its streamlining under the ongoing
Agricultural SECAL (Cr. 2163-MLI), IER has been working on a cadre organique to
reduce its excess staff. However, none of this was based on well thought through position
profiles combined with objective staff evaluations. To improve efficiency, there remains
a need to reduce staff, whose qualifications no longer correspond to IER needs.
(d)  from its creation, a special unit within IER had a mandate for the planning and evaluation
of agricultural development programs and projects and for carrying out any special studies
as requested by the Ministry. This explains the relatively large number of social scientists
in the Institute, who are nct participating in research per se.
2.28       The selected scenario of the Strategic Plan (para. 2.19) requires 122 fully qualified scientists
during the first year. The number of scientists is proposed to increase to 140 by year 6. At present, IER
employs approximately 20 expatriate scientists. Even taking these into account, the available skills mix
is not compatible with the requirements of the Strategic Plan. The following disciplines are under
represented or not available at all: agroforestry, range management, bioclimatology, biometry, rural
engineering, weed science, forestry, and meat and milk processing. To correct this situation, which will
take time, the selected scenario provides for overseas training of about 50 scientists over the first six
years, including the requirements for the second phase of six years. However, this will need to be
reviewed when the Strategic Plan is going to be updated, three years hence (para. 3.04). The scenario
also recommends to regrade the large number of agricultural engineers who cannot be retained as
qualified scientists, as technicians, in order to augment the present limited number of support staff (only
0.7 technicians per scientist).
2.29       Accounting system.  Under the USAID-funded SPARC project (para. 3.36), IER has
recently completed the design of a new budgeting and accounting system. Unfortunately, this system
meets the requirements for the accounting of a 'project", not for a whole institute with financial
autonomy and apparented to a commercial firm. An accounting system that meets the requirements of
the new IER will have to be designed, implemented, and professional accountants recruited and trained
to run it.
2.30       Evaluation of past research results. For the elaboration of the Strategic Plan, an inventory
of past research results was made. However, it consisted of on-station research results. A list of
technologies presently recommended by various development organizations (CMDT, Ministry's services,
OHV, ON, etc.) was also elaborated. There are discrepancies between the two, and above all, except
for few ad hoc studies, these technologies have not been evaluated as to their adoption rate and impact.
In addition, past research results are often not well documented or accessible. There is a need therefore
to take stock and evaluate all past research results so as to constitute a data base to better design research
and extension activities.
2.31       The Strategic Plan represents a major step forward in defining research programs. It has
the merit of establishing priorities and defining a scope for research in line with the resources available
or likely to become available. In addition, because of their intensive participation, IER scientists are fully
committed to it. However, some programs need to be further thought out. Such is the case of the
programs on animal production, forestry and agro-forestry, natural resource management, and the
economics of commodity production, processing and marketing (economie de filleres). The research
approach in animal production and forestry has not been adjusted sufficiently to reflect the new conditions
of the country, in particular the degradation of the natural resource base, the evolving needs of the rural
populations and the changing market conditions. Nor does it take into account the lessons learned from



- 14 -
past research experiences in these areas, as far as user adoption is concerned. For the &conomie des
flWihres, a new program, the methodology and research approach need to be defined carefully, as well as
the relationship with other programs, i.e. the commodity programs and the production systems program.
2.32       Another problem of the Strategic Plan is the unrealistic scop- of the research ervisioned for
the second phase. It is not compatible with the country's and IER resources and management capabilities.
It would lead to over-investment in training, equipment and infrastructure, which would have to take
place during the first phase in preparation for the second one. However, more realistic investment
estimates have been developed during the course of project preparation with PPF funding and a revised
training and infrastructure investment plan was discussed during appraisal. At negotiations it was agreed
that a formal revision of the Strategic Plan would be comrleted in 1997 prior to the mid-term review of
the proposed project.
2.33       The research programming, monitoring and evaluation system within IER is presently
extremely weak. A process linking the short-term research activities proposed by individual scientists
to the Strategic Plan needs to be put in place. Independent external evaluations ('scientific audits') of
research projects under implementation and upon their completion are presently undertaken only within
the context of individual donor projects. The USAID funded SPARC project is providing technical
assistance to assist IER in the design of a research programming, monitoring and evaluation system.
2.34       Physical infrastructure. In general, there is sufficient land and buildings. However, in
addition to problems due to delayed maintenance, the present lay-out of the buildings and their internal
organization, is inefficient, and experimental land is poorly managed.
2.35       Experiment station management. Most experiment stations have farm managers who are
reasonably capable, but the station managers are often scientists with little professional knowledge of
farming operations. Serious under-funding of station operations and maintenance, and a lack of forward
planning, have led to practices that are detrimental to the quality of field experimentation. Major
problems are in the areas of: soil and seedbed preparation, equipment maintenance and calibration, a lack
of proper recording of field operations (plot history), and, most seriously, often forgotten soil
homogenization measures (cultivated fallow). To overcome these problems will require a professional
approach to station management, training, work programming, and better budgeting of station operations
and maintenance. Training has already started with PPF funding and will be further pursued under the
project.
III. THE PROIECT
A. Project Obiectives
3.01       The objective of the project is to implement the first six-year phase of the Strategic Plan for
National Agricultural Research (Chapter II.C). The principal objective of this Plan is to ensure that
adequate technology will become available to farmers as a means to increase agricultural growth and to
reverse the decline in the productive capacity of the natural resource base. The proposed project will
therefore aim at improving the performance of the national agricultural research system, by improving
research coherence, quality, relevance and accountability for results through institutional reforms.



- 15 -
3.02       In view of persistent limitations in the availability of resources, the proposed project will
help in focussing the national research effort on the priorities set forth in the Strategic Plan for
Agricultural Research. In doing so, the proposed project will emphasize: (a) the testing of technologies
developed elsewhere (to the extent possible, minimizing fundamental research); (b) expanding farmer-
participatory research and moving faster towards on-farm testing (strengthening internal linkages); and
(c) seeking regional collaboration in adapting promising technologies to local circumstances (strengthening
external linkages), thereby avoiding expensive duplication of effort and seeking economies of scale
through collaborative research. This is the broad outline of Government's agricultural research policy
and the yardstick for the approval of research proposals.
B. Summary Project Description
3.03        To meet these objectives, the project includes the following components:
(a)   Institutional Development:
(i)  transform the National Agricultural Research Council (NARC) into an entity, which
integrates user representatives and through which all official funding for agricultural
research is coordinated and screened;
(ii)  support the transformation of IER into an autonomous institution with an independent
Board of Directors, and reorganize and strengthen it; and
(iii)  regionalize research to bring it closer to its users;
(b)   Technology Transfer and User Participation:
(i)   develop interactive processes between farmers, extension agents and researchers
through farmer participation in setting research objectives and evaluating its results,
to ensure research relevance and to accelerate the dissemination of research results;
(ii)  create a pilot User Research Fund through which research users (farmers and
processors) will contract for specific research topics of interest to them;
(c)   Research Program Implementation and Management:
(i)  improve research quality and relevance through improved research programming,
monitoring and evaluation methods and procedures, characterized by users'
participation;
(ii)  provide research operating funds and introduce research contracting for the
implementation of the research programs;
(iii)  develop a scientific information, publication and documentation unit at IER; and
(iv)  strengthen external linkages and support the participation of Malian institutions and
scientists in regional and international collaborative research programs;



- 16 -

C. JraQt Detailed Features
Institutional Development
3.04       The National Agricultural Research Council (NARC) was transformed by Decree No.
93 384/P-RM of October 14, 1993 into a body in which Government, together with the users and the
major sources of Official Development Assistance (ODA) for agricultural research, will collaborate to
implement its national agricultural research policy. NARC has ultimate responsibility for defining
agricultural research strategy and consolidating all ODA and Government funding for agricultural
research. NARC provides the forum for Government and donors to reach agreement on agricultural
research policy and is their joint instrument to oversee its implementation. NARC's mandate includes
the regular updating of the Strategic Plan. At negotiations. it was agreed that the first such update will
be undertaken before December 31, 1997, as an input into the mid-term review (paras. 2.32 and 7.01
(a) and (b)).
3.05       Ultimately, NARC will only operate through the contracting out of research in line with the
priorities defined in the Strategic Plan (para. 2.19). However, the new system will be put in place
progressively, and therefore, until December 31, 1997, NARC will coordinate funding for IER in
accordance with annually agreed research programs, budgets and work plans. At negotiations. it was
agreed that thereafter. IER will be funded solely through contractual arrangements for individual research
proposals (para. 7.01 (c)).
3.06       NARC reviews all research proposals and mandates ioint independent financial and scientific
audits, i.e. for all donors, including Government. To execute its mandate in overseeing the national
agricultural research system and to administer its funding, NARC has three committees and a small
Permanent Executive Secretariat (PES), as follows (Chart l):
(a)  the Scientific Committee (SC) which reviews annually all new research proposals and
propose impact evaluations, mandates regular independent external reviews of ongoing
research programs, and subsequently reviews proposed adjustments;
(b)  the Financial Resources Committee (FRC) which reviews annually all budgets, their funding
and the external financial audits;



- 17 -
(c)  the Users CgmMit  (UC) consists of representatives of direct beneficiaries of research
results - herders, farmers and processors. It deliberates in local language, administer the
pilot User Research Fund and delegates representatives to NARC, the Scientific Committee
and IER's Board of Directors; and
(d)  the Permanent Executive Secretariat (PES), consisting of a highly qualified Research
Manager and a Finance Officer, supported by two secretarial/accounting staff.
At negotiations, it was aereed that the SC would mandate annually the external review of five research
programs. lt was also agreed that by June 30, 1997, all IER research programs would have been
revigewd (para. 7.01 (d)).
3.07       The approbation of the rules of procedures and the organization of NARC, acceptable to
IDA is a condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 7.02 (a)). It will include an implementation time
schedule for external reviews, research contracting arrangements (para. 3.09) and arrangements for the
channeling through NARC of Government funds destined for research. The nomination of the Research
Manae and Finance Officer in PES. with terms of reference. gualifications and experience acceptable
to IDA. is also a condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 7.02 (b)).
3.08       The National Agricultural Research Institute (IER) has been transformed by law from a
service in the Ministry of Rural Development (servlce rauach6) into a parastatal institution with full
financial and personnel management autonomy. The law established the Institute as an Etablissement
public a caractare abninistrartf (EPA), with an independent Board of Directors and a Director General.
IER's new organizational structure is presented in Chart 2. The Institution is managed by three Directors
and five Regional Center Directors, as follows:
(a)  the Scientific Director, together with four research coordinators, responsible for the
implementation of the research programs (paras. 3.18 and 3.20), each with a Program
Head;
(b)  the Director of Technical Support Services5, responsible for operating central laboratory
services in Sotuba, eight lead experiment stations and 13 substations, assisted by five
Regional Center Directors for Sotuba, Sikasso, Mopti, Niono and Kayes; and
(c)   The Director of Financial Resources, responsible for accounting, finance and the payroll.
The nomination of the Director General of IER and the three above Directors by the new Board of IER,
with terms of reference. qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA. is a condition of Credit
effectiveness (para. 7.02 (b)). Key to the success of IER's reorganization is the improvement of
accountability through delegation of authority.  Administrative management is decentralized and
streamlined with direct responsibility for budget execution to be given to Program Heads and Experiment
Station Managers.
51   The Director will combine this function with that of Deputv Director General.



- 18 -
3.09       Research conventions. A research convention commits IER to provide results according to
an agreed time schedule, taking into account available resources. Such conventions will be concluded
between IER and NARC for all Official Development Aid and Government funds. All conventions with
the private sector or with public enterprises will be concluded directly with IER. The progressive
introduction of research conventions serves three objectives:
(a)  to make the Institute and its scientists accountable fw results, the last payment on a
convention would only be made upon publication of the research results;
(b)  to progressively constitute a permanent working capital for IER through initial advances
paid prior to convention implementation; the level of IER's working capital would thus be
determined by its portfolio of conventions;
(c)  to improve management efficiency and avoid the scattering of resources: the funds can only
be used for specific research objectives; they are made available according to the terms of
the convention through invoicing for services rendered, rather than being reimbursed for
individual items.
All new research proposals will be managed on the basis of research conventions. Upon the completion
of the external review of each research program, its individual components ("research projects") will be
redefined in line with the recommendations of the review and will become the subject of research
conventions. A research convention comprises all direct research operating expenditures, indirect
expenditures for station operation and maintenance, personnel expenditures and a reasonable share of
IER's general overhead. IER will present prior to Credit effectiveness draft model research conventions
acceptable to IDA and approved by the Financial Resources Committee and NARC (para. 7.02 (c)).
3.10       Given the present situation of the Institution, where the full implementation of a performing
budgeting, budget control and accounting system is not expected before July 1, 1994, (para. 3.35), the
introduction of research contracting should be done gradually. Its completion is expected by December
31, 1997, when all research programs will have been the subject of an external evaluation (para. 3.05).
Government funding (through NARC) will be guided by a Performance Contract between the
Government and IER which will contain the scope of Government's contribution and key implementation
progress indicators (para. 5.19). Signatureg of this Contract is a condition of Credit effectiveness (para.
7.02 (d)).
Technology Transfer and User Partidpation
3.11       To ensure that the technologies developed respond to farmers' constraints and potential and
therefore stand a better chance of being adopted, well functioning linkages should be established between
the four main actors of the research and technology transfer system: the users and their organizations,
the extension agents, the production system scientists and, the commodity scientists. During appraisal,
IER scientists and extension agents from various development agencies met for a two-day workshop to
discuss technology transfer issues and linkages between research and extension.
3.12       The project will assist in the implementation of the workshop recommendations through
research contracting (para. 3.09) and improving scientist-farmer-extension agent linkages. The project
specifically provides for:



- 19 -
(a)  the implementation of a programming, monitoring and evaluation process that starts at the
grassroots level and involves the above four actors (Annex 2, Appendix 3);
(b)  the implementation of joint scientist-farmer-extension agent activities and events, such as
planned joint field days and experimental station visits;
(c)  the introduction of participatory research methodologies on a systematic basis, not only for
the production system program, but for all the commodity programs; inherent in these
methodologies are the joint conduct ar.J supervision of on-farm experimentation;
(d)  the additional costs of carrying out on-farm research for commodity scientists presently
working solely on-station (mainly for increasing mobility);
(e)  the technical training of agricultural extension subject matter specialists by scientists at their
regular meetings;
(f)  the training of subject matter specialists and scientists in communication techniques and team
work;
(g)  the implementation of an incentive system that rewards scientists for their work with farmers
and extension agents and for publications intended for the latter; and
(h)  the introduction of a joint research/extension impact evaluation system (para. 5.18).
3.13        Successful introduction of new technologies depends crucially on close interaction with the
users at all stages of technology development and in particular at a much earlier stage than the usual
ultimate one of technology testing and adapting. Participatory research methods are bringing all four
actors into play to ensure earlier farmer input. Farmers enter the decision-making process for:
(a) constraint analysis; (b) identification of potential solutions including farmers' indigenous knowledge;
(c) on-station technology evaluation; (d) on-farm testing and evaluation; and (e) technology diffusion.
The project will provide for training of commodity scientists, extension agents, farmers' representatives
in these methods and cover the costs associated with their implementation (paras. 5.15 and 5.16).
3.14        User research fund. Participatory research methods are a necessary condition for fostering
client-oriented research, equally important is the influence that the users are able to exert through their
participation in the NARC and its Scientific Committee. But these are not enough. Farmers should have
an additional way to access research, through their being able to contract for specific topics of interest
to them directly. To this effect, the User Committee of the NARC will manage a pilot research fund
made available to farmer or processor organizations. The idea is that farmer organizations, with
sufficiently developed managerial and technical skills represent a potential for bringing research closer
to its users, if they have financial muscle to exert more leverage over research priorities and portfolios.
The proposals financed through the user fund should not be redundant with the ones identified though
the regular programming procedures and participatory methodologies. This fund should be considered
as seed money to promote farmers' ideas and innovations. Research proposals, developed either by
farmers' organizations or through a collaboration between them and the scientists will be screened and
selected by the User Committee with the same rigor as research proposals presented by scientists. In
particular they will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee which will provide the User Committee with
a technical opinion. All expenditures including overhead will be covered through the User Fund as for
any other research convention (para. 3.09). The PES will manage the user fund according to the User



- 20 -
Committee's decisions. The user fund will be considered as a pilot fund, initially a small one (US$0.4
million) and its functioning will be closely monitored and reviewed at mid-term evaluation before it may
be replenished through a re-allocation of funds.
3.15       In order for users' representatives to be better prepared as research partners, training will
be provided for members of the User Committee as well as other farmer organizations' representatives
interested in collaborating with research. Training will include problem diagnosis, participatory research
methods, problem definition and identification of possible solutions based on indigenous knowledge. The
Permanent Executive Secretariat will manage the training funds and organize training events through
collaboration between service NGOs and IER production systems scientists.
Research Progrum Implementation and Management
3.16       Changes from the scenario adopted under the Strategic Plan. The research programs, made
up of projects and activities included in the first phase of the Strategic Plan will be implemented under
the project. A few adjustments to the Strategic Plan were agreed at the time of appraisal (para. 2.19):
groundnut and bottom-land rice research that had been placed under the second phase of the Plan were
brought forward; vice versa for research on floating rice. Another adjustment was the decision to open
the fifth regional center (Kayes) as early as the first phase of the plan to continue groundnut research
located solely in Kayes) and transfer small ruminant research away from Sotuba. These adjustments
were made for equity reasons. Lowland rice and groundnut cultivation are basically women's activities.
Kayes is a poor enclave region with agricultural potential, which has received little attention so far.
Finally, there is a need to further decentralize research activities away from Sotuba.
3.17       Termination of research activities.  According to the Strategic Plan and the above
adjustments, a number of research programs and activities will be terminated immediately: research on
tea, tobacco, dah, sugar cane, flood recession crops, wheat, floating rice and all horticulture and fruit
crops other than vegetables, citrus, and mangoes.  Scientists who have been working on these
commodities will prepare a full write-up of their results before being redeployed, by April of 1994.
3.18       Research programs and themes. All research programs to be implemented under the project
were reviewed during appraisal. Full agreement was reached on the objectives of all the crop research
programs and the fisheries program. However, it was agreed that the following programs would need
to be further developed or revised: cattle, small ruminants, poultry, production systems, natural resource
management, forestry, and Oconomie des ftihres (para. 2.31). It was agreed during appraisal that these
programs will be redefined before Credit effectiveness (para. 7.02 (e)). The agreed commodity and
fisheries research programs include cotton, millet, sorghum, maize, cowpea, groundnut, irrigated rice,
bottom-land rice, vegetables and fruits and fisheries. Details on individual research topics within these
programs are presented in Annex 4. No details are provided on programs that will be redefined prior
to Credit effectiveness.
3.19       Preliminary annual operating budgets for direct expenditures for each of the programs were
reviewed during appraisal. A tentative composition of the teams of scientists and technicians, by
program, discipline and station is presented in Annex 5.
Programming. Review and Evaluation
3.20       Effective research programs, that will produce replicable results, relevant for the users
require methods and proceaures tor research programming, review, and evaluation intended to improve
research quality and relevance. This will include:



- 21 -
(a)   setting in place programming and review mechanisms that involve research users at the local
and regional level (Annex 2, Appendix 3) up to the NARC level (paras. 3.06 and 5.08);
(b)  training of scientists in: proposal preparation (paras. 5.12 and 5.13); research methodology
design and statistical analysis (Annex 2, Appendix 1); and, participatory research
methodologies (paras. 5.15 and S.16);
(c)   regular  impact  evaluation  carried  out jointly  with  extension  services  and
external/independent program review (para. 5.18 and Annex 2, Appendix 2).
Documentation and Publication of Research Results
3.21        Inventory and evaluation of past research results. Past research results will be inventoried
and the documentation only available outside Mali will be repatriated. Existing results will be evaluated
as to their adoption rate and their impact on farmers' fields. The inventory will include a complete
bibliography for future referral by scientists and will become the basis for the building of a scientific data
base. The final document will serve as a reference for extension staff and for scientists to build upon
existing knowledge. This is a massive but necessary undertaking, which will require the support of the
CIRAD institutes and the participation of expatriate scientists who worked in Mali along with IER
researchers. Therefore, it was agreed at negotiations that the inventory and evaluation of past resear!h
results would be published by December 31. 1996 (para. 7.01 (e)). Mimeographed interim publications
by sector and discipline will be made available to scientists and extension staff upon completion. One
of the Research Coordinators will have specific responsibility for coordinating the preparation of the
inventory and getting it published.
3.22        Periodic highlights. IER will have a small publication service under the responsibility of
a scientific editor. He will be in charge of publishing the research highlights of the Institute in an annual
report. The report will include knowledge valuable for other scientists and extension staff, and only the
research results that have been sufficiently tested and evaluated on-farm to be recommended for
technology transfer. During negotiations, it was agreed that the first Annual Highlights will record the
results of the 1994 season and be Dublished by May 31. 1995 (para. 7.01 (f)).
3.23        Working paper series. Once the annual report publication is well etablished, IER will
undertake the publication of a numbered Working Paper Series, the purpose of which will be to enable
scientists to make their work known to the scientific community both inside and otutside Mali. Such a
publication will not replace publication in international scientific journals, but should be considered as
a first step towards it. It is aimed at helping scientists who experience difficulties in publishing in
international journals. The Series will come out only when there is matter for it. During negotiations.
it was agreed that a first publication would be expected by May 31. 1996 (para. 7.01 (g)). The scientific
editor will be responsible for organizing a series of courses on writing skills and scientific publication.
3.24        Publication for extension services and policy makers. Training of scientists will also be
necessary in oral and written communication intended for extension agents and policy-makers. Brochures
on specific themes for these audiences will be published by the scientific editor in collaboration with the
scientists concerned and with the extension services. At present, IER does not have a scientific editor,
and when hired, he will need at least two years of training. To avoid delaying the training of scientists,
the inventory and other scientific publications, IER will seek bilateral funding for long term (3 years)
technical assistance (para. 3.45). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the editor would be in
place by May 31. 1994 (para. 7.01 (h)).



- 22 -
3.25       Documentation. The documentation system will be developed into an integrated scientific
information system and consist of one center at IER's headquarters and secondary centers at the lead
experiment stations. IER will recruit specialized services to define the operation of the system, in
particular the role of headquarters vis a vis the secondary centers, and advise on the requirements for
equipment and training of staff as well as the purchasing of scientific publications, books and periodicals.
During negotiations. it was agreed that [ER will conclude by May 31. 1994, a turn-key contract with a
specialized institution, which will include all the above listed services (para. 7.01 (i)).
Participation in Collaborative Regional Research Programs (paras. 2.20 and 2.21)
3.26       NARC and TER will actively seek out scientific partners to collaborate on adaptive research
programs, to build upon a larger pool of scientific resources, and to benefit from economies of scale.
The collaborative programs should be acceptable to NARC (i.e. in accordance with the national Strategic
Plan). The components of the program to be implemented by other partners should be fully subscribed.
Malian scientists may be seconded to the country or a regional/international institution where the
collaborative program is being implemented. Alternatively, the program component may be suitable for
execution in Mali, in which case there is no need for such a secondment.
3.27       [ER participates in the first three regional collaborative programs to be constituted, i.e.
sorghum, small ruminant production and pathology, and natural resource conservation and management.
At present, the design of the regional sorghum program is the most advanced. IER presented the concept
of the program at the 13th SPAAR Plenary in the Hague in December 1992, where it was well received.
In the mean time, IER, INSAH and the ICRISAT Sahelian Center have agreed on a mode of collaboration
for the start-up of the program, which should ultimately also integrate the research activities on sorghum
executed by ICRISAT at its experiment station at Samanko. For the other two regional programs, IER
will invite scientists from Senegal and Burkina Faso, the lead countries for these programs, to participate
in the reformulation of its own national programs (para. 2.21) to ensure that they will be coherent with
the future regional concept.
3.28       Under the project, funding has been included for Mali's participation in regional
collaborative research programs. For the components to be implemented by IER, the costs are included
in the research and station budgets, but not separately identified, since these are the normal costs of the
national programs. Additional costs consist of the participation of Malian scientists in regional program
workshops, which are included under training as scientist participation in scientific conferences and
seminars (para. 3.43). The costs of regional program workshops, to be organized by Mali for the
sorghum program, are included under in-country training (para. 3.43). This does not cover the costs of
scientist participation from other countries, for which USAID has in principle agreed to make funds
available, which will be administered jointly by INSAH and the ICRISAT Sahelian Center until IER has
a performing accounting system, two years hence.
Resource Development and Management
Technical Support Services
3.29       The Director of Technical Support Services, together with the five Regional Center
Directors, will be responsible for the management of the physical resources of the Institute, investments
and purchasing. All infrastructure investments (experiment station rehabilitation, new infrastructure and
land development) will be the responsibility of a Technical Coordination Unit under the Director of
Technical Support Services. The design and supervision of works will be contracted out to architects and



- 23 -
engineering firms. The Technical Support services will also include a Central Purchasing Unit, which
will handle all international procurement of equipment and supplies and the procurement and distribution
of goods that can not be purchased locally at the location of the experiment stations.
3.30        Regional center and experiment station management. The existing 32 experiment stations
and permanent research sites have been reduced to 8 lead experiment stations and 13 substations. Their
distribution over the 5 regional centers is presented in Annex 6. Stations not retained in the negotiation
list will be closed. evidence of which will be presented prior to Credit effectiveness (para. 7.02 (f)) in
the context of the establishment of IER's initial balance sheet (para. 3.36). Further reduction of
substations will be considered on the basis of the results of an on-going agro-pedological survey.
Substations are generally within a radius of 50 kilometers of a lead station. Scientists will reside on the
lead research stations or in nearby towns, whereas on the substations only one technician will be resident.
3.31        Central service laboratories. The laboratories at Sotuba, which serve all the research
programs and also provide paid services for outside institutions, will be rationalized and re-grouped as
follows:
(a)   one laboratory for water, soil, and plant relationships (supported by KIT, Annex 9), which
will also include the animal nutrition laboratory and the dOsert4fication laboratory';
(b)  the food technology laboratory (supported by the SPARC Project) (Annex 9);
(c)  the seed certification laboratory; and
(d)  the fruits and vegetables post harvest technology laboratory (to be moved from its existing
location near Bamako because of road construction).
3.32       The Heads of the central service laboratories will report directly to the Director of Technical
Support Services. They will have separate budgets for their operating expenditures. Outside income will
be allocated to these budgets, as is presently the case for the soils laboratory. Under the project, a
charge-back system will be introduced. The field laboratories located at the lead experiment stations will
be managed by the scientists concerned with services to be provided by the Station Manager. Their
operating budgets are included in the research program budgets.
3.33        Cost recovery. Research and station budgets do not include the costs of seed production,
nor do the laboratory budgets include the costs of analyses for third parties. The budgets do include the
costs of germplasm maintenance. During negotiations. it was agreed that seed production and other
commercial activities for third parties (including Government services) will only be undertaken under
contract on the basis of full cost recovery, including a reasonable share of indirect production costs and
overheads (para. 7.01 (j)). Productive activities will be under the direct responsibility of the Experiment
Station Managers. They will present separate budgets for these activities and TER will only undertake
such activities on the basis of firm commitments. The accounting system will provide for separate
accounting of productive activities.
6/   These laboratories used to be separate before the merging of the two Institutes (para. 2.04). The
dAsertification laboratory used to be with the former Forestry Research Department and was part of a
now completed project.



- 24 -
Flnancial Resource Management
3.34       The Director of Financial Resources will be responsible for the management of the Institute's
finances. IER will have a consolidated accounting system. At IER Headquarters, the central accounting
services under the Director of Financial Resources will consist of: a general accounting unit; a budget
coordination and monitoring unit; a finances and billing unit; an inventory accounting unit; and a cash
management and pay-roll unit.
3.35       IER will recruit an experienced international accounting firm with terms of reference
acceptable to IDA, which will design and implement an integrated and computerized accounting, cost-
accounting and financial information system for both NARC and IER. The firm will also prepare IER
intial balance sheet. The firm should start its work by January 1994 and present a comprehensive system
by the end of March 1994 for review. The proposed accounting system, revised as need be, will be
introduced as of July 1, 1994. It will operate in parallel with the existing systems of individual donor-
funded projects within IER. Only after the new consolidated system has proven its value will the existing
systems be abandoned. Therefore, the new system should allow for the tracing of expenditures by
individual source of funds. The accounting firm will be responsible for the evaluation and training of
existing staff and the recruitment under contract of additional staff. It will have full responsibility for
presenting the financial statements of NARC and IER at the end of the 1994 fiscal year. The firm will
be released from this responsibility once these statements have been audited and the recommendations of
the independent auditor have been implemented. Thereafter, if needed, the firm may be requested to
continue its support in providing training and other services. Initial funds until Credit effectiveness will
be provided under PPF.
3.36       Under the USAID-funded SPARC Project, the University of Texas A&M is providing long
term technical assistance to assist IER in the implementation of the new accounting system. The SPARC
Project will also provide soft-ware and computers for the introduction of the system. Furthermore, Texas
A&M staff will assist the Director General and the future Director of Financial Resources in supervising
the implementation of the contract with the accounting firm. International recruitment of an independent
auditing firm and presentation of an audited initial balance sheet and the manual of accounting procedures.
ready for immediate implementation and acceptable to IDA will be a condition of Credit effectiveness
(para. 7.02 (t).
3.37       Internal audit. IER will have four essential operating manuals that will need to be formally
adopted by its Board of Directors:
*    the internal organization manual;
*    the personnel management manual;
*    the manual of accounting procedures; and
*    the procurement manual.
Other manuals, such as a station operations manual or laboratory manuals, that do not require Board of
Directors approval, may be added at a later stage. An internal organization manual, a draft of which was
reviewed at negotiations, will describe IER's internal organization, including terms of reference and
responsibilities for key management positions. It will also include the programming, review and
budgeting procedures, as well as the procedures for the participation of farmers and the extension services
in this process. Prior to its adoption by IER's Board, the internal organization manual will be presented
to the Scientific and Financial Resources Committee for comments. The accounting procedures and
procurement manuals will also be presented for comments to the donors represented in the Financial



- 25 -
Resources Committee. Adoption by IER's Board of the first three manuals acceptable to IDA is a
condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 7.02 (g)).  During negotiations, it was agreed that the
procurement manual. acceptable to IDA, will be adopted by June 30. 1995 (para. 7.01 (k)).
3.38        An internal audit unit will be created, ;irectly under the authority of the Director General,
and IER will recruit prior to Credit effectiveness an internal auditor with terms of reference and
qualifications acceptable to IDA (para. 7.02 (f)) who will have two assistants. The Internal Auditor will
be responsible for implementation control of the procedures described in the four manuals adopted by
IER's Board and present, when needed, proposals for their improvement.
Human Resources Development and Management
3.39        Under the Director General, the three Directors will have joint responsibility for human
resources management and development, supported by a Human Resources Management Unit. This unit
will have overall responsibility for personnel management. This includes: constituting and updating staff
records, organizing the annual staff evaluation, staff and consultant recruitment, and organizing training.
The recruitment of the Unit Head is a condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 7.02 (b)).
3.40        As of December 31, 1996, all IER staff will be employed under contract (either permanent
or temporary). Civil service staff for whom there will be no position in the new organization will remain
with the Ministry of Rural Development as civil servants. Scientific staff will be managed under a
separate statute, the first draft of which has been reviewed. This statute defines career paths and the
salary structure, as well as the evaluation procedures for grade changes.  Non-scientific staff in
managerial positions with MSc. level academic credentials (directors, experiment station and laboratory
managers and a few accounting staff) will follow the same classification as the researchers. The adoption
of this statute, which will provide for salary levels above civil service salaries, is a condition of Credit
effectiveness (para. 7.02 (h)). The career paths and salary levels of permanent non-scientific technical
and administrative staff will be defined in the personnel management manual (para. 3.37), which will
also include the general employment conditions for all staff, i.e. housing allocation and allowances,
vehicle allocation, transport allowances and per diem, etc.. A first draft of this manual was reviewed
prior to negotiations.
3.41        Initial staff evaluation. All permanent staff will be subject to an initial evaluation to
determine their new grades and where they fit in the new salariy structure. Scientific staff (paras. 2.05,
2.27 and 2.28) will be evaluated by an initial evaluation committee of independent external scientists7
on the basis of a dossier (extended curriculum vitae and publications) to be prepared by each scientist,
and an interview. Prior to negotiations. initial training was provided by a human resources development
specialist for scientists to prepare their dossiers. Initial evaluation criteria will be the following: academic
credentials, seniority, scientific accomplishments, relations with farmers and extension services, and
services rendered to IER or other institutions (teaching and training assignments, other responsibilities).
Research staff with a BSc. will only be considered for a scientist position if they have a minimum of 10
years research experience. The initial evaluation committee will present recommendations as to the
adequacy of the education and experience for the research program to which the scientist is or will be
assigned and additional long and short term training needs. The initial evaluation committee may
recommend to re-assign staff outside IER. At negotiations. it was agreed that JER will limit recruitment
7/   Including Malian scientists outside IER, scientists from neighboring countries and independent international
scientists. The initial evaluation committee will consist of 15 persons. Five sub-committees will be created
of three evaluators each by broad disciplinary area of expertise.

so that the total number of scientists will not exceed 140 by December 31. 2000. in accordance with the
Strategic Plan (para. 7.01 (1)).
3.42       The initial evaluation of technicians will be done by an ad hoc committee of IER scientists
and managers. Their total number is expected to reach 170 by December 31, 1999, of which 130 would
be assigned to the research programs and 40 to experiment station operations. This could absorb all
technical staff not classified as scientists following their initial evaluation. Accounting staff will be
evaluated by the accounting firm (para. 3.35) and other support staff will be initially evaluated by their
immediate managers and recommendations will be formulated by an ad hoc committee of managers. The
procedures for regular annual evaluations of all staff will be included in the personnel management
manual.
3.43       Training. An initial training plan based on a survey of IER scientists was reviewed during
appraisal. This plan was based on personal appreciation and did not take into account the requirements
of the Institute. A comprehensive plan for long and short-term training will be presented following the
initial evaluation. Preliminary estimates of training costs for scientists to be funded under the Credit are
based on the first survey and include eight 2-year overseas scholarships for MSC. and PhD. education,
and twenty 3-month overseas courses, including PhD training, based on research undertaken in Mali, with
short-term course requirements abroad. Additional funds for overseas training are available from bilateral
donors and are included in the project costs. Also included are ten 2-week and thirty 1-week in-country
training seminars for groups of scientists on specific subjects, such as: research proposal presentation,
scientific publication and post-academic training by foreign scientists and participation in scientific
conferences and seminars.
3.44       On-the-job training for accounting staff is included in the contract with the accounting firm
(para. 3.35). A special training plan was prepared during appraisal for station management staff and
technicians, including nine 2-year scholarships for MSc. training at the University of Arkansas. Also
included are ten 2-week in-country training courses for station operation staff and technicians. A first
course took place in 1992 with PPF funding. A second course is being organized for January 1994 to
be funded under the SPARC project. In the future, these courses will be organized under a partnership
agreement with the University of Arkansas. It is expected that in three years time the conduct of these
courses will be taken over by IER staff. Laboratory technicians, tractor drivers, equipment operators and
workshop staff will be tested to determine on-the-job training needs. Special training will be provided
for the members of the Users Committee (para. 3.15) and the training of commodity scientists, extension
agents and farmer representatives in participatory research methodologies. Also included are thirty 2-day
training seminars for subject matter specialists in the extension services. A preliminary training plan is
presented in Annex 7. The personnel management manual (para. 3.37) will stipulate that staff benefiting
from long term training will be required to stay with the Institution for at least five years after
successfully completing their studies.
3.45       Technical assistance. Long term technical assistance to TER is expected to be provided by
bilateral donors. Specifically, the USAID funded SPARC project will support research programming,
monitoring, evaluation, budgeting, accounting and financial management. Other long term technical
assistance provided by bilateral donors (mainly USAID, The Netherlands and France) includes the posting
of scientists under partnership arrangements with foreign universities and other institutions (KIT, CIRAD,
ORSTOM, etc.). IER will seek bilateral funding for the recruitment of a scientific editor for a period
of three years (para. 3.24). IDA funding will focus on short term assistance (both local and foreign) for:
the independent external research program reviews organized by NARC; the initial evaluation of IER



- 27 -
scientists; the in-country training in experiment station management; and the design and supervision of
experiment station rehabilitation. Some specific areas, that are complementary to bilateral technical
assistance, will also be eligible for short term support, such as: support for the biometry function
(experimental design, data analysis and data storage and dissemination), the in-country training in
research proposal presentation and scientific publication, and the training on participatory research
methodologies. For a number of these areas of support, partnership arrangements will be sought with
foreign institutions to ensure continuity. IER will enter into contracts with an institution specialized in
scientific information documentation and dissemination, an auditing firm, an international accounting firm
and local architectural and engineering firms for the rehabilitation of its research installations.
Physical Plant and Equipment Rehabilitation and Development
3.46       Capital investments to be funded under the project will include:
(a)  the rehabilitation of IER's headquarters in Bamako, experiment stations (buildings and
grounds) and laboratories to be retained in the system (para. 3.30), and
(b)  laboratory, agricultural and computing equipment; vehicles; and publications, library and
communication equipment.
3.47        IER's headquarters in Bamako will be modernized, in particular to make adjustments to
allow for modern communications and the installation of computer equipment. Other investments will
include the establishment of a research information system, which will involve bringing under a single
improved management system   the documentation, library, databases and publication facilities.
Investments will include neceseary adaptations in IER's Headquarters, the purchase of scientific
publications, software, improved communications and computer network systems, and better coordination
and communication with existing documentation centers within Mali and elsewhere.
3.48        A detailed inventory was undertaken during project preparation and funded under PPF.
Rehabilitation of remaining installations will focus on internal coherence of existing buildings and making
them functional. Limited additional construction for office space and laboratories will be undertaken only
to facilitate regionalization, i.e., moving scientists to lead experiment stations, away from Bamako and
Sotuba. Houses on the lead experiment stations will be rehabilitated but no new housing will be provided
since the lead experiment stations are all within commuting distance from an urban center. Rehabilitation
of substations will not be undertaken during the first part of the project (until mid-term review). The
need to continue operating the substations will be carefully evaluated at the mid-term review.
Rehabilitation of the remaining substations will be envisioned during the second phase of the project,
based upon the evaluation. It will be limited to operational buildings (equipment sheds, grain stores and
drying floors) and the technician's house, if needed. No disbursements will be made for rehabilitation
of substations until the mid-term review of the project (para. 7.03 (a)).
3.49        Experimental fields will be rehabilitated on lead experiment stations and, during the second
phase of the project, on the substations retained after mid-term review. The purpose is to provide for
a better lay-out of experimental plots; erosion control, land leveling, drainage and, where necessary,
irrigation; internal communications (field roads); and fencing. Before the preparation of architectural and
engineering designs for experiment station rehabilitation, IER will prepare Experiment Station
Development Plans. Such plans will indicate the future use of buildings and grounds, including:
proposed building occupation and working relationships, intemal communications, perimeter fencing,
experimental field lay-out (based on soils and topographical data, crop rotation, regeneration
requirements, etc.), and staff housing. The rationalization and modernization of the central service



- 28 -
laboratories will be preceded by a laboratory study, including number and type of analyses per year and
equipment requirements. No disbursements for civil works and land improvement will be made under
the Credit at any given location until IER has prepared an Experiment Station Development Plan
acceptable to IDA. the land has been officially transferred to [ER, and excess land and buildings have
been leased or sold (para. 7.03 (b)).
3.50       Most of the equipment to be bought under the project will be for renewal or modernization.
In the case of agricultural, library, communication and computing equipment, additional equipment is
included to improve the quality (e.g. soil preparation equipment) or efficiency (e.g. CDROM equipment)
of the operations. Field operations will be mechanized to the extent possible to improve research quality
and timeliness. This will require the procurement of 26 tractors (including renewal). To facilitate
commuting, 10 buses are to be procured. Under the project approximately 123 vehicles will be renewed.
The presentation of an Agricultural Equipment Profile for each of the 8 lead experiment stations and
surrounding substations. of a Laboratory Study (para. 3.49), and of a Computerization Plan. will be
a condition of disbursement for equipment (para. 7.03 (c)). IER has retained the services of a consultant
to assist in preparing the Agricultural Equipment Profiles. The Computerization Plan will be prepared
following the completion of the design of the accounting system (para. 3.35), and will also include
scientific, station, laboratories, documentation and publication requirements.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
4.01       The overall agricultural research activities have been considered as a capital good and
consequently project costs have been calculated to include both ongoing and new research activities,
irrespective of the financing source. Costs also include preparation and start-up activities financed under
PPF.
4.02       The total base cost of the project, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at 28.2 billion CFAF
(US$104.5 million equivalent). Base cost estimates reflect April 1993 prices. Physical contingencies
amounting to US$1.2 million are estimated to be 10-15% of civil works, depending on the site, and their
total amounts to 1% of base cost. (Physical contingencies were applied only to civil works and not to
other investment costs, where quantities have been clearly identified at appraisal). Price contingencies
amounting to US$6.0 million, representing about 6% of base cost and 5% of total cost are based on
average annual forecasts of international inflation for foreign supplied goods (2.8% per annum), and on
estimated annual inflation in Mali for local costs (2.5% per annum). The foreign exchange portion of
the total project cost is 51 %. A summary of total project cost of US$111.7 million equivalent is given
in Table 4.1. A detailed breakdown by year and component is given in Annex 8.

Note: Numbers may not add due to rounding.
B. Financing
4.03           The proposed IDA credit of US$20.0 million equivalent would finance 18%  of project
costs, net of taxes and duties. Financing would cover: civil works (new construction, rehabilitation
of existing facilities and on-station development), vehicles and equipment, training, technical
assistance and consultant services, and operating costs (both existing and incremental). Incremental
and non-incremental operating expenditures have been considered a capital good and therefore eligible
for IDA financing.
4.04           The Malian Government would finance 16%  of total project costs (US$17.9 million
equivalent). IER would contribute US$0.8 million from its earnings from sales of produce.
Government funding would cover 26% of total research operating expenditures.
4.05           Expected donor financing, based on present commitments, would total US$47.8 million
equivalent. The financing gap of US$25.2 million, represents other donor funding that is expected
to contirue beyond the individual project periods of the various donors, which has not yet been
committed but is assumed to continue. The financing plan is summarized in table 4.2 below, and
financing by individual donor is detailed at Annex 9.

under the expectation that these costs will continue to be funded by donors under follow -,; projects.
C. Government Budget Impact
4.06         The 1991-93 Government budgetary allocation for IER operating expenditures stands
on the average at CFAF 825 million per annum (US$3.05 million equivalent). Government has been
supporting agricultural research regularly. Over the project period, Government is expected to
continue to support research at the same level, adjusted for the estimated local inflation rate. During
the 6 year project period, Government's contribution net of taxes and duties would represent CFAF
4.8 billion (US$17.9 million equivalent), with each annual contribution estimated to increase by 2.5%
(the average estimated local inflation rate). This represents 16% of total project costs.
D. Procurement
4.07         The table below summar-'es the project elements and their estimated costs and proposed
methods of procurement. Figures are, however, indicative, as the objects of IDA financing will be
set each year in the light of the annual work program and other available funding.

4.08          The Institut d 'Economie Rurale (TER) is the principal implementing agency responsible
for carrying out the project, including all procurement of works and goods. The NARC, starting in
the fourth year of the project, will be responsible for administering all research conventions as
detailed in paragraph 3.09. This is the first IDA project in Mali using IER as principal implementing
agency. For this reason, a procurement procedures manual will be adopted by June 30, 1995 (para.
3.37). During appraisal, Standard Bidding Documents for Goods and for Works (Smaller Contracts)
and Letter of Invitation and Sample Form of Contract for Consultants' Services were discussed with
IER staff. During negotiations. it was aereed that the use of IDA's Sample Bidding Documents.
modified to suit the project requirements. will be mandatory for all procurement financed by IDA.

It was also agreed that for fixed-price contracts. the invitations to bid will include price adjustment
provisions in case the award is delayed beyond the bid validity period specified in the bidding
document (para. 7.01(n)).
4.09       The legal framework for public sector procurement in Mali consists of: (a) Law
No. 90-06/AN-RM of February 19, 1990, creating the Directorate General of Public Sector
Procurement (Direction G6n6raIe des March/s Publics); (b) Decree No. 90-030/P-RM of even date
establishing the organization and functions of the above-mentioned Directorate; and (c) Decree
No. 92-059/P-CTSP of February 14, 1992, establishing in detail the responsibilities of all entities
concerned with public sector procurement. The local competitive bidding procedures provided by
the latter Decree are acceptable to IDA.
4.10       Civil works contracts to be financed by IDA (US$4.6 million) would be procured under
local competitive bidding. This procurement procedure is warranted by the dispersed nature of the
works over 25 geographically widely dispersed sites, which makes packaging of the bids in large lots
impossible. The works involve construction and renovation of building and laboratory facilities at
IER headquarters and at 8 experiment stations and the substations retained after the mid-term review
(para. 3.48), and on-station development (irrigation networks, access roads, etc.) at experiment
stations and substations.
4.11       Goods financed by IDA would include vehicles, furniture, office equipment, laboratory
equipment, agricultural equipment, scientific equipment, audio-visual equipment, materials, spare
parts and training materials, and would be packaged in lots of US$200,000 or more and procured
using international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (May 1992). Contracts for goods procured under international
competitive bidding would total US$4.7 million. In the case of specialized scientific and agricultural
equipment, where only a limited number of suppliers exist that can meet product specifications,
procurement would follow limited international bidding procedures (US$ 1.0 million); prior agreement
from IDA would be needed on the justification for limited international bidding and on the list of
potential suppliers. The purchase of minor spare parts and replacement of small quantities of vehicles
and equipment, estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per package, with an aggregate limit of
US$300,000, would be procured using local and international shopping procedures (minimum three
quotations), or IAPSO (Inter-Agency Procurement Service of the United Nations Development
Program).
4.12       Consultant contracts financed by IDA would be procured on a competitive basis in
conformity with World Bank Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by
the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). Prior IDA review would not apply to
consultant contracts estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent. However, this estception
would not apply to the terms of reference for such contracts, to the employment of individuals, to
single-source selection or continuation, and to assignments of critical nature, as well as to
amendments raising the contract value to US$100,000 equivalent or above. Until December 1996,
the project will finance research activities as IER operating costs. After that date, research activities
will be carried out under contractual arrangements between IER and NARC, with IER using its in-
house capacity (para. 3.09).
4.13       During the first year of the project, IDA financed works contracts above a threshold of
US$200,000, and goods contracts above US$100,000 would be subject to IDA's prior review.
Thereafter, and subject to review of IER's ability to handle procurement satisfactorily, the threshold
will be increased to US$500,000 and US$200,000 respectively. Assurances were obtained at



- 33 -
negotiations that such a review will be undertaken after the first year of implementation. The review
process is expected to cover about 80% of the value of works and goods contracts, and 90% of
contracts for consultant services. The Project Procurement and Implementation Schedule is outlined
at Chart 4.
4.14       During negotiations, it was agreed that procurement information will be collected and
recorded as follows (para. 7.01 (n)):
(a)   prompt reporting of contract award by borrower; and
(b)   comprehensive 6-monthly reports by NARC and IER to IDA indicating:
(i)  revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract
award, and completion time for individual contracts; and
(ii)  compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.
Procurement relating to co-donors' financed components will be carried out according to their own
procedures.
E. Disbursement
4.15       A schedule of disbursements is at Annex 10. The actual distribution of the proceeds of
the IDA Credit will be done on the basis of annual work programs. Hence, the allocation of
disbursement categories (Table 4.4) is only indicative. All categories will finance 100% of eligible
expenditures, except for civil works, where 100% of foreign expenditures and 95% of local
expenditures will be financed. All disbursements will be net of taxes and duties. IDA financing is
shown at 100% because other donors and government will provide parallel financing for similar
expenditures. The expected closing date is December 31, 2001.

A/    The term 'operating costs' means operating costs for contractual staff, travel allowances, operating and mnaintenance costs of
vehicles, equipment and buildings, utilities, communications, insurance, office supplies, research and laboratory supplies.
4.17         To expedite disbursements and ensure that funds for the project are available when
needed, Government would open two Special Accounts: Special Account A, operated by the NARC,
and Special Account B, operated by IER. Upon -fTectiveness, IDA would advance US$250,000 in
Special Account A, and US$500,000 in Speci-. Account B, representing about four months'
expenditures. IDA would replenish the Special secounts upon receipt of satisfactory proof of
incurred expenditures and evidence that such expenditures were eligible for financing. Monthly bank
statements and reconciliation of the Special Account statements would accompany replenishment
requests.
4.18         Disbursements of the IDA credit would be fully documented except for incremental
operating costs and contracts valued at less than US$20,000, which would be against Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs). Documentation for withdrawals under SOEs would be retained at NARC and
IER for review by IDA staff during supervision missions and for regular annual audits.
4.19         Research conventions (para. 3.09) will be progressively introduced. As from January
1, 1997, all research and station operating expenditures and overheads will be disbursed through
research conventions.  At that time, disbursement for operating expenditures directly to IER will
cease. No investment in civil works, equipment, training and consulting services will be included
under these conventions. NARC will administer the research conventions and make payments as
agreed under the terms of the convention. Draft standard research conventions will be presented to
IDA for approval prior to Credit effectiveness (para. 7.02 (c)).



- 35 -
4.20       During negotiations, it was agreed that IER's research programs and annual budgets will
be submitted for IDA's approval by December 15th of each year. after having been agreed upon by
N_ARC (para. 7.01(o)).
4.21       No disbursement for rehabilitation of substations will be made prior to the mid-
term review (para. 7.03 (a)).
4.22       No disbursement for civil works and land improvement will be made under the
proposed Credit at any given location until the land has been ofricially transferred to IER at
that location, IER has presented an Experiment Station Development Plan acceptable to IDA.
and excess land and buildings have been transferred to the Ministry of Rural Development,
leased or sold (para. 7.03 (b)).
4.23       No disbursement for equipment will be made before IER has presented: (i) an
Agricultural Equipment Profile for each of the 8 lead experiment stations and surrounding
substations. (ii) a Laboratory Study, and (iiiO a computerization Plan (para. 7.03 (c)).
F. Accounting. Finance. Administration and Audit
4.24       Separate accounting of project expenditures would be kept. IER would keep accounts
relating to the components under its management, and NARC for its own expenditures and those
related to research conventions. An experienced international accounting firm with terms of reference
acceptable to IDA, will be recruited with PPF financing to design and implement an integrated,
computerized accounting, cost-accounting and financial information system for both NARC and IER
(para. 3.35). Accounts would be kept according to internationally accepted accounting standards to
cover as a minimum all expenditures, reimbursements received, commitments and donor funds
position.
4.25       To ensure timely availability of counterpart funds, IER and NARC will each establish,
not later than September 30 of each year, their quarterly budget funding requirements. Government
will confirm its budgetary commitment by December 31 and will deposit, in advance, its annual
budgetary contributions, in quarterly tranches, into NARC and IER accounts at a commercial bank
acceptable to IDA. Agreement to this effect was obtained during negotiations (para. 7.01 (p)). It
was also agreed that Government will channel its funds directly to IER, except for funds destined to
finance research conventions, which will be channeled through NARC. Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that as from December 31. 1996. all Government funds will be channeled through
NARC (para. 7.01 (q)).
4.26       The NARC and IER accounts, project accounts and Special Accounts would be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit reports would be submitted to IDA
within six months of the end of br- IER fiscal year; these reports would be of such scope and in such
detail as IDA may reasonably request, including a statement on the adequacy or otherwise of the
accounting systems and internal controls, the reliability of statements of expenditures as a basis for
loan disbursements, the operation and use of the Special Accounts, compliance with financial
covenants, and whether or not IDA funds have been used for their intended purpose. The above was
agreed upon during negotiations (para. 7.01 (r)). The recruitment of the auditors on a three-year
renewable contract is a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 7.02 (f)).

4.27       During negotiations, it was agreed that Government would prepare a project completion
report within six months of the Credit closing date (para. 7.01 (s)).
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Institutional Reform
The National Agricultural Research Council (NARC)
5.01       The membership in NARC's Committees and IER's Board of Directors provides for a
balance between fl officio and non- officio members. The non-_ officio members will be selected
for their professional expertise. To build confidence in the system, it is important that the selection
procedure be transparent. During appraisal it was agreed that all non-ex officio members, with the
exception of the members of the Users Committee, will be selected by an ad hoc Search and
Selection Committees. Staff of IER cannot be on a Search and Selection Committee. Terms of
reference for a Search and Selection Committee will be issued by the Council, which will also decide
on its composition (generally not more than three). The detailed composition of NARC, its
Committees and IER's Board of Directors is in Annex 11.
5.02 Membership and meetings of NARC. NARC will have 9 voting members including the
president, who will be a renowned scientist. The Sector Directors of the Ministries of Rural
Development and the Environment, and the Director General will participate in NARC meetings as
non-voting members. There will be one mandatory meeting of the Council in November of each
year. Under specific circumstances, an additional meeting can be held. Such will be the case to
deliberate on the national agricultural research policy, and in particular to decide on changes in the
Strategic Plan, which will be updated before December 31, 1997, prior to the mid-term review of
the project (para. 3.04).
5.03       Functions of NARC. Under the authority of the Minister of Rural Development, NARC
will be responsible for the preparation of the national agricultural research policy and strategy and
will supervise its implementation. It will also provide a forum for the dialogue and coordination
between the different parties interested in research, in particular, the donors and the beneficiaries of
research results.
NARC will have the following functions:
a)   periodically update the strategic plan for agricultural research;
b)   prepare the terms of reference for external scientific evaluations, examine the results of
these evaluations, and propose the implementation of those which recommendations
deemed relevant;
c)   examine the scientific quality and the relevance of new research proposals and propose
the implementation of those retained by the Scientific Committee;



- 37 -
d)   propose a financing plan for all agricultural research upon recommendation by the
Financial Resource Committee, taking into account the financial implications of new
research proposals and external scientific evaluations;
e)   propose terms of reference for joint external financial audits, acceptable to all donors,
including the Government, who make up the Financial Resource Committee and
examine the results to verify that the funds have been used as planned under the agreed
upon research programs;
f)   examine and approve the research conventions with TER or any other entity carrying out
research in the field of agriculture.
5.04       Functions of the Scientific Committee (SC). The SC will have 11 members, including
the chairman, who will be a renowned scientist. There will be one mandatory meeting in October
of each year to:
(a)  review all new research proposals;
(b)  prepare terms of reference for and propose the composition of the independent program
review teams (generally not more than three members);
(c)  review the recommendations of the independent review teams and subsequent program
adjustments proposed by IER; and
(d)  review the terms of reference and the proposed methodology for the technology impact
evaluations,  and  formulate  recommendations  based  on  their  results
(Annex 2, Appendix 2).
Recommendations of the Committee are presented to the Financial Resources Committee (FRC) and
NARC. Additional meetings will be called to deliberate on the Strategic Plan's update.
5.05       With respect to the definition of the national agricultural research policy, and in
particular the regular updating of the Strategic Plan, the SC will propose terms of reference for
review by the FRC and adoption by NARC. These terms of reference will include national
agriculture sector priorities to which research should respond, resources allocated to those, the
mandate of each research institution, the relations with regional and international research, and
propose the process to be followed by the Permanent Executive Secretariat and IER to update the
Strategic Plan. The process will describe the roles of IER's Program Committee and Regional
Technical Committees, as well as the involvement of the extension services and the users. Once the
update is completed, the SC will review the results and present these with its recommendations to the
FRC and NARC for adoption.
5.06       Functions of the Financial Resources Committee (FRC). The FRC will be chaired by
a high level civil servant the Ministry of Finance and include representatives of all the donors funding
agricultural research in Mali (Annex 9). There will be one mandatory meeting in October/November
of each year, preferably immediately following and partly coinciding with the SC meeting, to:
(a)   analyze the financial implications of the recommendations of the Scientific Committee;



- 38 -
(b)  review funding arrangements for all agricultural research and coordinate between
different sources of funds;
(c)   monitor the introduction of research contracting arrangements (para. 3.10) and review
the annual report and operations of the Permanent Executive Secretariat (PES); and
(d)   decide on joint donor participation in and funding of external scientific reviews and
financial audits.
Additional meetings will be called to review SC recommendations on changes in the Strategic Plan.
The FRC will present its views on SC recommendations and funding arrangements to NARC for
adoption.
5.07       Composition and functions of the Users Committee (UC). Constituting the UC presents
some specific difficulties. There are many organized rural associations. Some are very specialized
and do not necessarily represent the interests of a large percentage of the rural population. The
representation of their leaders could also be questionable, as well as the strength of their managerial
and organizational skills. Hence, few may have the potential to become research partners. There
is therefore a need to investigate existing organizations to identify potential partners. Another aspect
of the issue is the nation-wide effort to transfer some of the responsibilities presently carried out by
government and public agencies to organized rural groups. The Government established a special
commission (Mission sur la D&centralisation) to determine how this transfer could be done. The
efforts to build upon farmer organizations under the present project will be linked to this undertaking.
The composition of the first Users Committee and procedures to replace its members, including
criteria for selection, will be determined through a local consultation with PPF financing.
5.08       The UC will have two functions:
(a)  through the operation of the pilot User Research Fund (para. 3.14) let research
conventions that are of immediate interest to farmer organizations; and
(b)  through the delegation of one of its members to NARC, and two to the SC and IER's
Board of Directors influence agricultural research policy, decisions on the research
agenda, and improve transparency in decision making.
5.09       Composition and functions of the Permanent Executive Secretariat (PES). The PES will
consist of a Research Manager, a Finance Officer and two secretarial/accounting staff. The
Secretariat will be responsible for day-to-day implementation of policy decisions and have the
following tasks:
(a)  to organize with IER the preparation and regular updating of the Strategic Plan
according to terms of reference prepared by the SC and adopted by NARC;
(b)  to prepare guidelines for research proposal presentation (in collaboration with IER
(para. 5.12)), progress reporting, financial accountability, and the preparation of
standard research conventions (para. 3.09);



- 39 -
(c)  to act as a secretariat to the NARC, SC and FRC, organize their meetings, disseminate
their reports and organize the recruitment of the non-a officio members through the
ad bD& Search and Appointment Committees (para. 5.01);
(d) to act as a secretariat to the UC, organize their meetings and follow up on the
implementation of research conventions let by the UC; and
(e)  to ensure the appropriate and timely mobilization and administration of funding from
national and external sources, including the administration of the User Research Fund.
The Permanent Executive Secretary (the Research Manager) will be proposed by a selection
committee consisting of three NARC members, designated by the chairman, and the Director General
of IER. The composition of NARC, the SC, and the FRC is stipulated in the Decree creating
NARC. Their renewal procedures and modus operandi will be specified in NARC's procedures
manual, a draft of which was reviewed at negotiations (para. 3.07).
The National Agricultural Research Institute (IER)
5.10       Functions of IER's Board of Directors. IER's Board of Directors will consist of 9
voting members including the president who will be the Minister of Rural Development. Whereas
NARC and its Committees will provide for joint (Government and donors) and independent scientific
oversight and coordination of funding, IER's Board will provide for management oversight. Its
functions will specifically include:
(a)   monitor the implementation of NARC's decisions affecting IER;
(b)   propose the appointment of the Director General and define his/her mandate (five years,
once renewable)8;
(c)  appoint the Scientific Director, the Director of the Technical Support Services, and the
five Regional Center Directors upon recommendation of the Director General;
(d)  decide on management policy by adopting the four management operation manuals
(para. 3.37) and deciding on their modification upon recommendation of the Director
General; and
(e)   approve the annual budget and financing plan, verify implementation of audite
recommendations and approve the annual accounts.
The statutes of IER will provide for two mandatory Board meetings each year: once before the end
of the fiscal year and following NARC's meeting in November to approve the budget and financing
plan, and secondly, following the annual audit to formally approve JER's accounts.
8/   The Director General will be selected by an ad hoc Search and Selection Committee under terms of
reference issued by the Board. His nomination will be confirmed by Decree of the Minister of Rural
Development.
2/   IER's statutes will provide for the nomination by the Board of an independent auditor.

B. Research Management
The Planning Process
5.11       Planning and programming of agricultural research in Mali recognizes three levels:
(a)   strategic planning. NARC is responsible for the preparation, regular review and
updating of the National Strategic Plan for Agricultural Research (para. 3.04). External
program evaluations, every three years, are one of the inputs for the strategic planning
exercise. The Strategic Plan provides broad guidelines and only identifies research
themes, their priorities for the long term and an envelope of resources.
(b)  research proposal preparation.  The scientists, in liaison with extension agents and
the users, must then develop these themes into full-fledged research proposals. NARC
reviews and approves a proposal with its budget, which implies that the resources
necessary for its implementation have been committed for the duration of the research
project, unless the external review of the program to which the project belongs calls for
adjustments.
(c)   annual review, programming and budgeting. Though activities and resources have
been a freed upon at research project approval stage, they have to be adjusted annually
in lig it of previous year results. A detailed annual budget also needs to be prepared.
A detailed description of the research programming and review cycle is presented in Annex 2,
Appendix 3, and Chart 3.
Research Proposal Preparation
5.12       The Scientific Director of IER will prepare in close collaboration with the PES detailed
guidelines for research proposal preparation and presentation and will provide Program Heads and
scientists with regular training in their use. The first such training will take place prior to the start
of the 1994 programming and review process, that is before March 1994. In principle a research
proposal should always include the following elements:
*    a constraints analysis
*    problem definition
*    a "state-of-the-art" of research results, not only in-country but including a review
of on-going research in neighboring countries as well as results from international
research)
*    definition of research objectives
*    description of individual research activities, corresponding to the objectives
*    selection and justification of research methodology
*    proposed experimental design and methodology for statistical analysis
*    key indicators (bench marks) for the monitoring of progress and evaluating
impact
*    a budget.
5.13       Research proposal guidelines will include mandatory provisions for economic
justification. A description of how extension agents and users have been involved in project
preparation and how they will continue to be involved in project implementation will be an integral



- 41 -
part of all research proposals. In so far as many research results users are women, proposals will
take into account the specific role played by them and their particular needs and constraints in
production and processing. Finally, the proposal will indicate how the research project is integrated
into the regional context (coherence and complementarity with neighboring countries and international
centers initiatives in the area). The guidelines. acceptable to IDA. will be reviewed by the SC and
adopted by NARC prior to Credit effectiveness (para. 7.02 (c)).
C. Training Program
5.14        The project includes an extensive training program (paras. 3.43 to 3.45) which was
discussed in detail during appraisal. A summary is provided in Annex 7. It is important that IER
will develop a training culture. That is why the directors will have first-line responsibility for
training, each in his domain. The Scientific Director will be responsible for overseas and in-country
training of scientists, as well as for training provided by IER scientists. One of the Research
Coordinators will have specific responsibility for training, including identifying convenient
universities for overseas training, identifying technical assistance for grouped in-country training of
scientists, and organizing and developing course material for training provided by IER scientists. A
second Research Coordinator will be responsible for the planning and development of course material,
with the extension services, for training to be provided by IER scientists for subject matter specialists;
and for organizing the training in participatory research methodologies (para. 5.15). The Director
of Technical Support Services will be responsible for training of station management and operating
staff, also including on-the-job training to be provided by laboratory, station and farm managers. The
Financial Resources Director will be responsible for the training of accounting staff and monitor the
training to be provided by the accounting firm (para. 3.35).
Training in Participatory Research Methodologies
5.15       This training is intended for scientists (both commodity and production system
scientists), extension agents and other research partners. It is hoped that if research users and
extension agents understand the research methodologies used, they will be able to better participate
in the various stages of technology development and will become more effective research partners.
Particular attention will be given to the training of scientists and extension staff in taking into account
the specific needs and potentials of women users of research results. The techniques and approaches
in participatory research are gender specific.
5.16       The training will be based upon the Dutch financed farming systems research program
in Sikasso. This project, which is now at the beginning of its sixth phase, has accumulated a
considerable amount of experience in participatory research methods. The Dutch Cooperation agreed
to use its technical experts to capitalize upon the Sikasso experience and provide training to IER
scientists from other regions and programs. Training of farmers will also build upon the Sikasso
experience, but will be carried out in local languages, by Malian NGOs. There are NGOs in Mali
who are already providing village associations training in rapid rural appraisal techniques and other
aspects of participatory research methodologies. Under the project, additional train-the-trainers
courses will be provided with the assistance of a specialized institution. In addition to the short term
training, the Dutch team will continue to provide back-up and technical support to scientists in the
four regional centers (other than Sikasso) through regular visits to ensure proper implementation of
the methodologies. This additional back-up is expected to last for two years.



- 42 -
5.17       The Human Resources Management Unit will be responsible for providing logistic
support for IER's training program, including the organization and administration of both overseas
and in-country training, the recruitment of external trainers, course and trainer evaluation, and
keeping records of training received by IER staff.
D. Impact Monitoring and Evaluation
5.18       The Malian agricultural research system recognizes three distinct evaluations of the
(possible) impact of research, as follows:
(a)  the x_ a_te evaluation, i.e. the mandatory economic justification accompanying new
research proposals (para. 5.12), based on expected results;
(b)  the a posl evaluation, i.e. the expected impact of new technology upon its release for
dissemination, i.e. the actual performance of the technology in on-farm testing; and
(c)  the impact evaluation, i.e. impact on production as measured by farmer adoption rate
of new technology and productivity increase.
T-he e p.f evaluation will become an integral part of the annual review of research results by the
Regional Technical Committees. It will be transmitted to the Program Committee for review and will
be recorded in IER's Annual Report. The programs selected for impact evaluation will be the ones
undergoing an independent review mandated by the Scientific Committee (paras. 3.06 and 5.04).
Details on the proposed impact evaluations are in Annex 2, Appendix 2. At negotiations. it was
agreed that IER will implement jointly with the extension services, impact evaluations for at least five
programs per year. and will have completed the first impact evaluations of all its research programs
by June 30. 1997 (para. 7.01 (d)).
E. Key Implementation Progress Indicators
5.19       The overriding objectives of the project are to make agricultural research relevant and
to make scientists accountable for results. The key elements to achieve this are to be put in place
prior to Credit effectiveness. These include: the creation of NARC and its committees, the
reorganization of IER, the introduction of operating manuals, the initial evaluation of the scientists,
the nomination of key staff, the implementation of a performing accounting system, and the revision
of research programs on: livestock, natural resources and forestry, production systems, and the
economics of commodity production, processing and marketing.
5.20       Real progress in implementation will be measured by the impact evaluations (Annex 2,
Appendix 2). However, as a proxy for success in project implementation, key indicators have been
agreed upon at negotiations and are presented in Annex 12 (para. 7.02 (d)).
F. Infrastructure Rehabilitation
5.21       The Technical Coordination Unit (para. 3.29) will be responsible for all infrastructure
investments. The unit will recruit and supervise architectural and engineering firms to prepare
Experiment Station Development Plans and, upon their acceptance, sketch plans, detailed engineering

and bidding documents. The contracts with these firms will generally include the technical evaluation
of bids received and the supervision of works. IER has obtained the short term services of an
experienced architect and a land development specialist to assist the Technical Coordination Unit in
its tasks. A detailed planning for the design and execution of the rehabilitation program is presented
in Chart 4.
G. Project Implementation and Supervision
5.22       The project Procurement and Implementation Schedule in Chart 4 provides for the
phasing of civil works over a period of four years owing to the need to proceed to an initial lay-out
study in the first year, and to the limited capacity of the local industry. Research conventions
extending beyond the expected Credit Closing Date will need to be tailored to the availability of
funds. Consultancies for training on research programming, experiment station management and
scientific publication and documentation will extend over the initial three years after project start-up.
The purchase of vehicles and tractors will take place initially in the first three years of the project,
investments thereafter will serve fleet renewal. Agricultural and laboratory equipment will be
purchased in the second and third year after the initial station lay out review has been done.
Acquisition of documentation for the information center will be done over the project period.
Supervision Plan
5.23       A project launch workshop will be organized in the first half of 1994, for which full
participation of all donors will be sought. This first workshop will include all managers, including
Program Heads and Station Managers. Immediately thereafter, separate launch workshops will be
organized in each Regional Center for all scientists and station operating staff, which will also include
key extension staff. The project will be supervised formally twice a year. Donors and IDA
participation in NARC's Financial Resources Committee's review of: annual work programs and
budgets, research convention execution, annual financial audits, impact evaluations and external
evaluation reports, will provide an additional element of supervision and donor coordination. A mid-
term review of project implementation will take place before December, 1997, where progress with
the institutional reforms will be assessed in depth, as well as IER's ability to operate fully under a
contractual regime. The Project Supervision Plan is in Annex 13.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Anticipated Project Benefits
6.01       Long term project benefits (i.e. beyond the present project period) are expected from:
(a) accelerated and sustained agricultural productivity and growth; (b) higher returns to farmers;
(c) improved and sustainable management of Mali's natural resources; and (d) increased foreign
exchange earnings. Most of these benefits will be indirect and obtained through improved priority
setting, better research quality and relevance, greater research efficiency (earlier availability, higher
returns to investment, and lower cost), and improved and more dynamic linkages with extension
(complementarity with the ongoing Agricultural Services Project (Cr. 2235-MLI).



- 44 -
6.02       As in most other Bank Group-assisted agricultural research projects, no attempt has been
made to quantify the economic rate of return a ante, due to:
(a)  inherent uncertainties regarding the timing and value of research findings, and the
timing and extent of adoption of research findings by farmers;
(b)   difficulties in separating potential benefits of research and complementary investments,
such as input supply, extension and training; and
(c)  the problem of assessing the value of negative research, which adds to the pool of
knowledge and frequently benefits subsequent research efforts.
Considerable evidence of e, Dost analysis shows that investment in agricultural research in both
developed and developing countries has generated high economic rates of return, exceeding 40 % in
many cases10.
B. Employment and Poverty Impact
6.03       The Project will have only a comparatively small direct employment impact during Its
implementation period. Far more important will be its possible indirect long term impact on income
generation in rural Mali. Through the eventual adoption of improved agricultural production and
farm management techniques, the project will lead to increases in smallk,older productivity and farm
output, thus generating additional income for farmers and their household members that constitute
about 80% of Mali's population. Through its focus on generating new and improved technologies
for the sustainable production of food and export crops by small farmers, the project is ultimately
aiming at helping to secure the food supply and increase incomes, and will thus be an important
component of the country's antipoverty strategy.
C. Environmental Impact
6.04       With only very limited areas of natural forest and park land remaining, and severely
reduced bush fallow, farmers are the major custodians of its natural resources. Generating
technologies for the sustainable use of these resources is one of the main objectives of the project.
Through its emphasis on soil and moisture conservation, soil fertility management, agro-forestry and
natural forest management, integrated pest management, and participatory on-farm and farming
systems research, the project aims at stabilizing and improving farming in a degrading environment.
Although most of the environmental degradation in Mali is man-made, the situation has evolved to
a point where the farmer's interest and that of protecting the environment are now the same. The
environmental impact of the Project will therefore be largely positive. The focus of agricultural
research is necessarily limited to: (i) what farmers can do on their own fields; and (ii) what
commutiities can do for their common interest (e.g. watershed protection, etc.). The bigger questions
of the protection of Mali's remaining bio-diversity, finding solutions for land tenure problems
affecting the environment, pesticide usage (legislation and control) are beyond the scope of this
project, but they are the main focus of the Natural Resources Management Project (Cr. 2370-MLI).
The present Project with its focus on sustainable management of Mali's natural resources is fully
consistent with this project and constitutes an important component of it.

D. UroiJet Rsisk
6.05       A risk that may delay the realization of project benefits and affect the credibility of
agricultural research in Mali is the desired change in attitudes of research staff needed to make
research more demand-driven. The project emphasizes on-farm participatory research and close
collaboration with extension staff and a number of measures have been included to help in bringing
about such a change in attitude training in participatory research methodologies (already successfully
practiced in IER's farming systems research program); and mandatory coordination with field
extension staff for all on-farm trials and training of extension staff by scientists. However, changes
in attitude take time, unless accelerated by motivation. A scientist is motivated by research results.
A scientist working in applied agricultural research should find his motivation in seeing the results
of his/her research being applied by farmers.
6.06       The major risks of the proje t are: (i) implementation delays as a result of the rather
profound institutional reforms envisaged under the project; (ii) inadequacy of public funding;
(iii) weak research management; and (iv) government reluctance to rely on regional collaboration.
As to the first point, most of these should be completed by negotiations, but changing attitudes may
take longer. The design of the project includes measures to reduce the last three types of risk, i.e:
the introduction of contractual arrangements for research funding; improving staff training and
introducing independent staff selection procedures; and the provision of funds for Mali's participation
in regional collaborative research.

Research Organization and Management
1.         The Scientific Director has overall responsibility for research design, programming,
monitoring and evaluation, the quality of implementation, scientific information, publication and
training. To assist him in this task he will have the following support staff and units:
(a)  four Research Coordinators, responsible for scientific support and advice to the Program
Heads; research programming, monitoring and evaluation; and implementation
coordination;
(b)   one biometrist and two statistical assistants responsible for the quality of experimental
design and statistical analysis, analytical support to scientists, and the constitution of
scientific data bases and a research management information system; and
(c)  scientific publication and information services responsible for the publication and
dissemination of research results and keeping up-to-date a scientific documentation and
information system, including IER's library.
2.         The Regional Center Directors are in collaboration with the Research Coordinators and
the Program Heads responsible for defining research objectives in the regions in close liaison with
the extension services and the users of research results. The Regional Center Directors ensure the
coherence between the research programs and collaboration between commodity and systems
scientists. The Program Heads will be based on the lead experiment stations where the most
important part of their program is being implemented. They will be directly responsible for research
programming, program design, implementation and monitoring, as well as for budget execution. For
the part of the program implemented on research stations where they are not physically present they
will delegate authority for budget execution to a qualified scientist of the program located there. The
terms of reference of the Regional Center Directors and the Research Coordinators, which are newly
defined pivotal positions in IER, are presented in Annex 3.
3.         The Program Heads will be responsible for constituting and updating the part of the
research management information system that concerns their programs (projects, activities,
operations, their location and the annual budget resources). A statistical assistant, one in each lead
experiment station, will provide support to the Program Heads in constituting their part of the
information system. The statistical assistant will also provide support to the scientists for the use of
software for statistical analysis. The eight assistants will work in liaison with the biometrist and the
two assistants based in Bamako for the use of statistical packages and the constitution of the research
management information system.
4.         The University of Texas A&M is providing long term technical assistance and financial
support to set up and implement the research management information system under the USAID-
funded SPARC Project.

Research Impact Evaluations
The impact evaluation provides necessary feedback to focus future research activities.
An impact evaluation for each research program on technology released during the preceding six year
period will be done every three years. The results of these evaluations should be available prior to
the external reviews organized by NARC (para. 3.06). The impact evaluations will be the
responsibility of one of the Research Coordinators in the Scientific Directorate, who will prepare
detailed terms of reference for each evaluation, which will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee
of NARC prior to their implementation. Small ad hoc impact evaluation teams consisting of one
scientist and one extension agent (subject matter specialist) will be provided with a separate budget
(for the recruitment of enumerators and travel expenses). They will be jointly responsible for
analyzing and publishing the results with the guidance of the Research Coordinator. The results will
be released upon review by the Program Committee and will be widely distributed among scientists
and extension staff and summarized in IER's Annual Report. Training on impact evaluations is
provided under the training program. A complete set of impact evaluations should be available at
the time of the mid term review.

Research Programming and Review Cycle
Mechanisms and Procedures
I.         The mechanisms and procedures for research proposal preparation and for annual
review, programming and budgeting are part of a research management system which involves 4 main
organizational mechanisms for consultation, design and/or review and decision-making. These are:
the Scientific and Users Committees of NARC, the Program Committee of IER, the Regional
Technical Committees and the Local Working Groups. At the level of IER, the Program Committee
is an internal review and decision-making body. It is headed by the Scientific Director and includes
the Director of the Technical Support Services, the Regional Center Directors, and the Program
Coordinators. At the regional level, Regional Technical Committees provide a framework for
consultation between research and its partners (extension services, NGO's and farmer organizations).
Finally, in the Local Working Groups, scientists and their partners meet to prepare the Regional
Technical Committee.
2.         The review, programming, and budgeting process, together with the organizational
mechanisms and their role is described in Chart 3. For both research proposal preparation and annual
review and for programming of on-going research projects, the process starts with the Local Working
Groups. For each program or group of programs, these groups will bring together:
*     the organized users (farmers and processors);
*     the extension agents;
*     the production systems scientists; and
*     the commodity scientists.
Organizing the meetings of the Local Working Groups is the responsibility of the Program Heads,
under the guidance of the Regional Center Director, whose leadership may be needed to bring several
programs to plan and review their work jointly. In as much as possible, the Research Coordinators
participate in the Local Working Group meetings to provide technical support to the Program Heads
and ensure that the procedures set up by the Scientific Director are used correctly. Procedures for
the selection of Local Working Group members and their training will become an integral part of the
research programming cycle, which will be included in IER's Internal Organization Manual
(para. 3.37).
3.         To ensure maximum participation of the users, these Working Groups meet at the
village/district level, using local languages. The purpose of these meetings is the following:



- 54 -
ANNEX 2
Appenadix 3
Page 2 of 3
(a)  to review and evaluate previous year research results, decide which research results are
of interest to farmers and are ready to be proposed for diffusion;
(b)  in light of this review, to determine the content of activities for the following year,
which may include an adjustment in research topics or a new activity under an on-going
research project;
(c)   examine the research topics formulated by the scientists, in view of decisions taken by
the Working Group the previous year, taking into account the final budgetary allocations
by IER's Board (para. 5.10);
(d)   discuss any new research ideas; the initiative to propose new research areas can come
from any of the four actors;
(e)   prepare the Regional Technical Committee, i.e. what will be presented in terms of:
(i) interesting research results (not all research results are worth presenting); (ii) major
changes in research objectives; (iii) new research activities within on-going research
projects or new research proposals; and
(f)   if the program (or one of the programs) has recently been the subject of an external
evaluation, the Working Group has an additional task, which is to discuss the
recommendations that concern the users. It also prepares the program response, either
in terms of adjustments to existing activities or design of new ones.
4.          The Regional Technical Committee, presided by the Regional Center Director, brings
together all the parties concerned by the programs implemented in the region to examine the Local
Working Groups' proposals. These are reviewed, discussed and amended. The Regional Technical
Committee's recommendations are synthesized by the Regional Center Director. The Program Heads
will be responsible for their inclusion in research activities presented to the Program Committee for
its approval.
5.          Presentations by each Program Head to the Program Committee will include: (i) new
research proposals or new activities within on-going research projects; (ii) research results that are
deemed ready for dissemination; (iii) proposals for adjustments following external review
recommendations. The Program Committee's role is three fold: (i) to harmonize the regional
proposals within a national program, seeking complementarity and avoiding duplication when a
program is implemented at several locations; (ii) to review the new research project proposals and
activities in light of the Strategic Plan orientations and to decide whether to present them to NARC
for funding, with revisions or further development, if need be; (iii) to establish an order of priority
for the new activities or projects retained for presentation to NARC; and, (iv) to review the research
results that are proposed for diffusion. The quality (proposed experimental design and statistical
analysis) of each proposal will have been reviewed by a Research Coordinator and the biometrician
prior to its presentation to the Program Committee. Finally, the Program Committee will review
together with the Financial Resources Director the overall research budget, including the new or
adjusted research proposals, before its presentation to NARC and its Committees.

A Multi-Annual Process (Chart 3)
6.         It should be noted that contrary to the time frame of the existing situation, where the
review, programming and budgeting is done in the space of a few weeks, all for the on-going season,
the present process is spread over a two year period, to allow for proper review and decision-making.
It starts with the Local Working Groups in March of a given year with the review of previous year's
results and the programming for the year following the on-going year. The Regional Technical
Committees are held in April and the Program Committee in June. The Program Committee will take
one month to review, harmonize and prioritize the proposals from the various regions. The NARC
Committees will meet in October, and NARC will make its final decision in November, regarding
the new research activities and funding arrangements for the following year. The Board of Directors
approves IER's budget in December and the Scientific Director communicates the allocation decisions
by programs to the Program Heads at the end of the year. The scientists will then have two months
(January-February) to draft their protocols. They will discuss the details of the research proposals
approved by NARC with the Local Working Groups in March.
7.         The meetings of the various committees described above are not intended to replace the
scientific work of the scientists (which takes place in between the various Committee meetings) nor
the research managers' input and coordinating responsibilities. They only provide the framework for
users' and extension services input into the process, the basis upon which the scientists design the
scientific content of the research activities. On first view, the process may appear complicated and
cumbersome. However, one should not loose sight of the following:
(a)   The NARC  committees replace a multitude of individual donor interventions/
systems/reviews;
(b)  Including 'outsiders' (extension services, farmer organizations) in the determination of
the research agenda of IER should ensure a much closer 'bondage' between scientists
and their clients, and thus ensure research responsiveness to farmer constraints, one of
the principal objectives of the project;
(c)   The proposed process streamlines in a systematic manner what already exists. For
example, the cotton and the production system programs already prepare their work first
in Local Working Groups before going to the Regional Technical Committee. It is
proposed to generalize this practice. Presently, NARC reviews research results and
future activities for all IER's activities (para. 2.23) which hinders effective review.
Under the new process the Scientific Committee will only review new or revised
research proposals, and only research results ready for dissemination.
8.         Process implementation. The above procedures will be fully described in IER's Internal
Organization Manual of which a draft was presented for review at negotiations (para. 3.37). They
will also include procedures for the constitution of and composition of Local Working Groups.
Before the start of a new programming cycle, i.e. before March 1994, the Local Working Groups
will be constituted and IER will organize a series of workshops to familiarize scientists and middle
managers with the new procedures. The description of the above procedures will be distributed
separately to IER's partners in the process, i.e. the extension services and the Local Working Groups.

Experiment Station Management
1.        In addition to their responsibility for regional research programming and coordination
(Annex 2, Appendix 1), the Regional Center Directors represent the Director General in the region.
Under the Director of Technical Support Services, they are responsible for all station operations in
the region. To assist them in this task, each lead experiment station will have a professional Station
Manager, who will also be responsible for operations on the substations. Station Managers will have
the same status as the Program Heads and generally be MSc. level trained professionals. The 8
Station Managers will have full responsibility for the execution of their budgets which will be separate
from the research program budgets and which will include all indirect variable and fixed costs to
operate and maintain the station and substations and the equipment.
2.         Each lead experin'ent station will have:
(a)   a farm manager, responsible for all farming operations;
(b)  a technical service, including stores, the workshop and the maintenance of buildings and
grounds; and
(c)  an accounting unit, which will also be responsible for the pay-roll
The budgets of the substations are included in the lead station budget. Under the Station Manager,
the substations are managed by a technician, who will rely on the services available on the lead
station. As an integral part of project preparation, The University of Arkansas has provided training
in experiment station management with PPF financing and will continue to do so during project
implementation.

Experiment Station Work Programming and Review
I.         Proposals transmitted to the Program Committee by the Program Heads will include new
or revised research activities, together with a preliminary budget for all research activities. These
budgets should include details by lead experiment station and substation on areas to be cropped,
inputs to be purchased and equipment to be procured. All documents presented to the Program
Committee should be simultaneously made available to the eight Experiment Station Managers. On
the basis of this information, the Station Managers will each prepare a Purchase Plan, which will
be consolidated by the Central Purchasing Unit (para. 3.29) and should be available not later than
July 31 of each year. This should permit timely ordering of inputs and equipment with known
prelonged delivery periods.
2.         In July of each year, after the Program Committee's decisions, the planning of station
operations starts for the following year. Once the decisions on new research activities are taken by
the Programn Committee by the end of June, the Program Heads inform the Station Managers of all
the experiments retained by the Program Committee and to be implemented on each lead station and
substation, as well as the on-farm experiments. On the basis of this information, each Station
Manager prepares a detailed Work Plan for experiment implementation (planting dates, cropped
areas, homogenization requirements, etc.). This plan is discussed and agreed by the Experiment
Station Committees in July and August, in time for the preparation of the station budgets and their
presentation to the Director of Technical Support Services for consolidation with IER's overall budget
in September.
3.         The Experiment Station Committees consist of the Regional Center Director, the
Station Manager, the farm manager, the heads of the substations and all the Program Heads
intervening on the station. In principle, these committees convene only once a year to prepare the
Work Plan. Thereafter, the Station Managers convene each year in September to discuss their Work
Plans and budgets with the Directors of Technical Support Services and Financial Resources.
Budgets may need to be adjusted prior to the planting season, once IER's consolidated budget has
been approved by the Board and the scientists have prepared their research protocols. This may
necessitate one additional meeting of the Experiment Station Committee to adjust the Work Plan and
the budget, but only in cases of major changes (serious shortfall of funds or major changes in the
research programs). The above procedures will be fully described in IER's Internal Organization
Manual (para. 3.40). In the future, IER may feel the need to prepare a separate detailed station
operations manual, also including maintenance schedules, irrigation guidelines, etc..

RS   =  Agricultural Research Specialist
FA   =  Financial Analyst
ME  =  Monitoring & Evaluation Specialist (impact evaluations)

HRD =  Human Resources Development Specialist
Comments:   Supervision missions are expected to be undertaken jointly with other donors,
with Resident Mission staff, and with staff supervising the National Agricultural Extension
Project. This may lead to some economies of scale by joining the required expertise. The
supervision of experiment station rehabilitation, land development and equipment requirements
will be done by an architect/planner and a station management/land development specialist who
are already recruited under the project for four missions per year of two weeks each. As a pilot
project for both the SPAAR initiative and for innovative approaches to improve research - farmer
- extension linkages, additional support is expected from AFTES and AGRTN. Also, Mali is a
concentration country for ISNAR, which is expected to provide institutional development support.
