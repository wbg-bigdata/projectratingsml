PMB - PC2 has entered contracts with the Consultants* for the establishment of the
I             FS, EIA and the RAP for the sub-projects of 110kV S/Ss and T/Ls in the southern
provinces of Vietnam.
Note.
*PC2 appointed (i) Power Engineering & Consulting Center, (ii) Power Engineering & Consulting Company
No. 1, (iii) Power Engineering & Consulting Company No.2, (iv) Power Engineering & Consulting Company
No.3, and, (v) Hanoi Eleco Shareholding Company to carry out the preparation of FSs, EIAs and survey for
RAPs of each sub-project.
The RAP for the overall project are prepared by PECC3.
0.1.2. Objectives of the Report
Objectives of the Resettlement Action Plan report to define resettlement and
compensation program for the projects in such a way as to limit as much as possible
the number of project affected persons and their afffected properties and to ensure
that all PAPs shall be compensated for their losses at replacement costs and will be-
provided with rehabilitation measures to assist them      to improve, or at least
maintain, their pre-project living standards and income earning capacity.
The RAP preparation has been carried out with the consultation and participation of
PAPs and local authorities in the project areas.
0.1.3. Policy Framework
This RAP for the sub-projects under PC2 is based on the Policy Framework for
3             Compensation, Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons (see
Appendix 2 for Policy Framework for Compensation, Resettlement and
Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons). According to the Policy Framework,
the eligibility for compensation and rehabilitation entitlement includes all affected
persons, households and institutions with or without legal status on their assets
I             included in the RAP inventory prior to the RAP cut-off date. By the actual RAP
implementation, PMB/compensation council(s) will organize the survey for the
actual prevailing prices for the adjustment of the compensation unit prices, if
Power Comrlpany No.2                                                        Page 5

necessary and the amount of compensation will be displayed at the Communes's
People's Committee Offices.
0.1.4. Principles and Objectives
According to the Government Decree No.197/2004/ND-CP and resettlement
principles of World Bank, the resettlement and compensation program must be
designed so as to improve or at least to maintain living standards of PAPs as before
the imnplementation of the project. Both resettlement and land acquisition must be
minimized as much as possible. Cash compensation (for houses or structures, farm
products,...) shall be paid at the prices that were submitted by CRC and approved
by local PPC in order to reach the replace price for land, housesand perennial trees
and the market price for annual crops. The resettlement and compensation program
must be carried out in the progress on schedule with an appropriate monitoring
program.
The principles outline in the WB OD 4.30 (adopted in the Policy Framework) are
based for the preparation of this RAP.
Apart form direct compensation, all PAPs permanently losing more than 25% of
their residential/productive land or other incomes are entitled to be trained or
received other restoration measures. All PAPs being resettled are entitled to receive
(i) transport allowance; (ii) relocating subsidy; (iii) training or other restoration
measures and (iv) timely relocating bonus. In these sub-projects, there are 226
households (1,066 persons) losing more than 25% of their fixed assets
(residential/productive land and/or houses/structures).
Although the surveys have been carried out, the sub-project issues have been
communicated to the people in the project related localities along with community
participation S/S locations and T/L routes have been approved by the local
authorities, it is agreed between the local authorities and the PC2's PMB that the
cut-off date shall be the dates of the community meetings in the project related
localities in respect of RAP where the cut-off date is officially declared by the
competent local authorities.

0.1.5. Existing Power Distribution Situation in Project Areas
The existing power distribution networks in the project areas (covering 40
communes, belong to 15 districts/towns/cities of 7 provinces), in general, are
I           incapable of meeting the current and future demand due to unapt T/Ls (too long
distance and/or too small conductor diameter, leading to low service quality and
3           high loss) and lack of S/Ss
Details of the situation of existing power distribution in the project area are shown

relevant Institutions (i.e. Provincial and District CRCs, provincial DOFs, DOCs,
DOIs, ...)
PC2, its Consultants and Provincial Powers are responsible for carrying out cencus,
socio-economic survey and inventories, preparing RAP and for the day-to-day
implementation within their respective jurisdiction.
The project related District and Commune People's Committees will participate in
the RAP preparation and implementation.
0.2.2. Legal Framework
All GOV and WB policies related to land acquisition, compensation and
resettlement (OD 4.30) are applied for this RAP. Where GOV and WB policies are
not compatible, the WB's OD 4.30 shall prevail with certain required waivers.
0.3. Entitlement Policy
This RAP has been prepared on the basis of the OD 4.30 of the WB on involuntary
resettlement adopted in the Policy Framework. The principle objective of the Policy
Framework is to ensure that all PAPs will be compensated for their losses at
replacement cost and provided with rehabilitation measures to assist them in
improving, or at least maintain their pre-project living standards and income earning
capacity.
The Policy Framework lays down the priciples and objectives, eligibility criteria of
PAPs, entitlements, legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and
rehabilitation, people's participation and grievances procedures that will guide the-
compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of the PAPs.
Apart from direct compensation, all PAHs permanently would lose more than 25%
of their residential/productive land or other incomes are entitled (i) transport
allowance; (ii) relocating subsidy; (iii) training or other restoration measures and
(iv) timely relocating bonus. (GOV Decree 197/CP).
See Appendix 3 for the Entitlement Matrix.
0.4. Resettlement Site
Thanks to mitigation measures through public consultations the initial stage and
design stage of the project, the socio-economic surveys, inventories and census
show  that there   are  226  HHs   (1,066  persons)  whose   fixed  assets
(residential/productive land and/or house/structures) being acquired more than 25%
of their total holding and required to be relocated.

At the stage of this RAP preparation, actual land allocation required for the
development of the resettlement site can not be defined, however, Official
Agreements (approved by PPCs) on T/L route and S/S location have been obtained
and Official Agreement (approved by the related district People's Committees) on
the allocation of resettlement land, if required, have been obtained.
Base on the result of socio-economic surveys on PAHs, it is shown that all PAHs
who are required to be resettlement have spare land. In addition, they would like to
be compensated for their losses (land/house/structures) in cash so that they can use
it to resettle by their own. Therefore, the project does not need to set up any
resettlement area.
See Appendix 4 for Agreements on S/Ss Location and T/L Routes.
0.5. People's Participation
The consultation with PAPs in getting their feedback will limit contradiction and
avoid delays in project implementation. The RAP is developed in close consultation
with local authorities and PAPs in order to maximize their participation in
resettlement planning and implementing and the socio-economic benefits of PAPs
to the project.
Local authorities and PAPs were consulted through line alignment, draft of
resettlement policy, RAP implementation, grievance mechanism and monitoring
and evaluation on the restoration of PAPs livelihood after the project
3           implementation. (See Appendix 6 for Minutes of Community Meettings and
Appendix 8 for Pamphlets).

Implementing the project components, land acquisition will be required for stations,
pole foundations, access roads and ROWs. However, the construction of these
110kV T/Ls and S/Ss will not cause a large scale of land acquisition and
I            resettlement. Current data shows that there is lack of electricity (almost constantly
overloaded) due to:
-   The ever increasing demand.
-   Lack of electricity supply sources and transformers
Therefore, implementing this project will satisfy the requirement of power network
development in the project areas, meet immediate requirements and electricity
demand in future, increase electricity supply and share the electricity availability
with the existing substation which were currently overloaded. The project will not
U            only directly satisfy the ever increasing demand for industries, handicraft, tourism,
agriculture and aquaculture development but also improve the spiritual and material
3            life of communities in the project areas.
(See Appendix 1 for Maps of Project Areas)
1            1.2. Objective of the Report
Objective of the RAP is to define a resettlement and compensation program for the
i           project in such a way as to minimize as much as possible the number of project
affected persons and their afffected properties and to ensure that all PAPs shall be
comnpensated for their losses and will be provided with rehabilitation measures to

assist them improving, or at least maintaining, their pre-project living standards and
income earning capacity.
The RAP preparation has been carried out with consultation and participation of
3            PAPs and local authorities in the project areas.
1.3. Policy Framework
|            The Project has prepared policy framework for socially negative impacts from the
project (see Appendix 2 for Policy Framework for Compensation, Resettlement and
3            Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons). The principle objective of the Policy
Framework for Compensation, Resettlement and Rehabilitation is to ensure that all
PAPs will be compensated for their losses and provided with rehabilitation
measures to assist them improving, or at least maintaining, their pre-project living
3            standards and income earning capacity.
The Policy Framework lays down the principles and objectives, eligibility criteria
of PAPs, entitlements, legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation
and rehabilitation, peoples participation features and grievances procedures that will
guide the compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of the PAPs. This RAP is
based on the Policy Framework.
1.4. Principles and Objectives
The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 have been
adopted in preparing this Policy Framework. In this regard the following principles
and objectives would be applied:
(a) Acquisition of land and other assets, and resettlement of people will be
*minimized as much as possible.
(b) All PAPs residing, working, doing business or cultivating land in right of
way of transmission line, surrounding areas of tower foundation, the surveys
are entitled to be provided with rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist
them to improve or at least maintain their pre-project living standards,
income earning capacity and production levels. Lack of legal rights to the
3 |               assets lost will not bar the PAPs from entitlement to such rehabilitation
measures.
|             (c) The rehabilitation measures to be provided are: (i) compensation at
replacement cost without deduction for depreciation or salvage materials for
3                 houses and other structures; (ii) agricultural land for land of equal productive
capacity acceptable to the PAP or in cash at replacement cost according to
3 |               PAP's choice; (iii) replacement of residential/premise land of equal size

acceptable to the PAP or in cash at replacement cost according to PAP's
choice, (iv) and transfer and subsistence allowances.
(d) Replacement residential and agricultural land will be as nearby as possible to
3                 te land that was lost, and acceptable to the PAP.
(e) The resettlement transition period will be minimized and the rehabilitation
means will be provided to the PAPs no later than one month prior to the
expected start-up date of works in the respective Project site.
|              (f) Plans for acquisition of land and other assets and provision of rehabilitation
measures will be carried out in consultation with the PAPs, to ensure
minimal disturbance. Entitlements will be provided by PAPs no later than
one month prior to expected start-up of works at the respective project site.
(g) The previous level of community services and resources will be maintained
or improved.
3             (h) Financial and physical resources for resettlement and rehabilitation will be
made available and as when required.
3             (i) Institutional arrangements will ensure effective and timely design, planning,
consultation and implementation of the Inventories and RAPs.
3             (1) Effective and timely supervision, monitoring and evaluation of the
implementation of the Inventories and RAP will be carried out.
3           1.5. Existing Power Distribution Situation in Project Areas
The existing power distribution networks in the project areas (covering 40
3           communes belong to 15 districts/towns/cities of 7 provinces) in general, are in
incapable of meeting the current and future demand due to unapt T/Ls (too long
3           distance and/or too small conductor diameter, leading to low service quality and
high loss) and lack of S/Ss

2.2.1. World Bank policies
The Legal framework governing the implementation of this Policy Framework and
3           the Inventories and RAP are OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement of the World
Bank.
The primary objective of the World Bank policy is to explore all alternatives to
avoid or at least minimize involuntary resettlement. Where resettlement is
unavoidable, the living standard of displaced persons should be restored or
improved related to those conditions that prevailed prior to the Project. The policy
applied to the talking of land and other assets when land acquisition results in the
loss of the shelter, the loss of all or part of productive assets, or access to them, and
the loss of income source or other means of livelihood.
According to the OD 4.30 on involuntary resettlement. PAPs shall be compensated
and assisted in such a way as to warrant the improvement or at least the
maintenance of pre-project living standard condition.
Measures required to ensure that resettlement has a positive outcome include:

Persons who encroach on the areas after the cut-off date defined in this RAP are not
entitled to receive compensation or any other forn of resettlement assistance.
The methodology to be used in the valuation of losses for this project is based on
their replacement cost. In this project, losses comprise land, structures and other
assets. Replacement cost for land includes the value of land at market price plus the
cost taxes and fees to get LURC. For houses and other structures, the market cost of
the materials should be used to calculate the replacement cost to build a replacement
structures with area and the quality should be at least as good as those affected. For
I            both totally and partially affected structures, compensation includes market cost of
material, plus the costs of material transport, labor and contractor fees, registration
3            and transfer taxes.
Depreciation of the assets and amount saved in material will not form a part of

I            2.2.3. Compatibilities of GOV and WB Approaches
There are a number of ways in which the approaches of the GOV - either in policy
I            or practice -  are compatible with WB      guidelines. The most important.
compatibilities are:
I             -   Vietnam has a process whereby most people without legal land rights may
meet conditions of legalization and receive compensation for losses.
I             -   Permanent residents are provided with options that include relocation to an
improved site, or cash, or a combination of the two.
-   Resettlement sites offer not only better improved infrastructure and services
but represent a highter standard of living.
-   Allowance are provided to help the PAPs in the transition period and there is
* |               an institutional structure through which people are informed, can negotiate
*                 compensation, and can appeal.
-   Difference between the approaches and measures that need to be addressed
within the program also exist. However, in this context, procedures exist
within national and Provincial/City governments that allow the granting of

waivers of of domestic law on specific projects that may be in conflict with
that of the funding agency.
- On the issue of land tenure and the legal right to compensation, the
Government and World Bank approaches are compatible. The government
has its own process in place whereby land occupied without legal
documentation can be legalized; this land, however, is compensated for at a
I                 rate equal to 100% of land price minus the taxes and fee for land use right
registration from October 15th 1993 (Article 6,7,9,10 of Decree 38/2000ND-
CP on the payment for the Land Use Right).
2.2.4. Required Waivers
In order to meet the requirements of the World Bank OD 4.30 on Involuntary
Resettlement a number of articles in various Vietnamese laws and regulations which
do not ensure compensation at replacement cost or set eligibility provisions which
do not extend the right to rehabilitation and or assistance to households without
proper land paper, will be waived.
The articles of law and regulations that will be waived are mentioned below
(i) Eligibility to Compensation and or assistance - Decree 197
-  Article 7 of the Decree 197 (Cases where land is recovered without
a                compensation) stipulates that any person whose land is recovered and who
has not met one of the conditions of Article 8 of this Decree, or who has
violated the plan, or who violates the protecting corridor work, or who
illegally occupies land shall not receive compensation when the state recovers
the land. In case of necessity, the Provincial People's Committee shall
consider and decide on a case-by-case basis.
-   Article 18,19, 20 of the Decree 197:
Houses and structures on non-eligible-for-compensation land, which have
not violated announced land use plans or the right of way will be assisted
at 80% of replacement cost
Houses and structures on non-eligible-for-compensation land, which have
violated announced land use plans or the right of way will not be assisted.
If necessary, the PPC will consider on the case by case basis.
-  Article 28, 29 of Decree 197: DPs losing more than 30% of productive land
will be entitled to living stabilization and training/job creation assistance.
- To ensure that the objectives of this resettlement policy are met, a special
decision of the Government waiving Article 7, 18, 19, 20, 28, 29 of Decree
Power Com-pany No.2                                              Page 43

197 is needed to permit assistance and rehabilitation measures for illegal
users of land as proposed in the policy.
(ii) Pr-ice of Land for Calculation of Compensation
-  According to the Vietnamese regulations, calculation for land compensation
will be based on Decrees 188/CP, 197/2004/ND-CP, 17/1998/ND-CP and
Decision 302/TTg.
-   Article 4, 5 of Decree 188/CP on the method to determine land price and
application conditions.
-   Article 9 of Decree 197: The compensation rates for land shall be determined
by the PPC for the type of land which has been used for at the time of land
acquisition.
-   To ensure that the objectives of the project resettlement policy are met, unit
price for land compensation established by the Project Provincial/City
People's Committees will be adjusted to meet the replacement costs.
(iii) Assistance Policy for DPs who Rent State-owned dwelling houses - Decree 19 7
Article 21 of Decree 197/2004/ND-CP states that DPs who rent State-owned
dwelling houses shall be provided with monetary supports equal to 60% of
the land value and 60% of the value of currently rented houses, in cases
where there are no resettlement houses to be arranged for them.
To ensure that the objectives of the policy are met, a special decision of the
Government of Vietnam regarding waiver of - Article 21 of Decree
197/2004/ND-CP is needed to permit assistance and rehabilitation measures
for DPs who share State-owned dwelling houses as proposed in this policy.
The Prime Minister of Vietnam and Chairpersons of the project provinces in
approving/adopting (prior to the project appraisal) the policies and objectives
set forth in this Policy Framework will grant the waivers to the above
imentioned Articles 7, 9, 18, 19, 20, 21, 28, 29; and any other laws or
regulations which contradict this Project Resettlement Policy.

CHAPTER 3
ENTITLEMENT POLICY
3.1. Impact Categories
By the nature of the project impacts as described above and based on the surveys of
the PAPs, the impacted categories could be classified as below:
3.1.1. Temporary Impact within ROW
All of households have productive land, crops, trees or structures in ROW of T/Ls,
surrounding areas of tower foundation, in the temporary service roads, which are
temporarily affected only during the construction period.
Category 1: The households have trees, crops which are damaged by the project
during the construction period due to construction of temporary access roads or
conductor stringing.
Category 2: The households have residential, garden, productive lands which are
temporarily accquired during the project construction period.
3.1.2. Permanent Impact
The households have land and properties that will be permanently acquired for the
tower foundations, the subsation areas, the permanent access roads for construction
and maintenance of the project. All of households have house (total or a part of
house area) or structures, or trees in ROW of the transmission line, which need to be
removed, demolished, or cut.
Category 3: The households have house or structures which are partially dismantled
and the dismantled portion will not affect to the safety or using purposes of the
entire house or structure, and the lost house/structure portion could be rebuilt in
adjacent areas already owned by the PAH. Impact on cleared residential land in
ROW would be temporary as it could be reused for restricted purposes.
Category 4: The households have house or structures which are partially or totally
dismantled and the dismantled portion will not affect to the safety or using purposes
of the entire house or structure (the dismantled areas are more than 25% of total
areas or even less than 25% of total area, but the remaining area can not be used or
inconvenient for using), therefore, the house needs to be totally removed and rebuilt
in remaimiing adjacent areas already owned by the PAPs. Impact on cleared
residential areas will be temporary as they can be reused for restricted purposes.

Category 5: The households have house or structures which are partially or totally
dismantled, and the dismantled portion will be affected the safety or using purposes
of the entire house or structure, so the house/structures needs to be total removed
and rebuilt. But PAH does not have sufficient spare residential land for the
reconstruction of a house of equal dimensions as the house lost. The threshold of
sufficient residential land is at 100 m2 for rural areas..
Category 6: The households have residential land, productive land which will be
acquired permanently by the project, including for the construction of permanent
roads and maintenance of the project.
Category 7: The households have the job or other services are affected by the
project.

3.2.1. Definition and Limitation of Eligibility
PAP is individual, firm or institution with or without land registration papers who
owned, rented or used land, properties and business which are affected by the
project.
All PAPs will be entitled to receive full compensation for their respective losses as
long as they are included in the PAPs inventory list or can prove that they used the
affected items before the cut-off date. The same applies to PAPs whose incomes are
affected by the project.
The cut-off date has been fixed at the day of the inventory completion of DMS and-
will be proclaimed by local authorities.
i *         Encroachers who settled into the proposed affected areas after the cut-off date will
not be considered as PAPs therefore having no entitlement to compensation and
U           resettlement. They will be required to demolish their structures and cut the trees or
harvest the crops for land clearance to the project. In case necessary, they will be
forced to remove out of the proposed project area. Nevertheless, they do not have to
pay any fine or sanction.
3.2.2. Resettlement and Compensation Principles
The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 have been
|           adopted in preparing this Policy Framework. In this regard the following principles
and objectives would be applied:

Since the time from RAP preparation to time of the project implementation may
be long, at the implementation time, such prices may not correspond to market or
replacement rates. Therefore, all applied prices will be checked again at the
beginning   of RAP     implementation     and  adjusted   if necessary. The Detailed
Measurement Survey (DMS) will be also carried out by Resettlement Committees
at the beginning of project implementation. The evaluation of unit prices at the
implementation time will be done by the independent monitoring agency and
provincial DOFs. This activity will later be required in TOR for Independent
Monitoring.

4.1. Mitigation measures
Thanks to mitigation measures undertaken right from the initial design stage
I           through public consultation, close cooperation with various local authorities and
related offices, the project impacts are almost marginal.
All individuals, households or institutions (PAPs) who are impacted temporarily or
permanently by the project are owners of land and properties, land and house
renters in S/S areas, ROW of T/Ls and in proposed areas for tower/pole foundation
and temporary service roads.
There are 226 HHs (1,066 persons) with their fixed assets (houses/structures and
residential/productive land) required to be relocated.
4.2. Measures to minimize land acquisition and losses.
4.2.1 Consultation and participation
During the project preparation PC2 Consultants have conducted detail survey on the
project impacts. The survey teams have also conducted discussions and
consultations with local authorities and local people on the possible impacts caused
by the project, particularly the S/S locations and alignment of T/L routes so as the
selected line routes and S/S locations are the least impact option.
The proposed layouts of the S/S areas and T/L routes are also displayed and
discussed again in the RAP community meeting.
The draft layout of S/S area and T/L routes has been communicated by PC2 to the
relevant bodies i.e. provincial, district and commune People's Conunittees, Dept. of
Natural Resource and Environment, provincial/district/commune cadastral services
etc. for comments and public display. The valuable feedback of local authorities and
PAPs were taken into account for design.
1           4.2.2 Impact limitation measures in design stage
, |         Substations
The average area of the S/Ss in this project is around 6,000m2 and 650m2 of branch
3           (in case of S/S + branch).
Location of the S/Ss have been presented and discussed in the related community
meetings and related district/conmmune People's Committees and concerned offices
i.e. Natural Resource and Environment, Agriculture, Cadastral etc.

Official agreements on locations of S/Ss have been obtained from the related
provincial People's Comnmittees.
Route selection
|            The project impacts mitigation measures have been scrutinized during the design
stage, particularly for the route selection. Appropriate route would reduce the
project cost and adverse impacts on the local communities and environment.
The follwing principles were followed:
1            .   The selected routes are shorted possible with S/S location of optimal services.
Such routes are closed to public roads to avoid land accquisition for access
3                roads and minimize cost during construction, operation and maintenance.
.    The T/Ls routes should avoid traversing or running close to the important
3                projects (i.e. gasoline, explosive storages, radio station), sensitive locations
(i.e. historic and cultural assets) protected forests and areas with high trees.
3                Slope sides and turnings are also avoided to reduce leveling and angle towers.
During the mapping of the routes, PC2 and its Consultants have thoroughly studied
3            different alternatives on map and at sites to select the optimal ones.
To avoid impacts, certain changes in direction of the routes and many turning
angles (> 10°) of the routes are applied to avoid impacts to the houses/structures.
Official agreements on locations of T/L routes have been obtained from the related
3            provincial People's Committees.
Technical Solutions
I            The applicable average tower distance is around 196 m. Height of towers are vary
from 20m to 35m, especialy, for sections across rivers, the height of tower can be
|            reach to 120m.
Application of different dimensions for pole/tower foundations to be suitable to
I |          their functions and the selected locations. Area of pole/tower foundation size will
vary from 22m2 to 289m2.
) 1          4.2.3 Mitigation measures in construction stage
* g          During the detail technical design, PC2 and its Consultants will reinvestigate the
routes and make certain modification, if necessary, for optimal results.
In the construction stage, the construction process and organization will be used and
I            optimized to ensure the complying with the current regulations of construction
works and imiinirnize the negative impacts:
3 |          - Construction method is finished for each item to minimize time of temporary
land acquisition.

4.5. Resettlement Site
a            There are 226 HHs (1,066 persons) need to be resettlement. However, these HHs do
not gather but live separately in 40 communes of 15 districts/towns/cities of 7
I            provinces. Base on the socio-economic surveys, it is showed that all affected HHs
have spare land so that they can resettle by their own and, in addition, all HHs who
need to be removed, claimed that they would like to be compensated for their loss
(houses, land, crops and other assets) in cash so that they can self-resettle.
|            Therefore, the project does not need to set up any resettlement site.

used at the time of land acquisition. The decree No. 188/2004/ND-CP, Circulars
No. 1 14/2004/TT-BTC, No.1 16/2004/TT-BTC and others related documents are
also applied for this calculation. The price of land for calculation of compensation
for land acquired by the project will be adjusted to meet the replacement price and
decided by the Chairmen of the Provincial People's Committees based on the
proposal of the DOFs.
8.3.3. Action 3
Immediately after the completion of DMS and inventory survey, CRCs will inspect
and define the official number of PAPs, irnpacted properties and total

8.6. Complaints and Grievances
Since the entire resettlement and rehabilitation program is being carried out with the
participation of the PAHs and the impacted scale of this project will be relatively
small, it is expected that no grievance issue will raise. However, to ensure that the
PAHs have avenues for redressing their grievances related to any aspect of
compensation and resettlement, detailed procedures of redresses of grievances have
been established for the project. The objective is to respond to the complaints of the
PAMs speedily and in a transparent manner. The mechanism is designed to be easy,
transparent and fair. By resolving grievances at the project level, the progress of the
project would be more effective ascertained.
The procedures are as follows:
Stage 1 - Commune Level
If any person is aggrieved by any aspect of the resettlement and rehabilitation
program, he/she can lodge an oral or written grievance with commune authorities.
In case an oral complaint is made, it will be written on paper by the conmune and
processed. Commune People's Committee will settle the issue within 15 days.
Staae 2 - District Level
If any aggrieved person is not satisfied with the decision in Stage 1, he/she can
bring the complaint to the attention of the district CRC and withiin 15 days from the
date of the receipt of the decision in Stage 1, the district CRC will reach a decision
on the complaint within 15 days.
Staze 3 - Provincial Level
If any aggrieved person is not satisfied with the decision in Stage 2, he/she can
bring the complaint to the attention of the provincial CRC and within 15 days from
the date of the receipt of the decision in Stage 2, the district CRC will reach a
decision on the complaint
Staze 4 - Court Case
If the PAP is still dissatisfied with the decision in Stage 3, he/she can bring the case
to the district Court in accordance with the "Civil Procedure Act" and within 15
days of receiving the decision of in Stage 2, the case shall be settled in the district

Notes. * For Chau Thanh 110kV Subsation and Can Tho-Chau Thanh 110kV
Transmission line, areas affected by these projects belong to Hau
Giang province. Since Hau Giang province not yet have decision on
compensation unit cost, so Consultant applied compensation unit costs
for these projects based on decisions of Can Tho PPC.
To ensure that the applied unit costs for compensation are at the replacement costs,
during the impact survey, the Consultants had carried out the survey on unit prices
in 15 relevant districts/towns/cities of the above mentioned provinces and compare
them  with the unit costs approved by the respective Provincial People's
Committees. Construction prices given by contractors for recently structures are
similar to construction prices applied in RAP.
The applicable compensation unit prices in this RAP reflected the prevailing market
prices in the project areas, except the land price: the prevailing market price of land
in the project areas is, in general, slightly higher than that in the approved ones.
The contingency component would cover such differences by the time of actual
RAP implementation.
9.3.1. Compensation Unit Prices for Structures
The compensation unit prices for structures approved by the project related
Provincial People's Committees reflect the building materials and labor costs
proposed by the local construction contractor.

INTRODUCTION
A. Policy Framework
1. This resettlement policy framework prepared based on the OD4.30 of the World
Bank on involuntary resettlement. The principle objective of the Policy Framework is
to ensure that all project affected persons (PAPs) will be compensated for their losses
at replacement cost and provided with rehabilitation measures to assist them to
improve, or at least maintain, their pre-project living standards and income earning
capacity.
I           2. The Policy Framework lays down the principles and objectives, eligibility criteria of
PAPs, entitlements, legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and
rehabilitation, people participation features and grievances procedures that will guide
the compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of the PAPs.
B. Project Affected People (PAPs)
3. The PAPs include the following persons to be identified by the baseline information
I           collected for each of the Inventories and Resettlement Plans as specified in Section 5
of this Policy Framework:
I            -  Persons whose houses are in part or in total affected (temporarily or permanently)
by the project;
-   Persons whose premise and/or agricultural land is partially or totally affected
(temporarily or permanently) by the project;
-   Persons whose businesses are affected in part or in total (temporarily or
permanently) by the project; and
-   Persons whose crops (annual and perennial) and trees are affected in part or in
total by the Project.
C. Principles and Objectives
4. The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 have been
adopted in preparing this Policy Framework. In this regard the following principles
and objectives would be applied:
(a) Acquisition of land and other assets, and resettlement of people will be minimized
as much as possible.
(b) All PAPs residing, working, doing business or cultivating land in right of way of
transmission line, surrounding areas of tower foundation, the surveys are entitled to be
provided with rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or at least

will be provided to the PAPs no later than one month prior to the expected start-up
date of works in the respective Project site.
(f) Plans for acquisition of land and other assets and provision of rehabilitation
measures will be carried out in consultation with the PAPs, to ensure minimal
disturbance. Entitlements will be provided by PAPs no later than one month prior to
expected start-up of works at the respective project site.
