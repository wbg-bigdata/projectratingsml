The 110/35/22kV Dai An substation is planned to construct at the land area of Dai An Industrial Zone, Tu
Minh village, Cam Giang district. Hai Duong provinlc. The transmission line shall traverse two (02)
districts includinig Camn Giang (Tu Minh. 'T'u l Thone, Nhat 'I'an comIllunles) and Gia L oc (Lien Hong. Gia
Loc cominmunics) - Hai DuomnL Provinice - Hai DUOne- I'rovilIcc.
Dai An substationi is located in Dai An industrial Zone. Northerin part of the substation is National Road
No.5 (Ila Noi to Hlai Phong). Southern part is next to Sat River. Eastern part is next to access road of
Thuong Dat hamlet. Western part of the substation is next to Nhat Tan hamlet and rice field. The nearest
population area is in Nhat Tan hamlet, about 700m far from the substation.
The substation has the function of supplying electricity to Dai An Industrial Zone, Phuc Dien Industrial
Zone and new urban areas of Hai Duong City'.

crops and rice fields
-   The construction works will be started after
harvest
-   Vegetation affected is mainly grasses and
some    short-time   crops   during  the
construction and conductor lying.
-   Dai An substation is located inside Dai An

- The nearest population area is 700m far from the
substationi. the substation is 600m far from National
Road No.5, there is already certain level of noise and
dust caused by transportation in this road. The
additional noise and dust caused by the Project is not
considerable  due  to  distance  to the  nearest
population sites w'ill be not affect residential area.
- 110kV line is oniv 8km long and mainly crosses
the rice field or agricultural land (other dry crop and
polld. r iver etc). Noise and dust occurring at
constructioll sites will not affect residential area.

- Excavated soil of tower founidations shall be used
to embar-k surrounding thcse foudations and the
quantity of the redulidant soil is very little.
- No serious erosion and sedimentation can happen
lbecause the T L mainly crosses the flat areas such as
crops, rice Fields ...
- The construction site (substation) is near Sat river,

the TL crosses a pond (G4 point), Ty river (Branch

sedimentation of the river due to earth excavated for
pole foundation or substation leveling. But no
excavation will be planned to avoid rainy season so
soil erosion and sedimentation can be considerably
reduced.

transported to constructioni site is estimated 435m3
of stone, II .673m3 of sand
- These amoulIts of construction material will be
transported to the substationi by the National Road
No.5. The transportation in the Road is already quite
intensive. so additional work for the substation is not
considerable.
- Duration of substation ground leveling is quite
short (fi-om 2 to 3 months).
- Duration  of excavated   construction  of pole
foundationi for each pole wvill last within 2 or 3
weeks. Pole foundationi is mainly located   on
agricultural land. Residential area is far (usually
500m. 700m or evein higher from the construction
site) so air quality will not be effected seriously in
residential area.
-  lie vehicles and equipment used for the project

- Sewage from employees shall be discharged into
