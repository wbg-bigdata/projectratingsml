Based on the Viet Nam     Government Policy on the national industrialization and
modernization program, Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) has decided to use World
Bank financial resource for transmission line and distribution projects 3034 World
Bank's credit (Transmission, Distribution and Disaster Reconstruction) was signed on
November 25th, 1998 (effective date is February 12th, 1999). In order to use the
saving cost of this project, EVN proposed to extend the closing date up to 30/6/2006.
A part of the Transmission, Distribution and Disaster Reconstruction project, which is
carried out by Power Company 2 (PC2) is to construct and install 110kV distribution
network in Southern Vietnam. The following subprojects will be implemented within
the credit 3034 in Southern province of Vietnam, carried out by PC2. From this point
afterward, "Project" will be used to mean this part of Transmission, Distribution and
Disaster Reconstruction Project.
The project will consist of 12 components, of which there are 6 substations and 6
transmnission lines. The project will be implemented in 7 provinces: Tien Giang, Hau
Giang, Lam Dong, Soc Trang, Binh Thuan, Ben Tre, Vinh Long. Their locations are
showed in following table:

To improve the power supply
quality for distribution network of
Cho Lach District and surrounding
areas.
Implementing the project components, land acquisition will be required for stations,
pole foundation, access roads and ROWs. However, extension of the 110kV T/Ls and
construction of S/Ss will not cause large scale of impact on environment, land
acquisition and resettlement. Current data show that there is lack of electricity (almost
constantly overloaded) due to:
- The ever increasing demand.
- Lack of electricity supply sources and transformers

Therefore, implementing this project will satisfy the requirements of power network
development in the project areas, meet the immediate requirements and future
electricity demand, increase electricity supply and share the electricity availability
with the existing substation which was currently overloaded. The project will not only
directly satisfy the ever-increasing demand for industries, handicraft, tourism, and
agriculture and aquaculture development but also improve the spiritual and material
life of communities in the project areas.

2.4. MAIN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Width of ROW: 13 - 15m
Pole: steel pole, height are varying from 18m to 3 Im
Depth of pole's foundation: 1.3m
Span between two poles: 70 m to 80 m
2.5. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF 110KV SUBSTATION CONSTRUCTION
Main criteria for selection of substation are:
- Near electricity load center;
- Convenience for connection with 110kV in and out from the substation;
- Convenience for transportation of heavy equipment
- Suitable with socio-economic development of the local areas;
- Minimizing adverse environmental impacts;
Level ground arrangement
The level ground of each substation is designed basing on the line's alignment in and
out of substation, the transportation road, methods for equipment installation. The
level ground arrangement is also based on functions of the substation at the present
time with consideration for the further functions. Other sources of information for
level ground arrangement are reports of topography survey, geological survey, hydro
and meteorological survey in substations area.

Calculation of substation's foundation level (height)
Principally, the height of the foundation is calculated to avoid inundation in flood
season. The height should be selected in consideration to minimize amount of earth
needed for levelling but should be high enough to enable water running off and to
avoid flood. Usually the substation foundation height if difference is varied only for
few centimetres (for example 199,9 m and 200 m).
Ground levelling technique
Usually earth is used for ground leveling. Earth is rammed for each layer with 20cm
depth. Substation ground and walking ways inside substation are rammed and covered
by special material (CE 121) to avoid soil erosion and avoid weed growing.
The amount of earth and other material for substation and access road leveling are
specified more details in other section.
Ditch for cable
A part of substation construction is underground ditch for cables installation.
Underground ditch is usually constructed by reinforce concrete, lowering to made
collector. Typical width is 80 cm, typical depth is 70 cm. The cover of ditch is also
made by reinforce concrete and it is 6 cm in thick. Slope of ditch is about 0,05% to
enable water running off.
Transportation ways inside substation
Ways inside substation are used for transformer, equipment transportation and
walking during operation phase. The ways are made by concrete with carefully
rammed earth.
Water supply for substation
According to regulation for substation design, there is no need to design system for
fire extinguishment because project location is near local center of prevent and fight
fire. The main water demand is for daily use of operating staffs. Almost all substations
water source are supplied by underground water from the underground well-water.
Waste water
Drainage system is designed for whole substations including rain water run off, waste
water treatment. The water releasing from drainage system is meeting the VietNam
standards for domestic waste water TCVN 6772 - 2000, level III. The impacts to the
environment are very limited in term of waste water.

CHAPTER 5. SCREENING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
IMPACTS
5.1. CLASSIFICATION OF IMPACTS
The environmental impact assessment focuses on the major environmental issues of
the Project's Most Favored Alternative.
If classification of impacts base on affecting duration, impacts can be classified as
follow:
i) Temporary Impact within ROW
Land, air and water environment, fauna and flora at project area, and crops, trees
or structures within ROW of T/L, surrounding areas of tower foundation, within
the temporary service roads, are temporarily affected only during the
construction period due to construction activities and domestic activities of
worker.
ii) Permanent Impact
Land, structures, properties and flora will be permanently affected due to
acquired land permanently for the tower foundations, the substation areas, the
permanent access roads for construction and maintenance of the project.
All of households have house (total or a part of house area) or structure, or trees
in ROW of the transmission line, which need to be removed, demolished, or cut.
If classification of impacts base on affecting level, the potential impacts of the
Project's in pre-construction, construction, and operation phases were assessed as
being in one of five categories:
i) No impact. The potential impact of the Project activity is assessed as No impact
if the project activities are physically removed out of from the environmental
component.
ii) Major impact. An impact is said to be Major if the project activities have
potential impacts to environmental components. Major impacts could be "Major
Negative" or "Major Positive". The following criteria were used to determine
whether a given impact is Major:
- Spatial scale of the impact (site, local, regional, or national/ international);

1 OkV Transrnission lines and substations in Southern Vietnam
- Time horizon of the impact (short, medium, or long term);
- Magnitude of the change in the environmental component brought about by
the Project activities (small, moderate, large);
- Importance to local human populations;
- Compliance with national, provincial, or district environmental protection
laws standards, and regulations
- Compliance with Viet Nam's international commitments. These include the
Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterflow
Habitat (RAMSAR), the Convention Concerning the protection of the World
Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage Convention), and the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flora (CITIES); and
- Compliance with World Bank guidelines, policies, and regulations.
iii) Minor impact. If an impact occurs but does not meet the criteria for a Major
Impact it is assigned the category Minor. Minor impacts could be "Minor
negative" or "Minor Positive".
iv) Mitigable impact. The potential impact of a project activity on an
environmental component is said to be Mitigable if there is potential for a major
negative impact and the proposed mitigation measure will prevent the impact or
reduce the impact to acceptable levels.
5.2. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT
The project will play an important role in promotion of socio-economic development
in the targeted provinces. The project will also contribute to (i) stabilize voltage in
local area; (ii) supply electricity for industrial zones, tourism area; (iii) support
neighbor substation in case of emergency; (iv) other purposes. Electricity demand in
project's provinces is increased 15% to 17% annually.
It will also promote the policies of industrialization and modernization of the
Government of Viet Nam as well as create and great opportunity for overall socio-
economic development of the poor area. The electricity demand in these provinces is
quite high at the moment. The electricity is important to support many other sea food
processing factories.

activities.                           minimized by the natural surrounding vegetation.
The transportation road go across some densely population areas (along roads
such as: Highway one, 863, 13, 929, Mai Anh Dao and some local roads) so
impact of dust generated by transportation activities is considerable in these area
but the impact is shortly and will be ended when construction stage finish.
Because the projects site is far from residential area (200m - 500m), the
concentration of discharging source is not large and many mitigating measures
will be executed, this impact is insignificant.
These impacts are short, temporary and will be ended after the construction
stage.
Noise generation   X            With Substation projects, this impact is insignificant because the project site is
from vehicles and               far from residential areas (200m - 500m), almost substation is circled by a green
equipments.                     fence which can hinder and absorb noise.
With transmission line projects, this impact is very low because the
construction activities are mainly done by hand and period of construction for
every tension pole is short (about 15 days).
However, some of roads go near/through resident area, where materials,
equipments and vehicles transporting vehicles usually go, must be noted.
Many minimize measures will be carried out such as: control working time, use
equipments to minimize noise.

Mitigating impacts on Ethnic Minority
Besides above measures, the project will execute more measures to minimize impacts
includes of (i) technical measure; (ii) encouraging EM in the project affected areas to
participate in preparing and implementing EMDP; and (iii) closely consultation with
local authorities and all relevant institutions.
Information from the SIA and meetings with the ethnic minority communities will be
used by the Project Engineer in preparing the design, construction schedule and
construction measures for the subprojects and estimated cost of required work. These
will include:
a. Recommend changing of line alignments, locations, construction measures
anid schedule for subprojects to accommodate needs and preferences of
ethnic minorities:
Public consultation has already undertaken during the preliminary design
stage for the line alignments, locations of support poles with consideration
to preferences of the EM communities in the project areas.
The construction schedule has been considered to avoid crops. However,
temporary lost of crops is compensated at market prices.
b. Identify areas for particular cultural, spiritual or ecological sensitivity
which should be considered in design and construction activities
The sensitive areas have been well considered during the preliminary
design stage. However, such sensitive areas are well away from the ROWs
of the project.
c. Develop a program for communication, information and education by the
commune for the ethnic minority community in the zone of influence on
electric safety, potential health and social problems.
Special training programs for EM communities in the zone of influence
have been envisaged i.e.:
* Training on Agricultural Extension Program for EM households in the
project areas.
* Training on electric safety for villagers and pupils in the project areas.
* Training on utilization of small credit from BARD.

d. Land acquisition and compensation: Where there is land acquisition in
ethnic minorities, the project will ensure that their rights will not be
violated and that they will be compensated for the use of any part of their
land in a manner that cultural acceptableness to them. The compensation
will follow the Resettlement Policy for PAPs under the Project. Ethnic
minority leaders will assist with consultation of affected households and
with compensation activities.
* Compensation for land shall be at replacement cost as defined in RAP in
respect of any part of the land. However, it is noted that all EM PAPs
already have their LURCs for their overall land holding.
* There are always one representative of EM PAPs in Di Linh and Duc
Trong districts, Lam Dong province and one representative of EM PAPs
in My Tu districts, Soc Trang province with EM communities.
* The EM     people enjoy similar compensation    administrative and

CHAPTER 10. PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE
10.1. COMMUNITY MEETINGS
When the survey was completed, the Consulting Company (in coordination with the
commune officials) held meeting with PAHs having land in ROW and representatives
of Commune People's Committees, other government offices and commune NGOs
(Women Unions, Youth Unions, Farmers Associations, Fatherland Fronts, War
Veterants etc.). During the meetings, the Consultant presented numerous materials,
including: project Summary, draft RAP and draft EMP including Project's
identification, maps of the project site, maps of environmental project, figures, tables,
photos, pictures, and other support materials. Meeting officials informed participants
of the project purpose; presented the project impacts on land, crops, effect on
environment in detail; introduced the principles and policies of environment. Question
posed by the PAHs were addressed and recommendations/ concerns of PAHs and
Consultants were recorded.
The prevailing opinion of PAPs in the areas:
-   PAPs would like to be informed of the actual project implementation time-
schedule well in advance so as to prepare themselves for ground clearance.
,             -  PAPs would like to be compensated at replacement cost for their assets losses
and market price for their temporarily affected crops.
Most of the meeting for each component of the Project was held on from May to
September, 2004. The main comments of local people on the Project and the
environmental issue of the Project are summarized in table 6.1.
10.2. SOCIO - ECONOMIC SURVEYS
Consultants have carried out the socio-economic surveys and full-in the
"Questiomnaires" covering 100% of PAPs in the project areas. (Pls. see Annex 3 for
Sample of "Questionnaires")

10.3. OBJECTIVE OF INFORMATION CAMPAIGN AND CONSULTATION
PROGRAM
Information dissemination to, consultation with and participation of the affected
people and involved agencies (i) reduce the potential for conflicts, (ii) minimize the
risk of project delays, and (iii) enable the project to design the environmental
management program to fit the needs, priorities of the affected people and protect
environment thereby maximizing the economic and social benefits of the project
investment.
The objective of the Public Information Campaign and PAP Consultation Program are
as follows:
-  To share full information on the proposed project areas, its components and its
activities with the affected people.
-  To obtain information about the needs and priorities of the affected people as well
as information about their reactions/feedback to proposed policies and activities.
-  To obtain the cooperation and participation of the affected people and
communities required to be undertaken for environmental management plan.
-  To ensure transparency in all activities related to land acquisition, environmental
management plan.
There are two phases of the public information campaign and PAP consultation:
Phase 1: Information campaign, PAPs and agency consultation during prepare
environmental management plan
Phase 2: Information campaign and consultation during execute environmental
management plan
10.4. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN INFORMATION
BOOKLET (EIB)
To ensure that PAPs, their representative and local government of the affected areas
fully understand the detail of EMP, EIB will be prepared by PC2, and will be
distributed to all PAPs in the project area in the initial duration of the implementation
stage.
The EIB will contain information on the followings:

environimental certificate as required by; DONRL will be the oniL environmental
requiremenl fiorfurther processirg co Of tihe slbproject.
EA Documentation/DocumeLiM   Content
Preparation of all EA\ documentation is the responsibility of the Client.
An ENIP should include the following sections:
Project Description (see Annex 1)
*  Screening of Potential Environmental Issues AND Rationale for Their
Siznificance Gradinm
An EMP should be developed from the Environmental Template Documllent, xhich
has been suggested by WVB and the final version is yet to be endorsed bv EVN and \4Ol
An EIA or environmental certificate should be prepared in accordance wvith
Vietnamese guidelines as presented in the GOV Circular 490/KHCNNIT
All EA documents (EMIP. and EIA) should be consistent. For example, prioritv
issues identified should be, the same for all EA documents as well as the propused
measures to mitigate these Issues. Similarly, institutional responsibilities for mitigation.
monitorinn etc. should be the same in all EA documents.
Consultation                                               -
The Client will be required to conduct a consultation with project affected people
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The purpose of the consultaiion is to identify
environmental issues of concern to project affected groups and NGOs. so that they may be
included in the E A documents. Therefore consultation m ay take place e ither before the
FMivP is prepared or after 2. .r-ft FMD  s available. In either casX,,le fl?,l EMP
include ainy appropnate environmental issues identified at the consultation.
The consultation can be conducted in any of several forms: door-7o-door survey.
public meeting, circulation of questionnaires. call-in to local radio or TV s;ation, etc.
Detailed documentation of the consultation (see Annex F of the Environmental
Template Document) should be included in the EMP and IEE/EIA.
Disclosure
The Client will be required to provide a Vietnamese lansuace vers:on of the EMP
and IEE'EIA in a publi'c location easily accessible to project affected peco!e. An Enealish
languase version of the EMIP and IEEBEIA should also be provided by :.. Client to the
World Bank Office in H anoi for display in its library (VlDIC) and in t`e Info Shon in
Washincton DC



EA Review and Approval
The Client will be responsible for delivering IEE/EIA and EMNP1 documenits of
quality acceptable to the Bank for the Bank's review and clearance.
In the final submission to the Bar-k, the Client should provide evidence to the P.%IU
(e.g. copies of the letters of approvai, environmental certificate) that all necessar.
approvals o f the R egistration for Environment P ermit/EIA h ave b een obtained from t he
responsible Vietnamese authorities.
Sub loan Conditionalitv and Approval
It.is the responsibility of the Client to assure that sub loan agreements include a
statement, \vhich commits the Client to implementing the EMP. The followring sample may
be useful:
"The Client (or sub-Borrower) agrees to implement the Environmental Management Plan 
(EMP) as presented in (indicate wvhere the officially approved EMP is located----it could
be included as an Annex in the loan documents or situated in a projectfile)"
From the environmental view, a sub loan may only be approved after tize Clienit
has: (a) agreed to the conditionality for ElsIP implementation, (b) has successfullv
conducted and documented the public consultation and (c) demonstrated that all
appropriate EA documents have been disclosed.
Environmental Performance Standards
If either construction or operation aspects of the subproject are subject to specfic
Vietnamese environmnental standards, for example: electric and magnetic field strength.
prohibition of the use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), noise, dust, etc. These items
should be included in the Environmental Monitoring Program section of the EMP (set
Annex C of the Environmental Template Document). It is the Clients' responsibility to
assure that all Vietnamese environmental performance standards are met in the design,
construction and operation of the subproject. Ii is the responsibility of the Vietnamese-
environmental authorities to assure these standards are obeyed. From time to time, if
necessary, the Vietnamese environmental authorities may wish to seek support of the PMvU
in meeting their responsibility.
Licensing and Permitting
it is the r sponsibility of,'-                      ar.y        licens-,
or permnits, which are either issued by or re.quire approval of any Vietnamese
environmental authorities during both subproject construction and operation phases for the
life of the project.
INVESTMNENIT IMPLEMENTATION
Suuervision Responsibilities for Mitieation and Monitorinz
It is the responsibility of the PNIfU, possibly in collaboration with Vietnamese
environmental authorities to supervise both the mitigation and monitoring activities which
have been agreed to by the Client in the sub loan documentation. The supervision effort
should be a regular on-goincg activity. Additionally, if there are complaints from local
project-affected groups, the PvIfU should be prepared to send staff in a timely fashion to
assess the validity of complaints and taake any necessary actions to remedy the situation.
Institutional Resoonsibilities for Environmental Manacement



Institutional responsibilities for environmental management must be carefully
delineated and described in the EMP. Annex C of the Environmental Template Document
indicates the type of infomiation, wlich is required. A clear line of responsibility must be
indicated from data collection (numbers, observations), to analysis (information based
upon data), to reporting (inforrmation flow) to management (decision makers).
The PN9U will be responsible for monitoring of the implementation of a Site ENIP
(SENIP) by the contractors. An independent safeguard consultant will be hired by the
Client t o m onitor the general impacts of t he p roject a nd the E MP implementation. The
head of the project's communes will be sending to .he PMU a monthly monitoring report.
Based on this reporting line, the PMU will consoi {dcte the implementation of ENIP in its
quarterly progress report submitted to the Bank, copied to respective DONREs.
Permits and Licensing
Vietnamese environmental authorities are responsible for assuring that anv
permits or licenses which they either issue or approve for the subproject are maintained. It
is the Clients' responsibility to- maintain all such licenses and permits current. From time to
time, if necessary, the Vietnamese environmental authorities may wish to seek support of
the PMNU in assuring the Client meets this responsibility.
