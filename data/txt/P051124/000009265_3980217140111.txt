3. Benefits:
Proper utilization of project outputs would result in the following principal benefits:
(i) improve the operating efficiency and quality of electricity, water/sanitation, and telecommunications services; and
(ii) mobilize private sector capital to fund expansion of service.
Successful implementation will improve service quality for existing consumers, expand access for those currently without
services, and improve efficiency of basic economic and environmental services for the economy at large. While not a direct
benefit of the restructuring program, the transfer of responsibility for service provision to the private sector is expected to
create fiscal space in the general budget and as such will support the Govemment's public expenditure policy of directing
more budgetary resources to the social sectors.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 1998-2001
Executing agencies: MIPPE is responsible for assuring consistent implementation of the Government's reform program and
achievement of the program's economic objectives. The Ministry has been charged with supervision of the reform process
in the infrastructure sectors and will be the implementing agency for the project. Within MIPPE, the UTPP has direct
responsibility for oversight and day to day execution of the restructuring program and is already discharging these functions
for the IDB financed activities which form part of the project. The activities to be financed under the IBRD loan will utilize
existing implementation arrangements to ensure that the Bank, IDB, and other sources of financial and technical support are
closely coordinated during project implementation. The UTPP will be responsible for execution of project activities. The
sectoral institutions such as ERSP, MINSA, IRHE, IDAAN, will be responsible for defining and developing work
programs, substantive oversight of consultants and management of training activities.
The UTPP will also be responsible for administration of project funds, monitoring and reporting, and contracting
procedures. To facilitate timely procurement of technical assistance and payment of consultants financed under the loan,
the Government will contract with and directly finance the UNDP as procurement agent. The UNDP is currently carrying
out this function in a satisfactory manner for the IDB-funded activities which form part of this project. Such an
arrangement will help ensure consistent and timely implementation of closely related elements of the restructuring program
and will facilitate uniform reporting on project activities and expenditures.

Country: Panama                                     Project Title: Utilities Restructuring Technical Assistance Project
Project coordination: The UTPP is responsible for ensuring the activities and actions of the sectoral agencies are
consistent with sectoral and administrative policy in terms of content, timing and procedure. In this regard, the UTPP will
reach agreement with the sectoral agencies on the content of work, tenns of reference, identification of consultants and/or
consulting services including the preparation of short lists, publication of notices, evaluation of proposals, ensuring
participation of relevant sectoral institutions in the assignment, auditing of contracts as well as reporting requirements to
MIPPE, IBRD and 1DB. Such agreement has already been concluded for the majority of activities to be undertaken over the
next 12 months. The Project Implementation Plan (PIP) which has been found satisfactory by the Bank, describes the
coordination procedures. The latter have already been put in place and are working satisfactorily.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: During project preparation, UTPP's accounting, internal
controls, staffing, and reporting capabilities were reviewed by Bank financial management staff and found to be adequate.
The: required systems are in place and functioning well. The UTPP is in the process of completing the computerization of its
financial monitoring systems. This work will be completed within the first half of 1998. Project accounts will be maintained
by UTPP. It will maintain records and accounts which reflect, in accordance with standard accounting practices, the
operations, resources, and expenditures for each project activity. The accounts will be prepared monthly and consolidated
annually to provide a single financial statement for the project as a whole which reflects expenditures by component,
activity, disbursement category, and source of funds. The UTPP will retain the necessary supporting documentation, to be
macle available to Bank missions and independent auditors as required. Project records and accounts, including the SOEs,
will be audited annually in accordance with appropriate accounting principles consistently applied by auditors acceptable to
the Bank, with terms of reference for auditors and reports approved by the Bank. The Bank's Financial Accounting,
Reporting, and Auditing Handbook (FARAH) published in January 1995, will be used by the auditors in accordance with
the IBank's existing guidelines. Audit reports will be furnished to the Bank within four months after close of the
Government's fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Monitoring of project implementation will be undertaken by UJTPP, in its
capacity as coordinator of the restructuring programs. Success in achieving the benefits described in Section 3 above will
be monitored by responsible agencies in the sector such as the regulatory agency, MINSA and UTPP. The Bank will
participate in monitoring project implementation through supervision missions. Starting on October 31, 1998, UTPP will
provide to the Bank an annual plan of work. In addition, UTPP will provide to the Bank twice yearly reviews of progress
over the prior six months, commencing July 31, 1998. Annual reviews of the project will commence in July 1999.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective supported by the    Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Report 13846-PAN,
project                              February 7, 1995
The CAS stresses the importance of reviving sustainable growth through efficient resource use and private investment. A
key element of this strategy is improving the efficiency of public service provision and increasing the coverage of basic
infrastructure services. The proposed project would support the creation of an enabling environment for mobilizing private
sector participation to expand service coverage and quality and the implementation of a legal and regulatory framework
which fosters efficiency in provision and resource conservation. The project would also strengthen key policy-making and
regulatory bodies charged with overseeing these sectors.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The Government has concluded that inadequate provision of key infrastructure services has hindered economic growth and
efforts to improve quality of life among large sectors of the population. In the case of water and sanitation, service
deficiencies have also been a major contributor to environmental deterioration. The government now seeks to redress these
deficiencies through mobilization of private sector management expertise and capital, introduction of competition where
feasible, and redefinition of the government's role and functions from that of service provider to regulator and policy maker.
Electricity Sector: In the electricity sector, the state-owned utility, IRHE, has been unable to efficiently meet the growing
demand for electricity service. Rural coverage levels are extremely low at 50%, while urban areas fare better with



Project Appraisal Document                                                                         Page 5
Country: Panama                                     Project Title: Utilities Restructuring Technical Assistance Project
approximately 85% service coverage. Plant availability is low (42% of thermal), system losses are high (23%), and the
organization is overstaffed by international standards (82 customers/employee). While average retail tariffs are adequate
and high relative to the economic costs of service (USc 1 1/kWh), IRHE's financial solvency has been undermined by
transfers to Government in order to finance the general budget. Similarly, its operational autonomy and commercial
attributes have been circumscribed by a host of procurement, fund management, and staffing restrictions common to all
government agencies. IRHE's statutory monopoly, lack of commercial autonomy and conflicts of interest stemming from
internal policy making, service regulation, and public expenditure management, has led to growing operating inefficiencies
and inadequate service.
Water Sector: Provision of water and sewerage service for all but the smallest communities has been vested in a state
owned monopoly, IDAAN. Official estimates report nominal coverage at 80% and 50% for urban areas and 50% and 20%
in rural areas, while the actual access to services is probably less than the coverage figures suggest. Though IDAAN has
been relatively successful in increasing water production, management of and investment in distribution systems is poor,
with unaccounted-for-water (UFW) estimated at 45%. As a consequence, the water quality is inconsistent and water service
in many areas is characterized by low pressure and rationing. Treatment of residual flows is virtually non existent with
waste water discharged directly in watersheds, riverine and marine areas. This has contributed to environmental
degradation, most notably the Bay of Panama. Tariffs are a bit low by international standards (US$.35/m), and
approximately 30% of users are charged rates at half that level by virtue of their classification as "social sector" customers.
Less than half of potential tariff revenue is billed or collected. As a consequence, IDAAN has increasingly relied on direct
government transfers to finance not only investment, but also a portion of its operating expenditures.
Telecommunications Sector: Until 1997, all basic telephony services were provided by the state owned
telecommunications enterprise, INTEL. Coverage of basic services is low ( 11 lines/100 persons), given the prominent role
of information-intensive industries in the economy such as financial services, trade, and shipping. Service quality has also
been deficient: it has generally taken months to install a new line, weeks to repair faults, and more than half of the few
existing public telephones were in service at any given time. Moreover, INTEL did not provide cellular or other potentially
profitable data services in spite of the rapid growth in demand for the full spectrum of telecommunications services. As a
consequence, many business enterprises were compelled to provide services themselves, at very high cost. The inability of
INTEL to effectively service the growing demand for telecommunications services has largely been due to the budgetary and
management constraints characteristic of state owned enterprises and restrictions on market entry which inhibited
competition and innovation.
Past Reform Efforts:
Since the early 1 990s, the Government has sought to improve efficiency of service provision in the electricity, water and
telecommunications sectors by seeking to strengthen the relevant parastatal's operational and financial performance and by
encouraging private sector participation. However, the limited modifications in legislation and administrative procedures
enacted in pursuit of this goal did not establish industry structures or a regulatory framework conducive to securing private
participation, nor did it introduce competitive forces and improving the utilities' performance: private participation was
restricted to new capacity and, in the case of electricity, its allowed share of system capacity was capped; tariff policies did
not reflect economic nor financial considerations; and environmental provisions were vague and confusing. As a
consequence, several fundamental problems were not dealt with: (1) the utilities themselves remained responsible for all
aspects of system operations on the one hand, and policy and planning on the other; (2) all existing facilities and services
were to remain with the utilities; (3) IRHE and IDAAN were to assume all market risk for purchases from power/water
treatment plants; and (4) operators' rights and obligations in the provision of services remained vague, with their definition
left to the utility's discretion. These shortcomings have precluded the introduction of meaningful competition and the
likelihood that private participation, if indeed it were to materialize, would significantly improve sectoral efficiency. The
foregoing largely explains the absence until recently of a single IPP, private water treatment plant, or cellular service in
Panama despite repeated efforts since early 1991 to attract private participation.

Recent Actions and Government Strategy:
The current administration has pursued a far-reaching infrastructure sector reform strategy, recognizing the inadequacies of
prior efforts and the priority placed on reorienting and redimensioning the public sector's role in the economy and
redirecting public spending toward the social sectors. This strategy was developed through a lengthy process of
consultation with industry, government agencies, organized labor, and the public at large, and has been codified in sectoral
legislation, enacted in late 1995 and early 1996. The legal framework now in place requires the separation of policy,
regulatory, and operating functions and the establishment of a transparent regulatory framework to be applied impartially to
public and private operators. Toward this end, the Government established a financially autonomous and administratively
independent agency (ERSP) responsible for regulating the provision of public services (telecoms, electricity and water),
granting concessions and licenses, verifying service quality and environmental compliance, setting tariffs for regulated
segments of the market, promoting competition, and applying sanctions and penalties for non-compliance.
Policy and planning functions are now vested in an Energy Policy Commission in the electricity sector, and in MINSA in
the water and sanitation sector. The state owned utilities are to be disaggregated and responsibility and control of the
majority of services transferred to the private sector via sale of majority shares or through long-termn concession
arrangements. Approximately 5% of shares have been reserved for the existing utilities' labor force and the remainder may
be sold on the local market. As such, the privatization process in the infrastructure sectors, in combination with ongoing
modernization of banking and securities legislation and other financial sector reforms, is expected to contribute to the
development of local capital markets. The labor force's rights and privileges are also established in the legislation with
respect to collective bargaining, transfer of equipment to workers to establish their own service companies, and enhanced
transitory severance and retirement benefits. The legislation also contains specific provisions and principles for extending
service to rural areas, granting subsidies to the poorest segments of the population, and encouraging efficient and
sustainable use of natural resources. Increased coverage and service across income groups will be achieved through
universal service targets, direct subsidies and tariff reform. No new legislation is required to implement the reform program
for the infrastructure sectors.
In the electricity sector, IRHE will be broken up into independent companies: three distribution, three to four generation,
and one transmission/system operations entity. The enterprise restructuring work and key regulatory studies are underway.
The distribution and thermal generation companies will be privatized over the next two years. Over time, other companies
will be divested and the system of supply contracts between generators and the system operator will evolve into a real time
wholesale power market. In the interim, large consumers will be permitted to contract directly with the generating
companies for capacity and energy for which regulations requiring non-discriminatory access to the transmission and
distribution networks will be put in place this year. With the creation of the Energy Policy Commission, Panama will have a
public policy body responsible for indicative systems planning, coordination of various elements of energy policy,
promoting new private investment, energy conservation, and fuel marketing and diversification. Responsibility for rural
electrification will be transferred to a semi-autonomous agency, the Oficina de Electrificaci6n Rural, which will facilitate
the implementation of demand driven and private sector led projects.
In the water and sanitation sector, IDAAN is to be disaggregated into 2-3 companies. Responsibility for service to the
urban and peri-urban areas of Panama Metro, Chiriqui, and the Central Provinces will be transferred to the private sector
via auction of majority shares or competitively awarded concessions. Water production and treatment facilities in the canal
zone are to be incorporated into the system within the next two years. Detailed analysis of engineering, financial, and
economic parameters for the delineation of the new water companies has begun and will be completed by February 1998.
histallations and services in rural areas currently under MINSA's jurisdiction will be reconstituted under decentralized
cooperative or municipal arrangements, which likewise will be structured to facilitate private sector participation. Strategy
and programming decisions on these and other elements of sector policy are the responsibility of MINSA, which will be
reorganized and strengthened to effectively take on these functions.
In the telecommunications sector, the government has already established a regulatory framework designed to attract
private capital and management expertise, foster competition, and provide for orderly development of its radio frequencies.

In early 1996, the first cellular services license was granted to a consortium led by Bell South. In mid 1997, 49% of the
shares of INTEL, and managerial control was awarded to Cable and Wireless, netting US$ 650 million in proceeds and
US$500 million in investment commitments over the next 5 years. The majority of remaining shares are to be placed with
private investors in a subsequent tranche. In addition, during the past year a number of concessions and licenses have been
granted to providers of value added, data, trunking, and satellite services. Prices for these services are determined by the
operators under a fully competitive regime. Work is continuing on refining outstanding components of the regulatory
framework governing interconnection, concessionaire compliance with service targets, development of monitoring and
information systems, and dispute resolution procedures.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The principal strategic choice embodied in the Government's reform program is that addressing the long-standing problems
of poor service provision will require comprehensive restructuring of the utilities sectors. In particular, the roles and
functions of Government have been redefined to permit the introduction of private sector participation in the electricity,
water supply, and telecommunications sectors within a policy, regulatory and institutional framework which will provide
strong incentives to improve service efficiency, quality and coverage. In each of these sectors, the Government has enacted
an adequate legal framework for fostering private sector participation. The task is now to implement it. The project will
provide assistance for the following: restructuring and delineating the new companies; preparation for private participation
including systems characterization, asset valuation, design of bidding documents and sale facilitation; elaboration of
regulatory instruments and directives; carrying out of environmental audits; and establishing environmental standards. It
will also provide ongoing support to the regulatory and policy-making bodies in preparation for their newly defined
responsibilities. The latter is deemed critical to providing a stable, supportive environment in which both public and private
service can operate efficiently. Lastly, the project will support several activities directed at enhancing the scope for
individuals, communities, and interest groups to have a voice in the privatization process and in the provision of
infrastructure services.
Coordination with the IDB is an important element of the project strategy. IDB is already providing both investment
financing and technical assistance to the Government for the reform program. Relations are good and agreement was
reached on the allocation of funding responsibilities for various aspects of the infrastructure reform program, and on the
content and timing of key activities. Close collaboration in this area will ensure a coordinated policy dialogue, conformity
in the approaches of both institutions, and coherent and timely implementation. Implementation arrangements for the
project are designed to ensure close coordination and effective implementation: the two multilateral institutions will employ
the same organizational arrangements, reporting requirements, and monitoring systems.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
The Government and Bank considered three options for providing assistance in implementing the Government's
infrastructure reform program. First, an investment loan (power transmission reinforcement) with a TA component was
deemed undesirable given the time required to adequately prepare and appraise the investment component, the uncertainty
regarding specific policies and regulations for transmission services, and the immediate need for substantial support for
enterprise restructuring, policy and regulatory work. Second, a partial risk guarantee for one or more of the new companies
to be privatized was deemed a low priority because the substantial technical support required prior to and following
concession award could not readily be provided in the context of a guarantee operation. Finally, a technical assistance
operation was judged to be the most appropriate instrument as it provides the timely support that the Government's
schedule for implementing the reforms requires.
Decisions were also taken on how to provide the technical assistance vis a vis the IDB. Rather than the World Bank funding
all activities in a particular sector and the IDB all those in another, it was agreed that both institutions would finance
selected activities in each. This approach was chosen because available IDB commitments are not sufficient to cover the
support requirements in the three sectors, and the Bank's worldwide experience in infrastructure privatization could be
better utilized if it were to support key activities in each of them.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The design of this project draws on lessons learned in the delivery of technical assistance and in support of privatization in
many countries, including Panama. The most crucial are: sustained government ownership and commitment; flexible project
design; and regular supervision accompanied by substantive policy dialogue. Each of these are key features of the project
(see 8 and 11). In addition, adequate preparation and coordination arrangements are important for ensuring timely
implementation. Terns of reference for work to be carried out during the initial phase of the project have been prepared and
incorporated into the project implementation plan. Similarly, coordination and oversight arrangements have been put in
place, which ensure consistent treatment of regulatory and privatization issues while assigning day to day activity execution
to sectoral agencies.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The strength of the Government's commitment to restructuring the infrastructure sectors and introducing private sector
participation is demonstrated by:
* enactment of comprehensive sectoral reform legislation for the electricity, water, and telecommunications sectors in early
1996 following broad consultation with line agencies, industry, labor unions, and the public at large;
* establishment of an autonomous entity to regulate provision of these services and its timely mid-1996 start-up;
* successful negotiation with labor unions on terms of employment, severance and retraining policies;
* establishment of statutory commissions to ensure transparency in the privatization process; and,
* successful privatization of telecoms (telephone services and cellular), ports (Balboa, Cristobal, Manzanillo), transport
(three highways), and power generation (80MW).

Country: Panama                                     Project Title: Utilities Restructuring Technical Assistance Project
The breadth of commitment throughout the Government is extensive including the line ministries as well as the heads of
IRBE, IDAAN, and INTEL. No additional legislation is required to implement the restructuring program for the
infrastructure sectors.
12. Value added of Bank support:
The Government of Panama values the Bank's worldwide experience in infrastructure privatization and modernization, not
only in terms of sector specific issues, but also for overall coordination of such programs. The Bank's presence may also
serve to lend international credibility to the process, which may foster more competitive bidding and hence most efficiently
improve the provision of key infrastructure services.

Fiscal impact: The restructuring program is expected to have a significant, positive impact. Four dimensions of fiscal
analysis are presented in Annex 4; magnitude of expected sales proceeds, disposition of sales proceeds and debt service
savings, liquidation of pension liabilities/severance payments, and transfers (taxes, dividends and subsidies).
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)      NPV=US$              million; FRR=        %
Individual transactions will have a detailed financial assessment prepared by investment bankers or financial advisors.
15. Technical Assessment: NA
16. Institutional Assessment:
Executing agencies: The long-term sustainability of the reform process requires effective operation of motivated, professional
regulatory and policy-making institutions. The sectoral legislation provides for the clear separation of Government's roles in
policy/planning, regulation, and service provision, and defines the scope, functions, and powers of each. MIPPE/UTPP, the
executing agency and principal policy institution, possesses considerable project execution experience including design and
initial implementation activities of the privatization program over the past year. The multi-sectoral regulator, established by
law in late 1995, enjoys a high degree of financial autonomy and operational independence, a prerequisite for instilling
credibility and transparency in the exercise of its functions. The regulator has attracted 30 experienced professionals who
receive remuneration at several times the civil service standard. The institution has performed well over the past year, issuing
many of the regulations required for the telecoms and electricity sectors. This work has been judged to be of high quality in
terms of its clarity and balance. For the three sectoral policy institutions in the water and electricity sectors (MINSA, CPE,
and Oficina de Electrificaci6n Rural), qualified senior officials have been appointed. Organizational studies, to be completed
in early 1998, will define work program priorities, resource requirements, and training needs.
While considerable organizational capacity and a sound legal framework are in place, successful sector restructuring and
private participation in the utilities sectors will present increasing demands for policy-making and regulation. In conjunction
with the technical assistance provided under the project, independent evaluations to assess institutional performance will be
conducted bi-annually. In addition, the performance of the executing agency, MIPPE, will be a key focus of Bank supervision
missions.
Project management: The project management structure and personnel, in place for the past year, have provided the necessary
degree of coordination among regulatory, policy making, and operating agencies. To avoid delays associated with
procurement of technical assistance and payment to consultants, the UNDP is being contracted to provide procurement agent
services. The executing agency has the capacity to handle some of the initial contracts, and a contract with the UNDP will be
signed within 3 months of loan effectiveness.
17. Social Assessment:
The Government and labor unions agreed to policies and administrative procedures regarding rehiring and severance
conditions for existing labor force of INTEL, IRHE and IDAAN prior to passage of legislation last year (and are codified in
such legislation). Retraining programs for workers choosing early retirement form part of the project. New collective
bargaining agreements are to be negotiated after the new companies are formed and are to be ratified within 12 months
thereafter.

18. Environmental Assessment:
i. Environmental issues:    Major: There are no major environmental impacts.
Other: (a) the existence of guidelines and capacity to incorporate enviromnental and
social concerns into indicative planning; (b) the adequacy of existing service and system
environmental guidelines to monitor compliance; (c) the existence of environmental
liabilities that could effect proposed private sector participation; and, (d) the adequacy
of measures to ensure citizen/community participation during program implementation.
ii. Environmental category:    [B]
iii. Justification/Rationale for category rating: The Project will provide technical assistance in the process of
reforming the water and waste water, energy and telecommunications sectors and concessioning or privatizing
facilities in these sectors. The Project does not finance infrastructure investment and therefore will not have a direct
impact on the environment.
v. Proposed actions: Sector legislation explicitly recognizes the environmental costs of service provision and the
recovery of such cost through tariffs, and incorporates environmental concerns in sector policy, planning, regulation,
and contractual arrangements with the public and private sector. Sector Policy and Planning: the project will
support systems characterization work in the water sector, ongoing support to the Energy Policy Commission in
sector planning, resource conservation and renewable energy development, and support to MINSA for policy,
planning, and monitoring for water and wastewater services. Regulation: The project will finance studies leading to
the formalization and updating of environmental standards for the electricity sector, water and waste water quality
and service standards, consolidation of the institutional framework, and training and equipment for key institutions.
Privatization: The contractual documentation for share sale/concession of the electricity and water companies are to
reflect the environmental protection and mitigation requirements as articulated in the environmental standards and
guidelines and service standards to be issued by the Regulator (ERSP). Environmental audits will be undertaken of
installations to be privatized. Public Consultation:: The project will finance studies leading to issuance of regulatory
directives on consultation and dispute resolution as well as on rights and obligations of clients in the water and
electricity sectors. It will also provide ongoing support to the regulator to develop and strengthen oversight
capabilities in these and other areas of regulatory jurisdiction. Community Participation: The development of
policies and programs to expand service provision in rural areas will be supported by community participation in
planning, financing, and management of facilities.
During project preparation, TORs have been prepared for environmental audits of installations to be privatized. A
high-level inter-agency coordinating group, led by ERSP and INRENARE, has been formed to oversee the
preparation of enviromnental audits, review and revise as necessary environmental standards and procedures for
oversight of compliance. Studies underpinning the issuance of service, quality, and environmental standards, audits,
and initial support for institutional strengthening will be carried out during the first year of implementation.

Country: Panama                                   Project Title: Utilities Restructuring Technical Assistance Project
anticipated gains in economic welfare and growth. The project's emphasis on the design and execution of appropriate
regulations and policies prior to privatization and support for public institutions which will influence the operating
environment subsequent to the transfer of control to the private sector will be crucial to ensuring the sustainability of the
reforms. Panama's sovereign credit rating (BB+ 12/97) reflects a widely held perception of macroeconomic stability and
sound economic management. Lastly, the ongoing dialogue on further strengthening macroeconomic management and country
creditworthiness should enhance the attractiveness of the Panama and the infrastructure sectors in particular as a destination
for significant private investment.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Water sector legislation mandates that cross-subsidies are to be avoided. This may necessitate tariff increases for certain
customer classes and/or subsidies to be paid out of the general budget. The project will support analysis of demand
characteristics of various customer classes as a basis for dimensioning service standards, performance targets, as well as the
tariff regime.
Feasibility of the proposed mixed stock water company as modality for private sector participation in Panama Metro requires
validation and refinement. Project will support analysis of alternative risk sharing arrangements and investor/market
perceptions prior to finalizing contracuala documentation for bidding.

Annex 2
Panama Utilities Restructuring Technical Assistance Project
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - US$10.12 million
Electricity
As noted in Section 6 of the PAD, in February 1997 legislation reforming the power sector was
enacted. The work program to be financed under this component will support implementation of the
reforms contained in the legislation. The project includes assistance for the three principal elements of
the sector reform program: (a) assistance in the unbundling of IRHE and in the privatization of the
resulting companies; (b) support for the regulatory function, including assistance durmg the post-
privatization period; and, (c) the establishment and strengthening of policy institutions.
IRHE is to be disaggregated into eight companies (four generation companies-three hydro and one
thermal; three distribution companies and one transmission company, initially to be state-owned).
Financial projections to assess the viability of the new companies, elaboration of the grid code
(technical rules that will allow for integrated operation of the new companies), as well as draft
concession and vesting contracts are under preparation and will be ready by the end of 1997. This will
be followed by actual separation and vesting of the companies as commercial enterprises, which will be
completed in early 1998. The privatization advisor will then assist in the sale, beginning with
distribution companies which are to be sold during the last half of 1998. The generation companies
would be sold subsequently, beginning with the thermal generation company and then proceeding with
the three hydroelectric companies.
Most of the regulations and procedures needed by the Ente Regulador are under preparation and will be
completed by the first quarter 1998. These include regulations pertaining to the Electricity Law,
tariffs, wholesale market (rules for the operation of generating companies' facilities and commercial
arrangements), and technical standards applicable to generation, transmission and distribution services.
Additional regulatory work will cover the rights and obligations of consumers, the review of the
concession contracts and guidelines for new IPPs.
Support for the establishment of policy-setting institutions targets the Comisi6n de Politica Energetica
and the Oficina de Electrificaci6n Rural. The Executive Director of the Comisi6n has already been
appointed and agreement reached on terms of reference for consultants to assist in the establishment of
the Comisi6n. The work program for the establishment and initial operation of the Oficina de
Electrificaci6n Rural has also been prepared. Subsequent work will focus on studies that both
institutions must undertake to discharge their responsibilities. For the Comisi6n, these studies include
demand projections for energy, background work for modernizing the policy framework for trade and
marketing of fuels, developing renewable sources of energy and for the importation of natural gas from
Colombia, and energy efficiency and conservation. Studies undertaken with the Oficina de
Electrificaci6n Rural will center on the implementation of a rural electrification program that is demand
driven and private sector led.
Assistance will also be provided after privatization takes place. The Bank will finance the training of
Ente Regulador staff, as well as at least two years of advisory support dealing with regulatory
oversight. Once the new transnission company is corporatized, the IDB will provide partial financing
for the necessary generation and transmission expansion studies.

Project Component 2 - US$24.84 million
Water/Sanitation
As with the electricity sector, in February 1997 the Congress approved legislation that made sweeping
changes in the sector which provided the legal basis and defined key policies for incorporation of
private sector participation in the sector. The project includes assistance to support the four principal
elements of this program: (a) segregation and privatization of IDAAN; (b) development and
strengthening of the regulatory function in ERSP; (c) strengthening of oversight, policy and planning
capacity in MINSA; and, (d) a worker's severance plan.
For the more urbanized areas of Panama, the installations currently under the control of IDAAN are to
be disaggregated into three companies which will be established under commercial statutes. A sector
characterization study is underway to provide technical, financial, and commercial information on the
systems to be transferred to the private sector. This work will define the geographic coverage of the
new companies and will dimension key contractual parameters such as service expansion and quality
targets which will inform the key regulatory studies. It will also provide the basis for the following
enterprise restructuring activities: (i) preparation of audited financial statements; (ii) restructuring
IDAAN into three new water companies (Panama-Metro, Central Provinces and Chiriqui), and
definition of organization and operating statutes; (iii) identification of and measures to allocate and
mitigate risks, as perceived by potential investors and the government, and their incorporation into
contractual documentation; and, (iv) preparation of bidding documentation, concession agreements,
and sale facilitation.
ERSP has been created and properly staffed in recent months. Its regulatory functions will be
strengthened through assistance for the issuance of the reglamento for Law 2/1997 and for the
preparation of specific norms and procedures regarding the tariff regime, technical characteristics of
the systems, rights and obligations of users of WS&S services, and model contracts. In addition to this
support, under a separate contract, Coopers and Lybrand is providing organizational and capacity
building services to the new entity.



The strengthening of the oversight and policy development capacity of MINSA includes: (i) consultant
services for restructuring MINSA's current organization to allow it to better undertake the new roles
assigned in the sector reform legislation (expected to be completed by mid- 1998); (ii) designing and
establishing an information system, including basic laboratory equipment for water quality monitoring
and an information management system, building on the information system being developed under the
characterization study; (iii) consultant services for the characterization of rural water services and the
development of sector policies and programs for assistance to rural communities; (iv) developing
policies for service expansion to low-income populations through adequate and transparent subsidy
instruments; (v) developing the regulatory and policy framework for solid, hazardous and dangerous
vvastes; and (vi) training. The project will also support the strengthening of the planning and policy
making capacity and the development of an enabling environment for private sector participation, by
providing assistance for studies, designs, training and equipment for a watershed management and a
drainage master plan for the Panama Metro region, and for IDAAN's management of selected
investrnents during the transitional period leading up to private provision of services in Panama Metro.
Prior to passage of sectoral legislation, government and labor reached agreement as to the terms and
conditions of labor redeployment. Reductions in staffing levels are to take place before privatization
and severance payments, to be financed from the general budget, are estimated to be on the order of
US$10 million. Details as to terms of severance payments, timing and form are codified in legislation.
The project will fund the following activities under this component (baseline estimates excluding
contingencies, amounts in thousands of US$).

Project Component 3 - US$3.0 million
Telecommunications
The new legal and regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector has been in place for more
than a year. The regulatory entity, established in early 1996, has accomplished a great deal since that
time. It has overseen privatization of INTEL and concessioning of cellular band A services; issued
basic regulations governing the telecommunications sector which provide for competition in most
services (basic telephony being the exception where five year exclusivity was provided); and, granted
concessions for cellular and licenses for a host of other telecommunications services. Over the next
several years, the work of the regulator will grow to encompass not only licensing new providers, but
also managing the radio frequency spectrum, dealing with complex interconnection issues in a multi-
carrier environment, and overseeing compliance of concessionaires, particularly INTEL which will
enjoy substantial market power over the next three years. To build the institutional capacity necessary
to effectively undertake these functions, the project will provide support in two areas: establishment of
a modem system for managing radio spectrum and strengthening the capacity of the regulator to foster
competition and oversee compliance.
As of today ERSP estimates that there are near 12,000 radio-frequencies in use in Panama. The new
regulatory framework requires ERSP to manage the granting of licenses for radio-frequencies, control
its proper use, solve the interferences disputes, and sanction users for illegal use of the radio-
frequencies. The Project will support the establishment of an integrated Radio Spectrum Monitoring
System that would allow the ERSP to monitor the use of the Spectrum in the major urban
concentrations, where the majority of radio emitters are located. Support will also be provided for a
Spectrum Management and Administration System (SMAS), to allow the ERSP to manage the radio
frequency spectrum and to carry out the administrative tasks of the allocation, recording, notification,
cancellation, billing of frequency licenses, and other functions required to comply with Panamanian
law. The feasibility work for the frequency management system was completed last May and detailed
engineering will be completed before the end of 1997.
Training and technical assistance for the ERSP telecommunications group will focus on the exercise of
economic regulation as related to oversight of concession compliance with expansion and quality of
service obligations, auctions, interconnection policy, and resolution of disputes among operators. It will
also encompass training in operation of the Radio Spectrum Monitoring System, maintenance of
stations and the control center, surveillance procedures, and radio interference location and resolution
With the assistance of Coopers and Lybrand, the ERSP is preparing a detailed assessment of
organizational requirements and human resource needs as a basis for elaborating the technical
assistance program.
The project will therefore fund the following activities under this component (baseline estimates
excluding contingencies; amounts in thousands of US$):

Project Component 4 - US$3.65 million
Multi-sectoral
TFhere are several aspects of the restructuring and privatization program common to the electricity and
water sectors, as well as those which are required to ensure effective implementation of the project
itself. These include environmental management, public information and education programs, project
management (including auditing and training), and additional privatization needs.
Environmental management will comprise support for the following activities: (i) undertaking
environmental audits of existing installations to be privatized in the water and electricity sectors; (ii)
ongoing support to the environmental coordinating group, led by the MIPPE with the support of ERSP
and INRENARE, who will ensure that enviromnental concerns are adequately incorporated into the
regulatory, policy making and planning activities of the respective sectoral privatization programs; and,
(ni) review of current arrangements governing the allocation and security of water use rights in
Panama. The environmental coordinating group has begun work on selecting water quality and
emission standards, which will underpin the mitigation plans developed in the course of the
environmental audits. The group will prepare annual work programs beginning January 1, 1998 which
will be the basis for defining yearly technical assistance and training requirements. Terms of reference
have been prepared for the environmental audits to be undertaken during the first half of 1998.
The education and information programs would seek to: (i) better understand the concerns of various
segments of the population with respect to the privatization program, to then be reflected in program
design and execution; (ii) support the efforts of the CLICAC to foster conservation and efficient use of
electricity and water, as well as inform the consumers of their rights and responsibilities; and (iii)
provide information to foster private participation.
Given the nature of privatization programs, it can be expected that unanticipated needs will be
encountered in terms of new issues to address or studies to execute. Experience shows that flexibility
must be a key feature of these programs, and therefore US$1 million has been allocated under th
ccncept of "additional privatization needs".
Finally, with respect to project management, the program will provide funding for the services of a
procurement agent, external auditors and strengthening MIPPE, the principal executing agency.
The project will therefore fund the following activities under this component (baseline estimate
excluding contingencies; amounts in thousands of US$):

Fiscal Impact Calculations
Although not a primary objective of the restructuring and privatization program, substantial positive
fiscal impacts are anticipated with most of the proceeds of privatization being dedicated to public
investment in infrastructure and the social sectors, as established in government policy and legislation.
Privatization Revenues.
The majority of revenues from privatization will come from the share sales in both the
telecommunications and electricity sectors. In 1997, 49% of INTEL shares were purchased by Cable
and Wireless for US$652 million. The 1997 concession to Bell South for Cellular Band A service
yielded US$76 million, and Cable and Wireless paid the same amount for Cellular Band B service.
Numerous smaller concessions have also been granted for telecommunications frequency type B, which
yielded approximately US$1 million last year and are expected to yield a similar amount over the next
two to three years.
In the electricity sector, three distribution companies and five generation companies are expected to sell
at least half their shares for a minimum of US$500 million. This estimate is based on their book value
and sale free of debt. At this stage, there has not been a market-based valuation of the companies,
which would take into account investors' forecasts of potential profits considering the strength of
competition, the state of current assets, the initial commercial and vesting contracts for sale/purchase
of power, and the tariff regime.
In the water sector, IDAAN will be broken up into three companies and transferred to private control
via share sale or concession. The Water Sector Reform Law, Law 2/97, stipulates proceeds from
privatization of water and sewerage services will be used to capitalize the same companies. As such,
proceeds from the water sector privatization will not generate revenues to the treasury.
Use of Privatization Proceeds for Social Investment
An important underlying rationale for the restructuring program is to free up budgetary resources and
redirect public spending toward social programs. This goal has been explicitly spelled out in
government policy and legislation.' By law, privatization receipts are to be deposited in the Fondo
Fiduciario, from which the interest earnings are to be used to finance social and infrastructure
investment. It is expected that over US$1,300 million in privatization proceeds from the telecom and
electricity sectors will have been deposited in the Fondo Fiduciario by the year 2000. The investment
strategy and return on Fondo deposits has to date been conservative (5% to 5.5%). Assuming the same
pattem of return will continue, the US$1,300 million is expected to yield for US$500 million for
investment over the next eight years. Given the country's development needs and priorities set out by
the government, it is assumed that were it not for the resources provided by the Fondo Fiduciario, the
govemment would instead finance the US$500 million in social and infrastructure investment through
sovereign debt on standard terms for US-dollar denominated bonds, and would pay around US$120

septiembre 1997), Gaceta Oficial No. 23,393 de 7 de octubre de 1997 and Law 20/95 which creates the Fondo
Fiduciario para el Desarrollo.



million in interest on this amount over the same period. The imputed cost of interest payments avoided
is based on average terms for government bonds.2
Cost of Severance Payments
Some reduction in work-force will be required as part of the restructuring and privatization program.
Enhanced transitory severance and retirement benefits have been agreed with labor and established in
legislation. The GOP has provided the following estimates of the cost of severance packages: i)
INTEL - US$54 million was paid out of sale proceeds; ii) IRHE - US$58 million to be paid in 50%
stock and 50% cash; iii) IDAAN - US$10 million to be financed out of the general budget. While these
amounts are significant, they represent less than 14% of expected proceeds.
Net Impact of Transfers, Taxes and Dividends
The GOP currently receives transfers from IRHE, as it did from INTEL before privatization. Over the
last three years, transfers from IRHE averaged US$50.5 million per year. During 1994-1996, INTEL
transfers to the central government averaged US$124 million per year. While privatization will
preclude this source of government revenue, it will be offset by corporate taxes to be levied on the
privatized companies and dividend payments to the government from shares remaining under public
ownership. In the case of INTEL alone, tax receipts for the second half of 1997 are estimated at
US$42.5 million, and taxes and dividend payments for 1998 are estimated at US$89 million.
Estimates of future tax receipts and dividends of privatized entities in the electricity sector are
conservatively estimated on the order of US$75 million per annum.
IDAAN is currently dependent on government transfers to cover debt service and a portion of its
operating costs. Over the last three years, these transfers averaged US$3.2 million per year. Water
service concessions are expected to eliminate this drain on the government budget. Under private
service operators, the government will provide subsidies to the poorest segments of the population;
however, the subsidy program is expected to be less costly than prior goverrnent programs. Savings
will result from the efficiency gains from private service delivery and improved design of the program
for service delivery to poor (supported under this project). Presently, 30% of users are classified as
"social sector" customers and charged half the standard water tariff. Given that the urban poverty rate
is 21%/63, it is likely that "social sector" customers include middle and upper income households. More
efficient management will reduce the number of misclassified "social sector" customers. Further
savings will result from adaptation of innovative and cost-effective service delivery models being tested
in the region. The new companies under private operation will also pay corporate and other budgetary
taxes and dividends to the government for publicly held shares.
2 September 1997, the government issued 30 year Global Bonds at 87/8%.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement of consultants would be done according to the provisions of the "Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997) and of goods according to the
provisions of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans" (January 1995, revised in January
and August 1996). For complex time-based assignments and for contracts based on a lump sum price,
such contracts will be based upon the standard form of contract for consultant's services issued by the
Bank, with such modifications thereto as shall have been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant
standard contract documents have been issued by the Bank, other standard forms acceptable to the
Bank shall be used. As noted in the project description, a procurement agent would be hired to
expedite project implementation. These services of this agent would be paid by the Government of
Panama with its own funds.
Table A of this section shows the project costs by procurement arrangements. International
competitive bidding procedures (ICB) shall be used for the purchase of equipment under the project,
with contracts for goods where practicable being group into bid packages of US$250,000 or more.
Goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more, but less than the equivalent of
US$250,000 per contract, may be procured using National Competitive Bidding (NCB), up to an
aggregate amount of US$1,000,000. Goods estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$50,000
per contract may be procured through national or international shopping, up to an aggregate amount of
US$750,000. For consultants, prior review will be needed for the terms of reference only for contracts
below the equivalent of US$100,000 for firms and below US$50,000 for individuals. Contracts over
the equivalent of US$200,000 will be subject to review by the Bank of the Borrower's technical
evaluation of proposals, prior to the opening of the economic proposals. Consultant's services may be
procured, where appropriate, using the following options: Quality and Cost Based (QCBS), Quality
Based (QBS), Selection of Consultants Qualifications (CQ), up to an aggregate amount of the
equivalent of US$1,500,000 and by contracting with individual consultants, up to an aggregate amount
equivalent to US$1,500,000. Requirements of prior review of other contracts for consulting services
are summarized in Table B.
Disbursement
The Government, through UTPP, will request an initial disbursement to be deposited with the
procurement agent to cover expenditures for a period not to exceed six months. The procurement agent
will make payments directly to consultants and suppliers. Expenditures for individual contracts of
goods and services, for which prior review by the Bank is not required, will be disbursed against
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). For expenditures claimed on the basis of Statement of
Expenditures all records evidencing such information must be retained by UTPP until at least one year
after the Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the
Loan Account is made. Full documentation for all contracts requiring Bank's prior review will be
submitted. Applications for withdrawals will be prepared by UTPP and submitted to the Bank.
Subsequent payments to the procurement agent would be based upon regular presentation of
expenditures made by UNDP, as covered by the agreed procurement plan. Disbursements,
representing mainly expenditures under short-term technical assistance, will be made over a period of
four years, the average for technical assistance projects in the Latin American and Caribbean region.



Since the program has already commenced, retroactive financing not to exceed US$600,000 (5% of the
loan amount) would be applied to finance eligible expenditures made after December 1, 1997 but no
more than a year before loan signing.
Since a PPF was approved for this program for a total of US$1,648,000, the amount disbursed at the
moment that the Loan becomes effective will be charged against the Loan and all then outstanding
disbursements will be subsequently made from the Loan. In a few cases, contracts not financed under
the PPF will have to be processed prior to retaining the procurement agent. In these cases, the bidding
process would be conducted directly by the implementing agency and disbursement would be made
directly by the Bank to the contractors, at the request of UTPP.
The allocation of loan proceeds is provided in Table C of this section.

Panama Utilities Restructuring Technical Assistance Project
Environmental Framework
Introduction
The reform program addresses enviromnental impacts from past and ongoing public enterprises, as
well as broad concems for environmental management of private service delivery. Building on the
existing environmental framework, the proposed project will address environmental issues that span all
basic infrastructure sectors. The program will specifically support the following environmental
management activities: (i) the strengthening and restructuring of institutions to meet new policy,
normative and oversight responsibilities; (ii) the review and updating, as necessary, of environmental
norms (in particular, water quality and discharge norms for sewage and contaminating sludge); (iii) the
identification and evaluation of environment conditions of installations to be privatized, as well as plans
to mitigate negative impacts; (iv) the increasing of capacity for coordination in environmental
management.
Institutional Capacity for Environmental Management
Since the mid-1980s, the GOP has built legal and institutional capacity for environmental management.
Long standing provisions include the 1986 establishment of the Instituto Nacional de Recursos
Naturales Renovables (INRENARE) to orient and direct environmental protection and conservation
activities, and the 1983 creation of the Comisi6n Nacional de Medio Ambiente (CONAMA), which
services as a policy making and coordinating body within the Ministry of Planning and Economic
Policy (MIPPE). The recently created regulatory entity, ERSP, and the sectoral agencies also posses
dedicated enviromnental units, which have been operating for the past two to six years. These units
have received training and support from IDB, USAID and GOP.
Sector Planning and Regulatory Authority
Prior to the enactment of reform legislation (1996-97), IRHE and IDAAN functioned as policy makers,
regulators and service providers. Reform legislation transferred these planning and oversight
responsibilities to independent bodies. In the electricity sector, Law 6/97 assigns policy and planning
authority to the Energy Policy Commission, and in the case of the water sector, Law 2/97 vests the
Ministry of Health (MINSA) with these responsibilities. Importantly, the 1997 sector legislation
directs the policy making and plaming bodies to promote sustainable development and restoration of
the natural resource base. The World Bank will finance consulting services to develop MINSA
policies and promotion of water and wastewater services, and to support to the Energy Policy
Commission through studies of renewable resource development and promotion of energy savings and
efficient use.
Regulatory authority has been established distinct from policy setting and service delivery bodies. In
the electricity sector, ERSP is responsible for establishing and verifying sector service quality norms as
well as overseeing compliance with environmental standards. MINSA will set water quality, discharge,
technical and service standards, and as prior to recent legislation, will monitor compliance with water
quality and discharge standards. ERSP, in coordination with MINSA, will oversee compliance with
water quality and service standards. The World Bank will provide support to strengthen the capacity
of ERSP and MINSA and will finance the development of monitoring and information systems for
water and waste water service provision.



Environmental Norms
Existing nonrs governing water and electricity service delivery provide for a minimum of
environmental protection. The Sanitary Code and the Norms Commission set standards for potable
water and sewer discharge, all of which have been officially adopted by MINSA. The Electricity
Sector Law 6/97 provides for transitory norms for ambient air quality, based on WHO guidelines, until
specific environmental protection norms are formalized. A 1993 IDB/UNDP financed study identified
emissions and noise norms for IRHE based on best practices around the world. Since that timne, IRHE
has voluntarily adopted these standards.
The IDB FOMIN project will provide support to the Ente Regulador to formalize these technical norms
for air as well as water quality, and service standards. The IDB PRIBA project will provide support
for the review and formalization of norms for effluent discharge, sludge and service quality. In
addition, IDB PREIDAAN will support the preparation of a Wastewater Drainage Master Plan for the

The 1994 Law 30 requires ELAs on all projects and human activities that effect the natural environment
and vests INRENARE with responsibility for review and compliance. The implementing regulation of
Law 30 provides guidelines and procedures for EIA preparation, review and enforcement. The pending
Environmental Framework Law and its implementing regulations provide the proposed new
environmental authority, Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente (ANA, which would absorb oversight
functions of INRENARE), with the responsibility for oversight of environmental management across
sectors. The IDB is supporting the implementation of the new legislation, including accompanying
regulations and institutional strengthening of INRENARE. Until the new environmental law comes
into effect, sector reform legislation assigns ERSP responsibility for oversight and compliance with
environmental norms.
The World Bank will support the preparation of the environmental audits that will identify and evaluate
the environmental conditions of installations to be transferred to the private sector. The contractual
documentation for share sale/concession of the new electricity and water companies are to reflect the
environmental protection and mitigation requirements as articulated in the environmental and service
norms already in place, in those to be issued by ERSP, and in the environmental audits.
Institutional Coordination
While the above described institutions and legal framework together form the basis for sound
environmental protection, the framework has several weakness, namely the dispersion of
responsibilities and competencies across institutions, lack of inter-institutional coordination, and
increasing charges assigned to incipient entities. In recognition of these weaknesses, MIPPE, with the
support of ERSP and INRENARE, is leading an environmental coordinating group to assure consistent
incorporation of environmental considerations throughout the privatization process. Group participants
include the executing agencies, MINSA, IRHE and CONAMA. Specifically, the group's objectives
are to: i) review existing and develop as necessary environmental norms which will regulate water and
electricity services; ii) identify and assign responsibility for environmental liabilities associated with
service delivery; and iii) improve the institutional capacity to monitor and enforce environmental norms
and compliance and mitigation agreements. Several activities financed by this project, in addition to
other international assistance and GOP support, will facilitate the achievement of these objectives.
Specific activities, institutional responsibilities and support are outlined below.
