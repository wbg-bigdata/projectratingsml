        The discrepancy between the estimated disbursement totals as shown here in Table 5 as compared to the
      financing plan in Table 2 is due to current fluctuation between US$ and SDR for the IDA Grant Number
      H3050 and US$ and EUR for the EU Grant Number TF094016.

                  COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT PROJECT II

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

  A. SUMMARY

1.      The restructuring paper proposes the extension of the IDA Grant Number H3050
from July 30, 2012 until July 31, 2013 and for the European Union (EU) Trust Fund
Number TF094016 from June 30, 2012 to August 31, 2012. The Project is funded by a
third funding source (Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund TF092325), which closes
on July 30, 2012. Activities under this Trust Fund TF092325 have been completed;
therefore, an extension of the closing date of TF092325 is not requested.

2.      The restructuring paper also proposes to revise the Project’s results framework to
include targets for the number of each type of sub-projects to be completed under the
CEPII. Given the community-driven nature of this Project, it was not possible to specify
the allocation of sub-projects at preparation. In addition, it corrects inconsistencies
between the various legal and project documents related to the Project, where applicable.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

3.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve poor rural communities’
access to basic infrastructure and provide economic opportunities for vulnerable
households in urban and rural areas.

4.      Under the CEPII, LACE has completed 101 sub-projects, including schools,
markets, bridges, culverts, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sub-projects and
164 subprojects are currently under implementation. This is in comparison to a target of
265 sub-projects. These infrastructures are spread throughout all 15 counties with a focus
on targeting remote and underserved communities, as determined by their access to and
distance from existing social services. Importantly, there are currently an estimated
4,590 children attending schools constructed under the CEPII. The bridges and culverts
are directly serving 52 communities, as well as their environs, with improved ease and
reduced cost of transportation. Additionally, 29 communities now have access to
improved water sources and hygiene facilities, reducing the use and pollution of open
water sources. There is a serious reputational risk associated with the failure to complete
the ongoing sub-projects to deliver similar increased access to basic social services in the
remote and vulnerable communities identified as Project beneficiaries.

5.      In addition to the impact of increasing access to social services in remote areas,
the CEPII also emphasizes building local-level capacity to empower beneficiary
communities as drivers of their own development processes. While LACE oversees the
construction activities, it is the communities who select and are responsible for these sub-
projects. LACE assists community-elected Project Management Committees (PMC) to
develop technical and managerial capabilities in all aspects of the sub-project selection,
construction, and maintenance, as well as on conflict resolution and reconciliation.

                                             1
Communities learn by doing, receiving training and guidance from LACE staff
throughout the Project. Fifty percent of PMC members have been women, in keeping
with the Project’s indicators. To date, approximately 2,650 community members have
received training from LACE, with equal gender representation among trainees, and 370
county and district officials have also participated in these training activities. This is in
line with the Project’s targets of 2,650 community members and 360 local government
officials.

6.      To provide economic opportunities for vulnerable households in urban and rural
areas, LACE has successfully achieved its target of providing 17,000 Liberians with
temporary employment through public works. In line with Project targets, this resulted in
the creation of 680,000 person days of labor. An impact evaluation of these activities
estimates that 80 percent of participants were either poor or extremely poor and that there
was an average reduction in the poverty gap of beneficiaries of 27 percent, exceeding the
targeted 20 percent. Moreover, 46 percent of people engaged in these activities were
women, exceeding the target of 30 percent.

7.      The impact of the Project’s implementing partner, the Liberia Agency for
Community Empowerment (LACE), in achieving this objective was recently confirmed
by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). An IEG evaluation report on Liberia noted
that “the Bank’s engagement with community-driven service delivery through LACE has
been very relevant in supporting the Government’s primary goal of delivering results.?

  C. PROPOSED CHANGES

8.      Results/indicators: The Project’s results framework, attached as Annex 1, has
been amended here to include targets for the number of each type of sub-projects to be
completed under the CEPII. Given the community-driven nature of this Project, it was
not possible to specify the allocation of sub-projects at preparation. In addition, it
corrects inconsistencies between the results frameworks included in different legal and
project documents related to the Project, specifically: the Project Paper for a Second
Community Empowerment Project dated May 30, 2007; the Financing Agreement For
IDA Grant Number H3050 dated June 15, 2007; the Emergency Project Paper for an
Additional Financing Grant to the Community Empowerment Project II dated May 22,
2008; an Amendment for Additional Financing (TF092325) to the Financing Agreement
dated June 21, 2008; and an Amendment for Additional Financing (TF094016) to the
Financing Agreement dated April 24, 2009. The revised results framework is attached as
Annex 1 and includes detailed footnotes explaining all specific changes proposed under
the restructuring

9.     Closing date: The closing date for the IDA Grant Number H3050 will be
extended from July 30, 2012 until July 31, 2013. The closing date for the EU Trust Fund
Number TF094016 for the Project will be extended from June 30, 2012 to August 31,
2012. The closing date for both sources of financing was originally June 30, 2011. The
IDA Grant Number H3050 was extended until July 31, 2012 with the Amendment to the
Financing Agreement for the Project’s Co-financing under the Emergency Food Price

                                             2
Crisis Response Program dated June 21, 2008. The first extension of the EU Trust Fund
Number TF094016 was signed on June 20, 2011 and extended the closing date until June
30, 2012.

10.     The proposed extensions are necessary to help achieve the completion of the full
target of 265 community-driven social infrastructure sub-projects under the CEPII, of
which 164 remain under various stages of construction. Annex 2 provides a detailed
narrative regarding these requests for extension, including the issues that have led to this
backlog of ongoing sub-projects and proposed actions for their successful completion
within the requested extension periods. Annex 3 includes a work plan outlining a
specific completion timeline for all 164 ongoing sub-projects.

             Unless otherwise noted, all indicators are taken from the Emergency Project Paper for the Additional
           Financing Grant to the Community Empowerment Project II, as approved May 22, 2008. The EPP
           indicators are used because they provide greater than the Amendment to the CEPII Financing Agreement
           dated June 21, 2008 that corresponds to this EPP. The subsequent Amendments to the CEPII Financing
           Agreement (dated April 24, 2009, June 20, 2011, and May 7, 2012) did not amend the Project’s indicators.

             All end target dates have been revised to June 30, 2013 in line with the requested Project closing date
           extension.

             ‘Improved’ is intended as schools that (i) function during the rainy season, (ii) have access to water and
           sanitation facilities, and (iii) are furnished.
           5
             This target is new and was not included in any previous Project documents given that the demand-driven
           nature of the Project prevented the allocation of different types of sub-projects a priori.

            CEPII PAD, although 50 people have been added to the total target number to reflect the additional
            financing of EUR285,000 provided in June 2011 to the Client on behalf of the European Union. This
            corresponded with the targeting of five additional communities under CEPII.

                        Community Empowerment Project II
                            Extension of Closing Date

_______________________________________________________________________

1.     The closing date for the IDA Grant Number H3050 for the Second Community
Empowerment Project (P105683) will be extended from July 30, 2012 until July 31,
2013. The closing date for the EU Trust Fund Number TF094016 for the Project will be
extended from June 30, 2012 to August 31, 2012.

2.      The proposed extensions are necessary to help achieve the completion of the full
target of 265 community-driven social infrastructure sub-projects under the CEPII. At
present, 101 of these sub-projects have been completed, including 27 financed by IDA
H3050 and 74 financed by an EU trust fund for the CEPII (TF094016). An additional
164 sub-projects are in various stages of construction (53 IDA and 111 EU). The
Administration Agreement between the World Bank and EU governing the CEPII Trust
Fund closes December 31, 2012 and, as such, activities through this funding cannot be
undertaken beyond August 31, 2012. The proposed IDA extension would allow the
Government to focus foremost now on the completion of the EU-financed sub-projects
and then allow for an additional year for the completion of the IDA-financed activities.

3.      The most recent ISR rated progress toward the achievement of the PDO as
Moderately Satisfactory and the implementation progress as Moderately Unsatisfactory
because of the delay in the implementation of the subprojects. The proposed extension is
necessary to allow additional time to complete the construction of the ongoing sub-
projects and thereby help the Project achieve its PDO in a satisfactory manner. The
implementation delays that lead to the necessity of this extension are threefold. First,
although the Project was approved by the Board in June 2007 and the IDA Grant Number
H3050 became effective in August 2007, the EU Trust Fund TF094016 did become
effective until August 2009. This was largely the result of delays in signing the
Administration Agreement for the parent Trust Fund (TF071042), which was not
finalized until December 2008. These delays stemmed from extensive negotiations
between the Bank and the EU about the terms of TF071042 and audit and reporting
requirements under both TF071042 and TF094016. In addition, prior to finalizing
TF071042, the EU requested revision of the Project’s community subproject cycle to
strengthen LACE’s interaction with local government authorities (LGA) through
sensitization and training by LACE of LGA, increased coordination between the Project
and LGA, and building linkages between communities and their LGA. Second, the
Project’s mid-term review (MTR) raised weaknesses in LACE’s procurement capacity,
which required the development of all new procurement templates. Moreover, the timing
of the MTR coincided with the effectiveness of the TF094016; therefore, it was necessary
that all such revisions be finalized before the majority of activities financed by the EU
Trust Fund TF094016 could begin. Third, with Liberia being a post-conflict and fragile
state, weak capacity of local contractors has led to delays in the completion of
subprojects within the agreed time frames.

                                           6
4.       Despite these challenges, LACE has made significant progress in the Project’s
implementation in the current fiscal year. In FY12, LACE finalized the procurement of
all outstanding small works contracts for the community driven social infrastructure sub-
projects. In the second half of FY12, LACE has committed itself, through a monitoring
action plan, to intense supervision of these ongoing works, with specific attention to the
quality of construction and contractor compliance with the contract work schedules. To
date, 32 of the small works contracts finalized in FY12 are complete and an additional 30
are at least 50 percent complete. An action plan for the continuation of these supervision
activities and the successful achievement of the CEPII PDO is attached as Annex 3. In
addition, LACE will continue to use its monitoring action plan that assigns its staff to
rotational, weekly field visits within each region of the country. The Project task team
intends to upgrade the rating for implementation performance once LACE has completed
50 percent of the target number of sub-projects and is continuing to make steady progress
toward the completion of the balance 50 percent.

5.      The Government of Liberia has, therefore, requested an extension of the IDA
Grant Number H3050 closing date from July 30, 2012 to July 31, 2013. This extension
will increase the likelihood of the Project’s satisfactory achievement of its development
objectives and help prevent the reputational risk associated with the partial completion of
the ongoing sub-projects. The Project’s original closing date was June 30, 2011. It was
extended until July 31, 2012 with the Amendment to the Financing Agreement for the
Project’s Co-financing under the Emergency Food Price Crisis Response Program dated
June 21, 2008.

6.      The Government of Liberia also has requested an extension of the EU Trust Fund
Number TF094016 closing date from June 30, 2012 to August 31, 2012. The original
closing date of the TF094016 was also June 30, 2011. The first extension of this co-
financing was signed on June 20, 2011 and extended the closing date until June 30, 2012.
An additional two months for completion of the 111 ongoing EU-financed sub-projects is
significant in the Project context, particularly when noting the relatively short duration of
these contracts. The Administration Agreement between the World Bank and EU closes
December 31, 2012 and cannot be extended. On an exceptional basis, the World Bank
has approved to condense the standard six month trust fund closing window by two
months to allow for the Project’s extension until August 31, 2012. The Government is
aware and in agreement that this two month extension will reduce from four to two
months its grace period for the submission of financial documentation.
