                         conditions of poor rural communities in Liberia. The CEP II has planned to implement a total of 265 subprojects (80 subprojects to be financed by IDA grant and 185 subprojects by
                         EU co-financing). To date, 99 have been completed or are under construction, 84 are in various stages of procurement, and 82 are currently being identified by LACE in collaboration
                         with the Local Government Authorities and the community members. In addition, under the capacity building component of the CEP II project, 1,740 (970 EU Co-financing and 770
                         IDA Grant) community members have received training on the project management, social mobilization, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, as well as on conflict resolution and
                         reconciliation. Fifty percent of the training participants have been women.
