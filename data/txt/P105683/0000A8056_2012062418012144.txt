                         To improve communities' access to basic infrastructures and provide economic opportunities for vulnerable households in urban and rural areas, through: (a) a
                         community driven approach; (b) a labor-intensive public works program; and (c) the provision of capacity-building at the community and local government levels.

                         The CEPII is funded by an IDA Grant and EU Trust Fund with closing dates of July 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012, respectively. In the current fiscal year, LACE made significant
                         progress toward the target of 265 community-driven social infrastructure sub-projects. 101 sub-projects are now completed and the progress toward achievement of the project
                         development objective is Moderately Satisfactory. However, the implementation progress is Moderately Unsatisfactory to reflect the possibility that LACE will be unable to complete
                         the 164 outstanding sub-projects within the remaining Project period (53 IDA; 111 EU). The delays that have lead to this backlog of activities are due to: (1) a 2-year gap between

                         Project approval and the EU Trust Fund's effectiveness, stemming from delays in finalizing the Administration Agreement between the EU and the Bank; (2) procurement challenges
                         that arose during the CEPII MTR, the timing of which coincided with the effectiveness of the EU Trust Fund; and (3) weak capacity of local contractors to complete construction of
                         sub-projects within the agreed time frame.

                         An implementation support mission is scheduled for June 18th to 22nd. This will be the seventh support mission in the current fiscal year.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government has requested an extension of the IDA Grant H3050 closing date from July 30, 2012 to July 31, 2013, and an extension of EU co-financing TF094016 closing date
                         from June 30, 2012 to August 31, 2012. The team has prepared a Restructuring to extend the closing dates of the CEPII IDA Grant and EU Trust Fund and submitted it for
                         Management approval. The EU co-financing can only be extended by two months because its parent trust fund closes December 31, 2012 and cannot be further extended. Trust
                         Funds Accounting has approved to condense the standard six-month trust fund closing window by two months to allow for the Project’s extension until August 31, 2012. An additional
                         two months for completion of the 111 ongoing EU-financed sub-projects is significant in the Project context, particularly when noting the relatively short duration of these contracts.
