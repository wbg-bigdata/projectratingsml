                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         To improve communities' access to basic infrastructures and provide economic opportunities for vulnerable households in urban and rural areas, through: (a) a
                         community driven approach; (b) a labor-intensive public works program; and (c) the provision of capacity-building at the community and local government levels.

                         up mission was held from January 15 to 26, 2012. The CEPII is funded by an IDA Grant and EU Trust Fund with closing dates of July 31, 2012 and June 30, 201, respectively.
                         There remains a significant back-log of activities -- particularly financed by the EU Trust Fund -- to be completed within this limited time frame. The IDA Grant is fully disbursed and,
                         to date, 69 of a target 80 sub-projects have been completed. The EU Trust Fund, however, is less than 50% disbursed and only 11 of a target 185 sub-projects have been
                         completed. The delays in the latter are due (1) to a 2-year gap between Project approval and the Trust Fund's effectiveness, stemming from delays in finalizing the Administration

                         Agreement between the EU and the Bank (2) to procurement challenges that arose during the CEPII MTR, the timing of which coincided with the effectiveness of the EU Trust Fund
                         and(3) a very weak capacity of local contractors to complete construction of subprojects within the agreed time frame.
                         LACE has, by and large, overcome its procurement challenges; however, it now faces the challenge of completing these activities with the limited time frame remaining. While
                         capacity building efforts must continue, an international procurement specialist was hired in late 2011 and by December 31, 2011 LACE had completed the procurement processes of
                         all 185 sub-projects that will be financed by the EU Trust Fund. However, this progress has come late in the implementation of the Project and may not be enough to allow LACE to
                         complete the implementation of all the 185 sub-projects planned and utilize fully the EU Trust Fund co-financing of the CEPII. The Administration Agreement between the EU and the
                         Bank closes December 31, 2012 and cannot be further extended.

                         Per the Government's request, the Task Team approved the reposting of IDA Grant funding disbursed since August 2009 (the EU Trust Fund effectiveness date) to the EU Trust
                         Fund to the Trust Fund to allow for the extension of the IDA Grant for one additional year. While project implementation started in 2007 as planned with the IDA resources, the EU
                         Co-financing Agreements were delayed and this funding did not being disbursing until two years later. The reposting will reallocate 42 completed sub-projects originally financed by
                         IDA to the EU, increasing the total to 53 of the 185 target. This will also result in USD 2.15 million in undisbursed funds under the IDA Grant. Extending the closing date of the IDA
