PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF A TENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the Pakistan Railways (PR),
with objectives of upgrading the railway system and improving PR's opera-
tional performance and financial position, thus ensuring that PR can play
its economic role in the Pakistan transport system. The proposed loan/credit
of US$60 million equivalent would be the seventh Bank Group lending operation
affecting PR and its predecessor, the former Pakistan Western Railways (PWR).
The first was made in 1952, jointly to the Eastern and Western Railways;
the last loan (Loan 621-PAK, US$14.5 million) was made in 1969 exclusively
to the then PWR. Total lending to PWR has amounted to about US$122 million
equivalent.
ii.       Since the last loan was made, PR has been slow in achieving physi-
cal goals and improvements in operational efficiency and in certain finan-
cial and accounting matters. Since 1973/74, the financial position has been
deteriorating. PR's operating ratios have been significantly higher than
the goals specified in Loan 621-PAK; traffic growth, especially for freight
which makes some contribution to net operating revenues (as against passenger
traffic which does not cover its costs) has been slow. Apart from the conse-
quences of the conflict with India and of the creation of Bangladesh, PR has
had to contend with exceptional operational problems arising from floods
and a shortage of resources to maintain the system to a proper standard.
However, to improve operational performance, PR introduced in November 1975
battery operation of mail and express passenger trains to enable freight
trains to run more smoothly without interference from passenger trains. There
are now signs of significant operational improvements. To improve PR's finan-
cial position, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has authorized PR to increase
freight rates three times since 1974, although passenger fares have been
increased but once in 1974, with minor adjustments in 1976.  Still further
measures are required to make PR an efficient and financially viable railway.
iii.      In the past decade, the development of the transport sector has
been dominated by the increasing role of road transport.  This has been
fostered by generally unregulated rates and liberal licensing policies
towards the industry, together with PR's problems in providing adequate
service and capacity. However, intermodal cost comparisons indicate that
rail transport, if efficiently operated, is the most economic means of
transporting bulk commodities from the Karachi area to upcountry and for
their internal distribution over medium and long distances. PR has also
been carrying substantial passenger traffic. With good traffic densities on
the main Karachi-Rawalpindi line and better operating performance, costs can
be kept low. It is in Pakistan's economic interest to improve PR's overall
performance and the Bank should support such efforts.



- ii -
iv.       The proposed project consists primarily of a two-year slice (1977/78
and 1978/79) of PR's US$391 million equivalent Investment Plan for 1976/77-
1980/81. The project is estimated to cost US$247 million equivalent includ-
ing contingencies, with a foreign exchange component of US$109 million equi-
valent. The main items of project consist of track rehabilitation (21%);
manufacture of passenger coaches, conversion of freight cars from four-wheeler
to bogie wagons, re-engining of overaged diesel locomotives and acquisition
of marshalling yard equipment (20%); provision of telecommunications and related
signalling scheme (15%); bridge works and other civil engineering works (7%);
provision of yards (5%); improvement of facilities for repair of motive power
and rolling stock (4%).
v.        The proposed loan/credit would finance mainly imported goods:  track
materials, materials and equipment for rail welding, telecommunications and
related signalling equipment, marshalling yard equipment, materials and
components for manufacture of rolling stock, plant and machinery for repair
facilities, and procurement of diesel locomotive spare parts. The proposed
loan/credit would also finance needed technical assistance and staff train-
ing. Except for spare parts for diesel locomotives, goods to be financed
under the loan/credit will be procured by PR through international competitive
bidding. The diesel locomotive spare parts will be purchased from established
spare parts suppliers. However, certain critical spare parts may be purchased
in consultation with the Bank/IDA on the basis of quotations from original
locomotive manufacturers. The remaining foreign exchange requirement for the
project, amounting to US$49 million equivalent, is being secured by GOP. A
substantial portion of local costs would have to be met by GOP, since PR does
not have sufficient internally generated funds with which to finance investment.
vi.       The management of PR recognizes the need for improvement in the
planning of operations. In order to help PR's management, consultants,
financed under the Third Karachi Port Project (Credit 422-PAK, 1973), are
being retained by PR to improve the Karachi area railway operations. For pre-
paration and implementation of the telecommunications and related signaling
scheme, PR will have detailed engineering prepared by consultants financed
under Loan 621-PAK and will also obtain assistance from PTT, which owns and
maintains PR's present communications network. Provision has been made in
the proposed loan/credit for staff training and some additional technical
assistance for the scheme. Also, adequate provision is made in the loan/
credit for staff training in such important areas as locomotive maintenance,
freight train operations and accounting modernization.
vii.      The proposed Plan is designed to eliminate various physical bottle-
necks, chiefly on the main Karachi-Rawalpindi line and to provide PR with
adequate plant, equipment and materials to operate its system efficiently.
Analysis of PR's operational performance reveals that there is much scope
for improvement in the passenger-train operations in order to release motive
power and train paths for additional freight-train runs. As an initial step
to this end, PR reduced the average number of passenger trains per day on the
main Karachi-Rawalpindi line from 90 to 74 as of November 15, 1976. PR's
freight services are also in need of improvement as regards both transit time



- iii -
and terminal operations, and transport planning of major bulk commodities.
In addition, PR's financial position should be improved. The question of
how best PR can improve its operational performance and financial position
was discussed with GOP and PR during negotiations and specific targets and
measures have been agreed upon.
viii.     The Investment Plan and the project are justified from technical,
economic and financial points of view. The economic rate of return from
implementation of the Plan would be about 24% and PR's financial position
would improve to the extent that PR would be able to generate funds to cover
all operating expenditures and debt service requirements from 1977/78, and
progressively thereafter but not later than 1981/82 a surplus equivalent to
the prescribed dividend on capital-at-charge.
ix        The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$35 million equivalent and an IDA credit of US$25 million equivalent to GOP.
The proceeds of the proposed loan/credit should be passed on the PR as bene-
ficiary at 8.5% interest rate for a term of 20 years, including a 4-1/2 year
grace period. However, that portion of the loan/credit used for investment
in capital additions will be added to PR's capital-at-charge and will not be
subject to amortization.






PAKISTANI
APPRAISAL OF A TENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
I. INITRODUCTION
1.01      The government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (GOP) and
Pakistan Railways (PR) have requested a loan/credit of US$60 million equiv-
alent from the Bank/IDA to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of
PR's US$391 million Investment Plan for 1976/77 - 1980/81. The proposed
Project consists primarily of a two year slice (1977/78 and 1978/79) of the
Plan and is estimated to cost US$247 million equivalent, of which US$109 mil-
lion would be foreign exchange expenditure. The Plan and the Project are
designed to continue the upgrading and modernization of PR's track, rolling
stock and other equipment, and to contribute to the improvement of opera-
tions and the railway's financial position, thus insuring that PR will play
its appropriate role in the Pakistan transport system.
1.02      The first loan to PR (former Pakistan Western Railway (PWR)) was
made in 1952. Since then five other loans and credits have been made and this
is the seventh operation. Up to 1959/60, three loans were made with the main
objective of rehabilitating railway facilities and equipment. The implementa-
tion of the projects under these loans was satisfactory. Operational effi-
ciency was good; PR's financial position appeared sound; and passenger miles
increased by 5% and freight ton miles by 6% per annum during 1955/56-1959/60.
The inadequacy of PR's accounting system was recognized and consultants were
engaged to help in modernizing the accounting system. During the next five
years from 1960/61 to 1964/65, PR was still catching up with increasing traffic
demand and a loan and a credit were made with substantially the same objectives
as before. During this period, a significant change in the administrative
arrangement took place in that the control of the Railways was transferred from
the Central Government to the Province of West Pakistan. This change in part
affected the Railways' performance, particularly in planning. Operational per-
formance also deteriorated. Although improvement in PR's accounting system
was still an objective, the recommendations of the previous studies had not
been implemented and new consultants were appointed to assist in the establish-
ment of a commercial accounting system.
1.03      Two other loans (Loan 496-PAK and Loan 621-PAK) have been made in
the last decade. Over this period, there was a significant decline in PR's
overall performance. The separation of Bangladesh and hostilities with India
in 1971 and the severe flood damage in 1973 all contributed to the deteriora-
tion. Although consultants were engaged under Loan 621-PAK to assist in carry-
ing out operational improvements, progress was slow; and PR continued to give
operational priority to passenger over freight services and the execution of
important works designed to increase the line capacity was delayed. Freight
traffic did not increase and PR's financial position deteriorated, despite
the fact that the section between Khanewal and Lahore was electrified and 65
new diesel locomotives were procured in 1970/71. hIowever, in 1974 at the
Bank's suggestion, PR engaged consultants to assist in implementing measures



-2-
earlier recommended by them to improve PR's overall efficiency. Since then
there has been a number of significant improvements. New passenger and
freight timetables were introduced in November 1975 in order to group
passenger trains in batteries which enable through-freight trains to run
smoothly, without interruption by passenger trains. Performance targets
have been better delineated and the traffic level reached its highest, an
estimated 5.7 billion ton-miles and 8 billion passenger miles in 1975/76.
In retrospect, it would have helped if at the time Loan 621-PAK was committed,
the operational targets had been more clearly specified. With the past ex-
perience in mind, PR's Investment Plan for 1976/77-1980/81 has been prepared.
The proposed project has been designed to assist PR to continue to improve
its operations and finances during the course of its execution, and specific
measures and targets to this end have been agreed upon with GOP and PR.
1.04      Other Bank Group assistance for transportation in Pakistan has
consisted of three operations for highways, four for ports and five for gas
pipelines. One highway loan was cancelled in 1971 because bids received were
greatly in excess of original estimates. The two completed port projects
encountered delays in execution and the ongoing port projects are also behind
schedule. The other loans/credits have been completed satisfactorily.
1.05      This report was prepared from information supplied by GOP and PR
and from the findings of the June 1976 appraisal mission, composed of Messrs.
Y. Abe (Economist), N. Holcer (Telecommunications Engineer), A. Sabeti (Rail-
way Specialist) and F. Tachibana (Railway Engineer). The mission was assisted
by Mr. W. Thompson (Railway Operation Expert, Consultant).
II. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      Pakistan covers a land area of about 310,000 square miles, one and
a half times that of France. It consists mainly of a flat plain stretching
from the foothills of the Himalayas in the northwest to the Arabian Sea in
the southwest. The main inhabited areas are at Karachi and in the center and
north of the country. It is crossed by five great rivers, the Indus, Jhelum,
Chenab, Rabi and Sutlej, which, after their confluence, flow as the Indus
southwestwards to the sea. These rivers frequently overflow their banks
causing serious interruptions to transport.
2.02      Pakistan's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1975/76 at current fac-
tor cost is estimated at about US$12 billion with a per capita GDP of about
US$170. The average annual growth rate of GDP in real terms has been about
4.3% during the past five years. The major sector in the economy is agri-
culture generating about 34% of GDP. Other important sectors are manufac-
turing (15%), commerce (14%) and transportation including communications (7%).
The balance-of-payments situation indicates persistent annual deficits of
about US$740 million in the trade accounts during the past four years. The
population of Pakistan is currently about 71 million, having grown at about
3% per year over the past five years.



-3-
B.   The Transport Sector
2.03      The geographic and economic characteristics which have influenced
the development of the transport system and the traffic pattern are:
(a) the shape of Pakistan's territory which runs north
and south over 1,000 miles;
(b) the port of Karachi which is located at the south
end of the country and handles a large quantity of
imports; and
(c) the location of agricultural, industrial, and pop-
ulation centers in Punjab and Sind Provinces.
The resultant main traffic flows are between the thickly populated area in
the northeast, with Lahore as the center, and the port and industrial area
of Karachi, some 700 miles away; west to the industrial and agricultural
areas around Lyallpur, Sargodha and Khushab; and northwest to the admini-
strative centers in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, and to Peshawar and the Afghan
border. The transport services are operated by the Pakistan Railways (PR),
four provincially owned bus companies, private operators for goods and
passengers, and air transport. Pakistan's transport network is shown in
Map IBRD 12245R.
2.04      The growth of traffic in each mode and basic data on the transport
sector are shown in Tables 1-3. PR has been handling substantial quantities
of bulk commodities and considerable passenger traffic, although its share of
the total traffic has been decreasing. Road transport has captured most of
the increase in traffic. Between 1960/61 and 1974/75, estimated total passen-
ger miles by road and rail increased from 12.7 to 38.7 billion and 93% of the
increase was accounted for by road transport. During the same period, total
freight ton-miles by road and rail increased from 5.7 to 12.0 billion ton
miles and 84% of the increase was accounted for by road transport. There was
a considerable increase in port traffic, from 5.0 to 10.0 million tons during
the same period, due mainly to increases in imports of bulk commodities such
as wheat and oil. Railway operations and traffic are discussed in detail in
chapter III.
2.05      Despite the fact that a large part of the highway funds was allocated
to development of communications in the less developed areas and the construc-
tion of a road along the west bank of the Indus river for a north-south link,
the length of road network is limited for Pakistan's size. Most of the roads
are narrow, poorly drained and either roughly surfaced with gravel or unsur-
faced. The relatively small number of vehicles in the country reflects the
import restrictions on imported vehicles and the limited capacity of the
domestic vehicle assembly plant. In spite of these problems, the road trans-
port industry has developed rapidly and its efficiency is maintained by com-
petition permitted by unregulated rates and liberal licensing policies.



-4-
2.06      After the promulgation of the Pakistan Maritime Shipping Act of
1974, the Government took over the management of various shipping companies.
Pakistan has been aiming at obtaining a greater share of its foreign trade,
only about 9% of which is currently carried by Pakistan vessels.
2.07      Air transport has been increasing rapidly.  The semi-public Paki-
stan International Airlines (PIA) provides domestic and international flights.
Passenger traffic, both international and domestic, more than doubled in the
past four years and reached 2 million passengers and 1.6 billion passenger
miles in 1975/76 Pakistan is also served by other international airlines.
Both Karachi and Islamabad airports handle international services. Freight
traffic is minor.
2.08      Karachi is Pakistan's only major port and handles all its foreign
trade. Because of a decline in cargo throughout productivity in recent years,
a substantial increase in ship waiting time has been incurred. KPT is now
being reorganized and, in order to meet future traffic demand, additional
capacity is being provided in the port. Also work has recently begun on the
construction of a new port at Qasim, some 20 miles east of Karachi. The new
port plan includes a rail link from the Pipri marshalling yard being financed
under Loan 621-PAK.
C.   Transport Policy and Investment
2.09      Transport capacity has generally kept up with demand and there have
been no critical bottlenecks so far except for seasonal problems at the
Karachi Port (KPT) and on PR's network. This is because of the existence of
some spare capacity in the past and the flexibility and efficiency of the
road transport operators. Also, there has been timely investment in KPT,
assisted by the Bank operations noted above. On the other hand, significant
misallocation of resources in the transport sector in the past may have
resulted from diversion of rail freight traffic to road transport, which
could have been carried more cheaply by a well operated rail system. Remedial
action will involve investments for replacement and some additional capacity.
The Government should also increase its efforts to improve operational effici-
ency in the sector, particularly in the case of PR, the financial position of
PR and the publicly owned bus companies.
2.10      The Planning Commission has indicated that GOP's priorities in the
transport sector during the coming five years would be to:
(a) support PR more than before in view of increases in
fuel prices;
(b) expand the network of farm-to-market roads;
(c) open up backward areas;
(d) expand domestic vehicle assembly plants;



(e) construct the second port at Qasim; and
(f) expand the share of Pakistan flag carriers to
30% of total international cargo by 1980/81.
To achieve these, the investment envisaged in the transport sector during the
Fifth Five-Year Period (1976/77 - 1980/81) would amount to about Rs 26.0
billion. Mlore emphasis is given to PR than in 1970 - 1975, but roads and
road transport will continue to receive the largest share of the investment
(see Table 3).
2.11      The Government through various transport related agencies has the
predominant role in the transport sector. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) and
PR are responsible for railways; the Ministry of Communications (MOC), for
ports, shipping and national highways. The rest of roads and road transport
are under the jurisdiction of either of four Provincial Governments or of
numerous District Councils and other local bodies. The Planning Commission
discharges a coordinating function through its preparation and approval of
major investment decisions. The private sector is dominant in the trucking
and bus industries which are practically uncontrolled except for maximum
passenger fares. The latter are invariably higher than railway fares for
comparable journeys.
2.12      To provide a basis for developing rational transport planning and
coordination, a transport coordination study was financed under the Third
Highway Project (Loan 578-PAK). In accordance with the recommendations of
the Study, GOP established a National Transport Research Center (NTRC) within
the Planning Commission in 1973/74. NTRC was charged with updating the work
done by the transport coordination study, with helping improve operational
efficiency of the various transport modes and fostering the economic alloca-
tion of traffic. The Bank has been supporting NTRC in training of staff
through setting up of a curriculum and sending instructors to NTRC. The work
program of NTRC is ambitious and technical assistance from UNDP and the UK
Government is being sought for designing and supervising its work program.
III. PAKISTAN RAILWAYS
A.   Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      The PR network is owned and managed by the Government of Pakistan
(GOP). Its operations are controlled and directed by a Board of four members,
located at Lahore, headed by a Chairman reporting to the Ministry of Railways
(MOR). One Board member, the Finance Member, has discretionary power to
report directly to the Ministry of Finance on financial matters. The Board
performs the dual functions of a secretariat to MOR and of an executive body
responsible for railway operations. This arrangement was formalized when MOR
was established in September 1974. In financial matters, GOP exercises
control through the National Asssembly. The organization of PR is shown in
the chart (16306).



-6-
3.02      The Railway Board exercises its power through six zonal Divisions
which are responsible for day to day field operations. The members of the
Board and other senior officers of PR for decades consisted of senior rail-
way men with a deep attachment to tradition and showing reluctance to adapt
themselves to changing circumstances. This situation led to extensive employ-
ment of consultants at the instance of the Bank to study many aspects of
railway operations and investment needs. Consultants are also being retained
by PR to improve the Karachi area railway operations and are to be retained for
the telecommunications and related signalling scheme to be financed under the
proposed loan/credit. PR's own staff is now devoting much more attention to
planning for improved operations.
3.03      PR, with about 137,300 employees, is the largest public sector em-
ployer in Pakistan. Only the Indian Railways has a higher number of employees
per track mile in the world than PR. The staff strength has remained stable
in the past five years (staff data by category as of May 1976 is shown in
Table 4). However, since PR's traffic growth has been slow, and since staff
productivity has increased very little, less than full benefits have been
obtained from modernization measures such as dieselization. There is need for
reductions in staff strength through attrition and improvement in efficiency.
During negotiations, it was agreed that PR would reduce its staff at minimum
by about 500 per annum in 1977/78 and 1978/79 and by about 1,200 per annum in
1979/80 and 1980/81. PR also agreed to undertake by December 1977 a study of
the possibility of further staff reductions through attrition.
3.04      PR's wage and salary structure are the same as for Government em-
ployees, and they are covered by a grade system which is reviewed and adjusted
by the Federal Wage Commission. In addition, from time to time the Federal
Government grants special national wage increases. Fringe benefits, grading
of jobs and crafts, work rules and craft lines are negotiated between PR's
two labor unions and the Board. Recently, skilled and semi-skilled staff at
all levels have been attracted to more highly paid work in the Middle East.
3.05      The training of PR staff is carried out at either PR's training
schools or Government training institutes. Staff training, carried out by
the Personnel Department, has generally been satisfactory. However, many
long-service officers are expected to retire from PR in the near future. The
problem this will cause will be partly eased by staff training included in
the proposed loan/credit in such important areas as locomotive maintenance,
freight train operations and accounting modernization.
B.   Railway Property
3.06      The present position with regard to railway property is described
in Annex 1. Details of route-miles are given in Table 5. There remains over-
age track structure on the Karachi-Lahore main line and PR is imposing speed
restrictions on trains at many locations. In order to increase the speed of
trains, the track must be improved. Track maintenance procedures have been
examined by PR with assistance from Consultants, SOFRERAIL (France), financed
under Loan 621-PAK and a new procedure has been introduced on a trial basis.



- 7 -
There have been some shortages in ballast and sleepers. PR plans to increase
the supply of ballast and concrete sleepers, but will still have to import
some wooden sleepers for some time. There are still some bridges with speed
restrictions on broad gauge lines and these have to be renewed or strengthened;
a new Kotri bridge providing a second track needed to remove a bottleneck
on the main Karachi-Lahore line is expected to be completed by April 1978.
Modernization of telecommunications facilities and signaling is also required
and this is now planned. Marshalling yard facilities, particularly in the
Karachi area, need to be augmented; a new marshalling yard at Pipri, designed
to remove congestion in the Karachi area, is being constructed with partial
financing under Loan 621-PAK and in addition, a study to improve PR's opera-
tional performance in the Karachi area is being undertaken by the Consultants,
SOFRERAIL (France) financed under the Third Karachi Port Project (Credit
422-PAK, 1973).
3.07      PR's motive power and rolling stock position by gauge at the end
of 1975/76, including the 68 diesel locomotives delivered in late 1975, is
given in Table 5. The electric locomotive fleet was introduced in 1970/71
PR still has a considerable number of steam locomotives, of which about 84%
are over 40 years old. However, before any decision is taken on the extent
to which the latter should be replaced by diesels, it is desirable to await
the expected operational improvements from the proposed project. About 32% of
coaching vehicles are over 30 years old and in poor condition; their partial
replacement is now planned. About 12% of four-wheeler wagons and about 7% of
bogie wagons are over 45 years old. Since PR has more than sufficient wagons,
not all will be replaced when scrapped.
3.08      PR's facilities and procedures for maintenance and repair of loco-
motives and rolling stock need to be improved. Because of a shortage of spare
parts, shorter life of reclaimed parts and frequent breakdown of one particular
type of locomotive, the availability of diesel electric locomotives was down
to 83% in 1975/76. Provision for spare parts is included in the proposed
loan/credit. At the same time PR is to improve the quality of reclaimed parts
and it is planned to eliminate troublesome equipment from some locomotives
even at the sacrifice of some power. PR will also have to improve freight
wagon maintenance, particularly to control the problem of hot boxes which
have become more frequent since the introduction of the new freight train
timetable which has enabled freight trains to run continuously.
3.09      PR manufactures most of its passenger vehicle and freight wagons.
Because of shortages of imported materials and components, the output from
two manufacturing units has been far below their capacity in recent years.
C.        Traffic and Operations
(i)   Freight Traffic
3.10      PR's freight traffic over the 1968/69 - 1974/75 period is summarized
in Table 7. Because of deterioration in PR's service and development in the
road transport industry, traffic declined gradually from 1968/69 to 1970/71,



-8-
reaching 12.3 million tons and 4.6 billion ton-miles in 1970/71. Since then
freight traffic in ton-miles has grown by 2.9% per annum, with tonnage increas-
ing more slowly; in 1974/75, freight traffic reached 13.2 million tons and
5.1 billion ton-miles. The average haul increased from 327 miles in 1968/69
to 391 miles in 1974/75 due mainly to PR's efforts to concentrate on long-
haul services during the past several years. Traffic density is highest on
the Karachi-Lahore main line which carries bulk commodities up-country from
the Port area. Movement on this line is unbalanced, with the ratio of ton-
nage between up- and down -directions as high as 3.5 (up):l (down).
3.11      The composition of freight traffic shown below for 1974/75 has been
quite constant over the years:
Tonnage           Ton-Miles
million
'000 tons       %      ton-miles       %
Wheat                           1,402       10.6      811.1       15.8
Rice                              860        6.5      438.1        8.5
Other Agricultural Products       769        5.8      188.8        3.7
Sub-total                     3,031       22.9   1,438.0        28.0
POL                             1,455       11.0      987.9       19.2
Other Minerals                    922        7.0      497.3        9.7
Sub-total                     2,377       18.0   1,485.2        28.9
Cement                          1,351       10.2      219.6        4.3
Fertilizer                        700        5.3      276.4        5.4
Other Industrial Products         107        0.8       58.9        1.1
Sub-total                     2,158       16.3      554.9       10.8
Others                          5,657       42.8   1,660.4        32.3
Total                        13,223      100.0   5,138.5       100.0
3.12      Table 8 shows PR's freight traffic forecasts from 1975/76 through
1980/81, which take into account expected increases in the production and
distribution of wheat, fertilizer, cement, and POL and increases in railway
capacity arising from the implementation of the proposed Plan. The average
traffic growth rate is expected to be about 7.3% per annum in tons and 6%
per annum in ton-miles and to reach 20 million tons and 7.3 billion ton-
miles in 1980/81. These forecasts were discussed with MOR and PR and
seem realistic since they are based largely on imminent increases in pro-
duction in other sectors, much of it in the public domain. Annex 2 gives a
detailed analysis of traffic forecasts for major commodities.
(ii) Passenger Traffic
3.13      Table 9 shows PR's passenger statistics from 1968/69 through 1974/75.
After a decline to about 125 million passengers and 5.9 billion passenger
miles during 1970-72, traffic increased to 143 million passengers and 7.7
billion passenger miles in 1974/75. Passenger traffic of the past five years
has had the following characteristics:



- 9 -
(a)  the average distance travelled per passenger has been
increasing from 46 miles in 1970/71 to 54 miles in
1974/75; and
(b)  the third class passengers have constituted about 95%
of the total passengers and about 88% of passenger-miles.
About 80% of third class passengers travel less than 50 miles including
about 30 million passengers making 10 mile trips on commuter services in
the Karachi and Lahore areas. Busy stations are those in the Karachi area,
Lahore, Layallpur, Landhi, and Rawalpindi, all in heavily populated centers.
3.14      Table 10 shows PR's passenger traffic forecast for 1975/76
through 1980/81, which allows for expected increases in travel demand
induced by economic growth and expected development of highway transport.
The average traffic growth rate is expected to be about 2.2% per annum
in passengers and 2.7% per annum in passenger-miles resulting in 178 mil-
lion passengers and 7.6 billion passenger-miles in 1980/81. These fore-
casts were discussed with MOR and PR, and appear realistic.
(iii)   Operating Performance
3.15      PR's operating performance for the period 1971/72  - 1975/76 is
shown in Table 11. Deterioration has been taking place over a longer period,
as shown below:
1958/59    1974/75
Diesel locomotive-miles per day
per available locomotive (miles)                     233         200
Hours worked per day
per available diesel locomotive (hours)               17          15
Wagon-miles per day
per available wagon (miles)                           48          38
Wagon turnaround (days)                                  7          15
To reverse the worsening trends, the previous loan (Loan 621-PAK) required
that consultants should be retained to make recommendations for improved
operations on the main Karachi-Lahore line. The consultants' (SOFRERAIL,
France) study, completed in 1971, recommended many specific measures for
improving operations with little or no investment. Major recommendations
made by the consultants are listed in Annex 3. PR was slow in taking actions,
but in 1974 the same consultants were appointed to assist PR with implementa-
tion of their recommendations. In November 1975, PR took a major step in
introducing battery operations of mail and express passenger trains to enable
freight trains to run more smoothly without interference of passenger trains.



- 10 -
Since then, there have been signs of operational improvements. Diesel freight
train locomotive-miles per day per locomotive increased from 110 miles to 150
miles; wagon turnaround days improved to 15 days in December-April 1975/76 as
against 17 days in July-November 1975/76; and the 68 newly delivered diesel
locomotives helped raising the average haul to 610 net-tons per train, or a
12% increase over the previous year.
3.16      On the other hand, however, there have been the following three
adverse effects:
(a) The number of passenger trains increased, partly because
of additional local trains needed to connect with battery
trains;
(b) Some increase in wagon hot-boxes was observed after the
introduction of new timetables in November 1975; and
(c) Availability of diesel electric locomotives deteriorated
because of greater use without appropriate changes in
maintenance.
3.17      Analysis of PR's operational performance reveals that there is much
scope for improvement in the passenger-train operations. This will be cru-
cial to the release of much-needed train paths and motive power for additional
freight-train runs which will enable PR to handle the expected growth in
freight traffic. To achieve this objective, some lightly patronized trains
will be eliminated on the main Karachi-Rawalpindi line. At the same time,
more passenger coaches need to be added to existing popular trains in place
of parcel and brake vans and/or by limiting the use of air conditioned coaches
and dining cars. As an initial step to this end, PR reduced the number of
passenger trains on the main Karachi-Rawalpindi line from 90 to 74 as of
November 15, 1976.
3.18      PR's freight services are also in need of improvement, as regards
both transit time and terminal operations, and transport of major bulk com-
modities. The through-freight train speed should be increased from 35 mph
to 45 mph in order to achieve improved line-capacity utilization. This will
require improving basic wagon maintenance procedures. PR will also have to
introduce more unit and block trains for the movement of wheat, rice, cement,
fertilizer (raw material and finished products) and POL. PR is currently
discussing with various agencies and provincial Governments ways of implement-
ing specific measures to improve bulk-commodity transport, with a view to
limiting destinations and loading points and ensuring adequate loading and
unloading facilities.
3.19      During negotiations, agreement was reached on specific measures
to rationalize further passenger-train operations, to increase the speed of
freight trains and to increase unit and block trains for movement of bulk
commodities. Specific measures are described in Annex 4.



- 11 -
3.20      The recent 83% availability of diesel locomotives is unsatisfactory,
and should be improved upon by providing more adequate repair facilities and
giving increased attention to the provision for stores and spares. The pro-
posed project allows for this and the proposed loan/credit includes provision
for procurement of spare parts for diesel locomotives and staff training for
improved maintenance practices.
3.21      With the above measures, and the timely execution of the investments
proposed in Chapter IV, there will be a marked improvement in PR's operations.
During negotiations, an action timetable for attaining the targets set forth
in Annex 4 has been discussed and agreed with GOP and PR.
IV. THE PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Plan
4.01      The basic objectives of PR's Investment Plan for 1976/77-1980/81 are:
(a) to improve PR's operational performance on the main line,
given the presently available and some additional plant
and equipment; and
(b) to provide capacity for expected traffic during 1976/77
through 1980/81.
The execution of the Plan and the Project as described below will eliminate
various physical bottlenecks and provide the basis for the implementation of
improvement in operational performance.
4.02      The Plan has been based on assumed passenger and freight traffic for
1980/81 of 9.1 billion passenger-miles and 7.3 billion net ton-miles, respec-
tively, and envisages capital expenditure of Rs 3,840 million (US$391 million
equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of Rs 1,504 million (US$153
million equivalent). The cost estimate has been based on December 1975 prices,
including 5% contingencies, in accordance with GOP practice. The Project
cost estimates discussed below have, however, been prepared in accordance with
Bank guidelines.
4.03      The Plan consists of investments for new line construction, track
rehabilitation, bridge works and civil engineering works, marshalling yards
including completion of a new marshalling yard at Pipri, line capacity works
and terminal facilities including completion of the second railway bridge
between Kotri and Hyderabad, telecommunications and related signaling, motive
power and rolling stock, plant and machinery and facilities for workshops,
sheds, and depots, and change-over to airbrakes and central couplers. Table
12 summarizes the Plan and Annex 5 details the Plan description by item.



- 12 -
4.04      The Plan has excluded work on construction of three new lines and
one gauge conversion, costing about US$50 million equivalent, because they
seem uneconomic. However, PR has recently been directed to commence work on
some of the new lines. While these additional works being financed by GOP
would continue, GOP assured the Bank/IDA during negotiations that the execu-
tion of these works should not, in any manner, affect the satisfactory imple-
mentation of the Plan and Project and that GOP would not expect any return
to be paid by PR on GOP's investment on the construction until they become
profitable. It was agreed during negotiations that substantial changes in
the Plan involving more than Rs 35 million or US$3.5 million equivalent p.a.
would be made only after prior agreement with the Bank/IDA.
B.   The Project and the Proposed Loan/Credit
4.05      The Project, for the most part, consists of a two-year slice (1977/78
and 1978/79) of PR's Five-Year Investment Plan described above. In addition,
the Project provides for a telecommunications and related signaling scheme up
to its completion in 1980/81 (because of the indivisible nature of the scheme),
for technical assistance and staff training, and for imported spare parts for
diesel locomotives. The Project is designed to complete important ongoing
works and to undertake some new works which are required to meet projected
increases in demand for freight and passenger services and to improve opera-
tional performance and reduce operating costs. The project is estimated to
cost Rs 2,432 million (US$247 million equivalent) with foreign exchange content
of US$109 million equivalent. The estimated expenditures are summarized in
the following table:

4.06      The main elements of the Project are the complete track renewal
of 185 miles; rail renewal, using released rails, of 70 miles; sleeper
renewal of 200 miles; bridge works and civil engineering works; completion
of the new Pipri marshalling yard; line capacity works including the com-
pletion of the second railway bridge at Kotri and terminal facilities; put-
ting into operation the telecommunications and related signaling system;
acquisition of marshalling yard equipment; re-engining of 20 overage diesel
locomotives; manufacture of 220 second/third class passenger coaches and
conversion into 800 bogie wagons of 1,600 overage four-wheeler wagons; acqui-
sition of plant and machinery together with improved facilities for work-
shops, sheds, and depots; procurement of imported spare parts for diesel
locomotive; and technical assistance and staff training. Table 13 details
the Project and Annex 6 describes principal items included in the project.
4.07      Of the foreign exchange content of US$109 million, US$60 million
would be covered by the proposed loan/credit. Items to be financed under
the proposed loan/credit were selected on the basis of (i) suitability for
procurement by means of international competitive bidding procedures and
(ii) relative priority of works to be undertaken. The items are shown in
Table 14.
4.08      The Project cost is based on December 1975 prices adjusted for
physical and price contingencies. Physical contingencies have been allowed
at about 10% on local and foreign costs where quantities and work to be done
cannot be clearly defined. Price contingencies have been allowed on local
and foreign costs at 9% for 1976, 8% per annum each for 1977, 1978, and 1979.
Telecommunications expenditure for 1979/80 and 1980/81 has been assumed to be
spent in 1978/79, since it is likely that almost all of the equipment will be
indented for in that year. A detailed engineering study for the telecommuni-
cations and related signaling scheme is being financed under Loan 621-PAK.
When this is completed in September 1977, precise cost estimates will be
available. 2Ieanwhile, provision of Rs 372 million with a foreign exchange
content of US$16 million equivalent has been made in the project.
4.09      Contingencies, physical and price, on all items taken together
represent about 20% of Project costs. The foreign exchange cost is the total
estimated cost of PR's foreign procurement. The local cost includes customs
duties and sales tax for PR's foreign procurement. Detailed cost estimates
for the proposed loan/credit are given in Annex 7.
4.10      The provision in the proposed project for imported spare parts for
diesel locomotives of US$5 million equivalent corresponds to one year's
normal consumption. GOP so far has released foreign exchange for spare parts
procurement twice a year, but this tends to be irregular, impairing the timely
ordering of spare parts. The Bank's participation is based on agreement
reached with GOP to secure all of the remaining foreign exchange required for
normal use of parts for three years (1977/78-1979/80). During negotiations,
GOP agreed to provide US$10 million in foreign exchange over the three years
to PR, necessary for the procurement of diesel locomotive spare parts, in
addition to US$5 million to be financed by the proposed loan/credit.

C.   Financing of the Project
4.11      The financing of the Project is being arranged by GOP.  Regarding
foreign exchange funds, besides the proposed loan/credit of US$60 million
equivalent and likely commitments to be made by France for equipment for the
Pipri marshalling yard (US$1.0 million equivalent) and by Germany for rails
(US$3.9 million), GOP is currently negotiating grants and loans from the
Kuwait Fund, Canada and UK. The bulk of foreign exchange funds is expected
to be provided by the Kuwait Fund. Most of the local costs will be provided
by GOP.
4.12      The proposed Bank Group financing would be provided to the GOP in
the form of a loan of US$35.0 million equivalent and a credit of US$25.0 mil-
lion equivalent. The proceeds of the loan/credit will be passed on to PR at
8.5% interest rate repayable over 20 years including a 4-1/2 year grace period.
However, that portion of the loan/credit used for investment in capital addi-
tions (as distinct from investment on replacements) will be added to PR's
capital-at-charge and will not be subject to amortization. This arrangement
is standard practice for development funds provided to PR. (para 6.02).
D.   Execution of the Project, Procurement and Disbursement
4.13      PR has the necessary facilities and is competent to carry out the
Project. However, timely completion of works on Pipri marshalling yard and
Kotri bridge and proper execution of complete track renewal are critical for
implementation of PR's operational improvement measures. Therefore, during
negotiations, it was confirmed that:
(a) PR would complete and put into operation Kotri bridge by
April 1978, and Pipri marshalling yard by December
1978; and
(b) PR would undertake complete track renewal in accordance with
the schedule specified in Annex 4.
In carrying out the telecommunications and related signaling scheme, because
of the new technology involved, PR will have to collaborate with Pakistan
Telegraph and Telephone (PTT), which presently owns and maintains PR's com-
munications network, in the installation of some of new facilities and the
provision of technical assistance for their maintenance. Also, PR should
upgrade its telecommunications and signaling sections through staffing of
adequately trained personnel. For this purpose, PR will require further for-
eign technical assistance and training abroad for staff concerned, provision
for which is made under the proposed loan/credit. During negotiations agree-
ment has been reached with GOP and PR on the timely and efficient execution
of all aspects of this sub-Project. A time-phased schedule of project
implementation is shown in Annex 8.



- 16 -
4.14      Items to be financed under the loan/credit will be procured by
PR through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
Guidelines, except for spare parts for diesel locomotives. The spare parts
will be purchased from established spare parts suppliers. However, certain
critical spare parts may be purchased on the basis of quotations obtained
from original locomotive manufacturers in consultation with the Bank/IDA.
4.15      Disbursements from the proposed loan/credit would cover 100% of
the foreign exchange cost of:
(a) track materials, components, and equipment for
track renewal on 128 miles of track on the Karachi-
Lahore main line;
(b) marshalling yard equipment in the Karachi area;
(c) materials and components for manufacturing 220
second/third class passenger coaches;
(d) materials and components for converting 1600
four-wheelers into 800 bogie wagons;
(e) plant and machinery for workshops and running sheds;
(f) spare parts for diesel locomotives;
(g) equipment for telecommunications and related signaling;
and
(h) staff training.
Disbursements for technical assistance would cover 100% of foreign cost or
70% of local cost, the latter to be applied in case of employment of local
consultants. The estimated quarterly rate of disbursements is given in Table
15 and is based on the assumption that the proposed credit/loan would become
effective by May 1, 1977. Disbursements from the Loan would commence only
after all funds from the Credit have been fully committed or disbursed. It is
expected that virtually all disbursements will be completed by June 30, 1981;
but in order to allow time for retention payments, etc., particularly for the
telecommunications and related signaling equipment, the Closing Date will be
June 30, 1982.
4.16      During negotiations reporting requirements including periodical pro-
gress reports on PR's traffic, operations, finances and physical execution of
the Project have been discussed and agreement reached.

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   The Economic Role of PR
5.01      As discussed in Chapter II, the development of the transport sector
in the past decade has been dominated by the increased role of road transport.
This was due partly to PR's failure to improve its operational performance and
to provide needed transport capacity. Reports of SOFRERAIL (France) financed
by Loan 621-PAK and Transport Coordination Study (individual consultants) in
1970-1972 financed by Loan 578-PAK agree that PR makes a valuable contribution
to the national economy and has the potential for continuing to do so. It is
in Pakistan's economic interests to realize the benefits of the considerable
investments already made in the railway. If the Investment Plan is not carried
out and operational performance is not improved, PR's operating costs will
rise and a large tonnage of bulk commodities and some passengers would be
diverted to road transport at higher ultimate cost to the economy.
B.   Economic Evaluation
5.02      PR's Investment Plan has been examined to ascertain whether:
(a) the Plan is the most economic as compared to other
conceivable investment programs for PR; and
(b) the Plan yields sufficient economic returns.
The exercise on the first question started in late 1974 when the Bank re-
ceived an application for a loan for further support to the railways. Review
of documents indicated that traffic forecasts were unrealistically high and
that the proposed Investment Plan did not incorporate necessary operational
improvements associated with the execution of the Plan. The resulting dia-
logue among the Planning Commission, MOR, PR and the Bank led to substantial
reduction of traffic forecasts and the investment level. Freight and pas-
senger forecasts were reduced from 8.7 billion ton-miles and 9.9 billion
passenger-miles (in 1979/80), to 7.3 billion tons miles and 9.1 billion
passenger-miles (in 1980/81) respectively, and the size of the Investment Plan
from Rs 5.5 billion (1973 prices) to Rs 3.8 billion (December 1975 prices).
The review of major items indicated that original provision for motive power
and some rolling stock was excessive and so was that for new line construction.
They have been reduced substantially. The amount allocated to telecommunica-
tions and signaling systems was also reduced through changing from the original
scheme based on underground coaxial cables to a microwave system. The Plan as
now proposed, taken as a whole, responds well to the needs of PR and Pakistan
economy.
5.03      The second question requires an economic assessment of the Plan.
The various works included in the Plan are interrelated for efficient train
operation, quality of service and safety. Benefits attributable to many items
would not fully materialize unless some of the other items of work are also



- 18 -
Carried out. Expected improvements in PR's operations are taken into consid-
eration in the economic evaluation. Improvement in passenger train operations
would result in the release of much needed train paths and motive power for
additional freight-train runs which would enable PR to handle the expected
growth in freight traffic. Together with improvements in freight train opera-
tions, these would generate economic benefits in the form of savings in PR's
operating costs and avoidance of diversion of traffic to road transport. The
estimated economic return of the Plan as a whole is about 24%. Not included
in these quantifiable benefits are savings in passenger and freight time,
savings resulting from reduced inventories because of greater reliability,
and improved quality of service. The aforementioned 24% economic rate of re-
turn was based on 6% p.a. freight traffic growth, but even assuming a 3% an-
nual freight traffic growth, the rate of return would be about 16%, since the
greater part of the plan consists of replacements.
5.04      Assumptions used in economic analysis and economic return calcula-
tions are shown in Annex 9. Should the economic cost of the Plan be higher
than estimated by 15%, the economic rate of return would be about 20%. The
most important variables are railways' operating costs. Should operational
performance not improve as discussed in paras 3.17-3.21 above and if operating
costs increased at 4% per annum instead of 3% assumed in the table to Annex
9, the economic return would be about 18%; if PR's operating costs increased
by 5% per annum, the return would be further reduced to 13%. This indicates
the importance of achieving the planned operational improvements (Annex 4).
If the measures necessary to do this are implemented in a timely manner,
the Plan as a whole will have been fully justified.
VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Accounts, Budget and Audit
6.01      The Railways' accounts are those of a Government department and,
as now constituted, show the origin and use of public funds. The capital
and operating budgets are submitted annually to the National Assembly for
approval.
6.02      The terms under which development funds are made available to PR
are summarized below:
(a) Additional Capital Investment
(i) Local currency funds are provided by the
Government and added to PR capital-at-charge.
(ii) Government obtains foreign loans which are
added to PR capital-at-charge as and when
repayments of the loans are made by the
Government. Prior to repayment of these



- 19 -
loans, PR reimburses the Government annually
for the full cost of interest charges on the
loans. PR is not required to repay these loans.
(iii) Dividends on capital-at-charge are payable to the
Government at 4% p.a. on capital provided up to
June 30, 1965 at 5% p.a. on capital provided from
July 1965 to June 1969 and on capital provided
thereafter at 6.25% p.a.
(b) Capital Expenditure on Replacements
Funds required for expenditure on replacements
are funded by PR from annual appropriations of
its revenues to Depreciation Reserve Fund (DRF).
These appropriations are also used to cover the
local currency equivalent of the cost of servicing
foreign loans for replacements.
6.03      Under the previous project (Loan 621-PAK), attempts were made to
obtain needed improvements in PR's accounting methods and modernization of
accounting procedures. To this end, work was continued to complete account-
ing studies which had begun as far back as 1965 by consultants, tMessrs. Booz,
Allen and Hamilton, International, partly financed by USAID. Subsequently,
a committee was set up to review the consultants' work and make recommenda-
tions for implementation. The recommendations made by the committee for
accounting method changes were, in principle, accepted by GCP and PR. Im-
plementation of the recommendations was delayed because of ?R's transfer
from the former province of West Pakistan to the Central Government which
delayed the introduction of the new procedures in PR's accounts and subse-
quent incorporation into GOP's accounting and budgetary system. However, PR
has been trying to implement recommendations for modernization of its account-
ing procedures, such as payroll, stores, and stations accounting. Progress
has been slow since sufficient and reliable communications and computer time
were not available. In regard to accounting methods, the areas needing most
improvement are fixed asset accounts and treatment of depreciation, including
the operation of DRF. PR has already begun work on revaluation of depreciable
assets and it was confirmed during negotiations that PR would complete this
work by July 1977. Depreciation charges based on revalued assets will be
budgeted from FY1978/79 and proper fixed asset accounting will be implemented.
The matter was discussed with PR and agreement was reached during negotiations.
Also, work will have to continue on the modernization of PR's accounting pro-
cedures. Provision for staff training is made in the proposed loan/credit.
The installation of Railways' new telecommunications network will greatly im-
prove availability of real time and accurate data much needed for the success
of the accounting modernization program.
6.04      PR's accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General
of Pakistan through Director of Railway Audit. Because of PR's transfer
from the former Province of West Pakistan to the Central Government, the



- 20 -
audit of accounts for the years 1971/72 and 1972/73 were only completed late
in 1976; and 1973/74, 1974/75 and 1975/76 audited accounts are in arrears
and are expected to be completed shortly. It was agreed that PR would fur-
nish the Bank the audited accounts for 1977/78 and 1978/79 no later than
twelve months after the end of each fiscal year and the audited accounts for
later years no later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year.
B.   Past Performance
6.05      PR's revenue and expenditures accounts for the years 1971/72-
1975/76 are shown in Table 16 and are summarized below:
1971/72  1972/73  1973/74  1974/75  1975/76
------Actual----  ------Provisional--------
(Rs million)
Operating Revenues                    835.0    943.4   1019.5   1337.8    1619.4
Working Expenses                      602.4    654.9    873.5   1219.1    1329.2
Net Cash Operating Revenue            232.6    288.5    146.0    118.9       290.2

Net Operating Revenues                138.4    175.3      23.7    (41.8)    104.3
Interest on Loans                      45.2     68.2      64.3      76.7      99.6

Appropriation to Improvement Fund    14.9        17.3      -         -
Net Surplus (Deficit)                 (10.8)    (4.9)   (40.6)  (118.6)    (20.4)
Operating Ratio (%)               83       81        98      103         94
6.06      For many years, until 1972/73, PR's operating expenses remained
fairly stable. Since then, as an aftermath of the energy crisis and world-
wide inflationary spiral, there have been marked increases in fuel, labor
and material costs. In 1974/75 labor costs increased by about 37% diesel
fuel costs by about 42%, and material costs by 78% over 1973/74. Continued
inflation has further aggravated PR's financial situation. It may be noted,
however, that PR's working expenses include about Rs 200 million per annum for
taxes and custom duties on fuel, spare parts and materials.
6.07      In response to the substantial increase in costs, there have been
increases in freight rates, starting in 1974, as reflected by average
receipts per ton-mile--increasing from Paisa 10.2 in 1971/72 to Paisa 19.3
in 1975/76. However, general passenger fares were increased only once, by
20%, although there have been subsequent increases in first class fares, par-
cel and baggage rates, which comprise a very small portion of total passenger
revenues, the net result of such increases has been nominal. The increases
in passenger fares, second and third class, have been most inadequate when
considering that about 60-65% of PR's total working expenses are attributed
to passenger services, while passenger revenues comprise only about 30% of
total operating revenues.



- 21 -
6.08      The wide gap between passenger revenues and passenger expenses, and
stagnant freight traffic due to the floods of 1973/74 have resulted in net
revenues achieved in 1973/74-1975/76 being so low that the Government had to
waive the dividend due on capital-at-charge, which amounted to an estimated
Rs 312 million. The operating ratios declined from 81% in 1972/73 to 103%
in 1974/75 and 94% (provisional) in 1975/76. Therefore, since 1973/74, PR
has been unable to keep the operating ratios within the limit of 80% specified
in Loan 621-PAK. Furthermore, the appropriation to DRF has been kept at 12%
of gross operating revenues, an interim measure agreed to under Loan 621-PAK,
thereby understating the financial deterioration described above. The deter-
ioration in PR's financial situation has already had adverse effects such as
a tendency to reduce maintenance and some necessary investments have been
deferred.
C.   Rates and fares
6.09      Tariff structure and past increases in freight rates and passenger
fares are detailed in Annex 10. The current tariff structure is based on
costing studies done with the help of a Colombo Plan Specialist in 1970-72.
The freight rates are designed to encourage maximum use of wagon capacity.
Therefore, the unit rates for "smalls" traffic are about 50% higher than for
regular wagon loads traffic. The range of rates for selected commodities at
a representative distance of 500 miles is shown below:
Per Ton-Mile
(Paisa)
Wheat                            15.5
Coal and Coke                    16.0
Rice and Paddy                   17.5
Salt                             22.0
Cement                           22.1
Fertilizer                       22.2
Diesel/Furnace Oil               29.2
Gasoline                         41.2
Passenger fares are very low; the average receipt per first-class passenger
mile is Paisa 49.3 (US cents 5.0); but for third class, the average receipt
per passenger mile is Paisa 5.4 (US cents 0.55). The average revenue for
suburban traffic is much lower still at Paisa 1.5 (US cents 0.15).
6.10      The cost increases, changes in traffic flow and changes in method
of operations have made the present tariff structure and rate levels obsolete.
PR has established a Costing Cell to carry out costing and tariff studies
for restructuring rates and fares for adopting appropriate user charges. It
was agreed during negotiations that:
(i) PR would complete a costing and tariff study by
December 31, 1977;



- 22 -
(ii)  PR would commence by June 30, 1978 and complete by
December 31, 1978 implementation of a tariff struc-
ture on the basis of (i) above; and
(iii)  PR's new fares and rates would cover, as a minimum,
the relevant variable cost of each service by 1979/80.
D.     Future Prospects
6.11      During the negotiations, the financial position of PR was discussed
and agreement reached that as financial objectives PR should generate reve-
nues from its operations to cover operating expenses (including depreciation
charges based on revalued assets), debt service requirements, and progressively
but no later than 1981/82, cover the prescribed dividend on capital-at-charge.
Since the deterioration of PR's finances in recent years has been mainly as a
result of low passenger fares as compared to costs of passenger services, as a
first step GOP and PR have agreed to increase passenger fares by at least 20%
with an effective date no later than July 1, 1977.
6.12      Based on the June 1976 tariffs including 20% increase in second and
third class fares as of July 1, 1977, the traffic forecasts discussed in Chapter
3 and the proposed Investment Plan, a forecast of operating revenues and ex-
penses was prepared for the years 1976/77-1980/81. The forecast is shown in
Table 16, and a summary is presented below:
1975/76   1976/77 1977/78 1978/79 1979/80 1980/81

The forecast is based on assumptions detailed in Annex 11.
6.13      The operating expenses include provisions for cost increases resulting
from increases in wages, prices of fuel and material, and increase in usage of
fuel and material related to expected additional traffic; some effects of cost-
reduction measures are incorporated. Appropriation to DRF is kept at 12% of
gross operating revenues for the years 1976/77 and 1977/78.  Beginning with



- 23 -
1977/78 the appropriation to DRF is based on the estimated and revalued wasting
assets in each year. Based on the above assumptions, PR will be able to cover
operating expenses and debt service obligations; but it will have to borrow
from the Government for local currency portion of the investments on replace-
ments until 1979/80. Thereafter, the railways will no longer require local
currency loans for replacement expenditures and begin to progressively cover
the dividend on capital-at-charge and full dividend coverage will be reached
by 1981/82. Any further unforeseen increases in costs, therefore, would
have to be offset by additional tariff adjustments and/or further cost-reduc-
tion measures.
E.   Financing of the Plan
6.14      A cash flow and financing plan is given in Table 17 and summarized
below. Except for a 5% contingency included in the Investment Plan as
required by GOP budgeting guidelines, other price and physical contingencies
are excluded from calculations:

The cash generated from the operations during the Plan period is estimated to
be Rs 2,555 million. Out of this PR will require to meet debt services of
Rs 1,374 million and expenditure for improvements Rs 160 million. The
balance of Rs 1,021 million may then be regarded as available for financing



- 25 -
investment on replacements and payment of dividend on capital-at-charge.
The replacement costs during the Plan period amount to Rs 2,343 million, out
of which the local currency component is Rs 1,276 million. Thus, assuming
that no dividend payments (Rs 413 million) are made during the 1976/77-
1978/79 period, PR will require local cash development loans totaling
Rs 366 million to meet the expenditures on replacements.
6.15      Based on available information, the summary balance sheets have
been reconstructed in Table 18. However, PR's inadequate accounting system,
as explained in para. 6.03, does not provide the data required for the
assessment of a rate of return on the net fixed assets in use at either
replacement cost or historical cost. This situation will continue until
revaluation of fixed assets has been completed.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During the negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal matters:
(i)  A timetable for rationalization (consolidation) of
passenger train (para 3.17);
(ii)  A timetable for improving freight train operations
(para 3.18);
(iii)  A timetable for improving operating efficiency in
accordance with targets set forth in Annex 4
(para 3.21);
(iv)  PR's Investment Plan and limiting changes to it,
without prior agreement with Bank/IDA, to Rs 35 mil-
lion p.a. (para 4.05);
(v)  Completion of Kotri Bridge by April 1978 and Pipri
Marshalling Yard by December 1978 (para 4.16);
(vi)  A cost/tariff study and appropriate changes in PR's
tariff structure and level (para 6.10); and
(vii)  Financial targets for PR and passenger fare increase
(para 6.11).
7.02      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$35 million equivalent and an IDA credit of US$25 million equivalent to GOP.
The proceeds of the proposed loan/credit should be passed on to PR as bene-
ficiary at 8.5% interest rate for a term of 20 years, including a 4-1/2 year
grace period. However, that portion of the loan/credit used for investment
in capital additions will be added to PR's capital-at-charge and will not
be subject to amortization.

APPRAISAL OF A TENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Description of Railway Property
1.        Track:  PR operates about 5,500 route-miles of which about 4,800
route-miles, or about 90% of its total network, are of broad gauge (BG).
Diesel and electric traction hauls 87% of total gross ton-miles with the
remaining 13% being hauled by steam traction. About 180 route-miles, or
only about 4% of the BG system, are electrified, and the short distance
does not allow high utilization of electric locomotives. About 640 route-
miles, or about 13% of BG system, are double-tracked and form a principal
portion of the main line Karachi-Lahore (about 760 miles), which carries
66% of the total freight ton-miles of PR. Details of route-miles are given
in Table 5. The total running track length of the Karachi-Lahore main line
is about 1,300 miles on which complete track renewal has recently being
carried out at an annual rate of 30 miles. At this renewal rate, the life
cycle of track on this main line will come to 43 years, instead of a normal
average life cycle of 35 years. As a result, PR still imposes speed restric-
tions on trains at 47 locations on this line because of overage track struc-
ture; the total length of the speed restrictions on this line is 140 miles
or 11%. Another problem has been the shortage of ballast supply. Yearly
ballast requirements are of the order of 15 million cft, while ballast pro-
curement in recent years was only 5 million cft, indicating ballast short-
age. While production capacity of ballast in the railway quarries is suf-
ficient, there has been shortage of locomotives required for work trains
transporting ballast to the site. Track maintanence procedures have been
reexamined by PR with assistance of the Consultants, SOFRERAIL (France),
financed under Loan 621-PAK, and a new procedure has been introduced on a
trial basis.
2.        PR has its own factories for manufacturing concrete sleepers and
a treatment plant for wooden sleepers. As about 70% of yearly wooden sleeper
consumption has to be imported, PR has planned to increase the number of con-
crete sleeper manufacturing factories, to reduce foreign exchange require-
ments substantially.
3.        Bridges:  There are still some bridges on BG lines with speed
restrictions because of weaknesses largely in substructure; these are being
gradually improved. All bridges are subject to a once-a-year inspection,
which is satisfactory. A new Kotri bridge is under construction. This will
provide a second track needed to remove a bottleneck on the Karachi-Lahore
main line, and is expected to be completed by April 1978.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
4.        Signaling:  Except for the Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) system
already introduced between Karachi and Landhi (18 miles) 1/, a traditional
signaling system has long been used by PR. On the Karachi-Lahore mainline,
except for the section Landhi-Hyderabad (95 miles), which is partly installed
with the automatic block signaling system, all other double-tracked sections
still use Tyre's tokenless double line block instruments. Even on the elec-
trified section between Khanewal-Lahore (single-track), the tokenless block
signaling system is used. The system as a whole is undergoing only gradual
improvement (para. 5).
5.        Telecommunications:  PR operates presently an antiquated telecommu-
nications system based on open wire circuits leased and maintained by Pakistan
Telegraph and Telephone Department (PTT). Because of high winds and climatic
conditions, overhead open wires have had frequent breakdowns. Train control-
ler territory is 120 miles only and serious train delays occur on a daily
basis. PR has decided to modernize its telecommunications network together
with related signaling improvement and operate it independently from PTT which
is presently engaged in huge public telecommunications expansion program and
cannot satisfy PR's specific needs.
6.        Marshalling Yards:  PR has several major yards on the Karachi-
Lahore main line; Karachi City Yard, Karachi Down Yard, Kotri Yard, Samasata
Yard, Lahore Yard, etc. In addition, Karachi Port Trust (KPT) has its own
yards to sort wagons received from PR and allocate them to the wharves in
the port area. A new railway marshalling yard at Pipri, designed to remove
congestion in the Karachi port area, is now being constructed under Loan
621-PAK and is expected to be completed by June 1978; the yard will then be
able to handle 2,500 wagons daily. In addition, under Credit 422-PAK (Third
Karachi Port Project), to improve the operational performance, a study of the
railway system, including both PR and KPT yards, started by the Consultants,
SOFRERAIL (France) in September 1976.
7.        Locomotives and Diesel Railcars:  At the end of 1975/76, on BG lines,
there were 450 steam locomotives, 468 diesel electric locomotives, 29 electric
locomotives, and 63 diesel railcars (motor-driven). About 84% of the total
steam locomotive fleet was over 40 years old. The electric locomotive fleet
was introduced only in 1970/71. While only 10% of the diesel railcar fleet
was over 30 years old, its overall availability was only 52%. Traction policy
relating to conversion from steam to diesel traction had once been examined
by PR under Loan 621-PAK in December 1970. The study tentatively concluded
a replacement ratio of one diesel electric locomotive to 1.5 steam locomo-
tives, which was not acceptable to the Bank. After a lengthy discussion, it
has been concluded that a further study of replacing steam traction should be
undertaken with assistance of an expert to be provided by the Bank to determine
1/   Except for automatic block signaling and relay interlocking at stations,
remote control mechanism of CTC has been disconnected since September
1975, due to the shortage of spare parts.



ANNEX 1
Page  3
the most suitable timetable for eliminating steam traction, giving full con-
sideration to the present and future developments in operational efficien-
cies, maintenance procedures, training and other investments required. Such
assistance is expected to take place shortly.
8.        Passenger Carriages:  The present BG passenger carriages comprise
1,922 coaching vehicles, 115 diesel railcar trailers, and 1,013 other coaching
vehicles. About 32% of coaching vehicles are over 30 years old, including
those of wooden body structure.
9.        Freight Wagons:  The present fleet of BG freight wagons consists of
about 32,900 four-wheelers and about 2,800 bogies. About 12% of four-wheelers
and about 7% of bogies are over 45 years old. PR's motive power and rolling
stock position by gauge at the end of 1975/76 is given in Table 6.
10.       Workshops and Running Sheds Operations:  PR has two major workshops
in addition to running sheds at various locations. The Moghalpura Workshop
caters for the overhaul of all motive power and rolling stock, except for
that of diesel electric locomotives. The Rawalpindi Diesel Workshop caters
only for the overhaul of diesel electric locomotives. Improvement of main-
tenance operations for motive power and rolling stock has been taken up by
PR, with assistance of SOFRERAIL being financed under Loan 621-PAK. However,
the availability of diesel electric locomotives deteriorated from 87% in 1974/
75 to 83% at the end of 1975/76 in spite of additional 68 diesel electric
locomotives delivered. Three problems have been identified by PR: (i) short-
age of spare parts on order, due to longer delivery time; (ii) shorter life
of parts reclaimed mainly by the Rawalpindi Diesel Spares Workshop; and
(iii) frequent breakdown of super turbo-charger components for the General
Electric (GE) locomotives. Spare parts purchase is included in the proposed
loan/credit. PR has planned more adequate spare parts reclamation facilities.
A possibility for eliminating super turbo-chargers from GE locomotives is
being considered by PR, even at the sacrifice of horsepower reduction by about
10%. SOFRERAIL stated in their progress report that a considerable number
of coaches and wagons required simple items such as bolts, nuts, and brake
shoes to put them back into service. Plant and machinery imminently required
for this purpose is being purchased under Loan 621-PAK. After introducing
a battery passenger train system in November 1975, because of continuous run-
ning of freight trains, some increase in wagon hot-boxes has been observed.
PR was considering installing roller bearings on the existing four-wheeler
wagons, which would be very costly. The appraisal mission has suggested
that PR pursue proper remedies including adjustment of axle-box repacking in-
tervals, oil injection mechanism without opening box covers, use of new mate-
rials for packing, etc., to keep hot boxes under control.
11.       Manufacturing Units:  The Carriage Factory at Islamabad has a capa-
city of manufacturing 150 passenger carriages per year. However, because of
the shortage of imported materials and components and of difficulty in syn-
chronizing delivery of imported and local materials and components, yearly
output in the past was only 50 passenger carriages; many skilled workers and
well equipped facilities have been standing idle.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
12.       The Moghalpura Workshop also manufactures freight wagons.  The
highest yearly output in the past had been about 1,640 four-wheeler wagons.
However, recent yearly output showed about 140 four-wheeler wagons, and about
70 bogie wagons. In early 1975, PR decided to manufacture only bogie wagons
in the future and put much emphasis on converting the existing four-wheelers
into bogies to modernize its wagon fleet.

APPRAISAL OF A TENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Production Targets During Fifth Five Year Plan
(1976/77-1980/81) and Their Implications
for the Railways Freight Traffic
1.        Basic data reviewed for the purpose of assessing PR's freight
traffic forecasts are:
(i) Pakistan Economic Survey 1975/76, prepared by Finance
Division, Economic Advisor's wing;
(ii)  Draft Fifth Five Year Plan, 1976-81, Volume II, Planning
Commission, January, 1976;
(iii)  Annual Plan 1975/76, Planning Commission.
Also, the mission had discussions with Transport and Industry Divisions of
Planning Commission on transport planning and the present economic situation
of Pakistan. This Annex tries to shed some light on current industrial and
agricultural production and their future as compared to their target produc-
tions in 1980/81 defined in the Draft Fifth Five Year Plan, and the implica-
tions of these figures for railways' freight traffic.
(a) Wheat
2.        Wheat surplus areas are Multan, Bawalpur, Sargodha, and part of
Lahore and Sind Province areas. Past production, imports and rail traffic
are:
PR
Production    Imports       Tons    Ton-miles        Average Lead
(000 tons)   (000 tons)    (000)   (millions)          (miles)
1970/71          6,374           215     1,187         331            279
1971/72          6,781           694      1,536        733            477
1972/73          7,325        1,464       1,689        975            578
1973/74          7,508        1,102       1,312        595            454
1974/75          7,552        1,566       1,402        811            579
3.        Wheat production in 1974/75 was 38% of its target and imports
totalled 1.6 million tons (costing about US$200 million). The Planning
Commission explains that the shortfall was caused by the lowest ever
discharge of river flows and the drought conditions prevailing during the



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Kharif season and at the Rabi time. The Government's procurement price of
wheat was raised by about 32% to Rs 22.50 per maund for the 1972/73 crop; the
procurement volume increased from 0.2 million tons in 1972 to 1.3 million
tons in 1973. In 1974/75, the procurement prices were set at Rs 37/maund,
but Government procured only 1.2 million tons. The Government expects to
procure about 2 million tons in 1975/76 at the same prices set in 1974/75
procurement. Available information indicates that rail has been carrying
a substantial amount of imported wheat and some Government procured wheat
and that the transport of imported wheat from Karachi has been a factor in
the rather high lead.
4.        The Fifth Five-Year Plan indicates that by 1980/81 wheat production
would reach 12.7 million tons and this figure represents selfsufficiency.
Available information shows that the 1974/75 target of 8 million tons was
not achieved but that in 1975/76 8 million tons of wheat production would be
possible. The traffic forecasts take into account the production target,
expected decrease in imported wheat and improvement in the wheat distribution
system. In 1980/81, the expected PR's wheat traffic would be:
Tons      x      Miles    =    Ton-Miles
(000)                           (million)
Local Movement          2,490      x        300              747
Import                    100      x        900    =          90
Total              2,590      x       323    =          837
(b) Rice and Paddy
5.        Rice is produced mainly in Larkana and Lahore regions and is one
of the most important foreign exchange earners.  Past production, exports and
rail traffic are:
PR
Production      Exports          Tons    Ton-miles  Average Lead
(000 tons)   (000 tons)          (000)   (million)      (miles)
1970/71     2,165          178               802       236           294
1971/72     2,226          195               843       214           254
1972/73     2,293          776               850       250           294
1973/74     2,416          588               729       299           410
1974/75     2,275          470               860       438           509
The rice production in 1974/75 was disappointing to the country as the tar-
get production was set at 2.8 million tons. The Planning Commission explains
that the shortfall was due mainly to the water shortage and high fertilizer
prices. In order to provide incentives for increased production, the Govern-
ment procurement prices of various varieties of rice have been increased
substantially. The price support program worked well in the procurement of



ANNEX 2
Page 3
rice for exports as it increased from 135,000 tons in 1972/73 to 596,000 tons
in 1973/74 and 630,000 tons in 1974/75. In fact, exports jumped 3.5 times
from 1971/72 to 1972/73. The railways carried 30% to 38% of the total pro-
duction. While the total tonnage carried has been stagnant for the last
five years, the lead went up substantially due to increase in the trans-
portation of superior or fine rice from the Lahore area to the Port of
Karachi for exports.
6.        The Plan shows that Pakistan Plans to produce 3.5 million tons of
rice in 1980/81, 40% more than the estimate production of 2.5 million tons
in 1975/76. Basic assumptions applied to rice traffic forecasts in 1980/81
are:
Exports            Tons     x    Miles               Ton-Miles
(000)                             (Millions)
Superior Rice       400     x      800        =          320
Coarse Rice         500     x      300        =           150
Local               610      x     300        =           183
1,510     x      432       =           653
(c) Other Grains
7.        Although it is expected that production of grains other than wheat
and rice may increase, this traffic category usually moves in less than full
car loads. As a result of the policy adopted by PR to discourage this type
of freight traffic, forecast for this traffic was kept very low in its growth
rate.
(d) Sugar
8.        Currently, Pakistan has 25 sugar factories with a daily crushing
capacity of 54,000 tons. In 1974/75, the production level was about 490,000
tons, 18% decrease from the level achieved in 1973/74; in 1975/76, the pro-
duction level is expected to be at 550,000 tons. The Government policy is to
increase sugar production to satify household demand and to provide employment
opportunity in rural areas through setting up of sugar factories. Past pro-
duction and rail traffic are:
PR
Production             Tons    Ton-miles  Average Lead
(000 tons)             (000)   (million)       (miles)
1970/71       511                   108         51         467
1971/72       369                   137         48         349
1972/73       429                   264         97         369
1973/74       598                   250         58         231
1974/75       490                   191         37         194



ANNEX 2
Page 4
9.        The Plan indicates that the daily crushing capacity would be
increased to 70,000 tons to meet projected demand for sugar of 1.0 million
tons in 1980/81. Since the sugar factories are widely dispersed with a
fairly small size of each plant, it is not expected that PR will carry much
sugar. Traffic forecasts take this factor into account.
(e) Firewood
10.       About 3.6% of the country's total area of 198.6 million acres is
under forest in Pakistan. The average forest yield is only 4 to 5 cft per
acre per annum with a much larger potential. The production of firewood
from the Government's forests is estimated at 20 million cft per annum
during the past five years. Although the Government indicates that aggres-
sive policies should be adopted to increase forest areas by afforestation
and regeneration process, the effect on firewood production will take a
long time and thus the railways estimated increase in firewood traffic
from 400,000 tons in 1974/75 to 624,000 tons in 1980/81 is reasonable.
(f) Coal
11.       Pakistan has low-grade coal deposits in seven major fields; the
total reserve is estimated at 442 million tons. Coal is mainly used by the
brick-making industry and for power generation in Quetta. Production has
been a little over 1 million tons. Bulk of output is from Kohst-Sharigh,
Sor-Range, Deagri and Mach fields in Baluchistan and Makerwal in Punjab.
Other fields located all over the country give a small output. Past
relationship between coal production, including some imported coal, and
rail transportation is summarized below:
PR
Production      Imports          Tons    Ton-miles  Average Lead
Year      (000 tons)   (000 tons)          (000)   (million)       (miles)

1971/72     1,236          30                 872      475           545
1972/73     1,185           20                959      533           556
1973/74     1,111           13                677      387           571
1974/75     1,293            8                637     394            619
12.       According to the Plan, Pakistan plans to produce 3.5 million tons
of coal by 1980/81. The railways is expected to carry about 1.1 million
tons in 1980/81. The mission accepts this estimate as the brickmaking
industry is expected to increase in the rural areas in the future. Price
increase of 270% over the past two years indicates an increasing demand
for coal.
(g)  POL
13.       Imported crude oil and some refined products are the biggest
source of energy in Pakistan, accounting for about 42% of the total



ANNEX 2
Page 5
commercial energy in 1974/75, followed by natural gas (35%), hydroelectric
power (14%) and coal (6%). Since the import bill for oil increased from
about US$60 million in 1972/73 to about US$350 million in 1974/75, the
Government's fuel policy emphasizes a search for oil and gas deposits and
increasing use of domestic energy sources. Currently, domestic oil pro-
duction is only marginal and estimated at 0.32 million tons per annum,
meeting only 9% of the total demand for petroleum products in 1974/75.
There are two oil refineries at Karachi and one at Morgah (Rawalpindi)
having a total refinery capacity of 3.5 million tons annually; the output
in 1974/75 is estimated at 3.2 million tons. Of this, about 0.45 million
tons of naphtha and furnace oil are exported. About 1.4 million tons of
middle distillates are imported.
14.       Past POL consumption and its rail traffic are:

(000 tons)             (000)   (million)       (miles)

1971/72           2,995               1,102       736          667
1972/73           2,989               1,173       785          669
1973/74           3,163               1,121       763          681
1974/75           3,586               1,455       982          675
Since rail traffic shown above excludes railway's own fuel, the role of
the rail in the above statistics is shown to be less than it is in fact.
15.       The Plan indicates that Pakistan will consume about 5.12 million
tons of POL in 1980/81. The Government, recognizing the transportation
bottlenecks in the movement of POL which requires a substantial movement
from Karachi area to the north is setting up a petroleum refinery of 2
million tons annual capacity near Multan with a crude oil pipeline from
Karachi to Multan (some 500 miles). The project is being undertaken with
the participation of Abu Dhabi interest. After making allowance for 1.6
million tons of the product from the Multan refinery, the railway's share
of the rest of POL is estimated at 2.0 million tons in 1980/81. It is
assumed that 0.5 million tons from the Multan refinery would also move by
rail in 1980/81.
(h) Cement
16.       The present capacity for cement production is estimated at 3.5
million tons annually:

The rail share is less than half of the total production and the average
transport distance has been rather short due to the factory location being
separated between north and south.
18.       According to the Planning Commission, the existing capacity is
expected to expand and also new plants will be installed at various places
by 1979/80:

Javedan (expansion)                            0.300

TOTAL                                2.400
Since some are still in the planning stage, the mission estimates that cement
production would increase by about 2.0 million tons by 1980/81, reaching a
total of 5 million tons per annum. The railway is assumed to carry about
30% of the total production by 1980/81, and the average lead should in-
crease because of expected improvement in train operations, expected
increase in construction activities in rural areas through various develop-
ment schemes and expected cement exports to Iran.
(i) Fertilizer
19.       Fertilizer industries are located at Multan, Daudkhel, Jaramwala,
Lahore and Daharki and they have a total capacity of 313,000 nutrient (N)
tons in 1974/75, and all utilize natural gas. In 1974/75 they produced
about 764,000 tons and Pakistan imported about 360,000 tons of various
fertilizers. The past production, imports and rail traffic are shown below:

/a   Includes super phosphate, ammonia sulphate and urea from 1970/71
through 1973/74 based on Pakistan Economic Survey and 1974/75 from
industry sources.
20.       The average lead is only 360-460 milies, as factories are located
in the middle of the country. The railways have been carrying a high per-
centage of fertilizers produced.
21.       According to the Plan, future production would reach about 2.3
million tons by 1980/81. Various schemes exist to expand the present
capacity and to install entirely new plants:

1,088
Even now some of factories claim that they do not get allocated enough wagons.
Fertilizers are controlled by the Government in terms of its wholesale prices,
distribution and marketing. Therefore, there should be a good opportunity for
improving rail transport efficiency by cooperation between producers, the Gov-
ernment and the railways. However, there are four basic problems in preparing
for future wagon capacity of the railway:
(i) timing of the commencement of various additional factories--
not all of them would be completed by 1980/81 as some of
fertilizer companies have not finalized the engineering and
have not determined the energy sources and/or raw materials;
(ii)  the factories are widely dispersed--hence it is difficult
to coordinate shipments for the railways;
(iii) too many destinations--this is not favorable to efficient
railway operations; and
(iv)  wide seasonal variations in the volumes to be transported--
this is not favorable to efficient railway operations.
Currently, GOP, PR and manufacturers are negotiating the transport arrange-
ment and PR is confident that if the transport plan is properly organized,
PR can have a capacity to carry 1.7 million tons per annum by 1980/81. It
is estimated that 490,000 tons of phosphate would be imported and 651,000
tons of nitrogenous fertilizer would be exported by 1980/81. The local
movement of fertilizer by rail is expected to be 573,000 tons. Thus, in
1980/81, PR's fertilizer traffic would be:
Tons     X       Miles     =      Ton-miles
(000)                             (millions)
Imports          490      X       500        =       245
Exports          651      X       500        =       326
Local            573       X      200        =        115
TOTAL    1,714               400       =        686

(j) Iron and Steel
22.       Pakistan has to import most iron and steel materials.  Currently,
most iron and steel is consumed in the Karachi and Lahore areas where found-
ries and small-scale rolling mills exist. Past production and imports, and
rail traffic are:
PR
Domestic Production   Imports   Tons   Ton-miles   Average Lead
(000 tons)      (000 tons) (000)  (million)         (miles)
1970/71                190             472       215       156            726
1971/72                163             383       176       122            694
1972/73                 81             472       121        85            702
1973/74               215              364       108        70            645
1974/75               219              570       107        60            550
Since rail traffic shown above includes only commercial traffic, and excludes
iron and steel for railways' materials, these figures are less than the total
carried by railway services.
23.       Pakistan Steel Mill Corporation (PSMC) is installing the first
integrated steel mill at Pipri with financial/technical assistance from USSR.
The eventual output is to substitute imports and to supply materials for
ship-building and other engineering industries. While the Plan indicates
that the capacity of production will reach to 0.98 million tons by 1978/79
and increase to 1.1 million tons by 1980/81, these estimates look optimistic
as many of the basic civil engineering and other engineering works are either
just started or not started yet. In addition to the PSMC projects, consider-
ation is being given to setting up a small-scale integrated mill (about
200,000 tons) utilizing Baluchistan ores, with Chinese assistance.
24.       Based on the production figure of 1.1 million in 1980/81 and taking
a conservative view, it is assumed that about 50% of the production would be
carried by rail in 1980/81 with an average lead of 600 miles.

PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF A TENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Principal Items Included in the Plan
I.   New Line Construction (Cost:  Rs 58 million)
This consists of one ongoing scheme (Islamabad Spur), supplemental
expenditure required for completing new lines such as Dera Ghazi Khan-Kashmor,
Kot Adu-Dera Ghazi Khan, etc., all of which have already been put into opera-
tion, and feasibility studies for 17 possible new lines. Islamabad Spur is
6.3 miles long, of which 1.3 miles are already completed and the rest is ex-
pected to be completed in 1978/79. In addition, at the direction of GOP, PR
intends to undertake, outside the Plan construction of three new lines
(totaling 134 miles) and one gauge conversion (88 miles) at a total estimated
cost of about Rs 520 million spread over five years. The Bank has reservations
regarding the economic justification of these additional works, but has re-
ceived assurances from GOP that their execution will not be allowed to inter-
fere with implementation of the Plan.
II. Track Rehabilitation (Cost: Rs 1,184 million)
(a) Complete track renewal (Cost: Rs 820 million)
This comprises complete renewal program for 450 miles of track over
the Five-Year Plan period - 400 miles on the Karachi-Lahore section and 50
miles on the Lalamusa-Peshawar section:
Schedule of Complete Track Renewal
(miles)
1976/77  1977/78  1978/79  1979/80  1980/81
Karachi-Lahore        70        70       85        85       90
Lalamusa-Peshawar    20         20       10        -        -
Total             90        90       95        85       90
Complete track renewal involves replacing simultaneously existing
overage rails with new welded rails, installing new sleepers, mostly concrete,
and replacing entire section of ballast with new crushed stone. New 100-lbs-
per-yard rails will be used on Karachi-Lahore and new 90-lbs-per-yard rails on
Lalamusa-Peshawar. Highest priority would be given to removing speed restric-
tions resulting from the overage track on 140 miles of the Karachi-Lahore main
line in order to remove the major operating bottleneck in the system. Taking



ANNEX 5
Page 2
into account: (i) PR's working capacity; and (ii) the dispersed location of
sections with speed restriction, practical time-phasing of speed restriction
removal is as follows:
Miles
Total  1976/77  1977/78  1978/79  1979/80  1980/81
140      30        40       40        12        18
(b) Rail renewal (Cost: Rs 40 million)
This item includes renewal of rail on 140 miles of track, using
released rails from complete track renewal work on the main line. Some
replacement of sleepers and replenishment of ballast for surfacing are
included in the rail renewal program. The rail renewal line sections are:
Miles
i.  Sher Shah - Kundian                         40.0
ii.  Wazirabad - Sialkot                          7.5
iii.  Texila - Havelian                           24.5
iv.  Kotri-Dadu - Habibkot                       68.0
Total                               140.0
Released rails from Kotri-Dadu-Habibkot section will be used for
replacement of overage rails on Kundian-Cambellpur and Hyderabad-Badin
sections on a spot basis, which will be charged to recurrent expenditure
and is not included in the Plan.
(c) Sleeper Renewal (Cost: Rs 195 million)
This consists of sleeper renewal on 400 miles equivalent of track
using partly concrete sleepers and partly creosote-treated wooden sleepers
because of the limited capacity of concrete sleeper production during the
Plan period. Sleeper renewal adds up to 850 miles when that in the com-
plete track renewal item is included.
(d) Points and crossings, bridge timbers and rail anchors
(Cost: Rs 30 million)
Points and crossings are mainly for marshalling yards, bridge
timber sleeper is for metallic bridges and rail anchor is for preventing
rail creeping on grade sections.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
(e) New construction of concrete sleeper factories
(Cost: Rs 76 million)
PR has two concrete sleeper factories at Sukkur and Jhelum.
Sukkur Factory manufactures German-type post-tension concrete sleepers for
primary lines and has an annual production performance of 70,000 sleepers
on a single-shift basis. Jhelum Factory manufactures French-type composite
concrete sleepers for secondary lines and has an annual production performance
of 15,000 sleepers. To substitute concrete for imported wooden sleepers,
PR plans to build four (Khanewal, Kotri, Kundian, and Nowshera) new factories.
To save on the relatively high transportation cost of heavy concrete sleepers,
dispersed locations are desirable. Total national annual production capacity
is expected to reach 245,000 sleepers in 1981/82, but this will not meet PR's
annual sleeper requirements; a further increase in the number of concrete
sleeper factories has to be contemplated in the Sixth Plan. In the transition
period, however, PR will still have to import wooden sleepers.
(f) Miscellaneous (Cost: Rs 23 million)
This includes up-grading of track between Spezand and Kuhi Taftan.
Ill. Bridge Works and Civil Engineering Works (Cost: Rs 297 million)
(a) Bridge works (Cost: Rs 164 million)
This consists of strengthening 38 overage bridges (23 ongoing and
15 new schemes) and extending two bridges. The latter two extensions (Rabi
and Chenub river bridges) are necessary to cope with wider waterways resulting
from 1973 flooding, and one of the two extensions is expected to be completed
by 1980/81.
(b) Civil Engineering Works (Cost: Rs 133 million)
This includes miscellaneous works such as road-over-rail bridges,
water supply facilities, electrical works, store facilities, staff quarters,
etc. This also includes the construction of a planned research and develop-
ment center whose work will cover such fields as standardization, planning
and development, engineering research, operation and marketing research
and labor research.
IV. Marshalling Yards (Cost: Rs 202 million)
(a) Pipri Yard (Cost: Rs 168 million)
This is an ongoing scheme aimed at construction of a marshalling
yard handling 2,500 wagons a day to remove congestion in the Karachi Port
area. The yard is scheduled to enter operation by June 1978.



ANNEX 5
Page 4
(b) Kiridhor Yard and Others (Cost: Rs 34 million)
To deal with increased traffic on the Bolan section, PR plans to
build a marshalling yard between Spezand and Kolpur and expects it to be
completed in 1979/80. In addition, a feasibility study on Chak Khumra Yard
is included under this heading.
V.   Line Capacity Works and Terminal Facilities (Cost:  Rs 207 million)
(a) Ongoing schemes (Cost: Rs 147 million)
This consists of various schemes, including the additional single-
track Kotri bridge over the Indus River near Hyderabad. Upon completion of
the bridge, scheduled for April 1978, the most serious line-capacity bottle-
neck on the Karachi-Lahore section will be removed. The ongoing schemes
also include the construction of the Karachi Passenger Terminal.
(b) By-pass lines (Cost: Rs 5 million)
Two by-pass lines at Sher Shah and Golra are planned for smoother
train operations.
(c) Freight terminal facilities (Cost: Rs 55 million)
To expedite loading and unloading and to make for smooth unit/block
train operations, PR plans to improve freight terminal facilities in coopera-
tion with major consignors/consignees by means of extending existing sidings,
providing new sidings and expanding the capacity of goods' sheds.
VI. Telecommunications and Related Signaling (Cost: Rs 378 million)
A scheme is proposed by PR for replacement and improvement of the
present overhead communication system between Karachi and Rawalpindi, which
is rented from Pakistan Telegraph and Telephone Department (PTT). The
cost of the proposed telecommunications scheme is provisionally estimated at
Rs 378 million and is included in the Plan. The mission and PR reached tenta-
tive agreement on the basic design of a required telecommunications and
related signaling network to be completed in 1980/81, which is a combination
of a backbone microwave system on the Karachi-Rawalpindi route together with
the three legs to Quetta, Multan and Lahore, complemented with UHF spurs to
way stations and a mobile VHF system, and radio-activated signaling network.
However, the precise cost figure and its time-phasing will not be available
until the detailed engineering financed under Loan 621-PAK is completed in
about September 1977.
VII. Motive Power and Rolling Stock (Cost: Rs 1,246 million)
(a)  Marshalling yard equipment (Cost:  Rs 27 million)
This consists of six freight wagon movers for the Karachi port
area and four special shunters for the new Pipri marshalling yard. These



ANNEX 5
Page 5
are expected to be purchased in 1977/78. Except for this marshalling yard
equipment and re-engining below, no diesel locomotives are provided in the
Plan. However, some 30 diesel shunters to replace steam traction are
justified and the purchase can be made only if financing of all other items
in the Plan will have been secured.
(b) Re-engining of diesel locomotives (Cost: Rs 100 million)
Following a pilot scheme financed by CIDA for four re-enginings
of overage ALCO locomotives, PR plans to re-engine a further 40 locomotives
during the Plan period.
(c) Passenger coaches (Cost: Rs 900 million)
PR plans to manufacture 600 passenger coaches. Except for some
special coaches included in 1980/81, which are subject to a further review,
all coaches are of second and/or third class. The time-phasing of coach
manufacture is as follows:
Number of Coaches
Total  1976/77  1977/78  1978/79  1979/80  1980/81
600     127       100       120      120       133
(d) Bogie wagons (Cost: Rs 34 million)
PR plans to manufacture 140 bogie, POL wagons in 1976/77. No
further provision is made under this heading, in view of the relatively
excessive wagon fleet of PR.
(e) Conversion from four-wheelers into bogie wagons
(Cost: Rs 185 million)
PR plans to convert 3,700 four-wheeler wagons into 1,850 bogie
wagons. Number and time-phasing of bogie wagons by type are as follows:

the supplemental expenditure will be required in 1977/78 only.
II. Track Rehabilitation (Cost: Rs 504 million)
(a) Complete track renewal (Cost: Rs 330 million)
This comprises complete renewal program for 185 miles of track
in 1977/78 and 1978/79; 155 miles on the Karachi-Lahore section and 30 miles
on the Lalamusa-Peshawar section. At the end of 1978/79, while a further
175 miles of track will remain to be renewed on the Karachi-Lahore section,
the planned complete track renewal for the Plan will be completed on the
Lalamusa-Peshawar section. Part of materials for the complete track renewal
for the Project are already on order under the German Credit and GOP's cash
resources arrangement. The proposed Loan/Credit is limited to track mate-
rials on 128 miles of track on the Karachi-Lahore section which are broken
down into: (i) those for removing speed restrictions (40 miles each in 1977/78
and 1978/ 79; (ii) those for building up the inventory for removing the last
speed restriction sections at the end of 1978/79 (12 miles in 1979/80 and 18
miles in 1980/81; and (iii) those for other complete track renewal (9 miles
each in 1977/78 and 1978/79).

Sleeper renewal adds upto 385 miles, when that in the complete track renewal
item is included.
(d) Points and crossings, bridge timbers, and rail anchors
(Cost: Rs 12 million)
A lump sum provision. Points and crossings are manufactured from
imported 100 lbs-per-yard/90 lbs-per-yard rails at PR's Signaling Workshop.
Bridge timbers are creosoted at PR's Creosote Treatment Plant at Haripur
Band near Wazirabad. Rail anchors are locally purchased.
(e)  New construction of concrete sleeper factories
(Cost: Rs 46 million)
Of the four new concrete sleeper factories, which are under con-
struction during the Project, only one factory at Khanewal is expected to
be completed in 1978/79 and put into full operation in 1979/80. A second
one is expected to be completed in 1979/80, third and fourth ones in 1980/81.
III. Bridge Works and Civil Engineering Works (Cost: Rs 166 million)
(a) Bridge works (Cost: Rs 92 million)

IV. Marshalling Yards (Cost: Rs 129 million)
(a) Pipri Yard (Cost: Rs 98 million)
The yard is expected to be completed by June 1978.
(b) Kiridhor Yard and others (Cost: Rs 31 million)
Although PR has decided to construct the Kiridhor Yard, its exact
location and size is still under review. The yard is expected to be completed
in 1979/80. Also is included under this heading a feasibility study on
Chak Jhumra Yard (near Lyallpur), which the Consultants SOFRERAIL (France)
suggested to PR for consideration, in their 1971 report on operational
improvements.
V.   Line Capacity Works and Terminal Facilities (Cost:  Rs 76 million)
(a) Ongoing works (Cost: Rs 46 million)
This comprises the second railway bridge at Kotri, the Karachi
Passenger Terminal, and other line capacity works. The completion of the
Kotri bridge is expected to be by December 1977. The Karachi Passenger
Terminal is expected to be completed only during the Sixth Plan. Other
line capacity works include the lengthening of crossing loops at intermediate
stations between Lalamusa and Rawalpindi for pusher service to alleviate
traffic congestion.
(b) New schemes (Cost: Rs 30 million)
This comprises construction of two by-pass lines at Sher Shah and
Golra, and provision of freight terminal facilities at 36 places. One of
the two by-pass lines is expected to be completed in 1979/80, and the other,
in 1980/81. The exact location and the description of the 36 freight ter-
minal facilities will be determined by PR in consultation with various
Government agencies and provincial governments.
VI. Telecommunications and Related Signaling (Cost: Rs 372 million)
Expenditure of Rs 372 million with a foreign exchange content of
Rs 160 million (US$16.0 million equivalent) appearing in Table 13 is provi-
sional. However, during the mission, PR has revised its original scheme and
proposed a more modern telecommunications and related signaling scheme, which
may be implemented much faster and will cost less, satisfying needs for train
operations and other communications. The concept of the scheme is as follows:
(a) Backbone microwave route running from Karachi to Rawalpindi
through Khanewal, Lyallpur, and Wazirabad; the existing
Pakistan Telegraph and Telephone's (PTT) coaxial cable/



ANNEX 6
Page 4
microwave system is not built along the railway line and
cannot be directly used for purposes of train operations.
Three legs to Quetta, Multan, and Lahore complete the basic
system. As regards the Quetta leg, PR plans to jointly use
a PTT new microwave system to be built adjacent to the
railway line between Sukkur and Quetta, financed under
Credit 510-PAK (Third Telecommunications Project);
(b) Provision of small capacity UHF radio spurs on the same
routes for operational and control purposes to connect the
remote stations with the backbone microwave system;
(c) Provision of VHF radio equipment for 200 base stations,
500 locomotives, 100 PR motor vehicles, and 200 hand-hold
sets for mobile communications of the railway personnel,
enabling the train controller to communicate directly with
the locomotive driver and other crew not only on the main
line but on some branches lines covered by the system as
well;
(d) Use of UHF communications to activiate axle counters at
station signals for automatic block signaling between
Hyderabad and Lodhran (410 miles), and for tokenless
block signaling between Lodhran and Khanewal (60 miles)
and between Khanewal and Wazirabad (200 miles); and
(e) Provision of telephone exchange and data transmission.
Although the precise cost is not available until the detailed engineering,
which is to be financed under Loan 621-PAK, is carried out, the estimated
total cost is as follows and well under the provisional figure above:
--------US$ Million------

Cost Estimates for the Proposed Loan/Credit Items
1.   Track Rehabilitation (Cost:  US$11.7 million)
It has been estimated that the Loan/Credit proceeds are used for
imported track materials and components on 110 miles of track. Complete
track renewal will be carried out on 80 miles (40 miles each in 1977/78
and 1978/79) of track to remove speed restrictions imposed on the main
Karachi-Lahore line. It is intended that at the end of 1978/79, PR will
build up inventory of track materials and components on 30 miles of track,
which are used for removing the last speed restrictions on the main
Karachi-Lahore line in the last two years of the Plan, 1979/80 and 1980/81.

Economic Return Calculations
Introduction
1.        Table I of this Annex shows the calculations of a typical economic
return on the Plan. Economic benefits in the form of transport cost savings
are generated by avoiding diversions of the rail traffic to road transport
requiring additional costs incurring to the economy, by controlling PR's
operating costs and by expanding its capacity mainly through improvement in
its operational efficiency. The major variables involved in calculating the
economic rate of return are (a) PR's investment costs, (b) the volume of
traffic with and without the Plan execution, and, consequently, the volume of
traffic which would have to be diverted from PR to road transport because of
PR s capacity limitations, (c) economic costs of PR's operations with and
without the Plan and the implementation of complementary measures to improve
its operational efficiency, and (d) economic costs of road transport.
Investment Costs
2.        The economic costs of the Plan are based on figures in Table 12
in the main text but exclude customs duties and sales taxes levied on
various imported items such as locomotives, railcars, materials for manu-
facturing of passenger coaches, rails, machineries and signaling equipment.
Also sales tax of 10% is levied on some of these items. On telecommunica-
tions equipment and cables, customs duties of 50-60% and sales tax of 10% are
levied.  Taking into account these, the economic cost of the Plan would amount
to about 75% of the total and this is used in economic return calculations.
Traffic Volumes
3.        Basic traffic data are shown Tables 8 and 10.  For the purpose
of the economic analysis, PR's capacity has been estimated at 8 billion
passenger miles and 5.8 billion ton-miles in 1975/76. This capacity
assumption implies that without the Plan execution and expected operational
improvements PR's capacity would remain constant in the future and that
with the Plan execution and operational improvements PR would carry the
estimated traffic forecasts.



ANNEX 9

Economic Cost of PR's Operations
4.        An exact assessment of future cost increases without or declines
with investment is impossible because of PR's lack of cost data. But in
view of the very high percentage of overage PR's equipment and rolling
stock, it is reasonable to assume that without replacement or, other invest-
ment and operational improvements, the capacity remains same in the future
and the operating cost would increase at a considerable rate. Therefore,
the increase in PR's operating costs without investment has been assumed at
5% annually in the future. This is a reasonable assumption considering PR's
operating costs including depreciation went up by 3.2 times in the past ten
years without too much increase in the traffic level, while the general
wholesale price index went up by 2.3 times.
5.        With completion of important ongoing works designed to increase
line capacity such as Pipri Marshalling Yard, consolidation of passenger
trains, improvement in freight-train operations, and expected labor cost
control, PR's unit operating costs are expected to decline substantially
and its capacity will increase. Against expected freight traffic increase
by 6% per annum in ton-miles and passenger by 2.7% per annum in passenger
miles, it has been assumed that PR's operating cost would increase by 3% per
annum in the future.
6.        Both estimated operating costs exclude taxes and customs duties
(13%) but adequate estimated provision for depreciation has been added.
Economic Cost of Road Transport
7.        Review of various studies made under the Transport Coordination
study during 1970-1971 indicates that freight transport by rail would
become cheaper when the transport distance is more than 200 miles. Basic
assumptions made in this comparison are:
(i) costs on rail with the use of 22 ton two-axle
wagon loaded with 16 tons, including collection
and delivery costs at both ends by road
transport; and
(ii) costs on road transport with the 6 ton Bedford
truck loaded to its capacity.
The current cost figures are not available but because of increases in fuel,
other material and labor costs in the past several years which would generally
favor the rail, the bench mark of 200 miles would be shorter.
8.        Based on the Planning Commission's figure of the 1974/75 financial
vehicle operating costs, the truck cost has been estimated by adjusting
to the 1975/76 level and excluding tax elements:

Tire and Tube                  294               147
Depreciation                   335               201
Maintenance                    161               109
Salaries                       170               170
Total                    1,604              1,032
Thus, truck transport cost becomes about Rs 0.170 per ton-mile with full
load and without empty return haul.
9.        Bus operating cost has been estimated based on the Sind Province
preliminary data:

Financial         Economic
(Rs)              (Rs)
Fuel Consumption              600               370

Tire and Tube                 230               110
Depreciation                  600               300
Maintenance                   400               320
Salaries                      370               370
Other overheads               570               430
Total                   2,930             2,000
Thus, bus transport cost becomes about Rs 0.05 per passenger-mile with
80% load.
10.       These are only estimates and average figures.  However, these are
conservative estimates since they do not take into account road maintenance
costs, possible road construction costs, and procurement of new trucks and
buses.
Economic Return Calculations
11.       Based on an economic life of the Plan of 25 years, and various
assumptions described in paragraphs 2 - 9 as above, the Plan would yield
an estimated economic return of about 24%, which is shown in Table 1 of this



ANNEX 9
Page 4
Annex. The estimated economic return would vary, depending upon alternative
assumptions for major variables in the analysis. Assuming that the economic
cost of investment be higher by 15%, the economic return would be about 20%.
The aforementioned 24% economic rate of return was based on 6% p.a. freight
traffic growth, but even assuming a 3% annual freight traffic growth, the
rate of return would be about 16%, since the greater part of the plan consists
of replacements. The most important variables are railways' operating costs.
Should operational performance not improve and if operating costs increased at
4% per annum with the execution of the Plan instead of the 3% assumed in the
table to this annex, the economic return would be about 18%; if PR's operating
costs increased by 5% per annum, the return would be further reduced to 13%.
This indicates the importance of achieving the planned operational improvements.

Rates and Fares
A.   Freight Service
1.        Basically, the existing rate structure for freight traffic, which
has been in since October 1971, consists of 25 rate scales. The basic rate,
designated as scale 100, was based on the average total cost of haulage in
1969/70. The other rate scales are expressed as percentages of this rate
scale, the lowest being 70, which represented the direct cost, and the
highest being rate scale 300. Assignment of a rate scale to a commodity
and subsequent changes of scale for the commodity, is on an ad hoc basis
supposedly taking into account the capacity of traffic to bear the charges.
In addition, there is minimum distance and weight charges which are revised
by PR from time to time.
2.        Since 1971 when the present tariff structure became effective,
there have been the following rate level changes:
General Increases
July 1, 1972   - 10% increase on all traffic with few exceptions
July 1, 1974   - 30% increase on all traffic
July 1, 1975   - 15% increase on all traffic
March 20, 1976 - 15% increase on all traffic
Major Rate Scale Increases
December 1, 1974 -  Rate scale classification for rice and paddy
in wagon load increase.
April 1, 1975    -  Rate scale classification was increased in
various degrees for ten major commodities.
May 1, 1975       -  Rate scale classification was increased in
various degrees for eighteen commodities.
December 1, 1975 -  Rate scale classification was changed
in various degrees for 17 commodities.
3.        During the period, there has also been numerous increases in
rate scale classification of "Smalls" traffic, minimum weight and distance
charges.

B.   Passenger Service
4.        A revised passenger fare and parcel rate structure was also intro-
duced in 1971, based on an exercise by the Railways attempting to allocate
total costs between passenger and freight operation. However, the revised
structure turned out to be mainly a reduction of classes of passenger fares
rather than a fare structure based on costs.
5.        The only passenger fare increase since 1971 was a 20% general
increase in July 1974. The net result of several increases in air condi-
tioned first class fare, parcel and luggage rates in the past several years
have been nominal since they constitute a small portion of total passenger
revenues.

ANNEX 11
Page   1
PAKISTAN
APPRAISAL OF A TENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Assumptions Used in Making Revenue and Expenditures
Forecasts for 1976/77-1980/81
1.   Revenues
Traffic Earnings
Increases in traffic are taken from Tables 8 and 10. Since the
composition of traffic and the average distance show variations during the
Plan period, the freight revenue forecast is calculated for fourteen com-
modities separately. For passenger, the traffic is taken by each class of
service. The tariff and rate scales used for calculating revenues are those
in effect as of June 1976 and incorporate a 20% increase in second- and
third-class passenger fares as of July 1, 1977. Detailed calculations are
shown in Tables 1 and 2 of this Annex.
Other Earnings
The subsidy received from GOP for moving Government traffic was
increased by Rs 10 million, starting in 1976/77. Also, other coaching and
sundries' earnings were increased by Rs 5.0 million and Rs 2.5 million,
starting in 1976/77.
2.   Operating Expenses
General
Revised estimates for 1976/77 form the basis for the future pro-
jections. However, 1976/77 estimates include expenditures of special nature
(remaining ongoing works from the 1973 floods) amounting to Rs 30.1 million
(Rs 12 million labor and Rs 8.1 million material). Projections for future
years do not take into account this expenditure.
Labor
It is assumed that there will be no increase in the staff strength
during the Plan period. The labor costs consist of 60% salaries and wages
and 40% dearness allowance.   The wage scale can only be increased by the
National Pay Commission which normally is activated every five years or long-
er. The Pay Commission is presently in session. On the other hand, dearness
allowances are increased by the Executive Order when such an increase is



ANNEX 11
Page   2
deemed required. Therefore, the 1976/77 wages' cost is increased by 10% for
anticipated Pay Commission award. The dearness allowances are increased by
5% annually for the period. As agreed during negotiations, savings from
reduction of staff have been taken into account.
Fuel
Fuel costs consist of "primary cost" and "taxes and duties."
After allowing for increases in consumption due to increase in traffic and
taking into account efficiencies to be obtained from the execution of the
Plan, the primary cost of fuel is projected taking into account an annual
price increase of 8%.
Material
Material costs also consist of "primary cost" and "taxes and duties."
The projection of material costs were handled the same as projection of fuel
costs described above.
Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous costs are projected to escalate by 5% each year.
Appropriation to the Funds
Appropriation to Depreciation Reserve Fund (DRF) is provided at 12%
of gross earnings for 1976/77 and 1977/78. Beginning with 1978/79, appropria-
tion to DRF is based on preliminary estimated revalued wasting assets of PR.
The appropriation to the Improvement Fund is at 5.5% of passenger revenue.
Debt Service
Estimates of debt servicing are based on the foreign loans and local
currency development loans required for financing of the Investment Plan.
Dividend on Capital-at-Charge
This has been calculated to include Government's share of the
Investment Plan (investment on additions). However, PR has submitted a
claim to the Government for restructuring of railway capital, claiming that
much of the so-called Government capital-at-charge has been in fact generated
from railway sources. PR's claim has been turned over to a third party for
arbitration. If PR is successful in its claim, under the present accounting
method an estimated reduction of Rs 73 million in dividends will be required.
