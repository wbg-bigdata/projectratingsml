REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
AND LOAN TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A TENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit for the equivalent of US$25 million and a loan for the
equivalent of US$35 million to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to help to
finance a tenth railway project. The credit would be on standard IDA terms;
the loan would be for a term of 20 years, including a 4-1/2 years' grace
period, at 8.5% interest. Proceeds of both the loan and credit would be
passed on to the Pakistan Railways (PR) as Beneficiary on essentially the
same terms and conditions as the Bank loan, except that portion of the
loan/credit used by PR to finance additional (as opposed to replacement)
investment would, as is customary in Pakistan, be added to PR's capital-at-
charge and not repaid to the Government.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report "Recent Trends and Development
Prospects" (1023-PAK, dated March 1, 1976) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 10, 1976. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        The economic development of Pakistan since 1970 compares some-
what unfavorably with the record of rapid growth of output and exports of the
1960's.. Starting with the war with India and the separation of Bangladesh,
there followed a series of poor monsoons and floods, and consequently poor
harvests. Added to this were the twin effects of deteriorating terms of
trade and world recession. The magnitude of the problem was intensified by
the loss of momentum of the "green revolution" which had been one of the
mainstays of the favorable economic period of the late 1960's. In addition,
industrial development was discouraged by changed attitudes toward the pri-
vate sector and a series of nationalizations, beginning with the nationali-
zation of a large part of private industry in 1972. As a result, the basic
productive sectors have had an average growth of about 2% per year since
1970, although total GDP has grown by about 4% per annum because of the rapid
expansion of construction, government and other service industries.
4.        The stagnation of agricultural production during the 1970's con-
trasts with the rapid growth attained during the 1960's. This slowdown is
the result of many factors, including unfavorable growing conditions, a
slower rate of adoption of high-yielding varieties, and adverse pricing
policies. Heavy rains and floods in August 1976 have once again lowered out-
put levels below potential in the summer season. Cotton has been particularly
affected, and production is liable to be barely sufficient to meet domestic
demand. Rice and sugarcane, which reached record levels last year, show
slight declines due to flood damage. Wheat production in the winter season,

-2-
on the other hand, could achieve another record as a result of increased
fertilizer consumption, residual moisture left in the ground after the floods
and the use of water from the Tarbela Dam. Fertilizer consumption, which
leveled off at about 400,000 tons when retail distribution was taken over by
the Provincial Governments, reached 570,000 tons last year and is expected to
expand to 680,000 tons this year. This is a result of government policy
changes which have lowered fertilizer prices, increased output-procurement
prices, and permitted the return of the private sector to the retail distri-
bution field.
5.        For the next few years, further improvements from the exten-
sion of the "green revolution" technology can be expected, particularly
through increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, improved seeds and
further development of the groundwater potential. Growth thereafter will
require more fundamental change in on the farm practices regarding land and
water management, particularly in terms of increasing the efficiency of the
watercourse distribution system. Central to improved farmer techniques is
an upgraded, more effective extension service, with greater emphasis on
reaching the small farmer, and with better linkages to an effective research
program. In order to increase the basic productivity of the land, a major
effort needs to be made to increase investments in projects designed to
reverse waterlogging and salinity.
6.        After agriculture, which accounts for about 32%, manufacturing is
the second largest sector of the economy, contributing about 16% of GDP and
50% to 60% of total exports. Since 1973, the major change in the industrial
sector has been the expansion of the public sector, from about 10% to about
25% of industrial assets. In January 1972, the Government took over ownership
of 31 private companies in 10 basic industrial categories. This was followed
by takeovers of the vegetable ghee industry, the cotton and rice export trade,
commercial banks, shipping, life insurance and gas and oil distribution. The
most recent action occurred in July 1976 when the Government nationalized the
larger units in rice and flour milling, as well as all of the cotton gins.
These actions have adversely affected the climate for private investment,
particularly in the industrial sector. It remains to be seen what their
effect on agricultural production will be.
7.        While industrial growth averaged close to 10% per annum during the
1960's, since 1970 it has been only about 3% per annum. The decline in the
growth rate is a result of a number of factors including lower private in-
vestment during the late 1960's and early 1970's and the problems with agri-
cultural production which reduced the availability of some raw materials.
Since FY74, the international recession has had a major impact by reducing
demand for Pakistan's exports, particularly textiles. Output of both cotton
yarn and cloth is estimated to have been lower in FY76 than in FY74.
8.        Exports have remained depressed for the past few years in part
because of the international recession while imports have increased rapidly.
Import prices increased 36% in FY74 and 27% in FY75, but in FY74 the rise was
offset by increases in major export prices, particularly of cotton and rice.
In FY75 the full effect of earlier petroleum price increases, combined with
falling export prices for most products, produced an 37% decline in the terms



- 3 -
of trade, although a slight improvement is estimated to have taken place
in FY76. As a consequence of these developments, the deficit on the current
account of the balance of payments increased from $130 million in FY73, an
exceptionally good year, to $950 million in FY76. It is expected to rise to a
level of about $1.2 billion in FY77. These large deficits have been financed
by expanded borrowings from foreign sources. Domestic resource mobilization,
on the other hand, has declined markedly, with the overall saving rate falling
from about 10% of GDP in 1973 to 4% in FY75, and public savings turning
negative. The decline in private savings can be traced to lower corporate
profits as well as the lag of interest rates behind the rate of inflation.
While annual price increases have averaged over 20% during the past three
years, deposit interest rates at banks have averaged only about 7-8%. In
FY76, however, the rate of inflation was brought down to only 8%, and the
domestic saving rate increased to 8.5%.
9.        In the past few years the contribution of the public sector to do-
mestic savings has been quite unsatisfactory. Recently a number of steps
have been taken to improve public sector resource mobilization, including
substantially higher prices of electric power, cement, petroleum products,
railway and air fares, and import tariffs. Steps have also been taken to
simplify the income tax and improve its enforcement. Subsidies of various
types which amounted to Rs 3 billion in FY75, or about 15% of current gov-
ernment expenditures, are estimated to have been reduced to Rs 1.5 billion
in FY76. These revenue efforts have not been sufficient, however, to fully
meet the Government's increased spending. While public saving was positive
in FY76, the overall budget had a deficit of Rs 4.0 billion.
10.       For the longer term, the Government has drafted a new Plan for
FY78-83 which calls for substantially higher levels of output, exports
and domestic savings. Investment levels would amount to about 19% of GDP.
With an expected decline in foreign capital available, particularly from OPEC
sources, this target can be reached only by sharply increasing the rate of
domestic savings to 15% of GDP by 1983. Large investments are contemplated
in infrastructure, particularly power and transport, as well as in heavy
industry. Investments in steel, machinery, fertilizers and chemicals would
seek to reduce dependence on imports, and encourage a greater reliance on
domestic raw materials. A substantial increase in exports will depend largely
on a rapid growth of agricultural output, particularly rice and cotton. The
agricultural strategy focuses on increased use of fertilizer and pesticides,
further mechanization, expansion of the extension service, and programs to
reduce waterlogging and salinity.
11.       The balance of payments and debt management position will be
difficult for the next few years. By the end of FY76, the total debt out-
standing, including undisbursed amounts, was about $7 billion. Debt payments
as a ratio of export earnings and workers' remittances will be only about
15%, as a result of $650 million of debt relief which is being given by the
Consortium countries for the years 1975-78. The debt service ratio can be
expected to rise to 20% or more after 1978 since the end of the debt relief
arrangement coincides with a sharp increase in repayments owed to the OPEC
countries and the DMF. On the positive side, workers' remittances have risen



- 4 -
sharply and totalled $350 million last year; they could exceed $400 million
this year. Nevertheless, it is important that borrowing on conventional terms
should be held to the minimum. For this reason the major part of Bank Group
operations in Pakistan consists of IDA credits. Including undisbursed amounts,
Pakistan's debt to the Bank and IDA now represents about 16% of its external
public indebtedness; by 1980 this ratio is likely to fall to about 13%. The
share of the Bank Group in total debt service (after taking account of the
debt relief which Pakistan will receive from other creditors) is now about
23%, but is expected to decrease to about 9% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
12.       The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclusive
of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the former
East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$1.4 billion. During its long
association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in almost all sec-
tors of the economy. Through FY76, 43% of total commitments were for public
services, 24% for agriculture, 32% for industry, of which 12% was for indus-
trial imports, and 1% for education. Lending for public services has amounted
to more than $600 million and has included loans and credits for railways,
electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port, highways, telecommunications and
water supplies. A large part of past lending for agriculture was for Indus
Basin projects. Lending for industry has been mainly through the Pakistan
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC). For most projects for
which loans and credits are being disbursed, construction is now going ahead
satisfactorily. The principal problems being encountered are that the rates
charged by some of the public services have not kept pace with inflation and,
hence, some utilities are not earning the return which they need. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of December 31,
1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.    One of
these is to support the directly productive sectors of the economy, and, in
particular, to increase production of import substitutes such as foodgrains,
edible oils, fertilizer and engineering goods and to sustain export growth
in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other industrial and
agricultural produicts. The main part of Bank Group assistance for industry
will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as PICIC, which
finances the medium and large-scale private sector and will thus contribute
to exports and industrial growth, the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan
(IDBP) for the small and medium scale industrial sector, with possible parti-
cipation by commercial banks, and the National Development Finance Corporation
(NDFC) for industries in the public sector. The most important part of future
lending for agriculture is expected to be for the Government's new program to
increase productivity in the Indus Basin by controlling salinity and improving
the utilization of surface irrigation and groundwater. The Bank is the Execut-
ing Agency for a UNDP technical assistance grant for improving agriculture and
water planning in the Indus Basin.



-5-
14.       Another objective is to support the necessary expansion and to
improve the institutions which are responsible for the principal public
services which have benefitted from Bank Group lending in the past, namely,
the Telegraph and Telephone Department, Karachi Port, Water and Power
Development Authority, Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company
and the Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency. In most of these, institutional
improvements are being made with technical assistance financed by the Bank
Group.
15.       A third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to bring economic
development to the poorest strata of the population. This shift implies
increased lending for agriculture and rural development and will involve
significant lending for projects complementary to the Indus/Tarbela works.
In the urban sector, Bank missions have been working with municipal authorities
on the plans for the urban development of Karachi, whose population now exceeds
4 million. A Karachi master plan was completed in 1974 with the assistance of
consultants financed by UNDP, and urban projects are being developed within the
framework of this plan. A project for urban upgrading in the Lyari section of
the city has been appraised. The Government has also asked the Bank to study
urbanization problems in Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city. Planning in
Lahore is at a much earlier stage than in Karachi and the immediate need is
for technical assistance. A credit for the second Lahore water supply, sewer-
age and drainage project includes provision for the financing of urban-studies
in Lahore.
16.       Other projects which have also been appraised are a fertilizer
project, a flood damage restoration project and the SCARP VI irrigation and
drainage project. Preparatory work is proceeding on another irrigation and
drainage project, a Karachi water supply project and projects involving agri-
cultural extension and rural development. A further loan to PICIC and one for
a livestock project as well as a credit for a third education project have
already been approved in the current fiscal year.
17.       IFC has made investments in nine Pakistani enterprises for a total
of US$30.2 million, of which US$22.9 million was by way of loans and US$7.3
million by equity participations (these are shown in Annex II). About US$12
million remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in
the field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in steel,
cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN PAKISTAN
18.       The development of the transport system and traffic patterns in
Pakistan reflects the long (1000-mile) south-to-north axis of the country,
extending from Karachi, the country's only port and a major industrial center,
through the rich agricultural areas of Sind and Punjab in the Indus Basin to
the population and administrative centers of Lahore and Rawalpindi/Islamabad.
Virtually all imports and exports of the country pass through Karachi. Inland
transport services are operated by the Pakistan Railways (PR), four provin-
cially-owned and many privately-owned bus companies, myriad private trucking



-6 -
firms and the semi-public Pakistan International Airlines which provides
domestic and international service.
19.       Although historically PR has handled the bulk of freight traffic,
especially long-haul movements, and considerable passenger traffic, its share
of both freight and passenger traffic has declined in recent years. Between
1961 and 1975, estimated total passenger miles by road and rail increased from
12.7 to 38.7 billion, while total freight ton-miles rose from 5.7 to 12.0 bil-
lion; road transport accounted for 93% and 84% respectively of the increase
in each category. Rail passenger traffic increased by 2.1% p.a. and freight
traffic by 1.6% p.a. during this period. Road transport's capture of most of
the traffic increase reflects its efficiency, which has been promoted by com-
petition resulting from generally unregulated rates and liberal licensing
policies toward the industry. Intermodal cost comparisons, however, indicate
that rail transport, if efficiently operated, continues to have a major role
to play in the sector, particularly in transporting bulk commodities between
the Karachi area and upcountry, and in their internal distribution over medium
and long distances.
20.       To provide a basis for rational transport planning and coordination,
a transport study was financed under the Second Highway Project (Loan 578-PAK
of December 20, 1968). In accordance with the recommendations of the study,
GOP established the National Transport Research Center within the Planning
Commission in 1973/74 with the principal tasks of helping to improve opera-
tional efficiency of the various transport modes and fostering economic allo-
cation of traffic. The Bank has been supporting the Center in the training of
staff by helping to formulate curricula and sending instructors to it. Tech-
nical assistance is being sought by the Government from UNDP and the UK for
designing and supervising the Center's work program.
21.       A comprehensive Six-Year Plan (FY78-83) is now under preparation.
In the transport sector the Government proposes to give the railways higher
priority than in the past vis-a-vis other modes. This shift in emphasis re-
flects, in part, the recent increases in fuel prices. Other important areas
of proposed expenditure are the expansion of the farm-to-market road network;
extension of transport facilities to remote areas; the expansion of domestic
vehicle assembly plants; construction of a second port east of Karachi; and
increasing the share of the country's international cargo handled by Pakistan-
flag carriers.
22.       A Five-Year Investment Plan for PR, covering the period 1976/77
to 1980/81, forms the basis for the proposed project. The Bank reviewed this
Investment Plan while it was being prepared and suggested a number of modifi-
cations which PR accepted. The Plan's main objectives are to carry out re-
quired rehabilitation and replacement of PR's present plant and equipment
in order to improve operational efficiency and to enable PR to obtain and
carry a projected annual increase of 6% in freight ton-miles and 2.7% in
passenger miles. Capital expenditures over the five-year period are estimated
to amount to US$391 million equivalent, including US$153 million in foreign
exchange. In addition, at the direction of GOP, PR intends to undertake,



-7-
outside the Investment Plan, construction of three new lines (totalling 134
miles) and one gauge conversion (88 miles) at a total estimated cost of about
US$50 million, equivalent, spread over five years. The Bank has reservations
regarding the economic justification of these additional works, but has
received assurances from GOP in a Supplemental Letter that their execution
will not be allowed to interfere with implementatUon of the Investment Plan.
23.       The Bank/IDA has extended substantial support to the transport sec-
tor in Pakistan over the past several years. A total of $122 million has been
provided through six Bank Group operations to assist PR and its predecessor
organization, the former Pakistan Western Railways (PWR). The first three
loans were made in the 1950s, jointly to Eastern and Western Railways, the
latter's share amounting to about US$51.0 million. The next two loans and one
IDA credit, totalling US$57.0 million, were exclusively to PWR. These were
designed mainly to rehabilitate railway facilities and equipment. Physical
completion was satisfactory, but operations did not improve as much as had
been hoped, due in part to the transfer of control of the Railways from the
central government to the Province of West Pakistan. The latest loan (Loan
621-PAK, US$14.5 million) was made in 1969 to support part of the then PWR's
Third Five-Year Plan (1965-66 - 1969-70) and provided principally for track
renewal and line-capacity works on the main Karachi-Lahore line. Because of
the limited improvements in operational efficiency achieved under the previous
loans, this loan also provided for consulting services to assist with the
improvement of management and operations. Implementation of this project was
slow, largely due to delays in finding a suitable location for a marshalling
yard. This matter was resolved in 1974, and the yard is IIow under construction.
24.       Until about two years ago, there was continued delay in PR's intro-
ducing much needed improvements in operations and in the utilization of its
plant and equipment. As a consequence of giving operational priority to
passenger services, PR was unable to increase freight traffic and to improve
its financial position, despite the introduction of certain line improve-
ments and the acquisition of 65 new diesel locomotives in 1970/71. At the
Bank's suggestion, PR engaged consultants in 1974 to assist in implementing
measures to improve PR's over-all efficiency and in November, 1975, PR in-
troduced the grouping of mail and express passenger trains, thus enabling
through-freight trains to run more smoothly. This has resulted in encourag-
ing operational improvements, as reflected in the statistics for locomotive-
miles per day, wagon turnaround time and length of average haul and in a
reduction in the average number of passenger trains per day on the Karachi-
Rawalpindi line (see paragraph 28). Following procurement of additional
diesel locomotives in 1975/76, there was further improvement and the traffic
level reached new highs last year. Although as discussed below, major prob-
lems remain, considerable progress has recently been made in the operational
area. In restropect, however, it would have helped if at the time Loan 621-PAK
was committed, operational targets had been more clearly specified. With past
experience in mind, PR and the Bank have designed this project to assist PR
in improving its operations and finances throughout the period of project
execution.



-8-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The proposed project, to be implemented during FY78-81, was appraised
in June, 1976. The Appraisal Report (No. 1283a-PAK) on the project is being
distributed separately. A loan/credit and project summary is attached as
Annex III. At negotiations, which took place in Washington during December
1976, the Pakistan delegation was led by Mr. H. U. Beg, Secretary of the
Ministry of Railways.
Project Description
26.       Like the earlier railway projects in Pakistan, the proposed proj-
ect is designed to complete important ongoing works and to initiate selected
new ones required to meet projected increases in demand for freight and
passenger services and to contribute to the further improvement of railway
operations. Without the project, a large tonnage of bulk commodities and
some other freight and passenger traffic would be diverted to road transport
at higher ultimate cost to the economy.
27.       The proposed project consists of two main components, the physical
rehabilitation and improvement of PR's plant and equipment and the carrying
out of an Action Plan to improve railway operations and financial perfor
mance. The physical component includes about 185 miles of complete track
rehabilitation; about 70 miles of rail renewals; bridge works and civil
engineering works; completion of the Pipri marshalling yard; line capacity
work including completion of the second railway bridge at Kotri and terminal
facilities; completion of a backbone microwave route from Karachi to Rawalpindi
including related communication and signalling equipment; acquisition of mar-
shalling yard equipment; re-engining 20 overage diesel locomotives and provi-
sion of spare parts; manufacture of about 220 second/third class passenger
coaches and conversion into 800 bogie wagons of 1,600 overage four-wheeler
wagons; and the acquisition of plant and machinery together with improved
facilities for workshops, sheds and depots. This part of the project, except
for the telecommunication and related signalling scheme and the provision of
spare parts for diesel locomotives, is primarily a two-year slice of PR's
current Five-Year Investment Plan.
28.       The Action Plan would include, inter alia, rationalization of
passenger services; improvement in freight train operations; strengthening
maintenance procedures for diesel-electric locomotives; reduction in PR
staff; and other activities related to railway operations. Technical assist-
ance and staff training would be provided under the project to support the
Action Plan. Analysis of PR's operational performance reveals much scope
for improvement in passenger train operations. This will be crucial to the
release of train paths and motive power to enable PR to handle the expected
growth of freight traffic. To achieve this objective some little-patronized
passenger trains will be eliminated, while additional coaches will be added
to existing popular trains. As an initial step in this direction, PR reduced
the average number of passenger trains per day on the Karachi-Rawalpindi line



-9-
from 90 to 74 last November. Similarly, PR's freight services require im-
provement with respect to transit times, terminal operations and the transport
of major bulk commodities. Through-freight train speeds should be increased,
and this, in turn, will require improved wagon maintenance. PR should also
introduce more unit and block trains and implement measures to limit des-
tinations and loading points for commodities such as wheat, rice, cement,
fertilizer and POL.
29.       During negotiations, agreement was reached on reasonable and spe-
cific measures with respect to the improvement of passenger- and freight-
train operations. These measures should enable PR to achieve savings in the
cost of operating passenger services and, more importantly, free capacity
for handling a considerably greater volume of freight than would otherwise
be possible without additional investments. Implementation of these measures
may be difficult, but GOP is clearly committed to take the necessary action,
as set forth in the Annex to Schedule 2 of the draft Credit Agreement. Achieve-
ment of the financial targets would depend on both the success of the Action
Plan and the introduction of higher passenger fares to which GOP is also
committed.
Cost and Financing
30.       The portion of PR's Investment Plan which will form the Bank/IDA
project has a total estimated cost of US$247 million equivalent (including
taxes and duties), of which US$109 million or nearly 45% would be foreign
exchange. The cost estimates are based on December 1975 prices adjusted for
physical and price contingencies. The allowance for physical contingencies
accounts for 6% of estimated costs, while price contingencies have been
allowed at a rate of 9% in 1976 and 8% per annum during 1977-79; together
they represent about 20% of project costs (see Annex III).
31.       In addition to the proposed loan/credit of US$60 million, the Gov-
ernment is arranging other foreign assistance for the project. The prin-
cipal source of additional financing is expected to be the Kuwait Fund,
which has agreed in principle to provide substantial assistance. France,
Canada and Germany are expected to provide a total of approximately US$8 mil-
lion for various items in the project, and grants and loans are also being
negotiated with the U.K. Most of the local costs are expected to be provided
by the Government. The financing plan for the project would therefore be as
follows:
Foreign Costs         Local Costs
($ million)          ($ million)
Bank                           35.00
IDA                            25.00
Bilateral Sources              49.00                   -
GOP (including PR)               -                   138.00
109.00                 138.00

32.       Proceeds of both the Loan and the Credit would be passed on to PR
on essentially the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan, but with one
exception. In conformity with the general GOP policies with respect to
funds lent (or on-lent) to statuto-y bodies, the portion of the loan and
credit proceeds (around 60 percent) to be devoted to replacement works,
would be repaid on the same amortization and interest terms as applied to
the Bank Loan; however, with respect to the portion devoted to additional
investments (about 40 percent) PR would not be required to make amortization
payments to the Government and at the end of the notional amortization period
the loan would be converted into capital-at-charge. During the first 20 years
PR would pay interest on this sum to the Government at the Bank lending rate
(8.5 percent per annum) and thereafter would pay the prescribed dividend on
capital-at-charge (at the present time, 6.25 percent per annum).
Procurement and Disbursements
33.       All items, with the exception of spare parts for diesel locomotives,
to be financed under the loan/credit will be procured by PR through interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with World Bank Guidelines. The diesel
spare parts will be purchased from established spare parts suppliers. However,
certain critical spare parts may be purchased on the basis of quotations from
original locomotive manufacturers in consultation with the Bank/IDA. The ag-
gregate amount of diesel spares should not exceed US$5 million equivalent.
34.       Disbursements would cover 100% of the foreign expenditures for
imported items to be financed from the loan/credit. So as not to discourage
employyment of local consultants where these are available, disbursements for
technical assistance (US$500,000) will cover either 100% of foreign expendi-
tures or 70% of local expenditures. The major project items to be financed
under the loan/ credit and the amounts expected to be disbursed against each
category are: track rehabilitation, US$13.9 million; telecommunications and
signalling, US$13.8 million; motive power and rolling stock, US$14.1 million;
plant and machinery for workshops, US$3.7 million; diesel locomotive spares,
US$5.0 million; technical assistance and staff training, US$1.0 million.
Disbursements are expected to be virtually completed by June 30, 1981.
Project Organization and Management
35.       PR will be responsible for the implementation of the project.    It
will collaborate with Pakistan Telegraph and Telephone, which owns and main-
tains PR's present communications network, in carrying out the telecommunica-
tions and related signalling schemes. PR operates under the direction of a
four-member Board whose chairman reports to the Ministry of Railways. The
Board serves both as a secretariat to the Ministry and as an executive body
responsible for railway operations, exercising its power through six zonal
divisions which handle day-to-day activities.
36.       The earlier deterioration in operating performance, together with
inflation, has resulted in a worsening in PR's financial position. To improve
the position, the Government authorized three general and various selective
increases in freight rates since 1974 but only one general increase in fares



for passenger services, with the result that the general level, if not the
structure, of freight rates appears appropriate and is remunerative, whereas
most passenger services are operated at a substantial loss. In FY76 PR's
operating ratio is estimated to have been 94%. The Government has agreed that
beginning in FY78 PR should generate sufficient funds to cover all operating
expenses, including depreciation allowances calculated on the basis of revalued
assets, and debt service obligations and in subsequent years a surplus which
should rise progressively so that by FY82 it would be equivalent to the pres-
cribed dividend on PR's capital-at-charge. In addition, PR has established a
unit to carry out costing and tariff studies for restructuring rates and fares
and adopting proper user charges. These studies are expected to be completed
by December 1977, and within the following 12 months a tariff structure based
on these studies is to be implemented. A general passenger-fare increase is
to be introduced this year and subsequent fare adjustments will reflect the
revised tariff structure and the undertaking to generate the required surplus
(Credit Agreement Sections 4.04-4.05).
37.       Under the previous project, efforts were made to improve and
modernize PR's accounting methods and procedures and a number of steps in
this regard have been agreed and are now being implemented. These include
a revaluation of PR's fixed assets on or before July 1, 1977, and within one
year thereafter provision of an adequate annual depreciation charge based
upon revalued assets (Credit Agreement Section 4.03). The proposed project
includes provision for staff training in connection with the ongoing modern-
ization of PR's accounting procedures.
Project Benefits and Risks
38.       As already indicated, the primary objective of the proposed proj-
ect is to assist PR in improving its operational performance, particularly
to enable it to carry a substantially larger volume of freight traffic.
Expected improvements in PR's operations resulting from Plan investments and
concurrent organizational changes should generate economic benefits in the
form of savings in PR's operating costs and avoidance of diversion of traffic
to road transport, and make it possible for PR to carry the projected freight
and passenger traffic with significantly less new investment than would be
required in the absence of major operational improvements. The estimated
economic return on the investment as set out in the Plan is about 24%. In
addition, there should be non-quantifiable benefits resulting from savings in
passenger and freight time, reduced inventories and improvements in the re-
liability and quality of service. Should the economic cost of the Plan be
higher than estimated by 15%, the economic rate of return would drop to 20%.
If operating costs increase at 4% or 5% p.a., rather than 3% p.a. as assumed
in these calculations, the rate of return would be depressed to 18% or 13%,
respectively. The assumption of a 3% increase in operating cost depends on
PR achieving the planned operational improvements specified in the Annex to
Schedule 2 of the draft Credit Agreement; the achievement of the 24% rate of
return is therefore crucially dependent upon the successful implementation of
the Action Plan, which, in turn, is reasonable and has been discussed and
agreed with PR. There are no other significant risks which might affect the
success of the project.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 548         Tarbela Dam:  US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10, 1968;
Effective Date: August 2, 1968; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and disbursements
began in March 1975. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974,
the main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first
impoundment began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one
of the tunnels necessitated the emptying of the reservoir, in the course
of which further damage was incurred. A program of remedial works is
nearing completion. Agreement was reached with the parties to the Indus
Basin and Tarbela Development Fund Agreements whereby special contributions
were made by a number of the parties and IDA (Credit 581-PAK) to help meet
the costs of the repairs and additional remedial works. Meanwhile, the
reservoir was filled to within 20 ft. of the maximum pool level in the sum-
mer of 1975 and irrigation releases have been made through the Service and
Auxiliary Spillways. In the course of tests to the stilling basins further
damage was incurred in April 1976. Investigations of the causes of the dam-
age and a program of remedial measures are being prepared.
Loan No. 590         Development Finance Company - PICIC:   US$40.0 Million
Loan of March 21, 1969; Effective Date: May 21, 1969;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date
of March 31, 1974 was postponed first to September 30, 1975 and then to
September 30, 1976, the current date, to enable disbursements to be made
for the last sub-project. Less than $1 million remains to be disbursed.
Loan No. 621         Railways:  US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969; Effect-
ive Date: August 28, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
About 80% of the Loan has been committed, and it is anticipated
that the project will be virtually complete by June 1977. To provide for
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

reimbursement of commissioning expenses during the following year, however,
the Closing Date, formerly December 31, 1975, has been extended to June 30,
1978. The main outstanding item is construction of the first stage of a
new marshalling yard at Pipri, near Karachi. The location of this yard
was changed twice following protracted investigations and negotiations bet-
ween various agencies and planning authorities. Consultants have modified
the design of the yard for the new location, selected to reconcile urban
planning and railway marshalling objectives, and construction is underway.
While progress on improvements to the main line, which will permit removal
of speed restrictions has been rather slow, a new timetable for passenger
and goods trains was introduced in November 1975. This should help to
improve utilization of motive power and rolling stock, especially freight
wagons, eventually producing large cost savings.
Credit No. 177       Development Finance Company - IDBP:   US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Effective Date: June 25,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA funds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its lia-
bilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. The original
Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to December 31, 1977.
The Credit has been fully allocated by IDA and only $1.1 million remained
undisbursed as of August 13, 1976. The Bangladesh liabilities issue is no
longer a problem. The major problem remaining is the large arrears in IDBP's
portfolio and its consequent effect on liquidity. The liquidity problem has
been eased with Government assistance but the long-term portfolio prospects
will depend mainly on developments in the textile sector which accounts for
a large portion of IDBP's outstandings.
Credit No. 206       Engineering Education:  US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Effective Date: July 14, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
The project is now about 24 months behind schedule. The physical
facilities of the project are expected to be complete by the Closing Date
(December 1976), except for about 15% of the equipment purchases, which are
linked to the Technical Assistance program.   This program will require at
least two years extension of the Closing Date because of delayed recruitment
of experts. Progress in staff development is unsatisfactory, mainly because
of low staff salaries, but these have recently been improved. Suggestions
for improvement have been made to the Borrower. Project costs on civil works
are expected to exceed the appraisal estimates by 85% in rupee terms, but
total project costs are unlikely to exceed the appraisal estimate of US$6.3
million due to the 1972 devaluation of the rupee. Disbursement remains slow
but is expected to improve with the completion of the physical facilities.

Credit No. 213       Power Transmission and Distribution:   US$23.0 Million
Credit of August 13, 1970; Effective Date: December 11,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Since the extension of the Closing Date to June 30, 1977, project
implementation has been improving. As consultant services will terminate on
September 30, 1976, WAPDA will continue supervision of construction until the
project is completed.
Credit No. 422-PAK Third Karachi Port: US$18.0 Million Credit of July 19,
1973; Effective Date: December 14, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
Work has commenced on both the Juna Bunder shipping berths and
Napier Mole Bridge sites. Some contractor organizational and technical prob-
lems have delayed commencement of the permanent works at Juna Bunder.
Work is now due to start on the south abutment of the new bridge. Per-
manent way materials and water pipes and fittings are being supplied and
50% have been received to date. Supervisory and study arrangements are
being finalized. Over 90% of the Credit allocation has been committed and
59% of the Credit disbursed.
Credit No. 492-PAK Fourth Karachi Port: US$16.0 Million Credit of July 8,
1974; Effective Date: September 18, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The two lowest bids for construction of the oil berth were reviewed
in detail by KPT and, since the lowest bidder refused to delete numerous
conditions from the bid, an acceptable contract was negotiated with the
next lowest and signed by KPT in June 1976. The foreign exchange component
of the bid was twice that included in the appraisal estimates. Consultants
have not yet been formally appointed by KPT for preparing contract documents
for dredging works and dredger procurement. The implementation of oil berth
construction is now some 23 months behind the program prepared at the time
of appraisal. No disbursement from the Credit has been made to date.
Loan No. 961         Industrial Investment:   US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to PICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign cur-
rency liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh.
This problem has been solved. PICIC's major problem is a substantial volume
of arrears which has accummulated as a result of the difficulties of the
private sector over the last few years, particularly textiles. PICIC, in
cooperation with GOP, have undertaken a number of remedial measures and the
situation is now improving. The loan has been fully committed and disburse-
ments amounted to $15.8 million on August 13, 1976. A new loan is under
consideration.

Credit No. 466      Flood Rehabilitation:   US$35.0 Million Credit of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The general imports and civil works categories of this credit have
been fully disbursed. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1975 has been
further postponed to December 31, 1976, to permit completion of procurement
of specialized spare parts for the repair of construction and farm machinery.
Loan No. 988         Multan Fertilizer:  US$35.0 Million Loan of May 24,
1974; Effective Date: July 30, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. Work on major offsites
such as roads, railroad tracks and utilities is complete and plant construc-
tion is proceeding vigorously. Staff recruitment and training is increasing
steadily. The most likely potential problem appears to be the late delivery
of a few critical items such as heat exchangers and boilers, which could delay
startup by several months.
Credit No. 510      Third Telecommunications:   US$36.0 Million Credit of
September 12, 1974; Effective Date: October 25, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project covered by this Credit is proceeding satisfactorily
though somewhat behind schedule. Procurement action for all the main equip-
ment items is well advanced. T&T was required under Credit Agreements of
145-PAK and of 510-PAK to be reorganized to function more effectively along
commercial lines and to be given a greater degree of autonomy. This
reorganization has not yet been effected. However, a Government-appointed
Committee recently made suitable recommendations which if accepted will meet
the Association's requirements. Government approval at Cabinet level is
expected shortly.
Credit No. 546      National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC):    US$30.0
Million Credit of May 15, 1975: Effective Date: July 17,
1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
During 1975, the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC)
rapidly expanded its level of business with cumulative loan approvals total-
ling Rs 670 million and has forecast further expansion during the calendar
year 1976. To meet the new levels of business, NDFC has substantially in-
creased both its domestic currency resource position and its professional
staffing. NDFC forecast that the IDA credit will be fully allocated by mid
1977 and disbursed by December 1978. As at August 13, 1976, US$20.3 million
of the credit had been committed and US$2.5 million disbursed.

May 15, 1975; Effective Date: July 5, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Pipeline construction work is proceeding on schedule but installa-
tion of the two purification and dehydration banks will be delayed beyond
the planned date of June 1977 because of delays in preparing tender docu-
ments and evaluating bids. One of the banks should be installed by
December 1977 and contingency plans have been made for the winter season
1977/78. Costs of pipe and other equipment have been less than estimated
in the appraisal report.
Loan No. 1208T       Power Transmission:  US$50.0 Million Loan of
February 18, 1976; Effective Date: April 30, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
This loan was made effective in April 30, 1976 and engineering
consultants have been engaged.
Credit No. 620       Seed Prolect:  US$23.0 Million Credit of March 29, 1976;
Effective Date: November 29, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
This credit became effective on November 29, 1976. The project
represents the first phase in the development of a modern seed industry in
Pakistan involving research, variety release, seed multiplication, processing,
certification, storage and marketing. Commercial scale operations will cover
cotton, wheat, rice and maize with lesser quantities of pulses, oilseeds and
fodder, all totalling more than 100,000 tons of seed per annum at full pro-
duction. Pilot scale operations which include potato and vegetable seed
trials will lead to further expansion and diversification of the seed indus-
try. Consultants have been appointed to assist in project implementation
and to work with the National Seed Certification Agency, Provincial Depart-
ments of Agriculture and the Punjab and Sind Seed Corporations.

Procurement Arrangements:       All equipment financed under the loan/credit
will be procured by PR under international
competitive bidding in accordance with World
Bank Guidelines, except for certain critical
spare parts for diesel locomotives (US$5 mil-
lion). The diesel spare parts will be pur-
chased from established spare parts suppliers.
However, certain critical spare parts may be
purchased on the basis of quotations from
original locomotive manufacturers.
Technical Assistance:            The loan/credit will provide US$1 mil-
lion for technical assistance and staff
training for:
- telecommunications and related
signalling schemes; and
- other areas, including freight-
train operations, locomotive
maintenance and accounting
modernization.

PAKISTAN - TENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
SUPPLEMENTARY PROJECT DATA SHEET
Section I      Timetable of Key Events
(a) Time taken by the country to prepare the project
The project emerged from PR's on-going investment plan
ands,in particular, from the preparation of its compo-
nent of Pakistan's fifth Five-Year Plan. Project pre-
paration cannot, therefore, be meaningfully distinguished
from PR's other forward planning activities.
(b) The agency which has prepared the project
Pakistan Railways.
(c) Date of first presentation to the Bank and date of the
first mission to consider the project
The Ministry of Railways prepared a formal application
in December 1974 which was received in the Bank the
following February. In March 1975, a Bank mission to
Pakistan discussed the application.
(d) Date of departure of appraisal mission
June 1, 1976.
(e) Date of completion of negotiations
December 23, 1976.
(f) Planned date of effectiveness
About April 30, 1977.
Section II     Special Bank Implementation Actions
The Bank will collaborate closely with PR in achieving effective,
timely procurement -- particularly with respect to the spare parts and
telecommunications equipment to be financed under the Loan/Credit. The
Bank will also assist PR in identifying particular training needs and areas
in which outside technical assistance appears desirable.



ANNEX IV

Section III    Special Conditions
(a) GOP not to allow the execution of certain additional
works outside PR's Investment Plan to interfere with
implementation of the Investment Plan (paragraph 22).
(b) PR to adopt an Action Plan for the improvement of
railway operations. This Plan of Action would include,
inter alia, rationalization of passenger services;
improvement in freight-train operations; strengthening
maintenance procedures for diesel locomotives; and
reduction in PR staff (paragrap 29).
(c) PR to earn revenues sufficient to cover all operating
expenses and debt service obligation in FY78, and
thereafter to provide surpluses which by FY82 would
be equivalent to the prescribed dividend on capital-
at-charge (paragraph 36).
(d) PR to complete a revaluation of its fixed assets by
July 1, 1977, and within one year thereafter to provide
for an adequate annual depreciation charge based upon
revalued assets (paragraph 36).
