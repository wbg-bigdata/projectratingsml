MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A REGIONAL CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent
of $82.7 million to help finance a Regional Cement Industry Project. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20
years, including five years of grace. The Government would onlent $79.1 mil-
lion equivalent of the loan proceeds through the governments of Anhui
Province, Ningbo Municipality and Nanjing Municipality to the three project
companies tt an interest rate equal to 110 percent of the Bank variable rate,
vith a repayment period of 15 years, including five years of grace. The com-
mitment charge and foreign exchange risk on the on-lent proceeds would be
borne by the project companies. The balance of the loan proceeds ($3.6 mil-
lion equivalent) would be made available to four cement industry res2arch and
design institutes, and the State Administration of Building Materials Industry
(S&IMI), on terms and conditiori0 satisfactory to the Bank.
2.        Background.  China is the world's largest consumer and producer of
cement. During 1970-90, China's cement consumption grew from 25 million tons
to 204 million tons, an average annual growth rate of 11.3 percent. During
the same period, China's cement production increased from 26 million tons to
210 millions tons, against an annual average increase of 11.1 percent. Under
the Chinese Government's conservative assumption that future consumption will
grow at 3.9 percent per annum, cement consumption would reach about 320 mil-
lion tons by the year 2000.1/ During the past decade, the demand for high-
grade cement has increased dramatically as China's construction industry
shifted toward more sophisticated urban and industrial buildings. As a
consequence, China experienced chronic shortages of high-grade cement, except
in 1990 when the ongoing three-year economic austerity program resulted in
major cutbacks in capital construction. As the suspended construction work is
now being resumed and economic activity is returning to normal, the demand for
high-grade cement has been growing stronger again in recent months.
3.        China is expected to continue facing difficulties in meeting the
growing demand for high-grade cement because of several supply constraints.
They include: (i) the predominance of medium- and low-grade cement produc-
tion, which accounts for over 90 percent of toral production; (ii) the prolif-
*         eration of small-scale, inefficient cement plants, which cannot be economi-
cally converted to high-grade cement production, and the lack of investment
coordination across local jurisd-ictions; (iii) inadequate design capabilities
and the inability of the cement equipment manufacturing industry to produce
high-grade cement manufacturing equipment; and (iv) the system of cement price
_/  The assumed low growth rate of consumption is based on slower projected
economic growth, improvements in product quality, and technology improve-
ments in cement application.



- 2 -
controls, particularly for high-grade products,2/ which has depressed the
financial returns for large-scale plants and reduced the incentives for such
investmonts. Shortages of high-grade cement are expected to be particularly
acute in the Shanghai Economic Region (SER),3/ where industrialization and
urbanization have 'oeen progressing at a much faster pace than in the rest of
China.
4.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  Since 1982, the Bank
has been active in China's industrial sector through some 14 lending opera-
tions. These include DFC operations, the fertilizer industry, machine tools,
the pharmaceutical sector, light industry development, and development of
China's dynamic non-state enterprises. The implementation record generally
has been satisfactory, in particular with regard to the physical componeI;ts,
although implementation of some projects was affected by economic austerity
measures initiated after 1989. More important has been the Chinese authori-
ties' resolve at improved efficiency in the industrial sector via the adoption
of substantial sector reforms. This, concomitant with the pursuit of more
market-oriented macroeconomic reform policies, has led to an enhanced emphasis
in Bank operations on enterprise reform and subsector-wide restructuring,
rationalization of sector development strategies, trade reform, structured
technology policies, and creation of an environment conducive for sound finan-
cial sector development. The status of the ongoing policy dialogue with the
Chinese authorities on enterprise reform is reflected in the design of this
proposed project where, among other significant features, two of the three
beneficiary enterprises have been officially desig-Rted as pilot enterprises
for experimentation with the "joint stock" company system, one of the most
important elements of the current phase of enterprise reform.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's main role in the cement
industry in China is to support implementation of the Government's strategy
for the sector. Its overall strategy during the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year
Plans (1986-95) is considered sound and centers on: (i) building large-scale
plants which will produce high-grade and special cement, using up-to-date
technologies; (ii) modernizing existing medium-scale cement plants via the
modern dry process to upgrade their products and improve production effi-
ciency; (iii) gradually transforming the technical capacity of selected small
plants; (iv) phasing out most mini plants with capacities below 20,000 tons
per year; (v) improving cooperation across jurirdictions to achieve scale
economies in production; (vi) improving the capabilities for research, design,
and manufacturing of cement-related equipment, processes, and facilities; and
(vii) experimenting with further price liberalization of cement. The Bank has
already helped the Government in identifying the major issues and constraints
2/   In 1989/90, about 74 percent of high-grade cement was sold at controlled
prices under the state allocation plan.
At   The Shanghai Economic Region consists of Shanghai Municipality and the
Provinces oE Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi. The Region
accounted for 25 percent of the country's total cement consumption in
1987.



in implementing this strategy for the sector through two studies AI carTried
out at GOC's request in 1984-85. Further Bank assistance is aimed at provid-
ing financial and technical resources to implement key aspects of this strat-
egy. The project would provide a model for the design and construction of
large-scale plants based on cross-provincial/municipal cooperation and would
introduce for the first time in China a system for bulk transport of cement by
river. It would also provide a model for upgrading medium-scale manufacturing
facilities as well as support for key subsector design and research insti-
tutes. In addition, a study to be carried out under the project would inves-
tigate possible measures to optimize small cement plants.
6.        The project would also be used as a vehicle to help GOC experiment
with the "joint stock" ownership system for major Government-sponsored invest-
ments, an important step in the GOC's enterprise reform program. Under the
ongoing economic reforms, specific enterprise reform measures undertaken by
the Chinese government to improve the efficiencj of enterprises include a
system of contract management responsibility, wage incentives for workers, and
higher profit retention by enterprises. While these measures have enabled the
state-owned enterprises to expand their scope for making operation-related
decisions, their management autonomy is still constrained, largely due to
various regulations and interventions by supervisory government agencies,
which in turn provide disincentives for these enterprises to improve their
efficiency. Main topics on the agenda for further enterprise reforms being
considered by the Government include, inter alia, alternative forms of enter-
prise ownership, and the introduction and implementation of company and bank-
ruptcy legislation. In particular, the Chinese government has been actively
investigating theoretical and practical issues relating to adapting a share-
holding system to the state enterprises in recent years, and is launching
controlled "joint stock" experiments at selected locations. Two of the proj-
ect companies have been designated officially by the *..ate Reform Commission
as pilot enterprises for experimenting with main features of the "Joint stock
system" for state enterprises, which include a structure of ownership shared
by state and local investment companies, establishment of board of directors
for major corporate decisions, and sharing of profits in the form of divi-
dends. The project companies would experiment with additional features of the
joint stock system, such as issuance and trading of shares to institutional
and individual investors in the organized stock exchange, when such activity
becomes legally and practically feasible. This approach would, as a result of
a more rational capital and management structure, serve to promote greater
enterprise autonomy and accouftability, and serve as a model for broader
application.
7.        Proiect Obiectives.  Specifically, the project would support the
Chinese cement industry through: (i) implementation of a regional cement
production and distribution scheme that would include state-of-the-art large-
scale cement production facilities, together with the first integrated cross-
provincial bulk shipping and distribution network in China; (ii) model reha-
bilitation of a medium-size plant, designed to improve energy efficiency and
product quality; (iii) strengthening of the capabilities of four major cement

Sector Study (Report No. 6551-CHA).

industry institutes for plant design and related research; (iv) a study to
examine measures to improve operational efficiency, product quality and
pollution control in small plants; and (v) promotion of reform of the cement
pricing system through the sale of thp entire output of project facilities at
market prices.
8.        Proiect Description.  The project would consist of three components.
(i) The Tongltng cement vroduction and distribution component would involve
installation of a cement plant with a clinker capacity of 1.2 million tons per
year (tpy), a cement grinding capacity to produce 690,000 tpy of high-grade
cement at Tongling (Anhui), and a 600,000 tpy clinker grinding capacity (equi-
valant to 690,000 tpy of cement) at Ningbo (Zhejiang). The river bulk cement
transport systam, which would include a bulk cement and clinker loading ter-
minal at Tongling and a clinker receiving terminal at Ningbo, both of which
would be carried out under the project, would also comprise two bulk cement
receiving terminals at Nantong (Jiangsu) and Wenzhou (Zhejiang), respectively,
and required bulk carriers to complement the distribution network for
Tongling's output. (ii) The Zhongguo cement plant rehabilitation component
would support the first phase of rehabilitation of a medium-scale cement plant
at Nanjing (Jiangsu), to replace two outdated wet-process production lines by
a 640,000 tpy modern dry-process line, to improve production efficiency and
product quality. (iii) The technical assistance component would consist of
financial and technical suoport for fou- national cement industry research and
design institutes, and a study to improve the efficiency and pollution control
of small-stale cement plants.
9.         'rolect Implementation.  The proposed project would be carried out
by the b   ficiary companies--Anhui Tongling Cement Company (ATCC), Ningbo
Cement CoL any (NCC), and Zhongguo Cement Company (ZCC)--and SABMI. The proj-
ect cost is estimated at $244.9 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of $74.0 million (30.2 percent). Imported equipment and materials
would b_; exempt from duties. The total financing required, including interest
during construction, is $265.1 million, of which the Bank would finance $82.7
million equiralent (100 percent of the foreign exchange and 31.2 percent of
the total). To avoid delays in project implementation, the Bank loan would
retroactively finance up to $500,000 of eligible expenditures for interna-
tional travel for technical surveys incurred between October 31, 1991 and the
date of loan signing. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map of China's large and medium cement
plants is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8260-CHA, dated
February 11, 1992, is being distributed separately.
10.       Prolect Sustainability.  The technical design of the project empha-
sizes scale optimization for the modern large scale plants, and maximum oper-
ating efficiency for the smaller plants. Detailed demand analysis and projec-
tions as well as confirmed marketing arrangements indicate that the cement
produced under the project will be easily absorbed by the marketplace. The
promotion of expanded free market based pricing arrangements is a key element,
and will further assure the financial viability of the beneficiary enter-
prises. Under the project, large discretionary powers and autonomy are con-



ferred to enterprise management. The project thus includes a technical assis-
tance and training component in support of this objective. Particular atten-
tion has been paid during project preparation to assure environmental sustain-
ability cf the project investments.
11.      aMreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the following major
actions: (i) allow the output of project facilities to be marketed directly
by the project companies (ATCC, NCC, and ZCC), based on free market pricing;
(ii) ensure that the construction of the two bulk cement receiving terminals
at Nantong and Wenzhou and the necessary clinker and bulk carriers, is com-
pleted by December 31, 1994; and (iii) maintain a Project Coordination Group
during project implementation. The three project companies have agreed to
take a set of project-related actions, the more important of which are to:
(a) build and operate the project plants with due regard for safety, ecologi-
cal and environmental factors and in accordance with environmental standards
satisfactory to the Bank; (b) maintain long-term debt to equity ratios of
75:25 or better; (c) maintain current ratios of at least 1.2; (d) maintain
debt service coverage ratios of at least 1.2; and (e) inform the Bank promptly
of any changes in their charters, joint venture agreement, or management
structure (ATCC and NCC only). The conditions of loan effectiveness are:
(i) signing of contracts for the sale and transport of ATCC's output; and
(ii) signing of subsidiary loan agreements between GOC and the Anhui Provin-
cial Government (APG), GOC and Ningbo Municipal Government (NBMG), GOC and
Nanjing Municipal Government (NJMG), APG and ATCC, NBMG and NCC, and NJMG and
ZCC on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
12.       Environmental Aspects.  The significant environmental impacts of the
proposed cement plants stem mainly from: (i) the limestone quarries; (ii)
construction; and (iii) the operation of the plants. The project addresses
comprehensively issues of occupational and environmental safety in the design,
location, construction, aud operations of the proposed cement plants. Appro-
priate environmental protection measures for dust, air quality, flue gas emis-
sions and water pollution have been incorporated for each project component.
The project will include training of local staff in modern environmental pro-
tection skills to ensure the quality of future environmental management. The
beneficiaries have agreed to institute environmental management and monitoring
programs with standards satisfactory to the Bank. In addition to the environ-
mental issues outlined in the EAs and SAR documentation, such programs will
cover, inter alia: ground-water resource management at the quarries; waste
water monitoring; health monitoring; and agricultural soils monitoring. The
Environmental Assessment Summary, dated January 27, 1992, has been distributed
separately.
13.       Proiect Benefits.  The quantifiable benefits of the project derive
from:  (i) the high-grade cement production from the new facilities to be
established (the Tongling component); (ii) increased high-grade cement produc-
tion from the capacity expansion of a.. existing operation (the Zhongguo compo-
nent); and (iii) improved economic efficiency of production through the reha-
bilitation of inefficient facilities (the Zhongguo component). The economic
rate of return for th. two investment components is estimated at 18 percent.
In addition, these components would serve as models for optimizing future
subsector investments and promoting interregional cooperation and market inte-
gration. The "Joint stock" system, apart from the economy-wide benefit



- 6 -
expected in the longer term, would also provide a good example of mobilizing
resources across administrative boundaries to support large, optimal invest-
ments. Application of strict environmental standards for the new large
plants, and environmental improvements for the existing Zhongguo plants, would
also be a model for similar investments. The economic benefits from the tech-
nical assistance component, although unquantifiable, would be large and would
affect the entire sector.
14.       Risks.  Given the chronic and projected deficit of high-grade cement
in the SER and elsewhere in China, shortfalls in future projected demand for
project output are not perceived as a risk, even with the current cutbacks in
capital construction resulting from the Government's ongoing austerity
program. The main technical risk for the Tongling component is the need for
cross-provincial coordination of plant construction and operations, and the
transport of the project output after start-up. This risk has been minimized
by contracts designed to ensure timely installation of production and related
facilities, the market diversification of output to several cities, and flexi-
bility at the bulk-handling facilities of the receiving terminals. Further, a
delay in the construction of any one bulk cement terminal could be absorbed by
consumers within Anhui Province where the cement plant will be located.
Another technical risk for both the Tongling and Zhongguo components is the
lack of Chinese experience with the plant design associated with these invest-
ments. This risk would be reduced by the design of procurement packages,
where the contracte- will be responsible for process and detailed design,
supply of equipment, supervision of erection and overall performance warran-
ties for equipment and process performance.
15.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
