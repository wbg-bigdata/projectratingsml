REGIONAL CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Bogrowert              The People's Republic of China
Beneficiaries:         Anhui Tongling Cement Company (ATCC, Anhui Province);
Ningbo Cement Company (NCC, Ningbo Municipality);
Zhongguo Cement Company (ZCC, Nanjing Municipality);
and State Administration of Building Materials Industry
(SABMI).
Amount:                 $82.7 million equivalent
Terms:                 20-year repayment, including five years of grace, at
the standard variable interest rate
Proiect Objectives:    The project would help China achieve its goals for the
cement sector, which are to: (i) expand cement produc-
tion capacities based on economically viable technol-
ogies and scales; (ii) improve product quality and pro-
duction efficiency of existing cement plants in accor-
dance with the country's increasing demand for high-
grade cement; (iii) strengthen domestic capabilities
for research and design in the cement industry; and
(iv) address the issue of economic inefficiency and
po'llution relating to a majority of the country's small
cement plants. In addition, the project would help
China develop and experiment with, for major govern-
ment-sponsored investments, the "joint-stock" ownership
system, a new ownership structure emerging in China
under the ongoing economic reforms.
Project Descrintion:   Consistent with the above goals, the project would con-
sist of three components: (i) Tongling cement produc-
tion and distribution component; (ii) Zhongguo cement
plant rehabilitation component; and (iii) the technical
assistance component.  The Tongling component would
implement a regional cement production and distribution
scheme, which involves installation of a cement plant
at Tongling in Arnkui Province, with a capacity of 1.2
million tons per year (tpy) of clinker and with a
grinding capacity to produce 690,000 tpy of high-grade
cement, and construction of a 600,000 tpy clinker
grinding capacity at Ningbo in Zhejiang Province to
process clinker to be shipped from Tongling. This com-
ponent would be supported by a river and coastal bulk
transport system, the first interprovincial bulk cement
transportation and distribution network in the country,
which would include a loading terminal at Tongling,
bulk carriers, a clinker receiving terminal at Ningbo

(Zhejiang), and bulk cement receiving terminals at
Nantong (Jiangsu) and Wenzhou (Zhejiang). The Zhongguo
component involveq replac4ng wet-process cement produc-
tion units (with a 150,000 tpy capacity) by a 640,000
tpy cement dry-process cement unit in order to improve
production efficiency and product quality and to expand
production capacity of an existing medium-scale cement
plant. The technical assistance component provides
financial and technical support to strengthen four
cement industry research and design institutes and a
study to improve the efficiency and emissions of small-
scale cement plants.
Pro1ect Benefit:       The quantifiable benefits of the project come mainly
from the expanded production of high-grade cement and
improved production efficiency of an existing plant.
In addition to quantifiable benefits, the investment
components of the project would have a significant
impact on future cement plants by providing models for
optimization of such investments. Hitherto, the lack
of interprovincial cooperation in China has contributed
to the prevalence of suboptimal size plants based on
segmented markets. The benefits from the technical
assistance component, although unquantifiable, would be
significant and sector-wide.
Prolect Risks:         Given the chronic deficit of high-grade cement in the
Shanghai Economic Region and elsewhere in the country,
shortfalls in the projected demand for the output of
this project are not perceived as a risk. The sensi-
tivity test of economic analysis indicates a satisfac-
tory economic rate of return for the project even with
the assumption that the entire output of the project
will have to be exported. A major risk for the
Tongling component is the need for cross-provincial
coordination of plant operations and transport after
start-up. This risk would be minimized by contractual
arrangements to ensure the timely installation of
related facilities, offtake and shipping of project
output, market diversification of the receiving cities,
and flexibility in terms of the bulk-handling capacity
of the receiving terminals. Another technical risk for
both the Tongling and Zhongguo components is the lack
of Chinese experience with these plant designs. This
risk has been reduced by the use of internationally
experienced consultants in the basic design of the
project facilities and the preparation of technical
specifications for the procurement packages of major
processes and equipment, and by placing single party
responsibility for performance in the process areas.

CHINA
REGIONAL CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Government of the People's Republic of China (the Government,
GOC) has requested a Bank loan of $82.7 million equivalent to finance a
Regional Cement Industry Project. The project is the first Bank operation in
the Chinese cement sector, a sector characterized by low quality products, low
production efficiency, and suboptimal production facilities. The project aims
to help China implement its strategy for the cement sector by providing sup-
port for: (i) the definition of an optimal model for the large-scale produc-
tion of high-g.--de cement  J1 based on an economically viable technology and
scale, a related bulk transportation system on the Yangtze River, and success-
ful u.egotiations among the various jurisdictions in the Shanghai Economic
Region (SER) for pooling the currently segmented cement markets; (ii) rehabil-
itation of a medium-sized cement plant; (iii) strengthening of local capabili-
ties for research, technology development, and the design of plant and eq.ip-
ment at four of the country's cement industry research and design institutes;
and (iv) the investigation of measures to improve production efficiency, prod-
uct quality and pollutant emissions in small-scale cement plants. In addi-
tion, the project would help China experiment with the "joint-stock" ownership
system for major Government-sponsored large investments. Two experimental
shareholding companies would be established to implement the major (Tongling)
component of the project.
1.2       The Tongling component represents a major innovation in interprovin-
cial cooperation for large-scale investments. In the past, provincially-spon-
sored projects have often resulted in suboptimal scale investments, the result
of an excessive preoccupation with self-sufficiency and local funding con-
straints. The GOC, with assistance from the Bank, designed this project com-
ponent to include the cooperation of several provincial and municipal juris-
dictions: the Anhui Provincial Government (APG); the Ningbo Municipal Govern-
ment (NBMG); the Nantong Municipal Government (NTMG); and the Wenzhou City
Government (WCG).  Their agreements on the provision of investment funds,
sharing and pricing of output, transportation of products, and other related
issues have resulted in an economically and institutionally viable project
component that should be a model which can be replicated in the cement and
other industrial subsectors.
1.3       The project was first identified as a result of the Bank's sector
work on the cement and cement manufacturing industries in 1985. The appraisal
was completed in October 1989. The project was postappraised in February
1991.

which would cover 31 percent of the total financing required and 100 percent
of the total foreifn exchange financing required.
II. AN OVERVIEW OF INDUSTRY IN CHINA
A. Background
2.1       Industry is China's largest productive sector, accounting for nearly
46 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 1989 and employing 17 per-
cent of the country's total labor force. About 99,000 state-owned enterprises
generate 56 percent of total industrial cutput; the remainder is produced by
more than 1.7 million nonstate enterprises--primarily urban and rural collec-
tives, and township and village enterprises (TVEs). the state enterprises
concentrate mainly on important raw materials, capital goods, and strategic
commodities such as fertilizers, while nonstate enterprises mainly produce
downstream consumer products. Gross industrial output, which amounted to
Y 2,201.7 billion ($584.8 billion) in 1989, is shared almost equally by light
and heavy industries. The gross value of industrial production increased
rapidly between 1978 and 1989, at about 12.5 percent a year in real terms.
During this period, light industry registered a much faster average annual
growth rate (14.5 percent) than did heavy industry (10.9 percent). Chinese
manufactured exports have also grown rapidly from around $8 billion in 1980 to
about $37.5 billion in 1989.
2.2       China's industrial development has been constrained by several
structural deficiencies that stemmed mainly from rigid economic planning and
past industrial strategies oriented towards self-sufficiency at the national
and regional levels. The most obvious deficiencies pertain to outdated tech-
nologies, institutional rigidities deriving in part from quota and price con-
trols, a distorted structure of prices, inadequate infrastructure, and an
underdeveloped financial sector. These problems are reflected in the low
productivity of labor and low efficiency of resource use in Chinese plants.
The structure of industry also is skewed toward basic, heavy industry. The
emphasis on self-sufficiency at the regional level has led to a fragmented
national market, reduced domestic competition, and the suboptimal use of
scarce skills and resources. As a result, potential gains from economies of
scale are often missed. Institutional inflexibility, compounded by inadequate
market integration, has provided little incentive for industrial enterprises
to improve managerial efficiency and product quality. The low prices of
energy and basic intermediates for industrial production also contribute to
the inefficient use of inputs. Investments in infrastructure, particularly
for transportation and telecommunications, have lagged behind those in indus-
try. This disparity has in turn been a major constraint on industrial devel-
opment. The financial markets are still in their infancy and until recently
only provided limited intermediation services for enterprises.
B. Industrial Development Strategv
2.3       Since 1979, the Chinese Government has shifted the focus of indus-
trial development toward light industry and, as part of the ongoing economic



- 3 -
reforms, has introduced incentives and market forces to impreve economic effi-
ciency. The development strategy has emphasized modernizing existing equip-
ment, developing manufactured exports and more efficient light industry, and
conserving material and energy resources in industry. The reforms have
focused mainly on four areas: (i) prices--expansion of the role of market
forces in price determination; (ii) enterprises--strengthening of enterprise
autonomy and management accountability; (iii) trade--promotion of exports to
earn foreign exchange to finance the importation of modern technology and
equipment; and (iv) financial sector--enhancement of the scope and efficiency
of financial intermediation. However, given little international precedent or
experience in successful transition from centralized planning to an effective
integration of plan and market, these reforms will continue to be a difficult
and cautious process, involving experimentation and repeated fine-tuning.
2.4       The price reforms are designed to reduce gradually the distortions
that cause allocative economic inefficiency, particularly by reducing the
scope for allocation of resources under mandatory planning and by allowing
market forces to play a greater role in price determination. At present, a
two-tier pricing system exists as a result of differences between the con-
trolled prices for quota production under the state allocation plan and mar-
ket-related prices for output above plan targets. Since the start of the
economic reforms, the Government has allowed a growing portion of industrial
products to be sold at market prices outside the plan, and it has considerably
raised the price of major industrial inputs, including energy. While the
current transitory system is a significant tmprovement over the strict price
control of the past, significant distortions in relative prices and large gaps
between cortrolled and market prices have a number of shortcomings: reduced
allocative efficiency, discrimination across producers and consumers. adminis-
trative complexity, and creation of opportunities for corrupt practice and
other distortions. The Government's strategy is to continue reducing its
administrative control over pricing in parallel with gradual dismantling of
annual production planning and allocation.
2.5       Rapid increases in free market prices and costs of urban living in
1989 slowed the pace of price reforms in recent years. After the announcement
of major price reforms in May 1988, urban consumer prices, having risen by
15 percent in the first two quarters of that year, soared at an annual rate of
over 60 percent in the third quarter. These developments forced the GOC to
rescind the proposed price reforms and initiate a major stabilization (auster-
ity) program. Despite the ongoing three-year austerity program, which could
have implied a significant retreat to strong price controls over some strate-
gic commodities, however, price reform has been a firm part of the Govern-
ment's reform agenda. Major adjustments of controlled prices for agricultural
commodities (soybean, grain, cotton, edible oils, energy inputs, coal, crude
oil and power) and transport (freight and passenger transport) were made dur-
ing 1990/91. Further price adjustments are planned for 1992. These adjust-
ments are expected to create a more favorable environment for further price
reform, including a gradual decontrol of prices and continued enlargement of
the share of total output allocated by markets.
2.6       Reforms have been introduced in the management arrangements and
ownership structure of enterprises with a view to improving the efficiency of
enterprises. The central theme of these reforms has been the decentralization



- 4 -
of economic decision-making, from the government to enterprises and from
higher government tiers to lower ones. Enterprises, whose main function had
been to carry out production mandates from the government before the reforms,
have thus been provided various incentives to operate with greater autonomy in
a more competitive business environment. As a consequence of these reforms,
Chinese enterprises have now become diverse in terms of ownership, size, and
organizational and management arrangements. Many small state enterprises have
been converted to collective enterprises, and new rural collective enter-
prises, operated by TVEs, have proliterated in areas close to major cities.
The scope for privately-owned enterprises was expanded greatly by new regula-
tions in 1988, which eliminated ceilings on the number of employees, and
expanded the lines of business they can enter. New hybrid forms of enter-
prises based on domestic joint ventures among different bureaucratic jurisdic-
tions have also emerged, as a means of dealing with inter-regional trade and
investment barriers. As for the management arrangements of state enterprises,
significant changes have also been made in the degree of enterprise control
over their assets and profits. The state enterprise reforms introduced, among
other things, a system of contract management responsibility, a uniform tax
rate (55 percent) for many large enterprises, wage incentives for workers, and
higher profit retention by enterprises.
2.7       The economic environment over the next several years is expected to
be conducive to continued experiments with enterprise reforms. Such refotms,
however, will continue to be gradual and cautious; the step-by-step process
which has characterized China's successful reform efforts to date is likely to
continue. Main topics on the agenda include modification (in some cases,
phasing out) of the management contracting system for state enterprises,
introduction of a system of uniform taxation- alternative forms of enterprise
ownership, separation of social (security) functions from commercial enter-
prises, and the introduction and application of compary and bankruptcy legis-
lation. In particular, the Chinese government has in recent years been
actively investigating theoretical and practical issues related to adapting a
shareholding system to Chinese state enterprises, and is launching controlled
"Joint stock" experiments at selected locations. In this connection, an
important change in the state investment system was initiated in early 1989
through the creation of state and local investment companies, which can pro-
vide equity-type funding for state enterprises. Uitil the recent past, all
state-sponsored investments for state enterprises had been wholly debt-
financed.2/
2.8       Against this background, the Government has designated two of the
project companies as pilot enterprises for experimenting with the main fea-
tures of the "joint stock" system. This experiment will include, inter alia:
ownership sharing by state and local investment companies, establishuent of
board of directors for major corporate decisions, and sharing of profits in
the form of dividends among investors (paras. 2.15, 5.5 and 5.8). The Govern-
ment intends to allow these companies to experiment with additional features
2/ This practice was an improvement over the preceding one of total grant
financing. However, total debt financing of newly formed companies fur-
ther complicated the ambiguity of enterprise ownership, and was also in
conflict with a norm of prudent financial management.



- 5 -
of the "Joint stock" system such as divestiture of ownership by institutional
and individual investors in the organized stock exchange when such experimen-
tation becomes feasible.
2.9       Trade reform measures have been limiled, and larger scale reforL  to
break up the state export and import monopolies and improve the foreign
exchange allocation system have yet to take place. As a result of the limited
decentralization of export responsibilities in the 19809, several thousand
Chinese enterprises now have the right to trade directly with foreign firms.
There has been a concern that this rapid granting of export rights, without
sufficient regulation and institutional support for enterprises to adhere to
quality and delivery standards, may have crested negative impressions in over-
seas markets. GOC is fully aware of these problems, and has slowed the
authorizations of direct trading, although its commitment to the "open-door"
policy initiated in 1979 has not changed. The availability of foreign
exchange to non-exporting enterprises has improved somewhat with the creation
of the foreign exchange adjustment centers. While the operations of these
centers are still limited in size, they have been growing rapidly, particu-
larly in the recent past.
2.10      The major financial sector reforms include:  (i) formal establish-
ment of the People's Bank of China (PBC) as the country's central bank;
(ii) divestiture of PBC's c omercial banking functions to independent special-
ized banks; (iii) creation of a few new banks and nonbank financial institu-
tions for various financial services; (iv) introduction of new financial
instruments and establishment of related financial markets; and (v) a gradual
rise in interest rates to stimulate economic use of capital and to promote
domestic resource mobilization. These reforms have led to considerable finan-
cial deepening despite some setbacks in the recent period of high inflation:
the ratiL of the size of monetary assets (M2) to gross national product
increased from 37 percent in 1979 to 75 percent in 1987, and the figure for
1990 was 88 percent. Notwithstanding these advances, weaknesses remain. The
system remains overwhelmingly dominated by banks, in particular, the four
specialized banks. Financial institutions have still to undergo substantial
institutional upgrading to function as effective intermediaries. There has
been a trend in the banking system of increasing portfolio arrears which needs
to be arrested. Regulation and supervision of the financial system needs
considerable strengthening as do the accounting and legal frameworks. Recent
government efforts to finance investment in priority sectors through directed
credit and selective interest rates need to be reviewed. While recent reli-
ance on administrative mechanisms has enabled the government to regain control
of inflation, in the longer term, PEC needs to develop its indirect monetary
policy tools.
C. Bank SuDport to Industrv
2.11      The Bank's objectives in supporting China's industrial development
are to assist the Government in: (i) improving the policy framework for the
industrial sector as a whole; (ii) building sound institutions and practices
for subsector planning, project approval and implementation, and financial
intermediation; (iii) promoting and implementing technology upgrading, plant
restructuring and rehabilitation, and energy and material resource conserva-
tion in selected sectors at the national and provincial levels; and



-6-
(iv) carrying out various reforms, particularly in the enterprise and finan-
cial systems. As the Bank's relationship with China has deepened, lending and
sector work has increasingly concentrated on the articulation and design of
the specific policies, institutions and procedures, which are integral parts
of the reform effort.
2.12      The Bank Group's lending to the industrial sector in China, which
began in December 1982, comprises the following: (i) five loans/credits
totalling $945.6 million to the China Investment Bank (CIB) 3/ to develop it
as a premier financial intermediary providing term financing for small- and
medium-sized enterprises in a wide range of industrial subsectors; (ii) four
loans/credits totalling $394.3 million to the fertilizer industry 4; to sup-
port the b4ilding of new fertilizer plants, development of new phosphate
mines, revamping of plants, and strengthening of the institutional infrastruc-
ture; (iii) a loan of $100 million for the Shanghai Machine Tool project (Ln.
2784-CHA) in FY87, involving rehabilitation and modernization of the machine
tool subsector in Shanghai; (iv) a loan of $128 million for the Pharmaceuti-
cals Project (Ln. 2934-CHA) in FY88 to support the expansion of pharmaceutical
production using modern technologies and proper manufacturing practices; (v) a
loan of $154 million for the Tianjin Light Industry Project (Ln. 3022-CHA) in               |
FY89 to support the restructuring of textile dyeing and finishing, pulp and
paper manufacturing, and packaging subsectors; (vi) a $20 million industry
component of the Gansu Provincial Project (Ln/Cr. 2812/1793-CHA) in FY87 to be
used for modernization of the rural industry base; (vii) a loan of $50.0 mil-
lion and a credit of SDR45.1 million ($64.3 million equivalent) for the Rural
Industrial Technology (Spark) Project (Ln/Cr. 3274/2186-CHA) to support the
upgrading of standards and technology for the dynamic TVEs, China's rapidly
growing nonstate enterprises; and (viii) a loan of $150 million for the
Shanghai Industrial Development Project (Ln. 3288-CHA) in FY91 to support
restructuring and development programs in four industrial subsectors--elec-
trical apparatus, printing machinery, scientific precision instruments, and
electronic components. In addition, the Planning, Support and Special Studies
Project (Cr. 1835-CHA), approved in FY87, includes components for long-term
planning and strategic studies in several industrial subsectors.
2.13      Physical implementation of most of the investment projects had pro-
ceeded generally on schedule until the initiation of the economic austerity
program in late 1989, when related local funding shortages began resulting in
delays in the implementation of several Bank-financed projects. In recent
months, however, the implementing agencies have been taking steps to expedite
project implementation to catch up with the original schedule. GOC has given
assurances that the necessary funds would be made available for Bank-financed
projects. Disbursements of the above loans/credits, after some delays during
3/ The five CIB loans/credits are: Ln/Cr. 2226/1313-CHA in FY83; Ln/Cr.
2434/1491-CHA in FY84; Ln/Cr. 2659/1663-CHA in FY86; Ln/Cr. 2783/1763-CHA
in FY87; and Ln. 3075-CHA in FY89.
4/   The four fertilizer loans are:  Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy
Saving Project (Ln. 2541-CHA) in FY85; Fertilizer Rationalization Project
(Ln. 2838-CHA) in FY87; Phosphate Development Project (Ln. 2958-CHA) in
FY88; and Hubei Phosphate Project (Ln. 3066-CHA) in FY89.



the past two years, have returned to a satisfactory level. Project Completion
Reports (PCRs) have been prepared for the first three CIB loan/credits, and a
PCR is currently being prepared for the Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy
Saving Project.
2.14      The Bank's proposed future lending program in industry and finance
includes: (i) support for selected major industrial subsectors--chemicals,
fertilizers, manufacturing, electronics, building materials, etc.--at the
national and provincial levels, within the framework of a defined sectoral
strategies including broad-based restructuring; (ii) assistance to enterprises
in undertaking key investment projetts in important industrial subsectors; and
(iii) support for developing the infrastructure for sound financial sector
development, and for consolidating the central banking function of PBC, and
further support for CIB and other financial intermediaries in the context of
the overall financial sector reform. The increasing devolution of responsi-
bility for planning and implementation from the center to the provinces has
expanded the role of provincial authorities in industrial development. While
the central government rightly recentralized control of monetary policy as
part of the austerity program, there is little practical evidence of a rever-
sal in the overall trend. These developments in turn call for formulating a
coherent national strategy for key industrial subsectors and a consistent set
of investment priorities to be used as guides for provincial policies. The
anticipated series of provincial and subsector operations is designed to help
the central authorities and selected provinces articulate and implement their
new responsibilities.
2.15      The reform measures introduced in recent years have created new
opportunities for the Bank to help China in identifying and discussing reform-
related issues and experimenting with new systems. For example, the Bank has
produced several economic and sector studies on key reform issues; workshops
and symposiums on enterprise and related reform issues have been jointly spon-
sored by the Bank and the Government. Importantly, this project would create
two companies based on experimental joint stock ownership, the first such
arrangement for new state-sponsored investments designated officially by the
System Reform Commission (SRC), who would provide a model for future invest-
ments for medium- and large-scale state-owned enterprises (paras. 2.8, 5.5 and
5.8). The historical background, contents, and key issues of enterprise
reforms, together with related Bank role and contributions, are detailed in
Annex 1.1.
2.16      The International Finance Corporation's (IFC's) support for the
industrial sector has been limited mainly because, with only a few exceptions,
joint ventures have to earn their own foreign exchange to service foreign
exchange obligations. This provision has made it difficult for IPC to support
import-substituting joint ventures even though most potential partners in
China are interested in the domestic market. Since its first operation in
1985, IFC has provided a total of $43.0 million to China, all of it to the
industrial sector (equity participation of $3.0 million and loans of
$40.0 million). Its five investments include: (i) Guangzhou and Peugeot
Automobile Co., Ltd. (Investment No. 813, FY85); (ii) China Investment Co.,
Ltd. (Investment No. 974, FY87); (iii) Shenzhen China Bicycles Co., Ltd. (In-
vestment No. 1020, FY87); (iv) Shenzhen Crown Electronics Co., Ltd. (Invest-



- 8 -
ment No. 1066, FY88); and (v) Shenzhen Chronar Solar Energy Co., Ltd. (Invest-
ment No. 119, FY89).
2.17      Related to the above, the Bank Group has engaged in a dialogue with
the Government on the need to change the foreign exchange allocation and man-
agement system. The current system distorts investments and discourages
important import-substitution projects. The foreign exchange adjustment cen-
ters, established in recent years in select trade cities and provinces and
playing an increasingly important role (see para. 2.9), have the potential for
alleviating th±a constraint to a large extent.
2.18      In addition to Bank lending and IFC operations, the Bank's programs
for economic and sector work in industry and finance have provided the basis
for an active policy dialogue with the Government. Major topics for which
studies have been completed include state enterprise management and ownership
reforms, finance and investment, tax reform, industrial policies and struc-
tural changes, external trade and capital, tax reform, and phosphate subsector
planning. Ongoing and future studies will continue to address such areas as
enterprise and financial sector reforms, industrial policies and restructuring
for several subsectors (including electronics, machine building, and process
equipment manufacturing). This work is increasingly being carried out jointly
with Chinese agencies.
III. THE CHINESE CEMENT INDUSTRY
A. Status of the Cement Industry
3.1       China is the largest producer and consumer of cement in the world.
(See Annex 3.1 for information on the world cement market.) Cement is the
single most important product in the building materials industry in China.5/
In 1989, it generated 28 percent of the value of all building materials pro-
duced in China and employed one million workers.
3.2       The Chinese cement industry has undergone five distinct stages of
development. It remained underdeveloped and relatively insignificant until
1949, when about 30 plants produced 0.7 million tons of output. Then, during
the 1950s, the indistry expanded rapidly as a result of GOC's emphasis on
building materials to promote economic and social development. Several new
medium-sized plants and many small ones were constructed, using East European
technology and equipment. Between 1958 and 1961, the period of the "Great
Leap Forward," more than 41,000 very small indigenous and backyard kilns were
erected. However, they produced largely unusable products, and only 234 are
operating today. During the 1960s and 1970s, a large number of small plants
based on more adaptive local designs were built to serve China's vast rural
areas. Under the economic reforms that began in 1978, several large plants
have been established, and many of the small plants have been expanded to

which are categorized into cement, glass, ceramic sanitary wares, bricks,
tiles, gypsum, and other wall materials.

improve their technical efficiency and quality of product. In 1990, the
cement industry consisted of some 6,000 plants with a total production capac-
ity of 210 million tpy.
B. Demand and SupRly

3.4       Cement Demand.  Between 1970 and 1990, cement consumption increased
at an average rate of 11.3 percent a year, from 25.3 million to 204 million
tpy. During the 1970., the growth was driven largely by infrastructure proj-
ects. The economic reforms have led to accelerated growth in demand for



- 10 -
cement for rural and urban housing, and industrial applications. During
1989/90, the growth of cement consumption slowed down significantly (in fact,
a slight decline in cemenit consumption was registered for 1990) as a direct
consequence of the recent three-year economic austerity program, which
resulted in major cutbacks ard suspension of construction work. Now that the
inflationary pressure has been significantly reduced and the austerity program
is coming to an end, construction work is being resumed and the demand for
cement, particularly for high-grade products, has become increasingly strong.
Despite the rapid increase in consumption in the past decade, China's per
capita cement consumption in 1989 was well below the average for industrial-
ized countries (185 kg vs. 500 kg in 1987) (Annex 3.1).
3.5       According to the State Administration of Building Materials Industry
(SABMI), cement consumption in China is projected to grow at a rate of
4.6 percent to the year 2000, reaching 260 million tons by 1995 and 320 mil-
lion tons by 2000. This growth rate is far lower than the 10.1 percent per
annum of the past decade because of projected slower economic growth, improve-
ments in product quality, and better technology for cement application. While
it is reasonable to assume that future growth rates in consumption will
decline as high-grade replaces low-grade cement, these projections appear
rather conservative in view of the Government's economic targets under the
Eighth Five-Year Plan.
3.6       As economic development progresses, the demand for cement is shift-
ing in favor of high-grade varieties, which are needed in the urban indus-
trial, energy, and infrastructure sectors. Because of supply constraints,
however, the use of high-grade cement has been limited to pr!irity construc-
tion. Demand for the higher grades is also increasing in rural areas, where
the quality of new housing and construction projects has been rising. How-
ever, the demand for low-grade cement will remain strong in rural areas.
3.7       Cement SuPDlY. Betweein 1970 and 1990, Chinese cement production
increased from 25.8 million tpy to 209.7 million tpy, averaging 11.1 percent
growth a year. Nine major types of cement are produced: slag, rapid harden-
ing Portland, ordinary Portland (OPC), pozzolanic, fly ash, low heat, alumi-
num, oil well, and white cement.
3.8       Current production is characterized by a predominance of medium- and
low-grade products at small-scale plants. In 1989, these plants accounted for
83 percent of the cement produced in China. Of the total output of these
plants, about 45 percent of the products were medium-grade, the balance low-
grade. Because low- and medium-grade cements are not suitable for high-rise
buildings and industrial applications, the Government has attempted to upgrade
the quality of cement produced by establishing new large- and medium-sized
plants and revamping small ones. These efforts have not been very successful.
Indeed, many new small plants were constructed during 1980-89 as a result of
the rural construction boom brought about by the agricultural reforms.
3.9       Meeting the growing demand for high-grade cement would require the
addition of about 10 million tons of new capacity each year over the next
decade. However, the current investment plan calls for only 9.2 million tons
of additional capacity for high-grade cement from new large- and medium-sized
plants between 1991 and 1995. Renovations and capacity expansions of existing



- 11 -
medium- and small-sized plants will handle the bulk of additional production.
A limited number of new small plants to be established, based on up-to-date
technology, will also help assume some of the burden, particularly in rural
areas. Given that small cement plants will continue producing the bulk of
China's cement output, it is important that the Government introduce measures
to improve their production efficiency and to control pollution. In this
context, the Government has agreed to carry out a study to review the econom-
ics of small plant operations and to develop related policies and strategies
under the technical assistance component of this project (paras. 3.13, 3.27
and 6.11, Annex 6.6).
3.10      Cement Demand and SupplV. Despite the build-up of production capac-
ity during the last two decades, China is expected to remain a net importer of
cement during the 1990s. Because of foreign exchange constraints, the actual
volume of imports has been small relative to potential demand, particularly
for high-grade cement. Nonetheless, imports met a significant portion of
China's consumption of high-grade cement throughout the 1980s. A major por-
tion of the imports came from neighboring Asian countries, such as Japan,
Korea, and the Philippines. These imports helped ease the supply pressure in
the coastal cities. In 1990, China became a net exporter due to the depressed
domestic demand under the economic austerity program, as well as the extra-
ordinary construction boom in the neighboring countries. However, China is
expected to return to a net importer position as its economy emerges out of
its austerity program (para. 3.4). As China limits the construction of small
plants for low-grade cement production and its demand pattern further changes
in favor of high-grade cement, the volume of imports is anticipated to
increase over the next decade, the foreign exchange situation permitting.
C. Structure and Performance of the Industry
3.11      Production CaDacities.  China has 10 large plants, 56 medium-sized
plants, and some 6,500 small plants. Large plants are defined as producing
more than 1 million tpy of cement, medium-sized between 200,000 and 1 million
tpy, and small less than 200,000 tpy. Small plants are in turn subdivided
into two categories: those producing between 20,000 and 200,000 tpy; and mini
plants producing less than 20,000 tpy. The former, numbering about 3,500,
generally employ semi-mechanized shaft kilns and rotary kilns. The latter,
numbering about 3,000, employ manual-shaft kilns or crude pits.
3.12      Reflecting the industrial dispersion of the 1960., the underdevel-
oped inland transport system, and the availability of raw materials throughout
the country, China's cement plants are widely dispersed among the 30 prov-
inces.   Each province has a number of small plants and at least one medium-
sized plant. The proliferation and dispersion of the small plants result from
transport constraints, segmented markets, and the lack of investment coordina-
tion across local jurisdictions. The leading provincial producers are:
Guangdong (with 8.8 percent of total production in 1989), Jiangsu (6.8 per-
cent), Zhejiang (5.6 percent), Sichuan (5.4 percent), Hebei (5.2 percent) and
Liaoning (4.1 percent). These provinces, all located along the coast except
for Sichuan, together produced 45 percent of China's cement output in 1989.
The cement-deficient areas include the municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin,
Shanghai, other coastal open cities, and the provinces of Guangdong,



- 12 -
Heilongjiang, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Part of their shortages are met by
cement produced in Liaoning, Hebei, Hunan, and Anhui Provinces and by imports.
3.13      Although GOC's policy is to build up large-scale capacity for cement
production and to limit the uncontrolled expansion of small, particularly
mini, plants because of their low economic efficiency and poor product
quality, there has been a large increase in the number of mini cement plants
set up by townships and villages over the past decade. The increase in mini
plants reflects the general shortage of cement, the rapid growth in the rural
economy, and the underdeveloped and overburdened transport system. Given the
difficulty of obtaining cement for rural housing and infrastructure, local
authorities have had to turn to mini plants, which can use local materials and
resources. During 1989/90, the expansion of small and mini plants was halted,
due mainly to the weak demand for cement. In the absence of any effective
control mechanism, however, these mini plants would begin to proliferate again
with the recovery of demand for cement. The proposed study on small plants is
aimed at providing advice to the government in dealing with this issue more
effectively (paras. 3.9, 3.27, 6.11, Annex 6.6). The growth of mini cement
plants, and the shift in cement output among different categories of plants
are shown in Table 3.2.

3.14      Technologies.  Most cement plants in China, including the medium-
sized ones, use outdated technologies based on wet-process rotary kilns or
shaft kilns. In industrialized countries, this 1950s kiln-based technology
has been replaced with a more energy-efficient dry-process system that pro-
duces better quality cement. In the late 1970s, the Chinese Government began
to introduce dry-process technologies in newly built plants and in the renova-
tion of medium-sized plants. At the same time, it launched an initiative to
improve the technology of small plants. Since then, 7 new large dry-process
plants have been built, and 16 medium-size plants have been renovated using
imported technology. One major constraint in obtaining up-to-date foreign
technology hae been the foreign exchange allocation system, which makes it
difficult for import-substituting subsectors, such as the cement industry, to



- ±3 -
obtain the necessary foreign exchange (para. 2.17). The Chinese developed
their own dry-process technology for medium-sized plants in the early 1980s,
and it is now operational in two plants. However, in 1990 only 22 of the
country's 66 large- and medium-sized plants employed the dry-process system,
and most of the small plants still operated old shaft kilns, while the mini
plants used an even more primitive crude pit design. The Bank's sector work
on the cement equipment manufacturing industry, undertaken in 1985, identifies
the technological backwardness of Chinese manufactured cement equipment and
machinery as one of the major roadblocks to the overall improvement of the
cement industry.
3.15      Products.  The range of products produced by the large- and medium-
sized plants varies from 425 grade to 575 grade cements. About 85 percent of
their output is 425-525 grade. Small plants produce 225-425 grade with about
70 percent of their production consisting of 325. In 1989, high-grade (525
and above) made up only 9.7 percent of the cemer.t produced in China, and
47 percent of the output of large- and medium-sized plants. That year,
52 percent of the production of small plants was 325 grade, 44.5 percent 425,
and only 3.5 percent 525. Mini plants normally produce lower grade cement,
which is tunsuitable for structural construction.
3.16      Pollution Control.  The recent availability of modern pollution
control devices has confirmed the need to reduce the environmental degradation
caused by Chinese cement plants. The pollution control equipment in most
plants is inadequate, and national standards, while being generally consistent
with acceptable norms, have not been strictly enforced. Small cement plants
in particular hava been significant polluters in the countryside. As the
Government begins to monitor pollution problems more closely, modern electro-
static precipitators for dust collection are being installed in large- and
medium-sized plants. The technology for manufacturing pollution control
(mainly de-dusting) equipment has been imported from international licensors.
Arrangements for pollution control at the project plants are discussed in
parse. 7.7-7.8. Mitigation of the pollutants at small plants is a major topic
to be investigated in the study on small plants, to be carried out under the
technical assistance component of the project (para. 6.11, Annex 6.6).
3.17      Canacitv Utilization.  Capacity utilization for the industry as a
whole has been maintained at a relatively high level since 1980; the running
factor on a 365-day basis has been over 80 percent. That rate had declined
gradually from 1980 to 1986, mainly because of the growing obsolescence of
equipment, energy shortages, and the change in the demand pattern in favor of
high- and medium-grade cement. The capacity utilization rate rebounded in
1987-89 in the face of the construction boom and declined slightly in 1990.
The average capacity utilization of large and medium cement plants has always
been over 90 percent.
3.18      Supervisors ResRonsibility.  National supervisory responsibility for
the building materials industry, including the cement sector, rests with
SABMI, a Government agency under the State Council headed by a deputy minis-
ter-level director general. It prepares the five-year plans for the industry,
works out annual production targets, coordinates the supply of raw materials
and sales of output, and monitors the activities of the building materials
industry in coordination with the Building Materials Industry Bureaus of the



- 14 -
local (provincial and municipal) governments. Production planning for the 66
large- and medium-sized plants is SABMI's direct responsibility, while the
provincial authorities supervise actual production and financial operations.
Depending on the size of the plant and its relative importance to the local
economy, small and mini plants are supervised either by the provincial govern-
ment or other lower level authorities.
D. Marketing and Distribution
3.19      Cement Allocation and Marketing.  Compared with most of the other
major industrial commodities in China, a smaller portion of cement output is
allocated according to the state allocation plan, and cement enterprises them-
selves sell production above the plan quota. The state and the provinces
allocate cement produced by large- and medium-sized plants within the plan
quota to priority projects. Production of the larger and higher quality small
plants is also subject to plan quotas for priority projects of the provincial
and lower-level local governments. The remaining small plants and the mini
plants market their cement themselves without Crvernment intervention.
3.20      Essential raw materials designated for the production of quota out-
put and utilities such as coal and power are allocated within the state plan.
Cement plants must obtain raw materials for their above-quota output from the
free market at negotiated market prices. Many plants secure their supplies by
exchanging a portion of their above-quota cement production for key raw
materials. In 1987, 78 percent of the cement produced by the large- and
medium-sized plants, and 18 percent of the cement produced by small plants,
was allocated within the state allocation plan. In 1989, the shares of state
allocation declined to 67.5 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively. They
remained the same in 1990.
3.21      Cement Transportation.  Transportation of cement is generally the
responsibility of the buyer; the producer's responsibility ends at the factory
gate. Cement transportation across provincial boundaries has been limited
because of the traditional emphasis on regional self-sufficiency. Only the
cement allocated by the state is usually transported over longer distances by
rail. Above-plan output moves primarily by road; only a small portion goes by
rail. In 1986, 21 percent of total cement production was distributed by rail,
over an average distance of 446 km. The inadequacy of the railway and road
systems has limited the transport of cement even to close destinations. The
Tongling component of this project would introduce the first major low-cost
water transportation to ship bulk cement in large quantities (para. 6.3).
E. Pricing
3.22      The economic reforms have gradually expanded the role of market
forces in cement production and allocation. However, during the transition
phase, a three-tier pricing system has emerged. The State Pricing Bureau
(SPB) sets the prices for production under the State plan at the ex-factory
level. Provincial pricing bureaus set the prices of cement for priority pro-
vincial projects; over the past three years, they have been 5-33 percent
higher than the state-controllea prices. Free market prices are negotiated
between the plants, building material trading companies, and consumers. In
1988, they were on average 32.5 percent higher than the state-controlled



- 15 -
prices, and in June 1991, they were 35.8 percent higher. In the first quarter
of 1989 when the demand for cement was very strong, free market prices were
higher by more than 60 percent on average than state-controlled prices
throughout the country. In some areas, the free market prices of cement have
sometimes been more than three times as high as the state prices. In 1989/90,
about 22 percent of total cement consumption and about 74 percent of the high-
grade cement was sold at controlled prices under the state and provincial
allocation plans.
3.23      Local Prices of Cement and Inputs vs. Import Parity Values.  In June
1991, the state-controlled ex-factory price of 525 OPC in bag was Y 158/ton
($29.5/ton at the prevailing foreign exchange rate of Y 5.36/$i), about
52 percent of the CIF Shanghai import price of $57.0. Even the free market
prices, which generally exceeded the import parity prices during 1988/89, were
below tac' FOB export prices in China, thus providing incentives for the
Chinese cement manufacturers to export. Recently, there have been signs of
rising free market prices of industrial raw materials in line wi,b the gradual
recovery of the domestic demand for cement. For example, in June 1991, the
state-controlled price of coal was Y 70 ($13.0) per ton, or 48 percent of its
economic value,6/ based on netback from the export price. The province-con-
trolled price ranged from Y 90 ($20.5) per ton to Y 180 ($33.5) per ton,
depending on the province. In 1991 then, the free market prices of coal gen-
erally exceeded the state-controlled prices by about 1.5 times. The above-
quota cement production is supplied at free market prices. (A comparison of
the domestic and international prices of cement as of June 1991 is given in
Annex 3.4.)
3.24      While the overall price reform somewhat slowed (para. 2.5) under the
economic austerity program, GOC continued to experiment with further price
liberalization of cement. For example, six medium-sized plants located in
Shanghai, Guangdong, and Fujian were recently given more autcnomy to set
prices. The prices of 525 OPC from four of these plants (Yongan and Shunchang
in Fujian, and Yingde and Guangzhou in Guangdong) have been about 35-45 per-
cent higher than the state-controlled prices. The other two plants (Jinshan
and Shanghai) in Shanghai municipality set prices 40 percent higher than
state-controlled ones.
3.25      During loan negotiations, an assurance was obtained from the Govern-
ment that the output of project facilities would be sold directly by the com-
panies based on free market pricing. Draft contracts for the sale of the
Tongling output, which have been reviewed by the Bank and are available in
Project File Reference No. 7, reflect this principle of free market negotia-
tions between project companies and buyers (para. 6.5).
F. Government Strategv for the Cement Industry
3.26      The Government's main objectives in the cement sector are to:
(i) establish an efficient cement industry based on the country's rich lime
stone and coal resources and low labor costs; and (ii) meet the growth in
demand in the next two decades without resorting to imports. In accordance
6/   BAsed on coal with a calorific value of 5,400 kcal/kg.



- 16 -
with these objectives, the Government's strategy for sector development during
the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95) envisages: (i) expanding the production
capacities for high-grade and special cement using up-to-date technology;
(ii) modernizing and rehabilitating medium-sized plants to use the dry pro-
cess; (iii) gradually upgrading the technology of selected small plants;
(iv) phasing out most of the mini plants with capacities below 20,000 tpy; and
(v) improving capabilities for research, design, and manufacturing of cement-
related equipment, processes, and facilities. The broad outline of the
Government's strategy for the sector is essentially scund.
3.27      To promote the product quality and environmental standards of cement
plants, particularly small and mini plants, the Government is requiring all
new plants to obtain production licenses, register their businesses, and com-
ply with cement quality standards. These conditions will enforce more strin-
gent technical and financial requirements for plant operation. In this con-
text, SABMI has agreed to sponsor a comprehensive study of the technical and
economic efficiency, and pollution control of small plants under the technical
assistance component of the project (para. 6.11). This study would help
define proper strategies and policy measures for these plants. A summary of
the terms of reference for the study are given in Annex 6.6.
3.28      Over the longer term, the Government is looking at the possibility
of developing a cement export industry. The cement industry in a number of
industrialized countries is gradually reducing its capacity for export because
of rising labor costs. This shift creates an export market for low-cost
cement producers in developing countries. The Bohai Gulf, Yangtze Delta, and
Pearl River Delta have been considered as future export bases for cement. A
joint venture has been set up in Dalian between the Huanen Group and Onoda of
Japan to produce 1.29 million tpy of cement, mainly for export, on an experi-
mental basis. This plant is scheduled to be commissioned by the end of 1992.
G. Bank Role and Proiect Justification
3.29      The main issues that have been facing the Chinese cement industry in
implementing the above strategy are how to: (i) promote regional cooperation
to support modern large-scale, economic plants; (ii) support optimization of
small plants in terms of production efficiency and environmental improvements;
(iii) make appropriate marketing arrangements in support of establishing large
plants; (iv) promote pricing arrangements based on expanded free market pric-
ing; and (v) build up local design capabilities to improve production effi-
ciency and environmental control in the face of the limited availability of
foreign exchange for imported technology and equipment.
3.30      The Bank's role has been to help the GOC identify the key problem
areas and develop operational and policy prescriptions to resolve them. To
this end, the Bank prepared a Regional Cement Sector Study and a Cement
Machinery Manufacturing Sector Study in 1984/85. These studies have provided
the basis for ongoing dialogue with the Government on sector strategy, poli-
cies, and priorities, as well as the proposed project. The key elements of
the Bank's strategy are to help: (i) promote the construction of optimally
designed large plants and related marketing arrangements, and encourage poli-
cies designed to reduce the proliferation of suboptimal and economically
unsound small plants by reducing the barriers to cross-provincial trade and



- 17 -
cooperation; (ii) improve the ability of the local cement machinery manufac-
turing industry for the design and manufacturing of key cement machinery and
equipment; (iii) upgrade product technologies; (iv) improve distributive and
allocative efficiency through further price and trade reforms; and (v)
strengthen cement design and research capabilities.
3.31      In addition to introducing state-of-the-art technology for large
cement plants and techniques tor project planning and implementation, the main
(Tongling) component of the project would also establish a model for regional
cooperation. Constraints on interregional trade and cooperation in the past
resulted in the proliferation of siboptimal plants (para. 3.12), and prevented
the establishmet.t of modern bulk transport systems. The deuign of this compo-
nent involves various institutional and contractual arrangements for the sale
and shipping of project output that are being introduced for the first time in
China. The project would also offer indirect support to the cement equipment
manufacturing subsector by providing technical assistance to strengthen
selected research and design institutions.
3.32      Finally, the project would be used as a vehicle to help the Chinese
Government experiment with the joint stock ownership system for major Govern-
ment-sponsored investments, one of the most important elements of the ongoing
enterprise reform experiments (para. 2.7). Two project entities have been
designated officially as pilot enterprises for experimentation with the joint
stock company (JSC) system by the SRC 7/ (paras. 5.5 and 5.8). The arrange-
ments introduced under this project would be an important model for such
companies until formal joint stock legislation is enacted.
IV. THE CEMENT INDUSTRY IN THE SHANGHAI ECONOMIC REGION
4.1       Of the several economic regions in China, the Shanghai Economic
Region (SER) has been the best candidate for initiating regional cooperation
to implement the Government's strategy for the cement sector. It contains
provinces and municipalities which are not only strong in terms of economic
and construction activities, but have greater authority than others in negoti-
ating with other jurisdictions for new in'tiatives. The regional economic
background, cement production and market, and the need for regional market
integration are explained in this chapter.
A. The Shanghai Economic Region
4.2       The SER comprises the municipality of Shanghai and the five prov-
inces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. It is among the most
rapidly growing regions in China. In 1989, with only 6.4 percent of the total
area of China, it had 21.6 percent of the country's population, 31.2 percent
of its industrial production, and 30.0 percent of its output of building mate-

rials. In 1987, Jiangsu ranked first in the nation in gross output of agri-
culture and industry, while Shanghai was second in gross industrial output.
The region has been designated by the Chinese Government as an important coas-
tal zone for attracting foreign investments and for experimenting with econo-
mic reforms. (The major economic indicators for the region are given in Annex
4.1.)

4.4       Cement Consumption.  Between 1982-88, cement consumption in the
region increased dramatically at an annual average rate of 15.9 percent,
faster than the national average of 12.9 percent, a reflection of the area's
rapid economic growth. In 1988, cement consumption in the region was
24.9 percent of total national consumption. During this period, the demand
for higher grade cement had increased throughout the region as a result of the
growing demand for high-rise construction, urban renovation projects, infra-
structure construction, and better quality housing for the rural population.
In 1989/90, however, the growth of cement consumption in the region levelled
off due to the ongoing economic austerity program. As the austerity program
is now coming to an end, cement consumption in the region is expected to
resume growing faster than the national average again. The large investments



- 19 -
in improved infrastructure, expected for the region's open cities, will in
particular boost the demand for high-grade cement. Under the most conserva-
tive scenario of SABMI, cement consumption in the region is forecast to grow
at a rate of 5.7 percent a year up to the year 2000.
4.5       Cement Production.  Cement production in the region also increased
substantially between 1982-90, at an average 12.0 percent a year, going from
20.1 million tons to 49.9 million tons. This rate compares with the national
one of 10.1 percent during the same period. In 1990, the region produced
24.8 percent of all the cement produced in China. During 1989/90, cement
production in the region declined slightly from the peak in 1988 as a number
of mini plants ceased to produce low quality cement due to the deterioration
of profitability in the face of falling free market prices (para. 3.23).
SABMI's intention is to build up the capacity for high-grade cement in the
region to meet the growing demand and changing pattern of consumption there.
Its preliminary target is to increase the regional capacity for cement produc-
tion, mainly high-grade, at a rate of 5.6 percent per annum, until the year
2000.
4.6       Rezional Supply and Demand Balance.  Despite the recent build-up of
production capacity, demand, particularly for high-grade cement, still exceeds
supply in ths region as a whole. Except for Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian, the
provinces faced marked deficits of cement, particularly in the largest cities,
which had to import cement. In 1986, even when foreign exchange was scarce,
Shanghai Municipality imported 480,000 tons of high-grade cement at a cost of
$18 million. The shortages of cement in the region threaten to dampen econo-
mic growth unless improvements can be made in both production and quality.
Under present conditions, small plants are expected to continue meeting much
of the demand for rural housing and construction projects.
C. Structure and Performance of the Regional Cement Industry
4.7       Capacities.  The SER represents a good cross-section of the Chinese
cement industry. In 1990, it had over 1,200 cement plants, of whlch 2 were
large, 14 medium-sized (the large- and medium-sized plants are listad in
Annex 4.3), 807 were small, and the balance was mini. Anhui and Jisngsu,
which have rich limestone deposits, each have one large imported modern plant.
In Anhui, the Ningquo plant has a capacity of 1.2 million tpy; in Jiangsu, the
Huaihai plant can produce 1.0 million tpy. In 1989, large- and medium-sized
plants produced only 14 percent of the region's total cement output, and high-
grade cement represented only 7.5 percent of the total produced in the region.
4.8       SUDPlY of Inputs.  Limestone, the major raw material used in cement
manufacturing, is abundant but unevenly distributed throughout the region
(Table 4.2). Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces have the largest proven reserves;
Shanghai has almost none. Most of the reserves in the region are located
inland, away from the major centers of cement consumption, a pattern that pute
additional pressure on the region's inland transportation network and makes it
difficult to plan a rational spatial distribution of plants.
4.9       Good quality coal, essential for producing high-grade cement, is not
found in large quantities in the region except in Anhui Province; given the
prevailing constraints to rail transportation in Anhui Province (para. 5.14),

this also limits further development of the cement industry in the eastern
part of the region.
D. Market Intearation
4.10      Balancing supply and demand for various types of cement in the re-
gion requires increased regional cooperation to promote trade between cement-
producing and cement-consuming provinces. The absence of regional cooperation
has, as noted, engendered a proliferation of small and mini plants in each
province without any regard to optimizing investments in the region overall
(para. 3.12). Regional cooperation is especially needed to: (i) optimize the
size of cement plant construction and expansion; (ii) optimize the location of
plants according to the endowment of raw materials, transport constraints, and
market factors; (iii) establish a least-cost cement transport system;
(iv) develop a common strategy for restructuring small and mini plants; and
(v) articulate an appropriate price structure for cement in the region. As
mentioned earlier in para. 3.31, the Tongling component of the project pro-
vides an important opportunity for regional cooperation, as a model for future
regional cooperation.
V. PROJECT INSTITUTIONS
A. Introduction
5.1       The project would involve:  two new enterprises--the Anhui Provin-
cial Tongling Cement Company (ATCC) and the Ningbo Cement Company (NCC); an
existing enterprise--the Zhongguo Cement Company (ZCC); and four cement indus-
try research and design institutions under the auspices of SABMI. ATCC would
implement a major portion of the Tongling cement production and distribution
component (paras. 6.2-6.6). NCC would establish a clinker-grinding facility
in Ningbo City as part of the Tongling cement component (paras. 6.2-6.6). ZCC
would implement the Zhongguo plant rehabilitation component (paras. 6.7-6.9).
SABMI (see para. 3.18 for its role and function) would implement the technical
assistance component through four institutes (paras. 6.10-11). The institutes



- 21 -
are: the Research Institute of Cement (RIC), which belongs to the China
Building Materials Academy; the Tianjin Cement Industry Design Institute
(TCIDI); the Nanjing Cement Industry Design Institute (NCIDI); and the Hefei
Cement Industry Design Institute (HCIDI).
B. Background
5.2       All the large- and medium-sized cement plants in China are state-
owned and are under the supervision of the State and provincial governments.
However, they operate as financially and administratively independent enti-
ties. Their organization and management practices resemble those of other
state-owned enterprises in China. Each company is headed by a general manager
who is appointed by the provincial government. Under this general manager are
second-level managers responsible for functional areas such as procurement and
salary administration, production, maintenance, and construction. A chief
engineer, also in second-level management, is charged with all technical mat-
ters, including new construction and renovations. A chief accountant handles
financial matters.
5.3       In the past, most of the administrative, production, marketing, and
financial decisions of these companies were directly supervised by the state
and provincial governments. With the ongoing economic reforms, companies are
achieving greater operating autonomy and a two-tier planning system has
emerged. The State plan still mandates a required level of activity, but
above that level each company operates relatively freely in response to market
forces. Above quota, companies determine their own production levels, pro-
curement of raw materials, and utilization of funds accruing from sales. As
their autonomy increases, these enterprises will need to strengthen their
managerial capabilities, particularly their management information systems.
Under the project, project companies, with support from research and design
institutes, are developing a program to introduce a management information
system (HIS) supported by a computerized data base. This system would be able
to process and circulate marketing, production, and financial information for
use in business decisions. During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained
that the three project companies would implement their respective HIS programs
in accordance with the agreed scope, details and time schedule. During proj-
ect preparation, the project companies have also developed a detailed program
for recruiting and training staff. During loan negotiations, assurances were
also obtained from the companies that they would carry out the training in
accordance with a program agreed to between the Bank and the companies.
5.4       For the companies to obtain the status of legal entities, they have
prepared, issued, and registered their charters with relevant provincial
authorities. During loan negotiations, it was confirmed that their charters,
as well as related joint venture agreements for the two new project companies,
were satisfactory to the Bank.
C. The Anhui Tongling Cement Company (ATCC)
5.5       Background and Ownership.  ATCC is located in Tongling, Anhui Prov-
ince. It was founded in 1987 to prepare and implement the Tongling component
of the project. ATCC would become an experimental JSC based on a shareholding
system of multiple investors, formation of the board of directors, expanded



- 22 -
management autonomy, and output pricing and marketing outside the state plan.
ATCC's charter and the joint venture agreement between its three owners--the
State Raw Material Investment Corporation (SRMIC), the Anhui Provincial Con-
struction Investment Corporation (APCIC) and the Tongling City Investment Com-
pany (TCIC)--have reflected fully the features of JSC being experimented with.
A summary of the features being experimented within the company is given in
Annex 5.1. APCIC will have 53 percent ownership, and SRMIC, 33 percent, and
TCIC, 14 percent; ATCC would have authorized capital of Y 300 million, the
entire amount to be paid in by APCIC, SRMIC and TCIC (para. 8.6). During loan
negotiations, an assurance was obtained from ATCC that it will inform the Bank
promptly of any changes in its charter, joint venture agreement or management
structure. The Government provided an assurance that it will allow ATCC to
implement the shareholding system stipulated in the company's charter.
5.6       Organization and Management.  ATCC now operates a preparation office
with one director, one vice director, and about 40 technical personnel. (The
pro forma organization and staffing of ATCC are shown in Annex 5.2.) In prin-
ciple, ATCC's basic organization would be similar to that of existing state-
owned cement plants. However, as a joint stock company, it would have a board
with seven members who would make key decisions for the company; APCIC would
appoint three of the members, and SRMIC and TCIC two each. Particular atten-
tion was given during project preparation to the design of the company's
staffing, financial, and planning functions, including the development of a
detailed program to introduce an MIS (para. 5.3).
5.7       Staffing and Training.  The required key technical and managerial
staff for ATCC have been designated. When operations begin, ATCC would have a
total staff of about 1,200 (about 25 percent smaller than comparable existing
cement plants in China). Under the project, 35 technical staff would receive
122 staff-months of overseas and local training in all the critical aspects
and stages of the new cement process, including computer operations and envi-
ronmental protection. Major equipment suppliers would also be responsible for
training of technical staff, some of which would be provided on site during
construction. ATCC has agreed to incorporate special training programs for
its managerial and financial staff into the overall training program (para.
5.3).
D. The Ningbo Cement Company (NCC)
5.8       Background and Ownership.  NCC has been established to take charge
of constructing and operating a clinker-grinding facility at Ningbo, Zhejiang
Province. The grinding plant would be located near Beilun port area, 40 km
southwest of Ningbo city. NCC, like ATCC, would become an experimental JSC;
the initial paid-in capital of NCC would be Y 40 million, representing about
29 percent of NCC's total investment. NCC would have three shareholders: the
Ningbo Investment Company (NIC), which would hold a 54 percent share, and the
Beilun District Investment Company (BDIC) and SRMIC, which would own 25 and
21 percent, respectively. During loan negotiations, an assurance was obtained
from NCC that it will inform the Bank promptly of any changes in its charter,
joint venture agreement or management structure. An assurance was also
obtained from the Government that it will allow NCC to implement the share-
holding system stipulated in its charter (para. 5.5).



- 23 -
5.9       Organization and Management.  The preparation of NCC's project has
been assigned to a unit within the Ningbo Building Materials Industry Bureau
(NBMIB), established in May 19RQ. This unit is headed by a director and a
vice director, both of whom art. engineers. It now has four major sections:
technological (process) equipment, with two engineers; capital construction,
with three engineers; finance, with two accountants; and liaison, with three
engineers.
5.10      The staff would be increased gradually to meet NCC's proposed orga-
nization, shown in Annex 5.3, by project completion. NCC would have a board
of directors with three members appointed by NIC and two each by SRMIC and
BDIC. NCC would be organized into five groups, each headed by a manager:
three departments--production, finance, and administration--and two offlices--
chief engineer and chief economist.
5.11      Staffing and Training.  NCC's total work force is projected at 335
people, of whom 28 would be engineers and 32 technicians. Foreign training
would be included for 16 people for a total of 56 staff-months. It would
cover the process, mechanical, and electrical aspects of the plant as well as
computer operations, financial planning and overall production management,
including environmental protection. As with ATCC, some training would be
provided by the major suppliers, many of whom would be on site during trial
operations.
E. The Zhongguo Cement Companv (ZCC)
5.12      Background and Ownership.  ZCC, located in Longtan, about 20 miles
northeast of Nanjing city in Jiangsu Province, was founded in 1921. Cur-
rently, it operates five wet-process kilns with an annual production capacity
of 480,000 tons of high-grade cement. A state-owned enterprise, ZCC operates
under the supervisory responsibility of the Nanjing municipal government.
5.13      Orxanization and Management.  ZCC manages the operation of existing
cement production facilities. It is headed by a director. Three vice direc-
tors are responsible, respectively, for production, operation, marketing and
finance, and administration. A chief engineer is in charge of technical
development. Its current organizational chart is given in Annex 5.3.
Recently, a position for an additional vice director was created to take
charge of the proposed renovation investment under the project. Two addi-
tional vice directors would be put in charge of the new lines to be estab-
lished under the project. So far, ZCC's operational focus has been on meeting
production targets set by the Government; until now, the major portion of its
output has been allocated within the State and provincial allocation quotas.
Since, under the project, ZCC would sell its entire output from the project
facilities at market prices and outside the state allocation plan
(para. 3.25), it is important that it improve its capability for production
planning, marketing, and operational and financial management.
5.14      Production Performance.  During 1988/89, ZCC has not operated at
full capacity because of interruptions caused by power shortages; as a result,
capacity utilization dropped from 97 percent in 1987 to 65 percent in 1989.
The power shortages were caused in part by capacity conatraints in the railway
system that transports coal from the northern part of Anhui Province. In



- 24 -
1990, ZCC achieved capacity utilization of over 90 percent as the power Gupply
situation improved. The situation will further improve when a second railway
line from Huainan to Hefei and Wuhu in Anhui Province, which is currently
under construction, is completed (planned for 1992). Further, the power situ-
ation is expected to improve significantly when the construction of two 300 MW
coal-based power generating units is completed by the end of 1992. A consid-
erable portion of the coal required for the power plants will also be trans-
ported by water from Lianyunggan port (near the Xuzhou mine).
5.15      Marketing and Distribution.  A portion of ZCC's output is now dis-
tributed through the State allocation plan. In 1990, about 38 percent of
ZCC's output was allocated within the State quota, 35 percent within the pro-
vincial quota; ZCC sold the remaining 27 percent directly in the market.
5.16      Staff in  and Training.  The company employs more than 2,500 people,
of which 167 are managers, 63 engineers, and 71 technicians. (ZCC's organiza-
tion chart is shown in Annex 5.4.) ZCC already has most of the necessary
technical personnel.  However, the new production line would require hiring an
additional 615 people.  Because it would employ a modern dry process and a
computer-based centralized control system, its staff would need extensive
training domestically and abroad.  Under the project, 30 technicians would
receive on-the-job training at the Shunchang Cement Plant in Fujian Province,
while 19 would be sent abroad during the construction period. In addition,
major equipment suppliers would provide training for the staff operating the
new production lines.
F. The Four Cement Industry Research and Design Institutes
5.17      Backzround.  Of the 40 or so research and design institutions for
cement and building materials in China, only four have the necessary facili-
ties to carry out major research and design work. These institutions, which
are under the direct responsibility of SABMI, are: RIC in Beijing, TCIDI in
Tianjin, NCIDI in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, and HCIDI in Hefei, Anhui Prov-
ince. RIC was founded in 1954, TCIDI in 1953, NCIDI in 1965, and HCIDI in
1982.
5.18      With SABMI's guidance, the institutions have become increasingly
specialized. TCIDI and NCIDI focus primarily on designing large- and medium-
sized cement plants, including process design and adaptations of imported
technology. RIC emphasizes materials research, HCIDI small plants.
5.19      Organization and Manaxement.  The organization of the four institu-
tions is given in Annex 5.5, and more details are available in Project File
Reference No. 8. A summary of each institution's organization and management
is given in Table 5.1.
5.20      Staffing and Training.  Most of the technical staff have received
education above the university level; many have received advanced training
domestically and overseas.   Under the project, a number of the technical
staff of these institutions would receive training in specialized technical
fields (para. 6.10).

VI. THE PROJECT
A. Obiectives
6.1          The project aims are fully consistent with the Bank's strategy for
the cement sector (para. 3.30). The project consists of the following three
components: (a) the Tongling cement production and distribution component;
(b) the Zhongguo plant rehabilitation component; and (c) the technical assis-
tance component. The Tongling component (paras. 6.2-6.6) helps to introduce a
regional cement production and distribution scheme in China, based on a modern
large-scale cement plant, develop an interprovincial bulk transportation and



- 26 -
distribution network, and experiment with the joint-stock ownership system for
major Government-sponsored investments. The Zhongguo component (paras. 6.7-
6.9) provides financial and technical s'-pport to expand production capacity
and improve energy efficiency and product quality in an existing medium-scale
cement plant. The technical assistance component (paras. 6.10-6.11) is
designed to strengthen four cement industry research and design institutes,
and to investigate measures to improve the production efficiency and to con-
trol pollution emissions of small cement plants.
B. The Tonaling Cement Production and Distribution Comnonent
6.2       This component involves:  (i) establishing an integrated cement
plant with 1.2 million tpy of clinker capacity, a cement-grinding line that
can process 690,000 tpy of high-strength cement, and a clinker and bulk cement
loading terminal at Tongling in Anhui Province; and (ii) installing a cement-
grinding plant to process 600,000 tpy of clinker, equipped with a clinker
receiving terminal at Ningbo.  ATCC is to carry out part (i); NCC is responsi-
ble for part (ii). Half of ATCC's annual clinker output (600,000 tpy) would
be shipped 889 km along the Yangtze River and the coast to NCC's plant at the
Ningbo (Beilun) port in Zhejiang Province, where it would be ground to produce
690,000 tpy of high-strength cement. Tongling's remaining 600,000 tpy of
clinker would be ground at ATCC's plant to produce about 690,000 tons of high-
grade cement. Of the latter, about 200,000 tpy would be transported in bulk
by ship along the Yangtze River to Nantong City in Jiangsu Province (448 km).
Another 200,000 tpy in bulk cement would be shipped to Wenzhou City in
Zhejiang Province (1,175 km). The balance would be sold within Anhui Prov-
ince. (This component is described in more detail in Annex 6.1.)
6.3       This component will be complemented by a new water transportation
system to be established along the Yangtze River. The system will include, in
addition to a bulk loading terminal at Tongling and a bulk receiving terminal
at Ningbo to be constructed under the project, the construction of two bulk
receiving terminals for cement. One terminal will be built by the Nantong
Building Materials Trading Company (NBMTC), the other by the Wenzhou Building
Materials Trading Company (WBMTC). Each terminal will have a capacity of
200,000 tpy. The Shanghai Changjiang Shipping Company (SCSC) will be respon-
sible for providing clinker transportation from Tongling to Ningbo by utiliz-
ing the empty return hauls of two 5,000 dead weight tonnage (dwt) iron-ore
carriers; one has been in service since April 1989, and the other is being
built. Both will carry imported iron ore from Ningbo to the Maanshan Steel
Plant on the Yangtze River in Anhui Province. The Anhui River and Sea Ship-
ping Company (ARSSC) will be responsible for providing the river/coastal
transport of bulk cement. To do so, it will acquire two new 3,000 dwt bulk
cement carriers. (The water transportation system is described in more detail
in Annex 6.2.)
6.4       ATCC will enter into long-term supply contracts with the three
cement-deficit cities in which the bulk terminals will be constructed. This
procedure will ensure a stable market for 100 percent of its clinker output
and 58 parcent of its cement production. The demand for high-grade cement in
all three of the cities is growing rapidly because of their thriving light
industries, increasing foreign investment, and relatively prosperous hinter-
land. Because these cities have few limestone deposits, they have no large or



- 27 -
medium-sized cement plants and only have a few small plants that manufacture
medium- and low-grade cement.   Consumption and production figures for cement
in the three cities are summarized in Table 6.1.

6.5       Given the need to complete construction of all project-related
facilities simultaneously, specific institutional and contractual arrangements
have been drawn up to ensure that implementation proceeds smoothly. These
arrangements pertain primarily to the sale and bulk transportation of project
output. Draft contracts (available in the Project File No. 7) include:
(i) the sale of clinker between ATCC and NCC; (ii) the sale of bulk cement
between ATCC and NBMTC and between ATCC and WBMTC; (iii) the transport of
clinker, to be prepared between ATCC, NCC, and SCSC; and (iv) the transport of
bulk cement between ATCC, ARSSC, NBMTC, and WBMTC. These contracts cover,
inter alia: annual quantities, time of delivery, principles determining the
price of the output, principles for determining remedies in case of a breach
of contract, and methods of arbitration in case of disputes. (Specific con-
tents of the contracts are summarized in Annex 6.3.)
6.6       Signing of these contracts woul' be a condition of loan effective-
ness. During loan negotiations, an assurance was obtained that the Government



- 28 -
would have or cause to have the construction of the two bulk receiving termi-
nals at Nantong and Wenzhou, and the necessary clinker and bulk cement carri-
ers completed, by December 31, 1994. SABMI will closely monitor the implemen-
tation status of these facilities and report it as part of project progress
reporting to the Bank (para. 9.11).
C. The Zhon,.uo Plant Rehabilitation ComDonent
6.7       This component involves converting a medium-sized cement plant with
a production capacity of 480,000 tpy cement to a modern dry-process technology
to improve production efficiency, product quality, and emission control. Two
of the five wet-process production lines, equivalent to a capacity of 150,000
tpy of cement, would be replaced by a 640,000 tpy modern dry-process line.
The component also includes the opening of a new limestone quarry adjacent to
the plant and improvements of the road, rail and power infrastructure.
(Details of this component are given in Annex 6.4.)
6.8       While a major portion of ZCC's output is currently distributed
through the State allocation plan (para. 5.15), the entire output of project
facilities will be sold directly by ZCC in the market (para. 3.25). Given the
shortages of cement in the Nanjing area, no marketing problem is anticipated.
6.9       The facilities supported by the project would produce 640,000 tpy of
cement, 150,000 tpy of which would replace the loss of production from facili-
ties to be demolished. The China Petrochemical Corporation (CPC), located in
Jiangsu Province, already has requested a long-term supply of 200,000 tpy over
20 years starting in 1995. The remaining 290,000 tpy of output would be sold
directly to consumers in the Nanjing area.
D. The Technical Assistance ComDonent
6.10      The technical assistance component is designed to help China
strengthen its domestic capabilities for basic cement material research and
cement plant process engineering. Under SABMI's sponsorship, the four
research and design institutions participating in this component would imple-
ment their respective five-year work programs, developed in consultation with
the Bank during project preparation. They involve the implementation of crit-
ical research and development activities, the acquisition of new equipment,
technologies and computer software, and staff training. The major activities
supported in each of the institutions are as follows: (i) RIC is to purchase
new equipment for material testing and analysis, carry out staff training, and
engage in joint research with foreign institutes; (ii) TCIDI is to purchase a
new computer, establish a computer-assisted design (CAD) work station, and
carry out staff training; (iii) NCIDI is to establish a computer network,
install a CAD system, purchase testing and analyzing equipment, and carry out
staff training; and (iv) HCIDI is to purchase advanced equipment for scien-
tific research and technical design and introduce a CAD system. (Detailed
work programs are available in the Project File No. 8 and are summarized in
Annex 6.5.) During loan negotiations, an assurance was obtained from the
Government that it would have the relevant training carried out in accordance
with programs agreed with the Bank.



- 29 -
6.11      HCIDI would carry out the study for small-scale plants (para. 3.27)
under the sponsorship of SABMI. The study would: (i) investigate the econo-
mic viability of investing in new small plants or rehabilitating existing
ones; (ii) recommend policies and incentives to optimize the configuration of
small plants; and (iii) provide technical support to rehabilitate potentially
economic small plants in terms of production efficiency and pollution control.
(The agreed terms of reference for the study are presented in Annex 6.6.)
During loan negotiations, an assurance was obtained from the Government that
it would have the study carried out in accordance with the terms of reference
and timing agreed to with the Bank.
VII. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
A. Engineering ArranRements
7.1       TCIDI, which prepared the feasibility study for the plant, would
carry out detailed engineering for the Tongling facilities based on load dia-
grams and arrangement drawings to be provided by the successful bidder for the
main international procurement package. TCIDI has already received assistance
from internationally experienced consultants in critical technology areas such
as process selection, basic design and layout of plant and terminal, bulk
shipping, and basic engineering for critical process areas. Internationally
renowned consultants in cement process engineering also assisted in preparing
the feasibility study, and the technical specifications for the tender docu-
ments for procurement. The least-cost bulk shipping and inland bulk transport
systems were designed with significant inputs from international consultants.
7.2       The Ningbo grinding plant would be designed by TCIDI, in collabora-
tion with the Zhejiang Design Institute of Building Materials (ZDIBM). Both
institutes have experience in the design, engineering, construction, and
start-up of comparable plants. Most of the key design features for the
Tongling cement grinding facility would be copied for the Ningbo plant.
7.3       NCIDI, which prepared the feasibility study for the Zhongguo compo-
nent, would carry out the detailed engineering for this component. Interna-
tional consultants were also hired to ensure the use of up-to-date technology:
Dyckerhoff Engineering Co. of Germany for the feasibility study, and Kaiser
Engineering Co. of the US in preparing technical specifications for the tender
documents. The main equipment supplier would provide the load diagrams and
arrangement drawings, which would be used as the basis for NCIDI's detailed
engineering.
B. Project Management
7.4       SABMI would have primary responsibility for monitoring project
implementation and for overall coordination of the construction work. A Proj-
ect Coordination Group, which has been set up within SABMI (Annex 7.1), would
review progress on project implementation, the budget, and procurement on a
regular basis and would coordinate efforts to resolve any problems. During
negotiations, an assurance was obtained from the Government that the group
would be maintained during project implementation.



- 30 -
7.5       Project Management Teams have beer. formed at the project entities
(Annex 7.2). ATCC has a team of 40 managerial and technical staff, led by a
project manager. This team would be expanded to include about 74 technical
personnel and 25 managerial staff as project implementation progresses. NCC
has established a team of 27, headed by a vice director. This team has five
functional sections, responsible, respectively, for planning and financing,
machinery and equipment, materials supply, civil construction, and administra-
tion. SABMI's Project Coordination Group would coordinate implementation of
the technical assistance component in collaboration with the respective proj-
ect managers of the four design institutions. During loan negotiations, an
assurance was obtained from the companies that they would maintain their
respective project management teams during project implementation.
C. Implementation Schedule
7.6       Implementation of the Tongling and Zhongguo components is expected
to take 48 months from the signing of supply contract for the major equipment
package. The technical assistance component is expected to take 24 months
from the date of loan approval. The overall project is scheduled for comple-
tion by December 31, 1995. (A detailed project implementation schedule, with
key target milestones for monitoring project implementation, is presented in
Annex 7.3.)
D. Environmental Aspects
7.7       Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for the Tongling and
Zhongguo components were carried out by local design institutes and have been
approved by the state and local environmental protection agencies (EPA.).
(These assessments, which are satisfactory, are given in Project File No. 8.)
The international engineering consultants assisting in project preparation
took various measures to minimize any adverse environmental impacts
(Tongling), and to obtain maximum improvements of emission control (Zhongguo),
particularly through the selection of appropriate processes and suitable pol-
lution control equipment. The major pollutant from cement manufacturing,
emitted particulates, would be reduced to a satisfactory level by electro-
static precipitators and baghouses. No emission of noxious substances or any
liquid emissions other than sewage is envisaged; the sewage would be treated
in septic tanks and by chlorination. Project preparation has already resulted
in environmental improvements for the Zhongguo plant. Following the issuance
of the ETA, ZCC undertook critical measures to improve dust collection equip-
ment for kilns, slag driers, and cement mills at the existing plant. In
designing the bulk cargo terminals and carriers which will be constructed
outside the scope of the project, measures to minimize pollution to the envi-
ronment have been incorporated; these are satisfactory to the local environ-
mental protection agencies and the Bank, and include dust collectors installed
at the terminals and the ships and a closed conveyor belt system for bulk
cement loading and unloading. Environmental monitoring and control units are
to be set up for all the three project companies, and training will be
provided for the key staff of these units under the project. The project
companies will also institute their respective environmental management and
monitoring programs, which will cover all recommendations in EIAs as well as
additional items suggested by the Bank.



- 31 -
7.8       The design of project components is in compliance with local statu-
tory environmental standards applied to cement. A comparison of the design
pollution discharge allowed for the proposed project facilities with the emis-
sion standards in Bank guidelines is presented in Annex 7.4. Bank guidelines
are stricter than the local standards in some key areas, such as source emis-
sions of dust (particulates) and emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas at
battery limits. In these areas, the project companies have agreed to adopt
the Bank's standards and would incorporate the necessary changes in the design
of the de-dusting equipment. In addition, they have agreed not to use asbes-
tos cement in the construction of any project facility.
7.9       Importantly, environmental assessment of small cement plants, which
are characterized by low energy efficiency and poor pollution control, will be
conducted within the scope of the study on small cement plants under the tech-
nical assistance component (para. 6.11 and Annex 6.6). For environmental
assessment, several representative small plants will be selected to identify
areas for improving the environmental quality of such plants in China.
7.10      Assurances were obtained from ATCC, NCC, and ZCC that they would
build and operate the project plants with due regard for safety, ecological
and environmental factors, and would comply with environmental standards sat-
isfactory to the Bank.
VIII. CAPITAL COSTS. FINANCING PLAN, PROCUREMENT. AND DISBURSEMENT
A. CaRital Cost Estimates
8.1       The total financing required for the project is estimated at
$265.1 million equivalent, including interest during construction (IDC) and
the commitment charges for the Bank loan. The incremental working capital
would amount to $7.3 million (Y 40.3 million); most of it is to finance inven-
tories for the Tongling component. IDC and the commitment charges for the
Bank loan are estimated at $8.7 million. The foreign exc1-nge costs are
$82.7 million, or 31.2 percent of project costs. The capital cost estimates
are presented in detail in Annex 8.1 and are summarized below in Table 8.1.
8.2       The base cost estimates are expressed in June 1991 prices.  They
were derived from estimates prepared by the project entities and SABMI, in
collaboration with the domestic design institutes and international engineer-
ing companies. The exchange rate used to convert the base cost estimates from
yuan to dollar is Y 5.36 to $1. Physical contingencies are equivalent to
10 percent of the base cost. The price contingencies for the foreign exchange
costs were calculated on the basis of projected international inflation rates
of 4.9 percent per annum for 1991 and 3.9 percent per annum thereafter. Pro-
jected annual local inflation rates of 10 percent for 1991, 8 percent for
1992, 5 percent for 1993 and thereafter were applied for costs expressed in
local currency. Imported equipment and materials would be exempt from duties.

B. Financing Plan
8.3 The proposed Bank loan of $82.7 million would finance 100 percent of the
foreign exchange requirements including IDC on the Bank loan, and 31.2 percent
of the total financing requirements. The remaining financing would be met by
equ.ity contributions from State, provincial, and municipal investment
companies--22.6 percent, internal funds of the project companies--5.2 percent,
grants from NJMC and CPC--7.8 percent, loans from the investment companies--
23.0 percent, and loans from ICBC--10.3 percent. The proposed financing plan
for the project is shown in Table 8.2 on the next page.
8.4        Foreian Exchange Cost Financing and Bank Loan.  The proposed Bank
loan would be made to GOC at the Bank's standard variable interest rate for 20
years, including a five-year grace period, and with the Bank's standard com-
mitment fee. The major portion of the loan would be onlent by GOC to ATCC,
NCC, and ZCC, respectively, through APG, NBMG, and NJCG, at an interest rate
equivalent to 110 percent of the Bank's variable loan rate, with the corre-
sponding commitment charge and a repayment period of 15 years, including five
years of grace. ATCC would receive $45.9 million, NCC $8.0 million, and ZCC
$25.2 million. These loan amounts include the interest during construction on
the B8nk loan to the three project companies, to meet their cash flow needs
during the construction period; these companies are financially autonomous
entities. The remaining $3.6 million would be made available, through SABMI,

to the four research and design institutes on terms and conditions satisfac-
tory to the Bank. The foreign exchange risk would in all cases be passed on
to the beneficiaries. During loan negotiations, an assurance was obtained
from the Government on the above onlending terms and that the subsidiary loan
agreements would be signed between GOC and APG, GOC and NBMG, GOC and NJHG,
APG and ATCC, NBMG and NCC, and NJMG and ZCC, on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Bank, as a condition of loan effectiveness.
8.5       Local Eguitv Financing.  Financing plans for ATCC and NCC represent
a new type of financing for state-sponsored investments in China. Equity-type
funding for state-owned enterprises became available with the creation of the
State and local investment companies in 1989 (para. 2.7).  Legislation on the
joint stock system has yet to be enacted for equity shares to be issued by
state-owned enterprises.  However, as an experiment on the role and function
of the newly formed investment companies in the process of introducing a
shareholding ownership system, two "joint stock" companies would be formed
(paras. 2.8 and 2.15).
8.6       ATCC's local equity financing requirements would be met by SRMIC,
TCIC and APCIC. APCIC would provide Y 158 million ($28.0 million), or
53 percent of ATCC's paid-in capital. SRMIC and TCIC would each provide
Y 100 million ($17.4 million) and Y 42 million ($73 million), equivalent to
33 percent and 14 percent of ATCC's paid-in capital, respectively. NCC's
local equity financing requirements would be met by NIC, BDIC and SRMIC--NIC
would provide Y 21.6 million ($3.8 million), BDIC, Y 10.0 million
($1.7 million) and SRMIC, Y 8.4 million ($1.5 million). The already estab-
lished ZCC would provide Y 83.6 million ($12.8 million), or 17.4 percent of
its local financing requirements, from internally generated funds. In addi-
tion, NJMG and CPC (a prospective long-term buyer .of ZCC's product participat-
ing in exchange for ZCC's supply guaranty for 20 years) would provide grants
of, respectively, Y 70.5 million and Y 40 million.
8.7       Local Debt Financing.  Debt financing would be used to meet the
remaining local financing requirements. This financing would take the form of
construction loans for fixed assets and funds for working capital. ATCC would
borrow Y 229.6 million ($40.8 million) from APCIC and Y 113.1 million
($20.1 million) from SRMIC, both at an interest rate of 8.28 percent per
annum, with a repayment period of 15 years and a grace period equal to the
construction period. NCC and ZCC would receive, respectively, a loan of
Y 45.5 million ($9.9 million) and a loan of Y 22.2 million ($4.2 million) from
ICBC with the same terms. ZCC would receive an additional loan of
Y 57.0 million ($10.6 million) from ICBC with an interest rate of 14.4 percent
per annum, a rate applied to investments for renovation projects. Working
capital loans would be provided by ICBC at its prevailing rate for similar
investments, as follows: ATCC would receive Y 13.4 million, NCC
Y 10.2 million, and ZCC Y 1.5 million.
8.8       In the last three years, as the Government implemented a tight
credit policy to fight inflation, several construction projects experienced
delays in project implementation because of shortfalls in local funds. To
avoid such problems, the project companies have agreed to prepare quarterly
funding schedules, properly endorsed by related providers of funds and Govern-
ment agencies, for Bank review before loan negotiations. During negotiations,



- 35 -
a confirmation was obtained from the Jovernment that it would take all neces-
sary actions to enable the companies to implement the project in accordance
with the quarterly funding schedules agreed to with the Bank.
C. Procurement
8.9       The items to be procured with the proceeds of the Bank loan are
mainly equipment, technology, and training. The procurement arrangements for
the project are summarized in Table 8.3.

Note:   The figures in parentheses are the amounts to be financed by the Bank.
8.10      International Procurement.  A major portion of the equipment, mate-
rials, and technical services (83 percent of those financed by the Bank loan)
would be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accor-
dance with Bank guidelines. Bidding documents for the major packages have
already been prepared with technical input from international consultants
(paras. 7.1-7.3). Under ICB, domestic manufacturers would be given a margin
of preference of 15 percent or the prevailing custom duty, whichever is lower.
Technical assistance services would be selected according to Bank guidelines
for the use of consultants. No limited international bidding is envisaged.
8.11      Contracts for small or miscellaneous off-the-shelf items, estimated
to cost less than $200,000 per contract, would be procured through interna-
tional shopping from at least three qualified and eligible suppliers, up to an
aggregate amount of $3.2 million.



- 36 -
8.12      The packaging of procurement for the Tongling and Zhongguo compo-
nents was designed to ensure that single party performance warranties would be
obtained for each well-defined process area. There would be seven main pack-
ages for ICB, each of which would have an estimated value of $1.0 million or
more. The details of these seven packages are summarized in Annex 8.2. Four
of them would apply to the Tongling component (two for ATCC and two for NCC),
three to the Zhongguo component. All these packages would be subject to prior
Bank review; they would represent 82 percent of the total value of contracts
to be financed by the World Bank. Packages with individual values below
$1.0 million would be subject to post-review by the Bank. International
procurement would be executed by the International Tendering Company (ITC), in
cooperation with SABMI's Project Coordinating Group.
8.13      Retroactive Financing.  To avoid delays in project implementation,
the Bank loan would retroactively finance up to $500,000 of eligible expendi-
tures for international travel for technical surveys incurred between
October 31, 1991, and the date of loan signing.
8.14      Local Procurement Arrangements.  Procurement for equipment and mate-
rials to be purchased in China would be carried out by the operating companies
with assistance from SABMI's procurement department and the corresponding
design institutes. Since the project has been identified as a national prior-
ity, supply of the majority of local construction materials and plant and
equipment would be governed by the allocation system used for priority proj-
ects. During loan negotiations, a confirmation was obtained from GOC that
services for civil works and construction would be obtained through competi-
tive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank.
D. Allocation and Disbursement of the Bank Loan
8.15      The allocation of the Bank loan among ATCC, NCC, ZCC9 and SABMI is
summarized in Table 8.4 below.

la IDC and comitment fees on the tank loan.
8.16      To facilitate the disbursement of funds, a special account would be
opened at a local bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. It
would be established with an initial amount of $5 million, an average of four



- 37 -
months of estimated expenditures to be paid from the Special Account. Appli-
cations for replenishment would be made monthly or when the amounts withdrawn
were 50 percent or more of the authorized amount, whichever came first. Dis-
bursements for training activities and individual contracts for goods costing
less than $200,000 equivalent would be made on the basis of statements of
expenditure (SOEs). The supporting documentation would be retained by the
implementing agency for the Bank to review during supervision missions. The
special account and SOEs would be audited in a manner acceptable to the Bask
(para. 9.11).
8.17      The project completion date would be December 31, 1995, and the
closing date is expected to be June 30, 1996. An estimated disbursement sche-
dule has been prepared for the project, based on Bank experience with previous
comparab'le projects in China. The schedule is a little shorter than the dis-
bursement profile suggested for industrial projects in China (Annex 8.3), but
is reasonable given that the project's critical preparation activities such as
technical designs, international procurement of key processes and equipment
(including preparation of procurement packages), and site preparation have
already been undertaken.
IX. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Financial Management Practices in China
9.1       Financial Autonomy.  Historically, enterprises in China have had
little financial autonomy. In the past, the Government made all financial
decisions and approved all new investments. Enterprises remitted all or most
of their internally generated funds to the Government and in turn received
investment grants through budget allocations. With the enterprise reforms
(para. 2.6), four major changes in financial practices have taken place.
First, enterprises are allowed to retain 100 percent of their depreciation
allowances. Second, enterprises are allowed to retain a higher portion of
their profits. Third, new funding requirements, including those for invest-
ments, are to be met out of a company's internally retained funds or interest-
bearing loans. Fourth, enterprises may utilize an increasing portion of their
internally retained funds without prior Government approval. These changes in
financial practices in turn make it necessary for companies to move beyond the
traditional one-year operational and financial targets and engage in longer
term financial planning.
9.2       Financial Accountinft and Audits.  The Chinese accounting system is
governed by several national and local regulations. These regulations give
the system several unique features, such as: (i) maintenance of two separate
unconsolidated accounts: one for production operations, the other for con-
struction projects; (ii) inclusion of interest charges in production costs, so
that operating income reflects the company's financial structure; and
(iii) matching of funding sources with corresponding types of assets, e.g.9
fixed assets with fixed funds, current assets with current funds, and special
assets with special funds. The financial statements of Chinese enterprises
are subject to external audits by the State Audit Administration (SAM), which
was established in 1983. The quality of SAA's financial audits, which were



- 38 -
only marginally satisfactory in the beginning, has shown significant improve-
ment in recent years. The Bank has been supporting the Government's efforts
to improve its auditing capability through training under the first Technical
Cooperation Credit (Credit 1412-CHA).
B. Financial Performance and Proiections
9.3       The financial projections for ATCC, NCC, and ZCC were carried out on
the basis of current yuan. The prices of inputs and outputs are based on the
prices that companies are most likely to pay or receive in accordance with the
pricing arrangements made for the project. The relationships between input
and output prices are assumed to remain unchanged at their September 1991
levels throughout the life of the project. This assumption is conservative,
given that the assumed average output price of the project is about 5 percent
lower than the current free market prices and about 25 percent lower than
import parity prices (the CIF price plus transport costs from the importing
port to the consuming area). After making several adjustments for the Chinese
accounting system, detailed financial projections were prepared in accordance
with international accounting conventions. (The key assumptions used in the
financial projections are provided in Annex 9.1.) Selected data for the com-
panies' past and projected future finances are shown in Table 9.1.
9.4       ATCC.  Because it is not yet established, ATCC does not have histor-
ical financial records. During its first year of operations (1995), ATCC is
projected to show an operating loss, common for new companies because of low
capacity utilization in the initial years of operation. However, it is
expected to show a positive cash flow. The net profit is expected to increase
from a negative Y 11.2 million in 1995 to a positive Y 6.8 million in 1996.
From 1995 onwards, it is expected to achieve satisfactory performance. (See
Annex 9.2 for a summary of ATCC's project financial statements.) Because
these estimates assume rather low capacity utilization during the early years
and conservative estimates of output pricing (para. 9.3), downside risks in
the projections are not considered significant. With the build-up of capac-
ity, ATCC's net profit margin would increase from a negative 11 percent in
1995 to 22 percent starting in 1998, when its operations stabilize. Debt
servicing capacity is adequate at all times, at 1.5 times and higher. ATCC's
debt to equity ratio is maintained at satisfactory levels of no more than
68:32. The profitability of the average assets in operation would reach
10 percent per annum by 1998, an acceptable level for industrial projects in
China.
9.5       NCC.  The financial operations of NCC would follow the pattern of
ATCC, although, despite lower investments and slightly higher prices, NCC
shows lower profitability primarily because of higher raw materials costs
(mainly clinker). NCC's net profit margins are projected to increase from
1.4 percent in 1995 to 7.0 percent by 2000. The return on assets before
financial charges is projected to be high (13 percent by 1998), a condition
that to some extent justifies the higher level of borrowing. Its long-term
debt to equity ratio reaches a high of 69:31 at the end of 1994 and would
improve every year. Thr debt service coverage ratios and current ratios are
anticipated to remain at satisfactory levels over the life of the project.
(See Annex 9.3 for a summary of NCC's projected financial statements.)

9.6              ZCC.  Over the last five years, ZCC has managed to generate profits
even though it had to sell a large portion of its output at state and
provincially controlled prices. At the end of 1990, ZCC was in a strong
financial position, with a current ratio of 2.7 and no long-term debts.
9.7              After project completion, ZCC's profitability is expected to
improve.  Its capacity would increase from 480,000 tpy in 1991 to 970,000 tpy
in 19979 when the new facility reaches full capacity. The conversion from
wet- to dry-process technology would reduce its variable costs significantly.
ZCC is expected to be able to maintain a satisfactory financial structure,
with a debt to equity ratio of 75:25 or better. Throughout the construction



- 40 -
period, debt service coverage ratios would be over 1.8 times, and net profit
margins over 13 percent. With the commissioning of the new lines under the
project, the company's gross sales would triple to over Y 300 million, and ite
net income is expected to reach Y 32 million by 1997. Thereafter its
financial ratios are expected to improve over the next 10-year period. (See
Annex 9.3 for a summary of ZCC's projected financial statements.)
C. Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
9.8       The financial rates of return (FRRs) for investments made by ATCC,
NCC, and ZCC are 12.4 percent, 16.3 percent, and 11.9 percent, respectively.
Sensitivity tests were run on key variables such as cement prices, capital
costs, and scheduling delays. The results are shown in Table 9.2. The tests
indicate that, even under adverse conditions, the project would perform at
satisfactory levels.

D. Financial Covenants ar.d Reportinr Recauirements
9.9       During negotiations, agreement was reached that each of the three
companies would maintain: (i) a long-term debt to equity ratio of 75:25 or
betteri (ii) a current ratio of 1.2 or better; and (iii) a debt service
coverage ratio of at least 1.2. An assurance was obtained from the companies
that they would prepare and furnish to the Bank for review, by October 31 of
each year from 1992 to 1997, their rolling five-year financial plans, includ-
ing production, marketing, and investment plans in the fvrm of projected
financial statements. Such plans would be supported by: (i) a detailed anal-
ysis of trends in production costs; (ii) an analysis of operational and finan-
cial performance vis-a-vis planned targets; and (iii) financing arrangements
for investments proposed over the five-year period.
9.10      An assurance was obtained that the accounts of ATCC, NCC, and ZCC
would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and that the
annual audited financial statements for both the production and capital con-
struction accounts would be prepared in a form acceptable to the Bank, and



- 41 -
would be submitted to the Bank within six months after the close of each fis-
cal year. The audit report would include the audited project accounts relat-
ing to the Bank loans, SOEs and special accounts. The audit would certify
compliance with the above financial covenants and include relevant supporting
calculations.
9.11      An assurance was also obtained that the Government would have
SABMI's project accounts for the technical assistance component audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. In China, the audit of public
sector accounts and companies is performed by the SAA, usually by the provin-
cial bureau of SMA where the companies are located. During project implemen-
tation, SABII would use the project progress reports submitted by the compa-
nies to prepare and provide the Bank with a quarterly summary of the project's
status using the format for progress reporting suggested by the Bank. This
summary would contain, among other things, the status of project implementa-
tion in relation to planned milestones (Annex 7.3) and expenditures, the sta-
tus of procurement, disbursements from the Bank loan during the period and
cumulative amounts to date, and current problems and proposed actions. Within
six months after project completion, each of the implementing agencies and
SABMI would prepare and provide to the Bank a project completion report (PCR)
for their respective component of the project. The report would cover imple-
mentation, initial operations, projected costs and benefits, and actual costs
and benefits.
X. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
10.1      The economic rates of return (ERRs) for the two investment compo-
nents were calculated on an incremental basis. The economic analysis for the
Tongling component covers costs and benefits of all the related facilities,
including those at Tongling and Ningbo, and all other related handling and
transport costs. While the technical assistance component would create
significant economic benefits, no attempt was made to quantify them. The key
assumptions used in the economic analysis are given in detail in Annex 10.1.
A. Economic Costs and Benefits
10.2      Economic Benefits.  The quantifiable benefits of the project come
from three sources: (i) the new high-grade cement production from the
Tongling component; (ii) the expanded cement production from the Zhongguo
component; and (iii) the improved economic efficiency of production through
the revamping of operations at the Zhongguo plant.                   2
10.3      The economic value of cement, expressed in 1991 US dollars, at the
ex-factory level was assumed conservatively at its CIF Shanghai import price
in bag. While the value should be calculated by adding unloading, port
handling, and rail transportation costs from the Shanghai port to the cement
consuming areas, this conservative approach was adopted given the possibility
that Shanghai could become the final destination of at least part of the pro-
ject output.



- 42 -
10.4      Economic Costs.  The economic value of the tradable inputs was based
on their estimated border prices: CIF prices for imports and FOB prices for
exportable inputs. Nontradable inputs were converted to their economic value
by applying their respective conversion factors.
B. Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
10.5      The base case ERRs in constant terms were 18.6 percent for the
Tongling component and 16.8 percent for the Zhongguo component. The ERR for
the entire project is 18.1 percent. (The economic cost and benefit streams
for the ERR calculations are given in Annex 10.2.)
10.6      The results of the sensitivity and switching-value analysis are
summarized in Table 10.1. They indicate that the ERRs for the project are
sensitive to changes in the benefits from sales, which are closely related to
international cement prices. The ERRs are less sensitive to changes in capi-
tal costs, delays in completion, and fluctuations in input costs. The ERRs
for both Tongling and Zhongguo components are not expected to fall below a
minimal satisfactory level of 10 percent--the assumed opportunity cost of
capital in China--under conceivable adverse situations. Even under the
assumption that the project output had to be exported due to lack of domeotic
demand, the project is expected to show a satisfactory ERR.
10.7      The ERR for the project is higher than its FRR mainly because the
assumed economic value of the cement output is higher than its financial
price. The higher ERRs resulted even though the economic prices of the major
inputs, particularly electricity, are assumed to be much higher than their
financial prices.
C. Other Benefits
10.8      Once full operating capacity is reached, the project should result
in a net increase in high-grade cement production of 1.85 million tpy, that
will help meet the growing demand that would otherwise have to be met by
imports. This substitution would yield about $100 million a year in gross
foreign exchange savings in 1991 prices, about $90 million net of the annual
service on the foreign debt. The project would also result in the direct
employment of about 2,000 people and substantial indirect employment in
related industries: construction, equipment manufacturing, shipping, and
terminal operations. As noted in paras. 3.31 and 3.32, the project would
serve as a model for the introduction of new cement equipment, technology, and
marketing arrangements within a JSC-type framework. The benefits from the
technical assistance component, albeit difficult to quantify, are considered
to be significant and to apply across the sector.
D. Proiect Risks
10.9      Given the chronic deficit of high-grade cement in the SER and else-
where in China (other than in the recent past when the ongoing economic
austerity program resulted in significant cutbacks in capital construction)
shortfalls in the projected demand for the project's output are not perceived
as a risk. The sensitivity test of economic analysis shows a satisfactory ERR
even with the assumption of exporting the entire project output (para. 10.6).

The main technical risk for the Tongling component is the need for cross-
provincial coordination of plant construction and operations and transport of
the output after start-up. This risk has been minimized by designing con-
tracts to ensure timely installation of related facilities, off-take and
shipping of the project output, and flexibility in the bulk-handling capacity
of the receiving terminals. An assurance was obtained from the Government
that it would have or cause to have all the related facilities completed in a
timely manner (para. 6.6). Any delay in the construction of one terminal
could be absorbed, to a large extent, by consumers in Anhui Province where the
cement plant will be located. Another technical risk for both the Tongling
and Zhongguo components is the lack of Chinese experience with this type of
plant design. This risk has been reduced by the use of internationally expe-
rienced consultants in the basic design of the project facilities and the
preparation of the technical specifications for the major processes and equip-
ment. These risks would be further reduced by the design of equipment pro-
curement packages that would place single party responsibility for performance
in the process areas (para. 8.12). Seven major procurement packages would be
used for the project, two for ATCC, two for NCC, and three for ZCC. The
shortages of local counterpart funds for the project could delay the implemen-
tation of the project (para. 8.8). Agreement with the project entities and



- 44 -
tho Government on the quarterly funding schedule for the project, which has
been endorsed by respective providers of funds and Government agencies, would
reduce this potential risk significantly.
XI. AGREENTS REACHED AND RECOMNDATIONS
11.1      During negotiations, confirmation was obtained from the Government
that it woulds
(i) take all the necessary actions to enable the companies to
implement the project in accordance with the quarterly funding

9.9);
(viii) prepare and furnish to the Bank for review, by October 31 of
each year from 1992 to 1997, their rolling five-year plans,
including production, marketing, and investment plans in the
form of projected financial statements (para. 9.9); and
(ix)  comply with the atAiting and reporting requirements (paras.
9.10 and 9.11).
11.4      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from ATCC and NCC that
each one would:
(i) inform the Bank promptly of any changes in its charter, joint
venture agreement, or management structure (paras. 5.5 and
5.8).
11.5      The cond4tions for loan effectiveness are:

GOC and NBMG, GOC and NJMG, APG and ATCC, NBMG and NCC, and
NJHG and ZCC, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank (para. 8.4).
11.6      Subject to the above assurances and arrangements, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of $82.7 million equivalent to the People's Republic
of China at the Bank's standard variable interest rate for 20 years, including
five years of grace.

CHINA
REGIONAL CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
EnterDrise Ownership and Management Reforms in China
A. Introduction
1.        As of the end of 1988 China had about 421,000 industrial enter-
prises, including rural township enterprises but not village enterprises,
which accounted for 84 percent of industrial production in 1988; in addition,
there were over 800,000 village enterprises. Chinese enterprises are diverse
in terms of ownership and size and exhibit a wide range of owne-ship, organiz-
ational and management arrangements, mainly as a consequence of reforms in the
19808.
2.        Since 1979 under the ongoing economic reforms, various changes have
been introduced gradually and cautiously to the Chinese enterprise ownership
and management structure to promote economic efficiency of enterprise manage-
ment. This note summarizes: (1) trends in enterprise ownership structure and
management arrangements under reforms; (2) the currant enterprise reform
issues; (3) Bank role and contributions in this area; and (4) experimentation
of reform measures being considered under future Bank operations.
S. EnterDrise OwnershiD Structure and Management Arrangements under Reforms
3.        The central theme of enterprise reforms has been the decentraliza-
tion of decision making, from the government to enterprises and from higher
government tiers to lower ones as a means of improving the efficiency of
enterprises. Specific measures, which have altered the traditional forms of
Chinese enterprises to a large degree, were related mainly to: (i) increased
operational and financial autonomy for state-owned enterprises; (ii) the
decentralization and delegation of control over enterprises from the higher to
lower government tiers; and (iii) encouraging domestic and foreign joint ven-
tures, and mini-scale private enterprises to complement the state enterprise
system.
Ownership Structure
4.        Traditionail '3wnership Structure.  Traditionally there were three
distinctive forms of enterprises: (a) state enterprises; (b) collective
enterprises; and (c) individual (private) enterprises.l/ Assets of state
enterprises, which dominate heavy industrial production and control a majority
1/   Under the current Chinese Constitution, three basic forms of property
ownership are recognized: (a) ownership by the whole people (state owner-
ship); (b) collective ownership by the working people (collective owner-
ship); and (c) ownership by the private/individual economy (private/lindi-
vidual ownership). Individual ownership was officially recognized by the
Constitution in 1982. Private ownership of enterprises was allowed by
the "Regulations on Private Enterprises", issued on June 25, 1988 by the
State Council.



- 47 -                            ANNEX 1.1
Page 2
of the other industrial sectors, are in principle owned by the state. state
enterprises merely have the right to use and manage the state's property, and
had been severely limited in their ability to manage and dispose of their
assets. Collective enterprises, owned by a group of individuals, usually
workers or peasants in the collective, operate primarily in the agricultural,
services and light industry sectors. While collective enterprises are sup-
posed to be managed with autonomy by their members, many collectives, espe-
cially larger urban ones, have in practice been administratively absorbed by
local government authorities and operate as virtual local state enterprises.
The collective itself owns its assets, but it is in principle a "nonprivate"
ownership. Individual (2rivate) enterprises, which were permitted to exist
only to complement the public ownership to the minimum extent possible, were
encouraged by Chinese policy to collectivize.
5.        Enterprise Ownership Structure under the Reforms.  Under the econo-
mic reforms which started in 1979, various attempts were made to stimulate
enterprises to become more efficient, including changes to the enterprise
ownership structure. The first campaign in the area of enterprise reforms was
to increase enterprise autonomy by separation of management and ownership.
Under the General Principles of the Civil Codes, state enterprises, collective
enterprises, and Chinese-foreign joint ventures were recognized as legal
persons, and the limited liability of these enterprises was recognized. Major
experimentations with the enterprise ownership structure are summarized below.
(a) State Enterorises. Four important regulations by the State Coun-
cil--the State Industrial Enterprise Regulations of 1983, the Fur-
ther Autonomy of State Industrial Enterprise Regulations of May 10,
1984, and the Interim Provisions on Problems in Invigorating State
Enterprises of September 11, 1985, and the State-Owned Industrial
L&w of April 21, 1988--increased the autonomy of state enterprises
in the following areas: (i) disposal of, rent or transfer of their
surplus assets, including contributions to domestic joint ventures;
(ii) transfer of depreciation funds from the state to enterprises;
(iii) increased scope for operating outside the plan; (iii) a larger
share of profit retention by state enterprises; and (iv) greater
autonomy of management for production, personnel management, market-
ing, and wage determination. Despite increased control over their
assets, state enterprises still do not own their assets. Securiti-
zation of state enterprises, along with the establishment of inde-
pendent boards of directors, for the purpose of divesting state
ownership to workers, managers and other investors in the form of
stock, has been debated between opponents and proponents since 1985.
To date, state enterprises have been prohibited from issuing stock
to the public under the directive of the State Council issued in
April 1987; on a experimental basis, several state enterprises were
allowed to issue stocks for employees to own minority interest.
Another noteworthy trend during the reform period was that some
small state enterprises (as opposed to large and medium-sized enter-
prises) have been converted to collectives or, to a limited extent,
leased-out to private operations. At present, the Shanghai Munici-
pality is preparing an experimental regulation, in collaboration
with the SRC, on limited share companies, which, if promulgated,



- 48 -                            ANNEX 1.I
Page 3
to provide a legal framework for the issuance of shares of state-
owned enterprises to the public.
(b)  Collective EnterDrises.  Collective enterprises have shown remark-
able vitality and adaptability under the economic reforms. Hany
small state enterprises were converted to collective enterprises,
and tremendous numbers of new collective enterprises have been
formed. In particular, large numbers of new rural collective enter-
prises, operated by villages and townships (townshiR and village
enterprises. TVEs) and groups of individuals, mushroomed in areas
close to major cities. While collectives are still considered a
form of "public ownership," the reality is that some collectives now
have more of a private flavor, providing a scope for entrepreneurial
activities. New collective enterprises have been among the leaders
in experimenting with bond and, to a lesser degree, stock issuances.
(c) Private and Quasi-private Enterprises. According to the 1988 regu-
lations on private enterprises, private ownership can take the form
of a sole proprietorship, partnership, and limited liability com-
pany. Under the reforms, private enterprises have been promoted as
a useful supplement to public ownership. The new regulations have
eliminated limitations on the number of employees, and expanded the
lines of business they enter. Limited liability companies can have
up to 30 investors. However, stocks cannot be issued to the public
and can only be transferred with the consent of the majority of the
investors. Under the Regulations, private enterprises are permitted
to set prices and fees according to state pricing regulations, and
to determine the wage and profit system of the enterprise. However,
the managers' salary levels as well as the minimum reinvestment of
profits are also regulated.
(d) New Hybrids. The reforms have created a new breed of enterprises
which does not exist in other economies, namely, domestic joint
ventures. Under the traditional centrally planned economy, state
enterprises fit into a hierarchical bureaucratic system and report
to ministries and local governments for planning and operational
purposes. In order to break these bureaucratic barriers between
different administrative agencies and between geographic regions,
the government adopted regulations to promote domestic joint ven-
ures.2/ There are three types" (i) joint ventures formed through
the merger of production enterprises and units; (ii) joint ventures
where an original enterprise has solicited outside investment to
form an new venture; and (iii) joint ventures formed through the
joint investment of existing enterprises and units. The nature of
ownership of these joint ventures, in particular the ones between
state enterprises and collectives/private enterprises, is not clear.
2I   Related regulations are the Ninistry of Finance's Regulations Regarding
Certain Questions Relating to Domestic Joint Ventures, and the State
Council Regulations Regarding Certain Questions in Further Promoting
Lateral Economic Ties, both adopted in early 1986.



- 49-                             ANNEX 1.1
Page 4
At present, any joint venture with state enterprise participation
should subscribe to accounting rules applicable to state enter-
prises.
ManageaMnt Arranaements
6.        State enterprises have been the ones affected the most in terms of
management arrangements among different type of Chinese enterprises. As men-
tioned earlier, many small state enterprises were converted to collectives.
Others have also undergone various changes in terms of management arrange-
ments. During 1978-83, the scope for operating outside the plan was created;
enterprise retention of depreciation funds was allowed; financing method has
changed from direct government budget allocation to bank loans; and a workers'
bonus system was introduced. During 1984-86, price negotiations of the above-
quota output were allowed; profits taxes replaced the system of profit
remittance to the government; new procedures for appointment of enterprise
managers were introduced; hiring and firing of managers and workers by enter-
prise directors became possible; and a bankruptcy law and leasing of small
state enterprises to managers were introduced. Since 1987, the "management
responsibility contract system," the Chinese version of the deed of trust, was
introduced nationwide. Under the system, the role of directors has been
defined, and performance targets and evaluation criteria for them would be
agreed upon.
C. The Current Issues of EnterDrise Reforms
7.        The objectives and related main issues of enterprise reforms remain
unchanged since their start. The main question has been how to improve the
efficiency, innovativeness and competitiveness of Chinese, particularly state,
enterprises without changing the basic socialist form of dominant public own-
ership of enterprises. Three main related issues are how to: (i) diversify
ownership of enterprises with a view to overcome the interregional barriers to
trade, investment, and resource mobilization; (ii) separate management from
ownership to allow for increased enterprise a-1tonomy; and (iii) bring competi-
tion to provide incentives for enterprises to improve performance and inno-
vate. As experiences have been accumulated from experimentations with various
enterprise reform measures introduced to date, the Chinese government, acade-
micians and scholars were able to elaborate discussions on a framework of
future enterprise reforms; these measures relate mainly to regulatory and
policy environment and the "joint stock system." Major topics with respect to
the "joint stock system" currently under discussion are: (a) the design of
the "joint stock system" of enterprises along with a proper operational envi-
ronment conducive to improved efficiency and competitiveness of enterprises;
(b) ways to transform state enterprises to "joint stock companies"; and (c)
the degree of private ownership or shareholding of the means of production. A
draft of the Limited Liability Company Law is under consideration by the
Chinese government and would clarify many of the legal issues related to the
ownership of enterprise by one or more legal persons. Separately, there are
plans for shareholding company law, which would deal with issues concerning
the division of ownership in terms of shares and the ownership of shares by
the public. Regulations for the trading of such shares through the organized
stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen are already in place.

Page 5
Desi&n of the "Joint Stock System" for Public Ownership of Enterprises.
8.        In order to transform China's state enterprises into autonomous and
efficient economic units, questions on the following principles vith respect
to the nature of enterprises should be answered: (i) relationship between
ownership and management; (ii) ownership diversification; (iii) limited lia-
bility of enterprises; and (iv) incentives for increased management account-
ability.
9.        Ownership and I4anaaement.  One fundamental problem in dealing with
the issue of separating ownership and management is the current Chinese enter-
prise system which obligates enterprises to undertake both commercial and
social functions. Unless social functions and responsibilities, such as main-
tenance of employment, social welfare and support for other "family" enter-
prises, are taken away from them, enterprise profitability cannot be their
sole objective. Therefore, the main question is how to separate these two
conflicting functions, and prevent those who have conflicting interests from
exerting their influence on the management of enterprises. They consist of a
variety of central and local government agencies which have exercised
fundamental and powerful influence on state enterprise behavior for decades.
In this connection, urban housing reforms, which are currently receiving a new
focus as a main ingredient of future reforms, would have significant bearings
on the policy environment affecting future enterprise reforms.
10.       OwnershiR Diversification.  In the Chinese context, highly frag-
mented ownership might make it hard for owners to exert effective control over
an enterprise. The question is what is the proper level of dispersion of
public ownership, which ensures effective control through voting and represen-
tation on the board of directors and is geared to long-term growth of enter-
prise. One related issue is whether and how partial private ownership will be
allowed.
11.       Limited Liability of Enterprises.  The Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of
the People's Republic of China was adopted on December 2, 1986, and has gone
into force following the enactment of "The Law Concerning State Enterprises
Owned by the Whole People of the People's Republic of China," which became
effective on August 1, 1988. However, this law has not been widely applied to
date. In addition, it does not define clearly the liability of the enterprise
itself and its owners. The Limited Liability Company Law under consideration
should clarify this issue for different types of companies.
12.       Incentives for Manaaement Accountability.  If enterprise management
is separated from its ownership, another fundamental question is how to ensure
that those entrusted with management take their full responsibilities suffi-
ciently seriously. In most capitalist countries where enterprise ownership
and management are separated, two factors assuring management accountability
are built into the system: competition and rewards for good verformance.
Competition exists at various levels; among others, competition among
individuals for jobs and among enterprises in the same line of business (with
possible exits and entries of competitors). At present, competition is still
constrained in China given the predominant scope of state planning in inputs
allocation, production, and output distribution, and price setting and control



ANNEX 1.1
Page 6
of inputs and outputs. A difficult problem in this regard is that, even if
administrative controls are eliminated, distorted prices would lead to dis-
torted performance criteria for enterprise management, and eventually wrong
decisions on exits and entries; financial profit is an ambiguous indicator of
efficiency under distorted prices. In this context, this management account-
ability issue should be addressed in connection with price and market reforms.
Transformation of State Enterprises to "Joint Stock" Comganies (JSCs)
13.       Once an understanding is reached on what the JSC is and how it is
constituted, the next question is how to go about transformation of state
enterprises to JSCs. So far, there have been spontaneous experiments with
JSCs, many of which have involved misunderstanding of the concept. Against
this background, the most pressing issues with respect to this question relate
to: (i) the urgent need for standard formal regulations on the establishment
and operations of JSCs; (ii) distribution of ownership of enterprises among
particular ownership institutions; and (iii) phasing of experimentation and
transformation. The proposed Limited Liability Company Law would help provide
the ground for replicating the few experiments that have conformed with the
basic principles of JSCs agreed so far. More organized experiments in
Shanghai and Shenzhen are expected to result in comprehensive shareholding
company regulations for those localities, providing a basis for a nationwide
shareholding company law at a later date.
Degree of Private Ownershin and Shareholdint of the Means of Production
14.       Under the reforms, the role of individual enterprises and private
initiatives is to complement the system dominated by state enterprises. The
Chinese government also recognizes that various activities to raise funds from
society at all levels (both enterprises and individuals), including the issu-
ance of shares and bonds by enterprises, should be encouraged. However, it
has always been obvious that private ownership and shareholding of enterprises
is subject to a rather clearly defined limit, i.e., it will be allowed to
complement, not replace, public ownership to a minimum extent possible. Two
important related questions are: (i) in what sectors and areas and to what
extent private ownership should be allowed; and (ii) how to go about securiti-
zation of enterprises so as to promote participation of the "public" in enter-
prise ownership.
15.       Limitations on Private Ownership.  Until 1988 there were official
limitations on the number of employees that an individual entrepreneur may
employ,3/ and on the lines of business they may enter.4/ Despite these
limitations, the cooperatives, a quasi form of private ownership, have
flourished in the countryside. However, their sizes are extremely small, and
still retain a public ownership element of collectives. One noteworthy aspect
3J   State Council Policy Provisions on Urban Non-Agricultural Individual
Business of July 7, 1981, allows an individual business to employ one or
two assistance workers, and up to five apprentices.
4/   The above provisions, and their amendments on April 13, 1983.



- 52 -                            ANNEX 1.1
Page 7
of these collectives is that they are allowed to issue securities as a method
of obtaining financing.5/
16.       The 1988 regulations on private enterprises have eliminated the
employment ceilings, and expanded the lines of business that private enter-
prises may enter. At present, state enterprises are not allowed to issue
shares to the "public," except in Xiamen where small-scale state enterprises,
not large and medium-sized state enterprises, are allowed to issue shares on
an experimental basis. At present, a major debate is going on at the national
level whether private ownership of the shares of state enterprises should be
allowed and on the percentage of an enterprise's value which might be opened
to "public" ownership.
17.       Securitization of Enterprises.   Current regulations relating to
enterprise securitization are the national Interim Regulations on the Adminis-
tration of Enterprise Bonds of March 1987, and the Xiamen Rules on the Mana3e-
ment of Shares and Bonds--local rules approved by a provincial legislature for
the Xiamen Special Economic Zone--which became effective September 1, 1986.
Before a nation-wide enterprise shareholding system is allowed to emerge, the
current debate on the desirability of encouraging shareholding and other forms
of private or quasi-private ownership of the means of production in a social-
ist country should be settled. At present, state enterprises are allowed to
issue "enterprise bonds" to the public, and shares are allowed to be issued by
state, collective, and foreign owned enterprises only in Xiamen, except for
experiments in Shanghai and Shenzhen (para. 13). For the time being, most of
the securities to be issued by enterprises would be bonds; at present, most
trading at "stock exchanges" which opened in two major cities is in bonds.
D. Bank Role and Contributions
18.       One of the Bank Group's main objectives in the industrial and finan-
cial sectors is to promote a wide range of enterprise reform in the state
sector. The emphasis of Bank operations has bean given to a continued dia-
logue with the Chinese government on a series of reform-related issues emerg-
ing from various experiments.
19.       The Bank has carried out several pieces of economic and sector work
on enterprise reform issues, suggesting recommendations on specific measures
to expedite reforms. Workshops and symposiums on key reform issues have been
jointly sponsored by the Bank and the Chinese government.  A summary of their
main contents and recommendations are given below.
(a)  Economic and Sector Work
Four main studies have been conducted on enterprise reform issues by
the Bank in collaboration with the Chinese government. These are,
in chronological order: (a) "China - Finance and Investment," 1987
(No. 6445-CHA), which aimed to clarify ownership rights, and
5/ Article 8 of the Joint Statement on Policies to Stimulate the Rural Econ-
omy issued in 1983.

separation of ownership and management in the Chinese context;
(b) Corporate Governance and the Role of Board of Directors: The
International Experience and its Relevance for Enterprise Reform in
China," White-Cover, January 1988, which reviews a possibility of
introducing Board. of Directors for Chinese enterprises; (c) "China
Enterprise Management Reforms, Issues and Options," 1989 (No. 7773-
CHA), which recommended promotion of holding companies and cross-
provincial and sectoral investment companies, establishment of a
legal framework for corporate governance, and improvements in the
competitive environment; and (d) "China Country Economic
Memorandum," 1989, Volume II (No. 7483-CHA), which emphasized the
need for increasing the managerial independence of state
enterprises. Their key recommendations were discussed with the
Chinese government, and have formed the basis for several key exper-
iments. In addition, the Bank prepared two important informal
papers on enterprise reform issues, which have been circulated
within and outside China. These are: "Some Suggestions Regarding
Joint Stock Companies in China" (February 1989) and "Joint Stock
Companies with Rearranged Public Ownership: Invigoration of China's
State Enterprises Further Considered" (November 1989).
(b) Workshops and Svmnosiums
The Chinese government and the Bank has also sponsored jointly four
major workshops on enterprise reforms to invigorate discussions on
key enterprise reform issues. The locations and main topics were as
follows: (a) Workshop at St. Anthony's College, Oxford University
(UK) on ownership reform and economic efficiency in China during
February 17-18, 1989--basic concepts of joint stock company and
diversified public ownership; (b) Symposium on Ownership held in
Guilin, China during September 17-21, 1990--joint stock companies,
shareholding, valuation of shares, and legal framework for owner-
ship; (c) Systems Reform Symposium in Hangzhou, China during October
29-November 3, 1990--competition, contract responsibility system,
taxation and ownership; and (d) International Workshop on the
Economic Development of Shanghai held at Shanghai, China during
February 4-7, 1991--industrial restructuring and enterprise reforms
and urban housing reforms in Shanghai.
20.       Several Bank lending operations in the industrial sector were
designed to address key enterprise reform-related issues by: (i) providing
technical and financing support to line agencies and enterprises to conduct
studies on enterprise supervision and management issues--a management effi-
ciency study for large and medium fertilizer companies under the Fertilizer
Rationalization Project (Loan No. 2838-CRA, FY86), and studies on municipal
subsector and enterprise-level restructuring strategies for the municipalities
of Tianjin and Shanghai, which looked at, among others, enterprise reforms and
supporting mechanisms to be developed, such as management agencies, boards of
directors and asset transfers (Tianjin Light Industry Project, TLIP, Loan No.
3022-CIA, PY89, and Shanghai Industrial Development Project, SDIP, Loan No
3288-CIA, FY91); and (ii) agreeing on affirmative actions by Chinese authori-
ties conducive to enterprise reforms--an agreed industrial policy statement

for Shanghai, including the experimental introduction of reformed industrial
policies, pirticularly in the areas of enterprise autonomy and improved for-
eign exchange retention (SIDP); and (iii) providing financing support to
reformed and nonstate enterprises--loans to township and village enterprises
(Rural Industrial Technology (Spark) Project, No. 3724-CRA, FY90), loans to
restructured enterprises (TLIP and SIDP), and increased financing
opportunities for collectives and joint ventures (CIB V, Loan 3075-CHA),
FY89).
E. Experimentation of Reforms Beint Considered under Future Bank Operations
21.       All future Bank industry operations for China will help the Govern-
ment to experiment with key enterprise reform measures. The "Joint stock
system" of state enterprisee, together with proper management arrangements,
will be experimented with on a wider scale. Attempts will be made to expand
the scope for private and quasi-private enterprises in key industrial subsec-
tors. The experimentation with the "joint stock system" for state enterprises
under the project would be the first of a series of such experimentations.

REGIONAL CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
The World Cement Industry
1.        Market Characteristics.  The world cement market is characterized by
considerable regional segmentation and the predominant use of water
transportation in regional and international trade. The market segmentation
is attributed to the abundance of limestone--the chief raw material used in
cement production--which is present in most countries, and to the high cost of
transporting raw materials and cement inland. In the US, for example, more
than 80 percent of the cement produced in 1985 was shipped less than 200
miles.  Water transportation ! l..awily used because it offers a significant
cost advantage over inland transportation. In 1989, about 6 percent of world
cement consumption was traded internationally.
2.        Consumption.  Between 1972 and 1989, world cement consumption
increased an average of 3.2 percent a year, from 665 million tons to
1,138 million tons. For the most part this growth in consumption was
relatively steady, except during the first and second oil crisis of the 1970s.
In 1974, the worldwide recession and decline in housing and building
construction contributed to a 3.1 percent drop in cement consumption. In
1980, overall growth in consumption was still a meager 1.0 percent, although
the rate varied across different regions of the world. Asia, backed by robust
economic growth, registered the highest annual average growth rate of
consumption--8.3 percent during 1970-89. Per capita cement consumption also
varied among different regions. In 1989, Western Europe had the highest per
capita consumption, at 492 kg per year, while Asia and Africa registered
between 99 kg and 168 kg. China was the major consumer of cement in 1989,
with 16.1 percent of the world's total. It was followed by the USSR
(12.2 percent), US (7.4 percent), and Japan (6.3 percent). Gradual, steady
growth in world cement consumption is expected to continue into the next
decade.
3.        Production.  Worldwide cement production capacities have expanded
steadily, except in North America, since 1972. Despite the heavy capital
expenditures required, many countries have emphasized production of cement as
an essential material for infrastructure and industrial and housing
construction. World cement production increased from 676 million tons in 1972
to 1,138 million tons in 1989; temporary declines in demand occurred during
the recessions in 1973 and 1980. In response to rapidly rising energy prices,
the world cement industry has undergone technological changes to reduce its
energy intensity, primarily by developing and adopting energy-saving processes
that have had the added advantage of less pollution. Among the different
regions, Asia experienced the fastest expansion of production capacity,
reaching 43 percent of world capacity in 1989. That same year China was also
the largest manufacturer of cement (producing 18.1 percent), followed by the
USSR (12.2 percent), Japan (7.1 percent), and the US (6.1 percent).

4.        International Trade.  Although the general practice in the world
cement market is to produce cement mainly for the local markets, a pattern
that results in a very segmented world market, the high costs of inland
transport can make it beneficial to trade internationally, particularly
between coastal destinations. The differential in production costs across
plante, which depends on their size, technology, and cost of energy inputs,
also promotes international trade. In 1989, the net exporting regions were
Europe (exporting 9.2 percent of its production), South America (6.1 percent),
and the USSR (1.9 percent). The main net importing regions were Africa
(importing 17.0 percent of its consumption), North America (16.2 percent), and
Oceania (9.3 percent).

REGIONAL CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
Summary of the Tonmling Cement Production and
Distribution Component
A. Equipment and Facilities
1.        &TCC.  The equipment and facilities to be acquired by ATCC include:
(i) machinery and equipment for mining and quarry operations; (ii) equipment
for raw materials handling and storage; (iii) a 4,000 tpd kiln department with
raw mill and clinker cooler; (iv) cement packing and bag handling facilities;
(v) electrical infrastructure; (vi) instrumentation and process control facil-
ities; (vii) high capacity, covered belt conveyors for transporting bulk
cement and clinker to dock storage silos; and (viii) a bulk loading facility
at the river dock. The mining and quarry equipment consists of crawler-
mounted rotary drills with compressors, crawler-mounted hydraulic excavators,
and dumpers.
2.        NCC.  NCC would establish a cement grinding plant with a 2,500 tpd
grinding mill. Major equipment for this plant includes: (i) cement mill with
roller crushers; (ii) a high-efficiency air separator; (iii) a modern high-
capacity bagging plant; and (iv) cranes on the floating dock with a 260 ton
per hour unloading capacity.
B. Raw Materials
3.        Limestone.  The Tongling plant would be located at Yaodun, about
12 km from the center of Tongling City, 1.8 kms from the special wharf and
water pumping station, and 4 kms from the Tongling power plant. The limestone
deposits are located in Khanzing (Umbrella and Chi mountains), about 5 kms
southeast of the plant. Siltatone deposits are found in Guniuling, about 2.5
kma north of the plant site. The materials would be transported to the plant
by way of belt conveyors. Total limestone reserves are estimated at more than
50 million tons, with an estimated service life of about 60 years at a produc-
tion rate of 1.2 million tpy of clinker.
4.        Coal.  About 93,789 tpy of coal would be purchased from Huai Nan and
Huai Dei in Anhui, located 320 kms away by rail.
5.        Copper Slag.  About 17,453 tpy would be purchased from the Tongling
Second Smelter, located 12 kms away by truck.
6.        Fly Ash.  About 64,000 tpy would be obtained by truck from the
Tongling power plant, located within the site area.
7.        Gvsum.  About 36,300 tpy would be purchased from Shandong Province,

8.        Power.  About 124 million kilowatt hours (kWh) per year are to be
supplied by the Tongling power plant. A 220 kilovoltage switchgear and main
transformer would be operated and controlled by the plant. For power distri-
bution within the plant a 35 KV ring-type power supply line would be used.
9.        Rail.  A direct railway access spur would be built to connect with
the access line of Nanjing Oil Storage. The spur would be 1.5 kms long. Two
steam locomotives would be purchased and managed by the Tongling Company.
10.       Road.  The plant is located along the Qing-Tong Highway.  Roadways
in and around the plant, including 0.9 km of road to the living quarters,
would be constructed. An access road along the belt conveyor would be con-
nected to the main highway.
11.       Water.  Water requirements for the quarry would be met by drillirg
wells within the area. Water supply for the plant would be tapped from the
Yangtze River, located about 1.2 kms away. The water would be properly
treated, recycled/cooled, and retreated prior to disposal.

REGIONAL CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
Cement and Clinker Inland Water Transport System for the Tongling Output
A. Background
1.        The Tongling cement plant to be built on the Yangtze River is sched-
uled to start production in early 1995 and to reach full production in 1998.
At that time it would produce 690,000 tons of high-grade cement and 600,000
tons of clinker per year. The clinker would be shipped to Ningbo on the East
China Sea. Nantong, on the delta of the Yangtze River, and Wenzhou, on the
East China Sea, would each receive 200,000 tpy of bulk cement. All of the
above products would be shipped from Tongling to their final destinations by
inland waterway. Cement earmarked for Nantong would be transported all the
way on the Yangtze River (448 km). Cement earmarked for Wenzhou would be
transported 1,175 km along the Yangtze River and the East China Sea. Clinker
earmarked for Ningbo would be transported 855 km on the East China Sea.
2.        The Yangtze River.  The Yangtze River constitutes the most important
waterway system in China. Its main navigable channel, located between Yibin
and the delta, is about 2,700 km long. The lower segment of the channel falls
between Wuhan and Nantong and passes by Tongling; it is about 1,200 km long.
Between Tangling and Nantong, the navigable :hannel has a minimum width of
100 m and a depth of 5--9 m; at this point it can accommodate ships of up to
5,000 dwt. The channel's dimensions would allow larger vessels to navigate
beyond Tongling, but the railway bridge at Nanjing imposes constraints on
vessel sizes above that point. In general, navigation conditions between
Tongling and the East China Sea are excellent.
3.        The largest inland shipping company is the Chang Jiang Shipping
Company (CSC). It was separated from the Chang Jiang Navigation Administra-
tion and made financially indetendent in 1984. Headquartered in Wuhan, CSC
has five affiliated companies--in Chongqing, Wuhan, Wuhu, Nanjing, and
Shanghai. It operates more than 2,200 freight vessels and 130 passenger ships
totaling 2.2 million dwt. It also administers 9 shipyards and 22 repair
yards. Under the project, the Shanghai Chang Jiang Shipping Company (SCSC)
would assume responsibility for transporting clinker from Tongling to Ningbo
by returning iron ore carriers.  At present, because few vessels move between
the inland and coastal waterways, it is necessary to do a lot of transship-
ment, often in congested ports.  The introduction of shallow-draft vessels
capable of navigating on both rivers and ocean might alleviate this problem.
4.        The East China Sea.  The sea coast between the Yangtze Delta
(Eantong/Shanghai) and Wenzhou (about 730 km long) is subject to typhoons as
well as waves reaching up to 6 meters. The tide range at Wenzhou reaches 7 m,
creating strong littoral currents. Such rough conditions necessitate the use
of seaworthy ships to transport clinker to Ningbo and cement to Wenzhou.

B. Modes of Transport
5.        Background studies for the selection of transport mode comprehensive
feasibility studies were carried out in 1988 by the Shanghai Merchant Ship
Design and Research Institute (SDARI) and independent consultants. These
studies were undertaken to assess the most economical and least polluting
method of transporting clinker and cement from Tongling to the receiving
ports. Several different scenarios were studied and analyzed. The following
findings and recommendations emerged:
(i)   shipping cement in bulk from Tongling to Nantong and Wenzhou is
more economical and produces less environmental pollution than
does shipping it in bage. Currently, about 52 of cement shipped
in bags is lost as a result of damage during handling.
(ii)   shipping cement to Wenzhou and clinker to Ningbo in sea-going bulk
carricrs is safer and more economical than using other types of
floating craft (barges and tugs).
(iii)   using two self-unloading bulk cement carriers of 3,500 m3 each
(4,400 dwt) is the least-cost way to ship cement from Tongling to
Nantong and Wenzhou.  Cement would be loaded at the Tongling ter-
minal at a rate of 400 t/hour and unloaded at fantong and Wenzhou
at the same rate.
(iv)   using two 5,000 dwt ore carriers to carry clinker from Tongling to
Ningbo is the safest and most economical way to provide NCC with
needed clinker. Clinker would be loaded at the Tongling terminal
at a rate of 600 t/hour and unloaded at Ningbo at a rate of
360 t/hour.
6.          Bulk Cement Carriers.  The two 3,500 m3 (4,400 dwt) cement carri-
ers are estimated to cobt about Y 44 million; they would be owned and operated
by the Anhui River and Sea Shipping Company (ARSSC). Financing of the ships
has been secured from Anhui province and local banks. The carriers would be
built taking into account the following points: (i) the waves, tide, current,
and sea condition of the East China Sea (para. 4); (ii) all the rigorous mea-
sures necessary to ensure that loading and unloading of cement does not cause
pollution; and (iii) dust collectors that would take care of the dust as well
as the air injected and displaced by the cement.
7.          Clinker Carriers.  The Shanghai Chongqing Shipping Company (SCSC)
entrusted SDARI with the design of the two 5,000 dwt clinker carriers. One
has already been built by the Hawei Shipbuilding Company in Fuzou City and was
delivered to SCSC in April 1989. It has been operating successfully since
then, carrying iron ore from Ningbo to the interior of the country up the
Chang Jiang River. SCSC utdertook to have the second clinker carrier built
and completed on time in order to ensure uninterrupted production of the
Tongling plant. All necessary measures would be taken to ensure that the
environment is not polluted while loading clinker at the Tongling terminal or
unloading it at the Ningbo terminal.



- 75 -                        ANNEX 6.2
Page 3
8.          Tonglina River Terminal.  A river terminal would be built and used
to load cement into the 3,500 min self-unloading cement carriers and to load
clinker into the 5,000 dwt iron ore carriers. The terminal would consist
mainly of a steel floating wharf 125 m long, 20 m wide, and 3.5 m deep, on
which a double jib shiploader on two rails would be installed. The floating
wharf would be connected to the shore by a movable, horizontally swiveling
steel bridge, which slides forward and backward in accordance with variations
in the water :.-vel.
9.          Two silos, each 15 m in diameter, would be built about 200 m
behind the loading terminal. One would be used for clinker, the other for
cement. The clinker and cement would be delivered from the plant to the top
of each silo by a covered belt conveyor 1.8 km long. Another belt conveyor
185 m long would be installed at the bottom of each silo to move the material
to rhe shiploader on the floating wharf, thence to be discharged into the
clinker or cement carriers. All belt conveyors would be covered; the entire
delivery system would be closed to avoid pollution. Loading of cement carri-
ers would be carried out over tight flexible spouts with quick oouplings to
the ships' intakes. Loading clinker would be carried out through openings in
the hatch cover, with the cover in place to avoid flying dust.
10.         The facilities at the terminal include the belt conveyors, two
silos, two bridges, a ship loader, fl'ating wharf, mooring system, electric
power supply, lights, monitoring and controlling devices, a communication
system, and living quarters.
11.         Nantong and Wenzhou Cement Receiving Terminals.  At present,
Nantong receives low-grade bulk cement in small quantities from a cement plant
in Yi-Xing. The cement arrives in 400 t barges through the man-made Tonglu
canal. Cement is pumped from the barges through a pipeline leading to a small
cement silo. The pumping station is located on land.
12.         Nantong's new terminal, completed and put into service in April
1989, is located on the Chang Jiang River. It is used to unload different
types of building materials such as sand, gravel, stones, and steel by means
of a crane that moves on rails fixed to the floating wharf. The terminal
consists mainly of a steel floating wharf 90 m long, 13 m wide, and 3.5 m deep
connected to the shore by a concrete bridge 98 m long and 10 m wide. Since
the difference between high and low water at Nantong is about 3.8 m, the
floating wharf is not rigidly fixed to the bridge. NBMTC financed the cost of
building the Y 12 million terminal through a loan from the Nantong Construc-
tion Bank. Two cement silos would also be built near the entrance to the
bridge.  They would each be 18 m in diameter, and 24 m high and have 5,000 m3
capacity; the total construction cost would be Y 2.5 million. The terminal
would be owned and operated by NBMTC, the silos by the Nanconi Bulk Cement
Office (NBCO). The cement would be unloaded from the 3,500 m self-unloading
cement carriers at a rate of 400 t/hour through an air-slide closed boom. It
would be put onto a completely covered belt conveyor that leads to the bottom
of the silos. It would then be raised to the top of the silos by bucket ele-
vators in a vertical tunnel. This type of system has been in use for many
years and is considered reliable and technically and operationally sound.



- 76 -                        ANNEX 6.2
Page 4
13.         A similar system would be installed in Wenzhou; it would take
about two years to complete. The Wenzhou unloading facilities would include a
wharf, silos, belt and bucket conveyers, compressors, and de-dusting equip-
ment. They are estimated to cost about Y 12 million--Y 4.82 million for the
civil works, Y 3.18 million for mechanical equipment, Y 2.07 million for the
wharf, Y 1.51 million for the land and contingencies, and Y 0.42 million for
services. The terminal at Wenzhou would be owned and operated by Wenzhou
Ceramic Building Material Company (WCBMC). The operating cost of unloading
cement at Nantong and Wenzhou, not including the freight rate from Tongling,
is estimated to be Y 41.15 and Y 39.7 per ton, respectively, including port
dues of Y 5e0 per ton.
14.         SDARI is responsible for designing the pollution control systems
at the Nantong and Wenzhou receiving terminals. It has consulted with the
pollution control authorities in the respective provinces and obtained
approvals on measures to be taken to ensure that any pollution generated at
the two terminals would be within acceptable standards. The following precau-
tions would be taken to ensure that the unloading of cement at the ports'
terminals, its storage in the cement silos, and its loading into the distrib-
uting tank-trucks would have no adverse effects on the environment: (i) the
whole system for moving the cement from the ships to the belt conveyors and
bucket elevators and then to the silos would be completely sealed; (ii) some
15-20 de-dusting filters would be installed at each transfer point, including
those between the air slide, belt conveyors, and bucket elevators, as well as
at the top of the storage silos and in the packing sheds; and (iii) the dust
emitted from the top of the silos may not exceed 50 milligrams per mi3, the
amount of dust concentration in the bagged cement storage area may not exceed
6 milligrams per m3. Since the volume of air that would be emitted is esti-
mated at 12,000 m3/hour, and considering that 200,000 t would be unloaded in
500 hours, the amount of dust emitted in the air is about 300 kg/year, or
about 1 kg per day on average.
15.         Ninabo Clinker Receiving Terminal.  Wher. the Tongling cement plant
reaches full production in 1999, it would provide Ningbo with 600,000 t of
clinker a year. Between 1995, when production starts, and 1998, the amount of
clinker received by Ningbo would increase from 360,000 t to 600,000 t per
year. The latter amount would be used to produce 690,000 t of cement. All
clinker would be unloaded at a rate of 360 tph from the 5,000 dwt returning
ore carriers owned by SCSC, at a new terminal to be built at Beilum port.
Ships would arrive from Tongling at a rate of one every two or three days.
NCC's new cement plant would be located 1 kilometer east of the existing "F"
shaped 100,000 t and 25,000 t berths. A wharf to receive the 5 00( dwt
clinker carrying vessels would be built in front of the new plant, and cement
would be transported to the clinker silos by belt conveyors 280 m long. Three
silos with a total storage capacity of 30,000 t would be built. Coal needed
for the plant would also be discharged at the new wharf. The facilities for
unloading and storing clinker are estimated to cost Y 16.8 million--Y 7.0 mil-
lion for the wharf, Y 2.4 million for clinker unloading, Y 0.3 million for
belt conveyors, and Y 7.1 million for clinker silos in 1990 prices.

REGIONAL CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
Summary of the Zhonaguo Cement Plant Rehabilitation Component
A. Eguinment and Facilities
1.        Major equipment and facilities include a full line of cement manu-
facturing equipment to support a 2,000 tpd kiln that would be installed on an
already cleared site adjacent to the existing plant. These equipment and
facilities include: (i) machinery and equipment for mining and quarry;
(ii) facilities for raw materials handling and storage; (iii) kiln department;
(iv) a cement grinding system, and (v) a process control system for the entire
plant operation.
B. Raw Materials
2.        Limestone.  The project would rely on two limestone quarries.  It
presently depends on the Kongshan limestone deposit, which has 27 million tons
of proven reserves of high-grade limestone. The crushed stone is transported
to the plant in 20-ton self-tipping rail cars on a narrow gauge railroad. The
new quarry to be opened is at the Qinglongshan limestone deposit at the small
mountain bordering the plant to the south. It has proven reserves of 139
million tons of limestone, whose quality is slightly lower than that of
Kongshan. A crusher would be installed at the new quarry, and the crushed
stone would be transported to the plant by belt conveyor. The plant is plan-
ning to take 22% of its limestone requirement from the Kongshan quarry and the
remainder from the Qinglongshan quarry.
3.        Clav.  The clay is being extracted from the Baohua quarry, which is
5 km southwest of the plant. It has 1.5 million tons of reserves, equivzlent
to 10 years' consumption. Before it is depleted, the adjacent Dongyang clay
deposit with 0.9 million ton of reserves would be opened.
4.        Coal.  Coal is supplied from Xuzhou mine in Jiangsu province by
rail. Because this project is regarded as the first major one involving tech-
nical transformation in the building materials industry, the coal requirements
for the plant are assured under the State allocation system.
5.        Gspsum.  This raw material is purchased partly from Hunan and Hubei
provinces and partly from Nanjing. It arrives by rail.
6.        fyrites.  This chemical waste is delivered by rail from the petro
chemical plants in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Shanghai.
C. Infrastructure
7.        Power.  The transformer station would be relocated, and a completely
new set of two 16 MVA transformers would be installed to supply both the new



- 8v -                         ANNEX 6.4
Page 2 of 2
and the old production lines. The transformer station would be fed from the
public grid at 110,000 volts, stepped down to 6,300 volts. If the current
power shortage persists in the Nanjing area, ZCC would build a captive 2,000
kw power plant (para. 5.14).
8.        Rail.  The plant, located on the broad gauge line coniecting Nanjing
and Shanghai, is assured service under the state allocation system. The
existing spur wo!tld be extended to permit unit train loading of the cement.
9.        Road.  As the access road to the plant through the adjacent town,
Longtan, is overloaded; a new road bypassing the town is under construction.
10.       Water.  The plant draws water from the nearby Bianmin river part of
the year and pumps water from wells for the rest of the year. New wells would
be tapped to the south of the plant to supplement the present supply.
11.       Canal.  The canal is being built to connect the plant to the Yangtze
River, 3 km away. At the completion of the project, the plant would pump
cement to a new terminal with a barge loading facility.

CHINA
REGIONAL CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
A Study on the Efficiency and Environmental Assessment of Small Cement Plants
Terms of Reference
A. Background
1.        A distinctive feature of the Chinese cement industry is its heavy
dependence on some 6,400 small plants. These plants account for more than
80 percent of all the cement produced domestically; 90 percent of the produc-
tion from these small plants comes from outdated vertical kilns, many of which
show poor product quality, low energy efficiency, and high pollution.
2.        Four main factors account for the prevalence of small cement plants
and vertical kilns:
(a) The absence of needed infrastructure and transportation networks,
which necessitates the butilding of small plants to meet local needs.
This situation applies specifically in rural areas, where the demand
for housing construction has been growing rapidly in recent years.
(b) Abundant and widespread deposits of cement raw materials adminis-
tered under local jurisdictions, which make it possible for villages
to obtain mining and operating licenses for cement manufacturing.
(c) An abundant labor supply, low labor rates, and the relative simplic-
ity of manufacturing with vertical kilns and other small pieces of
cement-producing equipment.
(d) The cement investment system, which induces local authorities to
favor small-scale investments, as they do not require the approval
of higher authorities.
3.        Because small cement plants will continue to produce the bulk of
China's cement output, it is important that the Government of China (GOC)
introduce measures to curb the proliferation of inefficient and polluting
small plants, and to improve the production efficiency and pollution control
of the existing ones.
4.        In the past, Chinese cement specialists have carried out several in-
depth studies to improve the technical efficiency of small plants. For exam-
ple, the Hefei Cement Industry Research Institute carried out a major study in
December 1988 that resulted in recommendations for the technical improvements
of small plants. These studies covered mainly the issue of plant-level tech-
nical improvements. Based on the findings of these studies, SABMI plans to
carry out a comprehensive study on small cement plants, which would address a
wide spectrum of economic, technical and operational issues relating to these



- 85 -                        ANNEX 6.6
Page 2 of 5
plants, to formulate strategies for restructuring the small-scale segment of
the cement industry to achieve better production efficiency and pollution
abatement.
B. Obiectives
5.        The proposed study is designed to:
(a) articulate sectoral strategies and policies with respect to restruc-
turing cef the small-scale segment of the cement industry, taking
into account its economic and technical viability with specific
focus on its pollution generation;
(b) prepare a specific government-level program to expedite the restruc-
turing of this segment, in line with developed sectoral strategies,
detailing quantified time-bound targets for improving production
efficiency and pollution abatement, speciiic time-bound policy mea-
sures, institutional and financing support systems, and incentives
and disincentives for the phasing out of inefficient, polluting
plants; and
(c) establish an effective institutional set-up to monitor the implemen-
tation of the developed sectoral strategies, policies and programs.
C. Scope of the Study
Assessment of the Current Production Efficiency and Pollution Situation
 Assess the levels of raw material inputs per unit and energy consumption
of various types of small plants, with particular reference to historical
trends, comparison of their levels with those of modern larger-scale
plants, and achievable improvements.
* Assess the environmental impact of small cement plant operations in
accordance with the guidelines for environmental assessment attached to
this TOR (attachment).
Analysis of Technical and Economic Viability
e Identify and analyze available technologies for improving the production
efficiency and pollution abatement of small plants. The analysis of
technology should address the issues of particulate emissions to the
atmosphere, liquid water discharges, waste recycling or disposal.
* Analyze the economic viability of new small plants based on the up-to-
date technology depending on site locations and types of plants, using
import parity prices of cement.
* Analyze the economic viability of various options for rehabilitation of
existing small plants, using import parity prices of cement.



- 86 -                         ANNEX 6.6
Page 3 of 5
C. Elaboration of Sectoral Strategies and Policies
* Formulate strategies with respect to the establishment of new small scale
plants, rehabilitation of existing plants, and phasing out of inefficient
plants.
* Evaluate the current sectoral policies of the central and local authoti-
ties with focus on their consistency with the national strategies.
* Identify policies for promoting restructuring the small-scale segment of
the cement industry, based on the analysis of the current policy and
incentive structure. These policies would include: proper cement pricing
and distribution policies; regulations on product quality, energy effi-
ciency, and emission/effluent levels; and technical, institutional and
financial support and tax and non-tax incentives for technical rehabili-
tation and phasing out of inefficient operations.
* Prepare a sector-wide restructuring program for the small-scale segment
of the cement industry, including targets for efficiency improvement and
pollution abatement, time-bound policy measures to be introduced to
implement the sectoral strategies, and the provision of necessary techni-
cal, institutional and financing support.
o Prepare a program to improve environmental contvols in the cement indus-
try (Section E of the attachment).
D. Organization of the Study
6.        The State Administration of Building Materials Industry (SABMI), in
collaboration with the building materials industry and environmental protec-
tion bureaus of Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces (with the participation of city
and county authorities), would sponsor the study. In order to support the
implementation of the study at the government level, an inter-agency task
force will be formed under the leadership of SABMI, with participation of
officials the State Planning Commission, National Environmental Protection
Agency, Anhui and Jiangsu building materials and environmental protection
bureaus. This task force will review the work plan for the study, recommenda-
tions to be made by the study, and review suggested actions to implement rec-
ommendations. A study team, consisting of relevant specialists, will be
formed under the sponsorship of the task force and the institutional leader-
ship of Hefei Cement Industry Research Institute (HCIRI). Local experts for
required disciplines will be invited to join the study team. International
consultants will also be invited to complement areas where international expe-
riences are critical, in particular in environmental assessments, evaluation
of economic viability and sectoral strategies. They will also review the
findings and recommendations in the draft final report to be prepared by the
study team, and produce their own review report. The study will be carried
out in two stages: the analysis phase (PIase One, covering the above items A
and B) and the strategy and policy formulxtion phase (Phase Two, item C).

REGIONAL CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
Rev Assumvtions Underlving the Financial Analvis
A. General
1.        The financial projections were carried out in current yuan using
projected domestic inflation rates for local inputs and outputs and interna-
tional inflation rates for imported inputs. The annual domestic inflation
rates used were 10 percent ior 1991, 8 percent for 1992, and 5 percent for
1993 onwards. The annual international inflation rates used were 4.9 percent
for 1989-95 and 3.7 percent thereafter. The key assumptions used in making
the financial projections were based on Chinese regulations. However, a num-
ber of adjustments were made to the Chinese accounting system in order to
evaluate. th. companies' financial performance in accordance with conventional
accounting concepts and standards. First, the two sets of financial state-
ments, one for production operations and one for capital construction, were
consolidated. Second, the accounts in the income statements and balance
sheets were reclassified according to conventional concepts. Third, state-
ments on the sources and uses of funds were prepared, as they do not exist
under the current Chinese accounting system. The financial rate of return
(FRR) figures were calculated using cost and benefit streams in constant
terms.
B. Income Statements
2.        Prices of Output.  The financial prices for clinker and cement from
ATCC are as follows: (i) Y 152 per ton of clinker (600,000 tons); (ii) Y 198
per ton of bulk 525 RPC and 525 OPC for 290,000 tons; and (iii) Y 218 per ton
of bagged 525 OPC for 200,000 tons (the prevailing average market price in
Anhui Province minus a 5 percent discount as per the agreed sales contract).
The financial price of cement from NCC is Y 250 per ton based on the prevail-
ing average market price. The prices of 525 OPC and 575 OPC from the existing
facilities of ZCC are, respectively, Y 196 and Y 232 per ton (the provincial
controlled prices in Jiangsu). The average prices of 525 OPC from the new
facilities are assumed to be Y 230 based on agreed pricing arrangements. The
prices of cement are assumed to remain unchanged in constant terms throughout
the life of the project.
3.        Variable Production Costs.  The production costs for the new ATCC
and NCC plants are based on detailed estimates made by the project entities
with the assistance of domestic and foreign consultants. These costs were
adjusted to reflect the levels prevailing in 1991. The production costs for
the ZCC plant were developed from a detailed evaluation of material, labor,
fuel, power, and overhead costs provided by the plant for its existing kilns
and proposed new facilities. The prices for raw materials and utilities and
other inputs are held constant in real terms throughout the period.

Page 2
4.        Caoscitr Utilization.  Production for the new plants at Tongling and
Ningbo is assumed to build up to 6C percent in the first year, 75 percent in
the second year, 90 percent in the third year, and 100 percent in the fourth
year and thereafter. After the ZCC plant is fully converted, production is
assumed to be 60 percent of capacity in the first year, 80 percent in the
second year, and 100 percent from the third year onward.
5.        Deireciation.  Fixed assets, which are maintained at historical
costs, are depreciated using the straight-line method in accordance with pre-
vailing accounting rules in China, as follows. For ATCC, the assumed useful
life is 15 years. The depreciation charge is equivalent to 5.0 percent of the
original values; an additional 2 percent is also provided as an overhaul
expense (a Chinese practice to ensure an appropriation for this expense) and
is shown as part of the workshop expenses. For ZCC, the basic depreciation
rates are 4.75 percent and 5 percent for the plant and mine area, respectively
(the average rate is 4.8 percent).
6.        Fixed Costs.  For ATCC, the other fixed costs include the salaries
of management, staff welfare, insurance and miscellaneous expenses, regular
maintenance costs, and administrative expenses. At full operation, these are
estimated at Y 34.0 million per year in June 1991 prices. For ZCC, these
costs are estimated at Y 47.3 million.
7.        Taxes.  Although the new plants are expected to obtain some conces-
sions, the income tax rate of 55 percent, as reflected, is conservative. For
ATCC, an average of 9.7 percent of sales covers the product, city/municipal,
and education taxes. ZCC's sales tax is projected at the current rate of
16 percent of sales.
C. Balance Sheets
8.        Fixed Assets.  These are shown at historical costs.
9.        Eauity.  Based on agreed joint venture contracts, the equity contri-
butions for ATCC and NIC will be Y 300 million and Y 34 million, respectively.
For ZCC, the following items are considered "equity", given their equity
natures (i) grant funds from NCC; (ii) State fixed funds; (iii) State circu-
lating funds; (iv) retained internally generated funds; and (v) net special
funds retained by the enterprise (special fund assets less special loans).
10.      Workina Capital.  For ATCC, initial working capital is equivalent to
15 percent (45 days) of sales during the first year of operations; in later
years, the accounts receivable are assumed to be 30 days of sales, inventories
to be, on average, 30 days of production costs (7 days for goods in process,
15 days for finished goods, and 90 days for materials).
D. Flow of Funds Statements
11.       Expenditures from Special Accnunts.  Except for bonuses for staff
welfare, no special accounts would be maintained for ATCC and NCC since these
companies would be established as joint stock companies.

Assumptions Underlying the Economic Analysis
A. General
1.        The economic rates of return (ERRs) for the two investment compo-
nents were calculated on an incremental basis. Prices were expressed in con-
stant June 1991 US dollars. The economic life of the cement plants was
assumed to be 20 years. The following conversion factors were applied to the
financial prices of non-tradable goods and services to derive their economic
prices. The conversion factors were derived from the Bank's economic work:

B. Capital Cost
2.        The economic capital cost of each project element expressed in June
1991 prices was obtained from the financial base capital cost (including
physical contingencies) after: (i) deducting the duties and taxes on equip-
ment and other items; (ii) deducting the costs of those spare parts that are
to be included in the operating costs; and (iii) applying conversion factors
to non-tradable goods and services for economic valuation.
C. Working Capital
3.        The incremental economic working capital requirements for each proj-
ect element were derived by comparing goods and services employed in produc-
tion with and without the project.
D. Economic Benefits
4.        The economic prices of internationally traded products were derived
from their latest projected international prices, taking into account marine
freight from the origin of export to China ports, unloading and port handling
charges, and inland rail freight to plant sites.
5.        The economic value of cement was been derived from the reference
landed price of imported cement. The current FOB prices (Korean port) of
bagged cement are: $51/ton for 575 OPC and $47/ton for 525 OPC; $7 for marine

freight to the port of Shanghai and $3 for insurance and port handling charges
vere added to derive the CIF Shanghai prices. The economic prices at consum-
ing areas were conservatively assumed to be equal to the CIF prices, while the
estimated loss in handling and inland transport is about 2 percent. Inland
transport costs by rail from the port to the consuming areas have also not
taken into account in deriving the economic prices to make the assumption more
conservative given the possibility that the Shanghai Municipality itself will
become the user of the project output.
E. Operating Costs
6.        Tradable Raw Materials.  The economic cost of exportable inputs
(mainly coal) was de:ived by adding to the netback prices, from exports at the
production sites, the inland transportation costs between the production and
the plant sites. The netback value of inputs at the production sites was
calculated by deducting inland freight between the sites and exporting ports
from the FOB export prices. The economic cost of importable inputs was based
on their international FOB prices plus marine freight from the origin of
export to ports in China, plus inland freight to the plant sites.
7.        Nontradable Items.  The economic value of non-tradable inputs is
based on their long-term marginal production costs plus inland transportation
costs adjusted by specific conversion factors. The following assumptions were
made for major non-tradable inputs:
(i)   Electricity.  The long-term marginal economic production cost
of electricity has been estimated at Y 0.5/kWh. (The current
state-controlled price is Y 0.127/kWh.)
(ii)   Gypsum Slag and Other Industrial Wastes.  For the economic
valuation of these items, their financial prices were used as
a proxy for their economic prices, given that these inputs
were to be obtained at negotiated prices in the market, which
are comparable to market prices in other major cement-produc-
ing countries.
8.        Fixed Costs.  The economic costs of the various fixed cost items,
including labor and general selling and administrative costs, were based on
their financial costs adjusted by specific conversion factors. The main-
tenance costs were assumed at 5 percent of the original acquisition costs
throughout the life of the project.
