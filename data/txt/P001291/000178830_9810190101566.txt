I. ENERGY SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Indigenous Energy Resources
1.01         Firewood,  including charcoal,  is by far the most  important
indigenous energy source of Kenya and supplies about 71% of total energy
demand. However, Kenya is more industrialized than any of its neighbours,
as shown by the following estimates of their dependence on traditional
fuels: Burundi 81%, Tanzania 93%, Rwanda 96%, Somalia 90% and Ethiopia
93%.  Kenya's forests cover about 4% of the country's total area, and are
concentrated mostly in the central part of the country where average annual
rainfall  exceeds  850  mm.   The  accessible  reserves  of wood  have  been
seriously depleted, and deforestation is a serious problem in some areas
although there has been some replacement with extensive plantations of
exotic trees.  Kenya's wood resources are used not only for firewood, but
also for sawn timber, plywood, and pulp and paper, of which small
quantities are exported to neighbouring countries. The Bank has supported
establishment of forest plantations in the past with two projects and a
third project was approved in February 1982 1!; the new project also
envisages strengthening the Rural Afforestation Extension Service, a
government organization which currently operates 125 nurseries throughout
the country. Other forestry projects, now underway, are being financed by
Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Belgium and the European Economic Community
(EEC), and it is hoped that these projects will provide the needed fuel for
the rural population before the deforestation becomes widespread.
1.02      The hydroelectric power potential of the country is estimated to
be about 6,000 MW (about 30,000 GWh per year).   However, half of this is
located on small rivers, and because of topographical conditions and the
small scale, most is uneconomical to develop. The large hydro potential is
concentrated on the Tana, Turkwel and Eweso Nyiro Rivers.   The Tana River
has a hydro potential of about 3,000 MW but, of this, only about 820 MW
could be developed, which would produce about 4,000 GWh per year or about 1
million  tons  of oil  equivalent.    Four  hydroelectric  power  stations  -
Masinga (40 MW), Kamburu (91 MW), Gitaru (145 MW) and Kindaruma (44 MW),
operating in cascade some 100 miles northeast of Nairobi have developed 320
MW and an additional 140 MW would be developed under the proposed Kiambere
project.   The remaining 360 MW would be available for future development
2/.   The only other significant hydro power potential is on the Turkwel
river in north-western Kenya, where a multi-purpose project could provide
about 120 MW to the system 3/.
1/ The total project costs are estimated to be about US$74 million, of
which US$21.5 million will be financed by IBRD (LN 2098) and US$16
million by IDA (CR 1213).   Remaining costs will be financed by the
Governments of Switzerland and Italy.
2/ Major hydro potential sites on the Tana River to be developed after
Kiambere:  Grand Falls Tana (180 MW), Adamson's Tana (60 MW), Kotech (80
MW) and Karura (40 MW).
3/ Hydro potential on other rivers:   Eweso Nyiro (100 MW), Sondu (60 MW),
Webuye (20 MW), Nyando (35 MW), Arror (15 MW), Athi (60 MW).

1.03        Another source of energy is geothermal, with potential in the
Rift Valley at primarily Olkaria, Eburru and Lake Bogaria. Exploration and
development   of   geothermal   potential   at   Olkaria   field   (estimated
conservatively at 170 MW and optimistically at 1,000 MW) is continuing. In
a project financed by LN 1799-KE in 1980, one 15 MW generating unit was
placed in service in August 1981, and a second 15 MW unit in December
1982. The Bank has also provided part of the funds for a third 15 MW unit
to be operational in 1985, and a loan for this project has been approved
(Loan 2237-KE, February 8, 1983). Exploration is in progress in the other
two areas, Eburru (financed by Japan International Corporation Agency) and
Lake Bogoria (financed by the UNDP), and the preliminary evaluation of
prospects by the Ministry of Energy is encouraging.   The Bank is also
giving consideration to the funding of a country-wide geothermal
exploration program.
1.04        Solar radiation is quite high, and could provide an attractive
alternative to a portion of the high cost imported energy.   However, its
use for water heating and crop drying provides only a small fraction of the
total requirements of the country, and the Ministry of Energy is actively
providing information and encouraging its greater use.   In addition, the
Ministry of Energy is evaluating the possibility of using more wind-driven
pumps for irrigation to replace diesel-driven pumps presently in use.
Kenya has constructed two ethanol plants based on the use of molasses, and
the high capital and operating cost of these first two plants precludes the
possibility of proceeding with another plant at this time.
1.05       Surveys have shown no significant coal deposits in Kenya and the
results of past oil exploration have been disappointing.   In January 1982
Bank lending for the Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (LN 2065-KE,
for US$5.3 million) became effective, and the Government is hopeful of
success in this new project.
1.06        The Government cooperated with the Bank on energy sector work
during 1981, which resulted in the Bank's Report No. 3800-KE entitled
"Kenya:   Issues  and Options  in the Energy  Sector"  (May,  1982).   This
contains the findings of a mission to Kenya, and a number of
recommendations to improve Kenya's energy sector. (paras. 1.13-1.14).
Imported Energy
1.07      The main source of commercial energy in Kenya is imported oil and
petroleum products, with small amounts of coal and electricity forming a
secondary source.  Over the period 1973-1981, the consumption of imported
liquid fuels as a percentage of total commercial energy consumption
excluding fuelwood and charcoal has reduced from about 90% to about 80%.
This reduction is due mainly to the government objective of the greater use
of indigenous energy resources such as hydro.  Except for minor amounts of
specialty oils and lubricants, most petroleum products have been processed
domestically from imported crude at a refinery in Mombasa.  Prior to 1973,
the refinery exported about 55% of its output to the East African Community
(EAC) and other African countries, but partly as a result of the break up
of the EAC, there has been a fairly steady decline in exports.   Net oil
imports absorbed about 8% of gross export earnings in 1976-77 and reached
25% in 1981, in part as a result of the reduced earnings from coffee and



- 3 -
tea.   Kenya also imports electric energy from Uganda (about 12% of total
electricity sales in 1982).   The present political climate in East Africa
is improving the possibility of the utilization of benefits derived from
the interconnection of the national electric grids in Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda.
1.08        The major user of imported coal is the Bamburi cement plant in
Mombasa.    The  following  table  contains  a  summary  of  the  growth  in
commercial energy consumption in Kenya (fuelwood and charcoal excluded):

1981 Energy Balance
1.09        In 1981, Kenya consumed approximately 7.3 million tons of oil
equivalent (toe) of energy.  Per capita energy consumption is about 453 kg
of oil equivalent, which compares with the average of 1,500 kg for Europe,
and an average of 300 kg for all of Africa.   Non-commercial, traditional
energy sources met about 71% of the total 1981 demand for energy, with the
commercial energy providing the balance.   Kenya's energy balance for 1981
is given on the following page.

Energy Prices
1.10       The price of many essential commodities, including electricity
and fuel, is regulated by the Government.   Usually, prices of petroleum
products   vary  regionally  and,   in  general,   reflect   the   cost   of
transportation.   While  there are no duties  and  taxes on fuel oil and
industrial diesel oil, regular gasoline and light diesel oil are heavily
taxed.    The  relative  cost  of  energy  in Kenya  is  illustrated  in  the
following table:

1.11       The low selling price of diesel oil in the above price structure
relative to gasoline, is encouraging an increased demand for diesel oil for
the transportation sector and will create further problems in matching the
yield of the Mombasa refinery to market demand. With the existing refinery
yield pattern, the proportion of diesel to total production is
significantly less than the proportion of market demand for diesel to total
demand for petroleum products. It is the opinion of the mission that this
situation would improve if the refinery were to be modified to increase the
yield of middle distillates from refined crude oil, and the Bank is now
considering an engineering loan to study the various options for the
conversion of the refinery to improve the yield of products most in
demand.      Under   the  Second   Structural   Adjustment   Operation   (Loan
2190-KE/Credit 1276-KE; Report P-3322-KE) the Government has undertaken,
inter alia, to develop a comprehensive energy investment program providing
for both production and conservation in the modern and traditional sector.
A draft report covering the results of the studies of the proposed
investment program has been reviewed by the Bank, and the comments have
been sent to the Government.
Bank Strategy in the Energy Sector
1.12         Bank strategy has continued to be focused on improving the
overall energy sector.   For example, the Bank has assisted in meeting the
projected shortage of energy in rural Kenya through a forestry project
which was approved in February 1982, with total project costs of US$74
million to which IBRD will provide US$221.5 million (LN 2098) and IDA US$16
million  (CR  1213)..   The  project  is  aimed  at  improving  the  forestry
department's management performance and providing funds for new plantings
and rural reforestation. On January 9, 1982, LN 2065 (US$4.0 million) the
petroleum exploration project (total cost US$5.3 million) became effective,
and although the search for domestic oil has been unsuccessful in the past,
the Government is hopeful of success in this new project. All aspects of



- 6 -
the overall energy sector are being reviewed under the structural
adjustment loan (P 3322-KE, para 1.11).   There is now a firm commitment
from the Government to reduce energy costs including the diversion of long
distance traffic from highways to the railways. However, the railways need
extensive rehabilitations and the Bank is assisting in financing part of
the railways' investment plan for the period 1981-1983. The first project
in which the Bank became involved in Kenya was in 1975 when the Bank
provided part of the funds, US$20 million, under LN 1133-KE for the
construction of a 14-inch 452 km oil pipeline, pumping stations, and
related facilities to transport refined products from Mombasa to Nairobi.
Since it was placed in operation in 1978, the cost of transporting fuel to
Uganda, Nairobi, and other neighboring countries has been substantially
reduced. Recently, preliminary studies have been carried out to determine
the justification of extending the pipeline westwards to serve Eldoret and
the neighboring countries, but no action has been taken to date. The East
Africa Development Bank and the Kenya Pipeline Company are presently
seeking funds for a detailed feasibility study of the proposed extension.
Government Strategy in the Energy Sector
1.13        The Government realizes that Kenya's economy is vulnerable to
sudden increases in petroleum prices as long as expensive oil remains the
major source  of  commercial  energy,  and  substantial  amounts  of  foreign
exchange  are  expended  in  paying  for  crude  oil  imports.    Thus,  the
Government's strategy, as defined in the Fourth Development Plan 1979-83,
is to rationalize the use of imported petroleum, and to develop and utilize
domestic power resources as far as possible to reduce dependence on
imported  oil.    Moreover,  the  Government  has  recognized  the  need  to
formulate a comprehensive national energy development plan since the
1973-74 and the 1978 energy crises; and for that purpose established the
Ministry of Energy in December 1979.
1.14          The Government  is concerned about its access  to petroleum
supplies and the prices it is paying for petroleum.   In the past,  the
country  has  had  no  direct  contractual  arrangement  with  any  exporting
country and was wholly dependent upon a few multinational corporations for
its  supplies.    The  Government  has  now  established  the Kenya  National
Petroleum Corporation (not yet in operation) to handle about 50% of Kenya's
oil needs, leaving the balance to the private companies. In addition, high
priority is given by the Government to the acceleration of the Petroleum
Exploration  Promotion  Project  (para.  1.05)  which  aims  at  helping  the
Government to attract experienced oil companies to carry out exploration
programs under conditions equitable to both parties and to ensure that the
programs and their implementation meet the highest industry standards.
II. POWER SECTOR BACKGROUND
General
2.01       The availability of power to consumers in Kenya is, in general,
limited to the more densely populated narrow strip running across the
southern part of the country from Mombasa through Nairobi to Lake Victoria
(Map IBRD 17029) in parallel with the railway, and along the coast.   The



- 7 -
northern and eastern parts of the country are arid, and because of the
scattered population, consumers do not have easy access to electricity. Of
the estimated 15 million inhabitants to Kenya, 90% live in rural areas.
Only 6% of the total population has access to electricity, and the average
estimated per capita consumption of electrical energy was about 134 kWh in
1981.4/ This is a higher level than in most other East African countries,
i.e. Tanzania 52 kWh, Mauritius 607 kWh, Madagascar 45 kWh, Ethiopia 24
kWh, Botswana 486 kWh, Malawi 64 kWh, Rwanda 11 kWh, Burundi 12 kWh, and
Zimbabwe 928 kWh.
2.02        The electricity supply industry is presently composed of four
entities:  the Kenya Power and Lighting Company Limited (KP&L), the Kenya
Power Company Limited (KPC), the Tana River Development Company Limited
(TRDC), and the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA).   At
present, KP&L coordinates all sources of power, purchases in bulk from the
other three companies, and is the sole distributor. KP&L also operates all
generating facilities, staffs and manages KPC and TRDC, and since August
1981, staffs the Masinga hydroelectric generating station owned by TARDA.
2.03       KP&L (formerly East Africa Power and Lighting Company Limited -
EAP&L) began as a private company in 1922, and in 1970 the Government
acquired a controlling interest when it made a successful bid for all the
shares  on  the  London  Register.    Since  then  the  Government  has  been
purchasing shares as they come on the East African market and, at present,
holds about 57% of total shares.  KPC and TRDC were originally established
by the Government for specific functions. KPC's main function is to import
power from Uganda, and it now owns the Olkaria geothermal power generating
plant.  TRDC owns Kindaruma, Kamburu and Gitaru plants on the Tana River.
KP&L, KPC and TRDC form the country's main power producers, but some elec-
tric energy, about 411 GWh in 1981 (about 20% of total consumption) is
generated by private organizations and parastatals which have power plants
in sugar, tea and coffee estates, the oil refinery, textile factories and
large farms.   The power plants operate under license from the Ministry of
Energy and Regional Development.    During  negotiations  for  the  Olkaria
Geothermal Power Expansion LN 2273-KE the Government informed the Bank that
a review of the structure of the power industry was being carried out by a
Government Committee which includes the issue of merger of the power
companies, and the recommendations would be sent to the Bank for comment.
Background information and the description of the four companies is given
in paragraphs 6.01-6.04 and in Annex 17.
2.04      TARDA along with the Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVA) and
the Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA) were organized primarily to
develop the river basins and have an extensive interest in irrigation,
reforestation and industry.   They are also empowered to construct hydro-
electric power facilities, and to generate and sell their energy in their
respective areas.   As a result of the number of different organizations
interested in developing power facilities, there is a costly duplication
and diversification in power sector planning, a situation which Kenya, with
4/ Total electrical energy consumption for the country in 1981 was about
2,004 GWh of which 411 GWh was provided by private industries, while
1,593 GWh represented sales by KP&L (Annex 7).



its constraints in skilled manpower and finance, can ill afford and which
has  considerably  delayed  preparation  of  the  proposed  project.    The
Government has recognized the existence of the problem and agreed in Loan
2237-KE to a program for the merging of KPC and TRDC.   The Government
intends to carry out a separate sector organization study based on terms of
reference approved by the Bank.
Existing Power Facilities
2.05       The total installed capacity of the interconnected power system
is 541 MW of which 348 MW is hydro with 30 MW of geothermal, and 163 MW is
oil-based thermal.   The Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) also provides 30
MW.   KP&L has about 9,970 km of transmission lines operating at various
voltages throughout the country.   Total distribution transformer capacity
in service is about 1,780 MVA (excluding generating switching stations).
The total system loss is about 15%, which although higher than desirable,
the maintenance is adequate and this level of loss is considered reasonable
bearing in mind the age and condition of the equipment.   As these losses
increase, KP&L installs suitable system compensation equipment, and
strengthens power distribution lines within its general development program
to further reduce losses as far as economically possible.
2.06        Detailed information regarding the existing power facilities is
given in Annex I and 2 and shown on the map IBRD 17029.
Long-term Development Plan
2.07         During the preparation of the Gitaru Loan (1147-KE), it was
foreseen that generation of geothermal power at Olkaria was becoming
attractive, and to place it in a long-term perspective funds were included
for two separate studies.   As a result, Merz & McLellan (M&M) of the
United Kingdom and the Virkir Consulting Group Limited of Iceland submitted
a report in which it was concluded that development of the Olkaria site was
economically justifiable and would be part of the least cost program for
meeting the growing power demand. The results of this study were incorpo-
rated into M&M's and Sir Alexander Gibb's (Gibb) National Power Development
Plan, 1978-2000, completed in 1978.
2.08      The National Power Development Plan contains a forecast of growth
in demand which necessitates further development of power supplies by
1984.    Funds  for  a feasibility  study  to  determine  whether  a hydro,
geothermal,  or other conventional thermal projects should be undertaken
were included as part of the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project (LN 1799-KE
in 1980, para. 2.19).  The study recommended construction of the Kiambere
hydroelectric project to be completed in 1985.  However, this project has
been delayed while new engineering studies were completed. The Olkaria
Geothermal Power Expansion Project was proposed as a result of the delay
and LN 2273-KE was approved on February 8, 1983.
2.09         Kenya's future electric energy needs will be met by further
development of geothermal and hydro resources, or by thermal stations using
imported coal. While there has been an increase in the use of bagasse as a
source of energy in other countries, there has been little development of

its use in Kenya either for direct production of steam, or for the genera-
tion of electricity.  In the long term, some of Kenya's electrical energy
may be provided from neighboring countries. A recent updating of the long
range plan prepared by KP&L resulted in the following plant program for the
years 1983-1990:

Rural Electrification
2.11      A Rural Electrification Fund was established by the Government in
1973 with a contribution of KSh 9,980,260, and a Swedish bridging grant of
KSh  8,760,640.    It  is  administered  by  the  Electricity  Development
Committee, which is comprised of representatives of the Ministries of
Finance and Planning, Energy and Regional Development(MERD), and KP&L.
Rural electrification schemes are managed and operated by KP&L, which
receives revenue from the consumers and presents statements of revenue and
cost to the committee.   Funds provided  from the interest differential
between the soft terms of a Swedish International Development Authority
(SIDA) credit to the Government for the Kamburu project and the
Government's harder onlending terms to TRDC, are used to finance the rural
electrification program. Annual accrual to the fund is KSh 4,431,920 from
the SIDA Credit, and the interest in the investment of the Rural
Electrification Fund of KSh 4 million and the Sugar Finance Corporation of
KSh 250,682.   Total disbursement of the fund was KSh 70.6 million at the
end of 1981. A Swedish team, comprising a planning engineer and two
construction foremen, were seconded to KP&L to assist in the implementation
of the program.
2.12       In February 1980, the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) made a grant of C$550,000 (US$460,000), and in June 1981, CIDA made
another direct grant of C$2.75 million (US$2.3 million) to the rural
electrification program.   The grant provides two technical staff members,
one attached to KP&L to assist in carrying out the extension of the
distribution system in the rural areas, and the other attached to MERD to
assist in the socio-economic analysis of projects intended to be included
in the program.   In addition,, of the funds from the interest differential



- 10 -
between the soft terms of a CIDA loan to the Government, and the harder
onlending terms to KP&L for the Mombasa-Kamburu transmission line amounting
to about US$7 million in 1983 and 1984, about US$4 million will be spent on
rural  electrification,  and  the  remainder  on  other  unspecified  energy
related projects in Kenya.
2.13        In a separate rural electrification program, KP&L spent about
US$800,000  per  annum  on 22  schemes  during  the  1970-76  period.    KP&L
normally apportions 1% of its gross sales revenue (about US$900,000 in
1981) to develop additional schemes, but in recent years the funds serve
mainly to cover the losses of the earlier schemes.   The major problem
encountered with rural electrification programs in Kenya is the consumers'
inability  to  pay.    Demand  is  low  because  the cost  limits most  rural
households to the use of electricity for lighting and not for other
domestic or productive purposes.  KP&L has only a small construction staff
for this type of work.   The training of construction workers was included
in the training component of the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project (LN
1799-KE 1980), and it is anticipated that the additional trained staff
would alleviate this problem to some extent. The geography of the country
adds to the problem in that there are few village concentrations, and the
scattered households make the distribution costly.
2.14       Although the rural electrification programs do not appear to be
financially self-sustaining, the Government has continued to encourage the
expansion of the programs by providing funds through the interest
differentials (paras. 2.11 and 2.12), in the belief that improvement of the
social, commercial and industrial activities in small communities will tend
to reduce migration to the larger urban centers. The Government recognizes
that these rural schemes are subsidized to some extent by the urban
consumers, and has allowed KP&L to adjust its tariffs to enable this
cross-subsidization to take place, while encouraging the least unprofitable
schemes to be chosen. Although none of the schemes undertaken to date are
financially viable, they do not represent an undue burden on the sector and
most could become remunerative in time. Meanwhile, the social and economic
well-being of the rural community is gradually being improved.
Previous Bank Lending in the Power Sector
2.15       The proposed loan would be the sixth bank lending operation for
power in Kenya.   Two  previous  loans  - US$23  million  for  the Kamburu
Hydroelectric Project (LN 745-KE of 1971) and US$63 million for the Gitaru
Hydroelectric Project (LN 1147-KE of 1975) - were made to TRDC, and three
to KPC - US$9 million for the Olkaria Geothermal Engineering Project (LN
S-12-KE of 1978), which was absorbed into a US$40 million LN 1799-KE in
1980 for the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project, and US$12 million (LN
2237-KE) for the Olkaria Geothermal Power Expansion project in 1983.
2.16        The Kamburu project was the second phase of the Seven Forks
Hydroelectric development on the Tana River (the first was a hydroelectric
power station at Kindaruma).   The project was designed to meet the demand
for power in Nairobi and the coastal areas around Mombasa, where most of
the industrial and commercial activities of Kenya are concentrated.   The
project consisted of:



- II -
a)  a rock fill dam on the Tana River;
b)  an underground power station;
c)  three 30 MW units; and
d)  the associated transmission line facilities  connecting the
power station with Nairobi and the Kindaruma hydroelectric
power station further downstream.
The project was completed in 1974 about five months behind schedule with
a cost overrun of about 7%. The delays were not unusual for a construction
program of this nature, and the cost overrun was unavoidable as it was
largely due to currency fluctuations. The Project Performance Audit Report
No. 1230, dated July 14, 1976, based on the Project Completion Report,
stated that the construction of the dam, powerhouse and transmission lines
posed no unusual problems, and that the project was completed as planned
with only minor start-up problems.   It was noted that KP&L would have to
rely on the technical expertise of expatriates for some years to come, and
that  an appropriate  training  program was  available  for  all  levels  of
personnel.  The sales and maximum demand forecasts were exceeded to such an
extent that with a tariff increase in 1974, the rate of return for the
project was 21% as compared with the appraisal estimate of 16%.
2.17       The Gitaru project was the last phase of the development of the
hydro potential at the Seven Forks of  the Tana River.   It is situated
between the Kamburu and Kindaruma power stations, and the three stations
operate in cascade. The project consisted of:
a)  a powerhouse with two 72-MW units with provision for a third
similar unit;
b)  a 30 meter high dam, 580 meters long;
c)  a 900 meter supply tunnel and a 4,700 meter tailrace tunnel;
d)  switching station;
e)  a 111-km transmission line to the Juja Road substation in
Nairobi; and
f)  three  studies:  Geothermal  Development  at  Olkaria  (para.
2.07); the National Power Development Plan 1978-2000 (para.
2.08); and a Management and Accounting Consultancy Study
(para. 6.06).
2.18      The Project Performance Audit Report No. 3505 dated June 24, 1981
states that the project was completed within the dates established by the
contracts, due to having good control and supervision by competent
consultants. It was also noted that the use of bonuses for the completion
of certain tasks by key dates provided the incentive for contractors to
cooperate with each other and to complete their portion of the work on
schedule.
2.19      The Olkaria Geothermal Power Project consisted of:
a)  a powerhouse;
b)  two   15-MW   steam   turbines   and   generators,   with   all
auxiliaries;
c)  a system to bring steam from the wells to the powerhouse;
d)  roads;
e)  housing;



- 12 -
f) switchyard;
g) a transmission line to join the existing Uganda - Nairobi
transmission line;
h) training component;
i) detailed studies of the geothermal field; and
j) a feasibility study of the proposed Kiambere hydroelectric
project.
2.20      The first unit was placed into commercial service in August 1981,
and the second in December 1982, some three months ahead of schedule.   A
project completion report will be prepared in FY84.
2.21        The Olkaria Geothermal Power Expansion project consisted of the
construction of an extension to the existing electric generating station
(para. 2.19), comprising the addition of one 15-MW turbine and generator
with  its  associated  auxiliaries  and  other  necessary  civil  works.    In
summary, the project is as follows:
a) An extension of the existing powerhouse to house a third
15-MW unit, complete with all auxiliaries and ancillary
electrical and mechanical equipment;
b) a system to bring steam from the wells now being drilled
under LN 1799-KE;
c) a new cooling tower, and other works associated
with the cooling water system;
d) an extension to the existing switchyard;
e) a new hard-surfaced road;
f) an augmentation of the water supply to the site and to the
drilling operations;
g) additional housing for an increase in operating staff;
h) detailed studies of the geothermal potential of the site;
j) studies for future projects;
k) consulting engineering.
2.22      This unit is scheduled to be placed in service in May of 1985.
Bank Strategy in the Power Sector
2.23       The Bank's continued lending in the power sector would assist in
funding  Kenya's   requirements   for   electrical   power,   for   technical
assistance, for the development of Kenyan personnel to fill middle and
senior management positions now held by expatriate staff, and for studies
on the justification and manner that existing resources may be developed to
meet the needs of the country.   Without this assistance, growth in the
industrial sector would stagnate, and retard the major objective of the
Fourth Five-Year Development Plan, aimed at alleviation of poverty through
the creation of income-earning opportunities and the provision of social
services to meet the basic needs of the population. In previous loans the
Bank has included funds for continued updating of the needs for the
development of new electrical generating facilities, and the Bank intends
to continue this practice.   The present long range planning for electric
power is now out of date, and the Bank's lending strategy provides funds
in LN 2237-KE for two studies: future geothermal development, and for the
determination of the least cost investment program.



- 13 -
Government Strategy in the Power Sector
2.24      The Government continues to give high priority to the development
of the power sector in view of its importance for the overall economic
development of Kenya.   Moreover,  the need to formulate a comprehensive
national energy development plan has become generally recognized by the
Government since the 1973-74 energy crisis. Thus, to meet the development
objectives for the energy sector as defined in the Development Plan
1979-83, investment by the Government over the Plan period in generation
expansion, transmission and distribution is estimated at US$226 million, of
which US$59 million has been allocated for the geothermal program.   The
large allocation (about 21% of total capital expenditure in the power
sector over the Plan period) reflects the Government's emphasis on power
development.
2.25         Via the Ministries of Finance and Planning,  and Energy and
Regional Development, the Government controls the electric power sector of
Kenya through licensing regulations, tariff structures and levels.
TII. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The main project objective is to assure a firm source of reliable
electric generating capacity to meet the growth in demand which is expected
to exceed the capabilities of the generating facilities existing in 1987.
The project would develop indigenous renewable energy resources and create
new  job opportunities  particularly  during  its  construction period.   A
further objective would be to reduce the country's heavy dependence on
imported oil.
Project Description (Annex 3)
3.02          The project  consists  of the construction of hydroelectric
generating facilities on the Tana River essentially as follows:
(a)  a rock and earthfill dam approximately 100 meters high with a
crest length of about one kilometer, and a saddle dam with a
concrete-lined spillway, which would provide a reservoir capacity
of about 585 million m3; and two diversion tunnels each of about
0.5 km long ;
(b) an intake; a concrete and steel-lined shaft and a tunnel 6.1 m in
diameter, and about 4.1 km long, to connect the reservoir to the
underground powerhouse, and a reinforced concrete surge shaft
near the downstream end of the tunnel;
(c) an underground powerhouse with two 70 MW vertical Francis
turbines; a tailrace tunnel of about 1.4 km long;
(d) a 220-kV switchyard;



- 14 -
(e)  80 km of 220-kV transmission lines)  to connect the generating
station to the existing grid; and
(f)  consultants'  services  for  detailed  design  and  construction
supervision; and a panel of experts to advise on civil works.
3.03       Upon completion of the project, the reservoir would be available
to regulate the flow of the Tana River, and carry stored water from a high
flow year to the next year.   The addition of 140 MW to the system would
bring the total capacity including the 30 MW bulk supply of UEB to 692 MW,
i.e. a 25% increase in installed capacity. It is expected to produce 910
GWh annually during an average water year which would increase the
capability of the system from 2,702 GWh to 3,602 GWh, a 33% increase in
energy output. During the dry years when the flow in the river is reduced
due to lack of rainfall, the expected output of the plant would be about
683 GWh annually.   With the dry season capability of 2,365 GWh in 1987,
this additional 683 GWh would raise the firm capability of the system to
3,048 GWh annually or an increase of 22%.
Environment
3.04      The proposed Kiambere dam and reservoir would be one of a series
of power producing facilities on the Upper Tana River. These projects are

3.05         A comprehensive environmental  study was carried out by the
Government and TARDA's consultants prior to the construction of the Upper
Reservoir (the only significant reservoir with about 1.5 billion m3
capacity,  providing  the  main  regulation  of  Tana  River  system).    The
findings and recommendations were issued in the report entitled "Upper
Reservoir  Pre-Construction  Environmental  Study"  dated  August,   1976.
Environmental aspects of the downstream area including the Kiambere site
and the flood plain were also reviewed in this study.  In a separate study,
Engineering and Power Development Consultants Ltd (EPDC) reviewed the
Kiambere environmental aspects and issued additional findings and
recommendations in a report entitled "Kiambere Hydroelectric Development"
of April 1980 covering the following aspects:



- 15 -
- Land acquisition
- Land utilization in proximity of the project
- Roads and other communications
- Operational requirements
- Housing
- Facilities and amenities
- Resettlement
- Requirement for downstream projects.
3.06          The  review by  EPDC  did not  disclose  negative  effects  of
sufficient magnitude to influence the construction of the proposed Kiambere
Dam.   However, a detailed study of the integrated development, possibly
including  resettlement,   was  not  completed  and  TARDA  has  retained
consultants to prepare a detailed study based on the Bank's terms of
reference. This study is expected to be completed in early 1984, and will
be sent to the Bank for review and comment.
3.07      There are four storage reservoirs, upstream of the Kiambere site
and to date no adverse effects have been observed on the regime of the
river. EPDC concluded that construction of the proposed project would have
no significant impact on the environment, as there are no permanent
settlements in the reservoir area.   Between the dam and the powerhouse,
however, about 1,000 persons live on both banks within 2 km of the river.
If a decision is made to permit some or all of these people to remain, it
would be necessary to provide a continuous supply of water through low
level outlets of the dam. An allowance for the implementation of works to
reduce the environmental impacts of the construction of the proposed
facilities has been included in the cost estimates.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Cost Estimates
4.01         The total project cost is estimated to be KSh 4,075 million
(US$312 million), of which 47%, amounting to KSh 1,928 million (US$148
million), is in foreign exchange. The net cost excluding duties and taxes
is estimated to be KSh 3,471 million (US$266 million).   The local costs
include KSh 604 million (US$46 million) for duties and taxes. A summary of
the cost estimate for the principal components of the project may be found
on the following page.
4.02        The cost estimates were prepared by Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold
and Uhlmann and Ewbank, Preece and Partners (WLPU and EP) on the basis of
tender prices received May 18, 1983 and adjusted by the mission on the
following page.   Physical contingencies of 20% were added to the civil
works contracts, in view of the uncertainty of the actual conditions which
would be encountered during the course of construction and the possibility
of  increased  quantities  of  excavation  and  fill  materials.    Physical
contingencies of 10% were added to the equipment contracts to allow for
unexpected changes in requirements.   Price contingencies as tabulated on
the previous page were then added to the base cost plus physical
contingencies.

Project Financing
4.03      The proposed Bank loan (US$95 million) would finance about 22% of
the estimated project costs (US$312 million), about 20% of the estimated
foreign component (US$148 million), and about 23% of the estimated local
component (US$164 million) of the project; and in each case, exclude
interest  during  construction  (US$27.3  million).    It would  be used  to
finance:
(a)  100% of the front-end fee on the Bank loan;
(b)  100% of the repayment of the two Project Preparation Facilities;
(c)  86% of the local expenditures and 4% of the foreign expenditures
for the dam contract, excluding taxes;
(d)  100% of  the foreign cost and 33% of the local  costs of the
consultants for the design and supervision of construction
beginning November 1, 1982;
(e)  100% of the interest during construction on the Bank loan; and
(f)  100% of the cost of the panel experts,  and the project team
leader beginning April 1, 1984.
4.04       Retroactive financing of about US$2.5 million would be used to
finance part of the cost of consulting engineering services from November
1,  1982.    The  financing  of  the  remaining  foreign  cost  of  the  dam
construction would be by the African Development Bank (AfDB) (54%), the
Saudi Fund for Development (28%), and the Yugoslav Bank for International
Economic Cooperation   (14%).   The Yugoslav Bank would also finance the
remainder of the local costs  on  the dam  contract.    Financing  of  the
underground works, i.e., the tunnels and the powerhouse, and the mechanical
and electrical equipment for the project would be through grants and loans
from various donor agencies, TARDA, and the Government. Tenders and offers
of financing for these items have been received by the Borrower, but
announcement of the tender awards and the donors will not be made until
discussions have been held with the various lending agencies concerned. It
is expected that these would be announced after Board presentation.
4.05       A Government contribution in the form of equity in the amount of
KSh 603.8 million (US$46.2 million) would be used to defray the cost of
duties and taxes imposed on the project.
4.06       TARDA, would provide the remaining funds estimated at KSh 628.5
million (US$48.1 million) equivalent to about 16% of the total cost of the
project including duties and taxes to cover the remaining unfunded compo-
nents of the project.  These funds would be provided through a development
surcharge from KP&L (para. 5.11).
4.07        The total external financing would be about US$259.5 million,
about 84% of the estimated cost including interest during construction and
not including duties and taxes.   The Bank loan to TARDA would be for 20
years including a 5-year grace period at the standard variable interest



- 18 -
rate.   A front-end fee of 0.25% of the loan amount would be due on or
before  the effective  date  and  would  be added  to the  loan  amount.   A
condition of effectiveness would be the receipt of evidence satisfactory to
the Bank that the effectiveness conditions of the other external sources
have been met. A summary of the financing plan (Annex 4) follows:

Engineering Consultants' Services and Project Implementation
4.08        Although KP&L and TARDA have remarkably good records regarding
the preparation and implementation of large hydroelectric projects, the
Bank requested TARDA to employ independent cost and design review
consultants  to  check  for  completeness  and  accuracy,  the  costs  and
appropriateness of the original design prepared by TARDA's consultants,
WLPU and EP (para 4.02).  This is the Bank's customary practice for large
projects in the power sector,  Two separate advances, one for US$250,000
(PPF No. 60) and a second for US$750,000 (PPF No. 68), were provided
through a project preparation facility to carry out the above cost and
design review by independent consultants on the basis of terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank.
4.09        TARDA would be responsible for project implementation, assisted
by civil engineering consultants, WLPU, and plant consultants, EP, who
prepared the bid documents, and by a financial manager, presently being
funded by the EEC.   It is estimated that of the total of about  10,000
man-months which would be required by the consultants, approximately 2,400
man-months would be spent in England, 2,400 man-months by expatriates in
Kenya,  and  5,200  man-months  by  local  staff  in Kenya.    The  foregoing
estimates cover not only design and supervision, but also management and
operation of the camp facilities, the provision of English-speaking
teachers and the staffing of a hospital with a doctor and medical support
staff. The total cost of the engineering contract is estimated to be about
US$39.4 million of which about US$30.6 million would be in foreign
exchange. The average cost for expatriates is about US$6,400 per man-month
and for local staff US$1,800 per man-month, including the cost of services,
plus travel, and miscellaneous expenses.   The panel of experts' man-month
rate would be about US$23,300 including cost of services, travel, living
and miscellaneous expenses reflecting the desired high quality of expertise



- 19 -
to  be  provided  to TARDA  during  the  construction.5/    The cost  of  the
project team leader has been estimated at US$0.7 million based on an
assignment of about 60 man-months at about US$12,000 per man-month covering
cost of services, travel, living and miscellaneous expenses, beginning
April 1, 1984.  Until then his services will be funded by the EEC.  During
negotiations, agreement was reached that TARDA would employ engineering
consultants, the panel of experts, a project team leader, and a financial
manager whose qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of
employment are satisfactory to the Bank.
4.10         The project implementation schedule (Annex 5) is based on a
target in-service date for both units on May 31, 1988.
4.11       In accordance with Bank practice, the design and general concept
of the dams have been reviewed by independent consultants (para. 4.08).
However, during negotiations, TARDA was requested to and agreed to continue
to retain a panel of experts, who would provide independent supervision of
the dams, to make periodic inspections after completion, and report to
TARDA and the Bank on the safety of the structures.
Procurement
4.12        Procurement for work and material financed by the Bank for the
construction of the main and the saddle dam together with the two diversion
tunnels, has been in accordance with Bank guidelines for international
competitive bidding (ICB) from prequalified tenderers. TARDA has proceeded
with ICB from prequalified contractors for all other contracts (4 for
underground works, and 8 for plant). These civil works and plant contracts
were based on the requirement that bids be accompanied by financing
offers.   Evaluation was first based on technical grounds; acceptable bids
were then compared on the basis of total evaluated costs including that of
the proposed financing package.
4.13      The request for submission of bids for civil works were issued to
prequalified  bidders  on  February  1,  1983  and  requests  for  bids  for
equipment were issued to prequalified bidders on February 25, 1983.   All
bids were received on May 18, 1983.  TARDA expects to award all contracts
before the expiration of a revised validity period but after Bank Board
presentation.
Disbursement
4.14        The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed over five years on
the following basis:
(a)  100% of the reimbursement of the PPF;
(b)  100% of the front-end fee;
(c)  86%  of  the  local  cost  and  4%  of  the  foreign  cost  of  the
construction of the dams;
(d)  100% of the foreign cost and  33% of  the  local costs  of  the
consultants Eor the design and supervision of construction
beginning November 1, 1982;
5/ TARDA would like to keep the original panel for the design review of the
project for the construction supervision.



- 20 -
(e) 100% of the interest during construction on the Bank loan; and
(f) 100% of the cost of the panel of experts, and the project team
leader beginning April 1, 1984.
4.15         The remaining costs would be disbursed from funds of other
lenders,  TARDA,  and  the Government.   All disbursements  would be fully
documented by TARDA. The closing date for the loan would be June 30, 1989
and any savings which may accrue due to lower purchase prices, or if
contingency funds are not needed, would be cancelled.   The disbursement
schedule (Annex 6) deviates from the Bank disbursement profile for hydro
projects for East Africa because funds are being provided only for the dam
construction and consultants.
Accounts and Audit
4.16        KP&L, KPC and TRDC prepare their accounts in accordance with
sound commercial and public utility accounting practices. These accounts
are currently audited by Gill and Johnson, whose performance has been
generally satisfactory and acceptable to the Bank.   KP&L also prepares
consolidated statements for KPC and TRDC and for all three companies.
During negotiations it was agreed that the requirements of the Bank for
earlier Bank loans (745-KE, 1147-KE, 1799-KE and 2237-KE) relating to
submission of annual accounts of the three companies within six months of
the end of the financial year certified by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank, and submission of consolidated accounts of the three
companies, would be repeated for the proposed loan.
4.17           TARDA's  accounting  procedures  were  designed  to meet  the
requirement of Government as well as commercial accounting standards and to
provide necessary data relative to the construction program. The audit for
the fiscal year 1981 has been completed and the accounts for FY82 will be
submitted to the Auditor General shortly.   However, the Auditor General,
due to a considerable work load, has not expeditiously performed the audit
on accounts. This has not been critical in the past as TARDA's activities
have been very limited. TARDA believes that there should be no problem in
the future in obtaining more timely audits from the Auditor General and
that it would be able to submit its audited accounts to the Bank within six
months after the close of the fiscal year.   During negotiations it was
agreed that TARDA would submit its accounts to the Bank, certified by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, within six months of the end of
the fiscal year.  It is anticipated that the audit of the Auditor General
would be acceptable to the Bank and that no additional audit would be
required.  It was also agreed that TARDA would submit appropriate data by
June  30 on each preceding  calendar year  so  as  to  make  possible  the
determination of the sector (excluding rural electrification) rate of
return on average net revalued assets.
V.   FINANCIAL ASPECTS AND COST RECOVERY
Introduction
5.01       The public power sector in Kenya exclusive of rural electrifica-
tion is presently comprised of the activities of four companies - KP&L,



- 21 -
TRDC, KPC and TARDA. For convenience, the term, KP&L companies, is used in
this report to cover the joint activities of KP&L, TRDC and KPC.   These
companies are closely connected through common management and staff while
only the power operations of the fourth, TARDA, are carried out by the
staff  and management of KP&L.   For the purposes of this report it is
assumed  that  the  Kerio  Valley  Development  Authority  (KVA),  would  be
responsible for the implementation of the Turkwel Hydroelectric Project.
5.02      The financial performance and position of the KP&L companies have
been consolidated (Annexes 7-10) as these companies are very closely
associated and should not be evaluated in isolation.  However, an evalua-
tion of the operations of the sector (excluding rural electrification) must
include the power related operation of TARDA and KVA.   Accordingly, the
operating income of the KP&L companies and the power related operations of
TARDA and KVA have been combined (Annex 11) by eliminating all inter-
company transactions.   The combined operating income has been related to
the combined revalued net fixed assets to develop a rate of return for the
entire power sector, excluding rural electrification (para. 5.12).
5.03       TARDA began its power operations with the commissioning of the
Masinga Power Station in December 1981. Operations prior to this date were
limited and not power related.  Details of TARDA's operations are shown in
Annexes 12 to 14.
Past Financial Performance
5.04      The operations of the KP&L companies from 1979 through 1982 based
on audited annual accounts are summarized below.

a!   This reflects historical cost depreciation as reflected in audited
accounts; however, operating expenses have been adjusted for rate of
return computation purposes to reflect depreciation on the revalued
asset basis.



- 22 -
5.05       The consolidated rates of return for the three companies for the
years  1979-1982  were  7.9%,  6.4%,  11.6% and  7.2% respectively.    These
results reflect an adequate earnings position which in 1981 was substan-
tially above the 7% earnings requirement of Loan 1799-KE.   The Government
has approved an increase in tariffs in 1983 so as to further improve the
earning position of the companies (para. 5.10).
5.06       Net income for the years 1981 and 1982 have been significantly
decreased due to exchange losses resulting from currency revaluation.
These currency rate fluctuations have also had adverse effects on the
foreign currency debt of the  three  companies.   In the rate of return
covenant (para. 5.12) the provision for annual pro forma revaluation of
assets on a price index agreed between KP&L, TARDA and the Bank, which
would reflect the increases in the replacement cost of fixed assets due to
currency rate fluctuation as well as inflation would be repeated.
Financial Position
5.07       Annex 8 details the three KP&L companies' consolidated financial
position based on audited accounts on December 31, 1981, and  1982.  These
results are summarized below.

5.08      The working capital positions of the three companies at June 30,
1980 and 1982 are acceptable with current ratios of 2.0 and 1.8, respec-
tively, due primarily to good control of debtors; account receivables
amounted to about two months' billing.   The cash position at end 1982 was
very low but is expected to improve during the project period.   However,
there could be a minor cash problem during the project years.   KP&L has
available a short term line of credit with local commercial banks to
provide necessary funds if small cash shortages are experienced. A history
of the loan capital structure is shown in Annex 15.

KP&L Tariffs
5.09       Based on a tariff study performed by the Bank in 1977, a tariff
structure, giving consideration to long-run marginal costs (LRMC), was
introduced in January 1979.  A fuel oil surcharge has been added to allow
KP&L to recover any increase in the cost of fuel used in power generation.
The detail of the current tariff is shown in Annex 16.
5.10          The commissioning  of  the Masinga Hydroelectric  Station in
December of 1981; the strengthening of transmission interconnection between
the coast, central and eastern areas of Kenya in 1983; and the planned
commissioning of geothermal and hydro generating capacity in the 1980s
(Kiambere and Turkwel) have changed and will substantially change the
operating characteristics of the power sector in Kenya. Therefore KP&L has
recently carried out a new tariff study based on LRMC and has obtained
approval from Government for appropriate revision of the tariff levels,
which calls for a K48 increase in the average revenue per kWh every year,
the first increase was effective June 1, 1983 with subsequent increases
every January 1.  This tariff revision program was confirmed by Government
during negotiations.
5.11       KP&L has in the past assisted the financing of TRDC's and KPC's
construction programs by paying a development surcharge which provided
local currency funds for capital expenditure.  The funds for this develop-
ment surcharge are obtained from the application of the tariff and are not
identified to the consumer. KP&L plans to utilize this practice to provide
local fund assistance to TARDA and, for the purpose of this report it is
assumed, to KVA for the construction of Turkwel.  TARDA, KP&L and the Bank
have agreed that for Kiambere, a reasonable amount of this contribution
would be at least 15% of the total cost of the project including interest
during construction, duties and taxes (15.6% excluding duties and taxes).
This agreement has been incorporated in the proposed lease being negotiated
by  KP&L  and  TARDA.    To  meet  local  cost  requirements  the  financial
projections reflect a contribution of KSh 628.5 million.   KP&L has agreed
that this level of contribution would be acceptable and is prepared to make
available additional funds if necessary to meet these requirements.
5.12          The tariff  revision program agreed  to during  negotiations
(para. 5.10) would provide necessary funds during the project period and
would produce rates of return for the sector on revalued asset basis of
7.2% in 1983, 7.9% in 1984, 9.2% in 1985, 9.7% in 1986, 10.4% in 1987 and
8.9% in 1988.   By December 31, 1988, the KP&L companies will have a cash
position of KSh 125.8 million. With the possible utilization of short-term
financing during critical times in the construction period (para. 5.08),
the power sector would be able to meet its financial requirements with the
program which would result in rates of return of at least 8% from 1984 and
1985, 10% for 1986 and 1987 and 8% thereafter.  Therefore during negotia-
tions it was agreed that Government would take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary to permit KP&L to obtain the necessary revenues to pro-
duce these rates of return on the combined average net fixed assets of the
sector excluding rural electrification, revalued in accordance with the
price index agreed to between KP&L, TARDA and the Bank, and during the
construction of the Kiambere project to obtain revenues sufficient to
contribute at least 15% of the total cost of the project including interest
during construction, duties and taxes.

- 25 -
5.14        During the project period  1983-1988,  the Kenya power sector
construction program anticipates expenditures of KSh 10,540 million,
(US$806 million) including interest during construction of KSh 966 million,
(US$74 millions).   About 44%, KSh 4,625 million (US$354 million) of this
total construction program relates to the proposed project.   Based on the
financing plan outlined in para. 5.13, this program would be feasible and
would not endanger the soundness of the sector.
5.15        Initernal generation after covering debt service and dividends
would produce 31% of the funds required during 1983/1988 period (or 33%
exclusive of duties and taxes).
J.16       All of the toreign exchange expenditures and some of the local
expenditures would be financed from external financial sources. This would
be appropriate as many of the foreign loans carry soft terms. Exclusive of
duties and taxes borrowing would provide 61% of fund requirements.   The
Bank's share of this financing plan, KSh 1,242 million (US$95 million),
would contribute 12% of the total requirements.
5.1/      Other loans and grants are expected to be made to TARDA or to the
Government. The eftective lending and onlending interest rates to TARDA on
its other loans are expected not to exceed 10% as the terms of many of the
foreign loans would be soft and it has been a Government policy to onlend
foreign funds to Government entities at an interest rate slightly above
that being charged Government by the foreign agency.  TARDA would bear the
exchange and interest risk.  Under the proposed lease (para. 6.05) for use
of the Kiambere hydroelectric station KP&L would pay TARDA a rental which
would cover TARDA's debt service on Kiambere over a twenty year period
after commissioning at an interest rate of 11.5% which is slightly below
the estimated local inflation rate.   However, KP&L proposes to delay the
signing of this agreement until the lending and onlending terms to TARDA
are finalized.   During negotiations the Bank and Government agreed that
the execution of the onlending agreement with TARDA and the lease agreement
between TARDA and KP&L would be conditions of effectiveness.
Future Operations and Financial Performance
5.18      The projected operation of Kenya's power sector, excluding rural
electrification for the years 1983/90 together with notes and assumptions
used  in  their  development,  are  shown  in  Annexes  7  through  11.    The
projections indicate that the sectors' financial performance and condition
would be satisfactory throughout this period on the basis ot the tariff
levels consistent with the proposed covenant  (para.  5.12).   During the
period, electricity sales are forecast to increase at about 6% per year
while revenues, reflecting both demand and annual tariff increases would
increase over 3 times.   Key financial indicators during the construction
period follow:

VI. THE BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCY
The Borrower and Power Supply Entities
6.01       The Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA) would be
the borrower, and the executing agency for the proposed loan.   The power
companies (para. 2.02) responsible for the generation and distribution of
power have competent management, are operated efficiently, and are among
the best  electric  utility  organizations  in  Africa.    Annex  17  gives  a
history of the power companies and Annex 18 contains a description of each
organization.
6.02         TARDA, a regional development  agency,  is accountable  to the
Ministry of Energy and Regional Development.   Founded in 1974 as the Tana
River Development Authority, TARDA changed its name in 1981 upon assuming
the planning responsibility for the Athi River Basin.   Its duties include
the following:
(a)  to advise the Government on all development possibilities within
the Tana and Athi River basins;
(b)  to establish long range plans for the effective utilization of
the water resources of these basins;
(c)  to  coordinate  and  maintain  all  development  projects  in  the
catchment area and, in some cases, undertake the execution of
development projects including power projects; and
(d)  maintain liaison between the Government, the private sector and
foreign agencies in development of the Tana and Athi basins.



- 27 -
6.03       TARDA's Board of Directors consists of a Chairman, appointed by
the President, seven Permanent Secretaries from various Ministries, the
General Manager of the National Irrigation Board, the Chairman of KP&L, the
Director of Water Development, and five representatives from various
sectors  who  are  appointed  by  the  Minister  of  Energy  and  Regional
Development, in consultation with the President. Day-to-day management is
delegated to the Managing Director, with four department managers for: (i)
the Athi River Planning Team, (ii) Tana River Planning Team, (iii) Finance
and Personnel and (iv) Administration. In addition, a project team leader
(position vacant since August 1982) and a financial advisor, the only staff
directly attached to TARDA's power activities, report to the Managing
Director.     In  August  1982  TARDA  had  110  employees,  including  two
expatriates (a financial adviser, and a hydro resources and irrigation
engineer).
6.04           Existing  staff  are  competent  to  carry  out  the  financial
responsibilities  of  the  organisation.    However,  TARDA  requires  other
technical assistance, and would carry out the project with the help of
engineering  (all  expatriates)  consultants.    TARDA would also employ a
project team leader and two civil engineers who would be responsible for
construction supervision and management activities for the project.
Similar arrangements were made for the implementation of the Masinga
hydroelectric project which was successfully completed in December 1981.
In addition, TARDA would be assisted by KP&L who would be associated with
all phases of project implementation: design, procurement, construction and
site supervision on the basis of regular information by correspondence and
coordinating meetings.  As KP&L would be responsible for the operation of
the project power facilities, a technical training program would be
designed for KP&L staff and training would be provided as part of the
contracts for supply of major items of equipment.   TARDA has employed a
part-time panel of experts to review and advise on the solution of possible
construction problems. These arrangements are adequate.
6.05       At present, the only electricity facility owned by TARDA is the
Masinga hydroelectric generating station, which is managed and staffed by
KP&L, which (through TRDC) purchases the energy on the basis of an agreed
price per unit of electricity received.   These revenues received by TARDA
cover its debt service related to the financing of Masinga hydroelectric
station while operating and administration costs, including insurance, are
borne by KP&L.   KP&L and TARDA have  sometimes  found  this  arrangement
inequitable and prefer to utilize a different approach and have negotiated
a leasing agreement to cover the generating costs of Kiambere.   During
appraisal, KP&L, TARDA, and MERD agreed in principle to an alternative
arrangement  for  operation  of  Kiambere  power  station  after  it  is
commissioned.    The  essential  features  of  the  arrangement  would  be as
follows:
(a)  KP&L  would   have   the   right   to   lease   and   operate   the
electricity-related   Kiambere   installations   including   the
powerhouse, substations, etc.;
(b) KP&L would operate and manage these installations and bear all
direct operating costs associated therewith;



- 28 -
(c)  KP&L would pay the following amounts  as rent  for the leased
facilities:
(i)   TARDA's overhead expenses (a fixed charge of KSh 4 million
per year, subject to periodic review); and
(ii)  Debt   servicing   requirements   for   Kiambere   station's
electricity-related fixed assets.
6.06      The above arrangement is considered satisfactory to the Bank for
the following reasons:
(a)  KP&L with experience in operation of similar power stations would
have full responsibility for operation of the Kiambere power
station.   TARDA would, therefore, not be required to duplicate
similar capabilities to operate and manage power plants and would
consequently be able to devote its efforts more fully to its
primary functions of regional planning and development.
(b)  KP&L would have the incentive to make the best possible use of
the leased plant in coordinating the plant's operation with the
operation of other generating facilities in the country since
Kiambere plant's  operational  and cost  considerations would be
substantially similar to those of other plants.
(c)  KP&L would have a relatively dependable basis for forecasting the
cost of energy from the Kiambere plant and it would, therefore,
be in a position to establish realistic levels for its
electricity tariffs.
(d)  TARDA would  receive sufficient  revenue from KP&L through the
lease agreement to service all its loans related to the financing
of Kiambere.
Insurance
6.07       The three KP&L power companies maintain sufficient coverage for
the power operations against loss from fire and special perils in addition
to normal coverage such as for the motor vehicle fleet, workman's
compensation, personal accident, third party liability, etc. This coverage
incorporates  the  operation  of  TARDA's  electricity  assets  and  the
arrangement is satisfactory to the Bank.
Billing and Collection
6.08         Customers of KP&L are billed monthly on a cyclical billing
basis.  The major portion of this billing is computerized and performed in
Nairobi.  A small number of large users in Mombasa and on the Coast are
billed manually in Mombasa as this approach results in more rapid
collection of these revenues.   A strict "disconnection for non-payment"
practice  is maintained for all non-government accounts.   The value of
accounts receivable have been maintained at a 65-day revenue level which is
acceptable particularly when the effect of the slower payment of Government



- 29 -
accounts due to normal, more intricate Government payment practices is
considered.
Training
6.09      KP&L has several training programs designed to produce qualified
staff to meet the company's normal growth and to compensate for the
frequent loss of employees to other sectors of the economy because of
salary differentials.  The cost of training in 1982 was KSh 23 million for
352 trainees.   Of these,  there were  31  students  at university  and  2
graduate apprentices primarily in mechanical and electrical engineering.
Presently there are 177 trainees in the Technicians Training Program,
sponsored by KP&L at the polytechnic schools in Nairobi and Mombasa. This
number will be increased by at least 50 as a result of January 1983
recruitments. One hundred and twenty seven candidates who did not meet the
requirements for training as technicians were apprenticed as linesmen,
mechnical and electrical fitters, welders,  etc.   Ten of the middle and
senior managers attended management courses conducted abroad, and 20 more
attended courses by the Kenya Institute of Administration and the East
African Management Institute. Other training requirements were covered in
a previous Bank project (LN 1799-KE).   KP&L's training arrangements are
satisfactory.
Staff
6.10      TARDA's staff directly attached to its power operation include a
hydro resources and irrigation engineer and a financial adviser (both
expatriates).  However, since KP&L would be associated with all phases of
project implementation and would be responsible for operating the project
facilities, it is more appropriate to examine the staffing position in
KP&L.
6.11         The staff of KP&L at November 30,  1982, inclusive of staff
attached to KPC and TRDC, numbered 5300, an increase of about 6% over the
past  year.    The  increase  in  staff  was  employed  mainly  in  the  line
maintenance  to  improve  the  distribution  network.    There  has  been  a
significant reduction in expatriate staff as evidenced by the fact that in
1970 there were 189 expatriate professional staff, 120 in 1974 and 53 in
1982.  The number of metered connections on November 30, 1982 was 177,702
and there were about 34 consumers per employee.   This compares favorably
with some of the other East African countries 6/ and is reasonable
considering the number of installations (some 25 power stations spread over
Kenya), the distances involved, the amount of construction work carried out
by the company, and staff training needs.
6.12         Maintaining  the establishment  at full strength as well as
avoiding a deterioration in the quality of staff are continuing problems.
Departing expatriate staff have generally been replaced with qualified
local staff, and there are a number of vacancies which KP&L is having
6/ Mauritius 74;  Tanzania 22;  and Madagascar 38.



- 30 -
difficulty in filling with suitable candidates, particularly in the area of
finance and accounting. The post of Finance Manager has been vacant due to
better paid jobs in the private industries. However, KP&L has identified a
suitable local candidate to fill the position of the Finance Manager, and
he commenced employment with KP&L early 1983.  The standard of management
of the companies has been maintained at a satisfactory level since the
appraisal of the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project in 1978. KP&L will have
to rely on expatriates for some years but their need is decreasing and
eventually all posts will gradually be filled by properly trained Kenyans
as they become available in the market or through the efforts of the
training program (para. 6.09).
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
6.13       During negotiations the reports and records necessary to monitor
progress of the project and its evaluation on completion were agreed.
Proposed guidelines for a project monitoring system are given in Annex 19.
On completion of the project KP&L will prepare a project completion
report.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Demand and Market
7.01       Sales of electricity have been rapid during the last decade with
an average annual growth of about 9%, with the highest growth 11.2%,
achieved in 1977 at the peak of the coffee boom, and the lowest rate, 7.6%
recorded in 1974 following the 1973 petroleum crisis.   In recent years,
the growth rate has declined to less than 8% p.a. as a result of a slowdown
in economic activities.
7.02             An  analysis  of  historical  growth  trends  relating  the
growth in sales for the two major categories:   (a) domestic and small
commercial, and (b) industrial and large commercial, to the growth in
overall gross domestic product and manufacturing sector growth rates
respectively, was carried out.   A high correlation, at greater than 95%
confidence level, was found to exist between power sales growth and
economic growth.   On this basis, functional relationships were determined
for the two basic groups of consumers (domestic and small commercial, and
industrial and large commercial) on the assumption that the historical
relationships will continue in the medium term (up to 2000).  In the long
run, these relationships may change as a greater percentage of the
population is served and as the industrial sector matures. However, such a
change may not occur until after the study period of this project (beyond
year 2000).
7.03      In addition to consumption forecasts for the two basic categories
discussed above, individual forecasts have been made for off-peak sales
(interruptible supply for domestic water heating and irrigation pumping),
street lighting, and supply to KP&L staff.   The forecast of industrial
sales has been adjusted to take into account specific new industrial loads
resulting from projects either under construction or with a high proba-
bility of realization. The overall sales were found to have a growth rate
of    about    6%    p.a.    between    1982    to    1990    which    is

lower than the historical growth rate, due to expectations of lower
economic growth.  Energy sales and average yearly growth rate of consumer
groups are as follows:

in 1980.
7.04         It is evident from the above table,  that industry and large
commercial consumers are by far the largest group, and the Bank expects
that it will remain so in the foreseeable future.   Details of the load
forecast are given in Annex 20.
7.05        The timing for the addition of new generation capacity has been
determined  by KP&L and confirmed  by the appraisal  mission.    Based  on
existing capacities, available cost estimates and the load forecast, the
present program would be the least cost solution (Annex 19). By 1988 total
system firm capacity would be about 480 MW and 2,313 GWh 7/ (excluding
Kiambere) but would be insufficient to meet the expected demand of 465 MW
and 2,771 GWh with minimum system reserves of 105 MW (corresponding to one
of the largest hydro units and one of the largest thermal units out of
service).   Additional capacity (the proposed Kiambere project 140 MW, 683
GWh firm energy) would therefore be needed to meet the energy requirements
in 1988.
7.06        The present power sector development plan has evolved from the
National Power Development Plan (1978-2000) prepared by M&M and Gibb in
1978.    This  study  reviewed  several  alternative  scenarios  to meet  the
expected load growth, beginning with the Olkaria project (para. 7.08) and
taking into account the potential for development of both hydro and thermal
schemes. The study recommended construction of the Kiambere project to be
completed in 1985;   however,  project preparation was delayed while new
7/ Allowing for retirements and assuming that Uganda cannot guarantee firm
supply of 30 MW and 250 GWh.



- 32 -
engineering studies were undertaken.   WLPU and EP, TARDA's consultants,
revised the load forecast and completed the new studies and indicated that
although the Kiambere project is the least cost next generation addition,
it could not be completed before 1988.   On that basis, it was found that a
small deficit in meeting the demand would occur in 1985 before the
completion of Kiambere (para. 2.08) and the construction of the third 15-MW
Olkaria geothermal unit was planned for completion in 1985 (para. 2.21 and
2.22).
7.07       Further deficits of about 10 MW and 30 MW may occur in 1986 and
1987 respectively based on the current demand forecast.   Construction of
additional geothermal units at Olkaria cannot be considered as an
alternative to meet these deficits as the availability of steam has not
been proven;  therefore,  KP&L  planned  the  construction  of  a 30-MW gas
turbine driven unit in 1985 at Mombasa.   The availability of this gas
turbine unit would also permit the operation of the Masinga reservoir and
the Tana cascade hydro plants in a mode which would maximize average annual
energy, thereby reducing thermal generation at the existing Kipevu thermal
plant.   Mombasa is the second largest load center after Nairobi and the
proposed gas turbine would increase system supply reliability in the
Mombasa area.  However, in view of the constraints imposed by the lack of
funds, and to reduce the need for further tariff increases, KP&L has
decided to defer the construction of the gas-turbine plant, and accept
load-shedding, if demand exceeds supply during peak demand periods.
Need for the Project
7.08.      TARDA's consultants (WLPU and EP) have demonstrated that Kenya
needs additional generation capacity in 1988 (Annex 20) to meet the power
and firm energy requirements for Kenya's expected load growth and this has
been verified by the Bank's  consulting economist.   The Kiambere output
would have an annual average generation of 910 GWh.  Without the Kiambere
project's two 70 MW hydroelectric units it is expected that during a dry
year, when power from Uganda is not available, there could be a 90 MW
deficit in capacity and a 458 GWh energy deficit in 1988.
Least Cost Power Generation Solution
7.09         Additional generation facilities should be added to Kenya's
existing system when either maximum demand exceeds firm system capacity or
firm  energy  capability  (para.  7.06).    Beginning  in  1988,  the  system
requires additional firm energy before  firm capacity.   The technically
feasible new plant alternatives are:
(a) gas turbine or diesel units;
(b) Kiambere hydroelectric project;
(c) geothermal units;
(d) imported oil or coal fired steam units; and
(e) other hydropower plants.
7.10         Another possibility is the importation of power from either
Tanzania or Uganda, since large amounts of relatively low cost hydro energy
could be developed in those countries. However, it is unlikely that Uganda
would be able to increase its committed supply  level to Kenya beyond the



- 33 -
present level of 250 GWh/yr (the existing 30 MW contract runs through 2005)
before 1990. Increasing load growth in Uganda could also prevent UEB from
guaranteeing a firm supply in the absence of any addition to Uganda's
generating  capability.    Since  there  are  no  firm  commitments  for  such
additions, it has been assumed that the 30 MW capacity from Uganda would
not be available at the time of the yearly peak after 1988 since both
system peaks occur during the same season.   Furthermore, in keeping with
Government objectives to ensure national independence in energy supply, the
assumption that the 250 GWh/year energy supply from the Uganda Electricity
Board (UEB) would not be a firm source after 1987 has been used by the
appraisal mission  in deriving  the energy balance.   Even if UEB energy
supply were available, a firm energy deficit of 76 GWh would occur in
1988.   It is nevertheless  expected that the 250 GWh/year supply would
continue to be available to the end of the existing contract, (2005) and
would be used to augment the Tana system reservoirs, and displace thermal
generation.   There is a good possibility  that  after  the  Kiambere  and
Turkwel capacity have been fully utilized, imported power from either
Uganda or Tanzania could be the least cost solution to meet load growth
when compared to additional thermal generation.
7.11      Although a number of potential sites for hydroelectric generation
have been identified in Kenya including sites on the Tana, Athi, Turkwel
and other rivers, none of these sites could be considered as a possible
alternative to the Kiambere project, because none have been studied in
sufficient detail so that they could be developed for operation by 1988
8/. Furthermore, the 1978 power sector development plan identified
Kiambere as the cheapest site for next development.   Gas turbines, diesel
units, oil- and coal-steam units based on imported fuel are by far the most
expensive  alternatives  compared  to  Kiambere.    However,  additional  gas
turbines and diesel units were considered to firm up hydro energy in dry
years or to defer the addition of new hydro plants with large investment
costs in the event of a capacity  constraint  only.   Therefore possible
programs to satisfy the load growth to 1995 have been determined from the
options below:

- 34 -
7.12       On the basis of above generation options and simulation studies
involving the analysis of many development strategies, the Kiambere project
has been demonstrated (Annex 21) to be the least cost generation solution
to meet the demand up to 1990/91.  Additional generation would likely be a
blend of hydro and geothermal generation if power interconnections with the
neighboring countries is not possible.
7.13       Development alternatives with any oil-fired or coal-fired steam
plants were found to be the most expensive alternatives for the tested
discount rates (10 to 28%) because of very high imported fuel prices
(US$180 and US$70/ton for fuel oil and coal respectively).   Sensitivity
studies have shown that even at US$50 per ton, the coal-fired steam plant
is far more expensive than Kiambere, and postponement of Kiambere even for
one year by an oil-fired plant would not be justified.   Expansion of the
existing Gitaru hydroelectric generating station by a third 72-MW unit was
considered and was found to be one of the most expensive solutions.   The
following three development programs are the most meaningful among several
tested to meet the demand through 1993:
Year to be
Commissioned   Alternative A          Alternative B          Alternative C
1987       Kiambere (70 MW)       Gas Turbine(25MW)
1988       Kiambere (70 MW)       Gas Turbine(2x25MW)  Gas turbine
(3x25 MW)
1989                              Coal Steam (120 MW)  Geothermal (45MW)
Gas turbine (35MW)
1990       Turkwel  (60 MW)                              Kiambere (70 MW)
1991       Turkwel  (60 MW)                              Kiambere (70 MW)
1992       Geothermal (30 MW)   Kiambere (70 MW)
1993       Geothermal (15 MW)   Kiambere (70 MW)
1994                                                     Turkwel (60 MW)
Alternative A is Kenya's   current power sector development program and,
therefore,  has been taken as the base case for comparison.   The plant
additions up to 1987 (viz. the third 15 MW Olkaria geothermal unit) was
omitted from the least-cost analysis since it is common to each
alternative. Since Alternatives B and C would provide greater capacity and
firm energy than Alternative A, an allowance in 1994 for the residual
values of the extra gas turbine capacity provided by these alternatives has
been made in the cash flows of the least cost analysis.  A fourth option,
which tested the sequence of Turkwel versus geothermal (i.e. Kiambere,
geothermal, Turkwel), was also examined during appraisal and results of the
analysis suggest that geothermal development before Turkwel could be more
costly for all discount rates. The installation of gas turbines to firm up
existing hydro generating plant and defer Kiambere by one year was found to
be more costly than constructing Kiambere in 1988.
7.14          The analysis  of  the  three  development  programs  above  has
indicated that alternative A, beginning with Kiambere, would be the least
cost program for discount rates up to 24% for A versus C, and 23% for A
versus B. In addition, Alternative B beginning with a coal steam plant to
delay the need for Kiambere, would be more costly than using gas turbines



- 35 -
and geothermal for the same purpose for discount rates up to 22%.   The
present values of incremental costs of each alternative at varying discount
rates are shown in Annex 21, in which a description and analysis of the
alternative development programs are also given.
Sensitivity
7.15      Sensitivity tests have been carried out to determine the effects
of a 10% increase in capital costs of the project and a 10% reduction in
total demand as well as a reduction in coal costs to $50/ton. For project
capital cost increases of 10%, Alternative A remains the least cost than
competing alternatives for discount rates up to 21%, versus Alternative B,
and 21% versus Alternative C. Alternative C results in a lower cost than B
up to  21%.   If  coal  costs  are  $50/ton,  and  project  costs  are +10%,
Alternatives A and C still are less costly than B for discount rates up to
19% and 17% respectively.   If total demand were to reduce by 10% through
1988 (corresponding to an average growth rate of about 4.2% p.a.) the need
for Kiambere would be delayed by less than one year.    The possibility of
such a drop in growth is considered to be remote.
Economic Rate of Return
7.16       The economic rate of return of the project is the discount rate
at which the present value of the capital and operating costs of the
project  equals  the  present  value  of  incremental  project  benefits  as
measured by the value of production according to the existing average
tariff of 0.70 KSh/kWh (effective June 1983) and attributable fuel savings
in an average hydro year, assuming load growth at 6% p.a.   The economic
rate of return from the project would be 10%.   This rate of return is a
conservative estimate because it does not include non-quantifiable benefits
to the country, always associated with the development of new power
projects.   Nevertheless, this rate of return is lower than the estimated
opportunity cost  of capital  (about  12%).   A tariff of 85 K cents/kWh
effective June 1, 1983 would have been required  to give a 12% rate of
return. Should project costs increase by 10%, the rate of return would be
9.4%, while if total demand were 10% less than forecast (corresponding to
an average growth rate of about 4% p.a. to 1988, increasing to about 5% by
1992) the economic rate of return is estimated to be 9.5% (Annex 22).
Long Run Marginal Cost
7.17      The Long Run M1arginal Cost (LRMC) of power sales is estimated at
83.2 Kcts/kWh or about 17% higher than the present tariff of 70 Kcts/kWh
plus  1 Kct  tax.   However,  financial  requirements  will  be met  by  the
proposed tariff program (para. 5.12).  Annex 23 gives details of the LRMC
calculation.
Project Risks
7.18       Load growth: The future load growth accepted in this report is
lower than the past growth and assumes that the existing economic recession
will continue into the next decade.   There is a slight chance that the
actual growth could be lower than the estimates due to possible further



- 36 -
economic deterioration.    In that  case, projects following the Kiambere
power project would be rescheduled.
7.19      Tariffs:  A further point of consideration is that of the tariff
increases that are required in order to satisfy earning requirements;
however, timely tariff increases have been introduced in the past, which
suggest there is no undue risk in this respect.   Experience in Kenya has
shown no appreciable effect on growth of demand due to tariff increases
except in the case of water heating when tariff increases have been
designed to encourage use of solar water heaters, a desirable strategy
which should continue.  Since electricity amounts to less than 2% of total
cost of all inputs used in Kenya's industrial sector, no effect on demand
has been experienced in spite of doubling industrial tariffs since 1975.
It is thus expected that the future demand growth would not be materially
affected by the proposed tariff increases and that any effect has already
been taken into account in projecting future demand.
7.20      Construction and project costs: Although site investigations and
sub-surface exploration have shown that geological conditions of some areas
of the underground excavation are not favorable, TARDA's consultants and
the Bank's engineering geologist have not identified any potential risk
that could be a problem for the physical construction of the project. All
possible construction risks have been taken into consideration by TARDA's
cost consultants and by the Bank's cost expert (para. 4.02).
7.21       The important risks are explained above.   All other risks are
considered to be minor and may be solved without any major cost increases.
Bids will be received on May 18, 1983 so that the cost of major contracts
would be known before Board presentation.   No major physical risks are
anticipated in implementing the proposed project beyond those that are
normally expected in the construction of a project of this type and size.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION

1.            The existing power supply facilities  of the interconnected
system are mainly located at the more densely populated narrow strip
running across the southern part of the country from Mombasa through
Nairobi to Lake Victoria in parallel with the railway, and along the coast.
as shown on the map (Map IBRD 17029).   The northern and eastern parts of
the country are arid, and because of the scattered population, consumers do
not have easy access to electricity.
2.           A 132-kV powerline link connects Kenya and Uganda power grid
(UEB), and Kenya imports power of about 30 MW per year. As of December 31,
1981, the total installed capacity of the interconnected system including
the Uganda link (30-MW) is about 571-MW with an effective capacity of about

7.            KP&L has an effective  communication system  throughout  the
country.   It has used land mobile radio-telephone equipment satisfactorily
for many years. Maintenance crews working on transmission lines and almost
all important power plants and substantions are linked by radio-telephone.
A powerline carrier (PLP) communication network has been used throughout
the grid satisfactorily.   The primary means of communication between the
regional administrative centers and the headquarter and grid control center
(load dispatching center) in Nairobi is the public telephone system as
operated by the Kenya Post and Telecommunication corporation and KP&L's PLC
system.

KIAMBERE HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
Project Description
General Description
1.            Kiambere Gorge offers particularly favorable prospects for
hydropower development due to the steep gradient, promising dam sites and
the fact that a sharp bend in the river valley offers construction of an
aggregate of water passages (Map IBRD 16895).
2.           The selected site is located on the Tana River some 150 km
north-east of Nairobi and some 35 km downstream of the lowest of the
existing hydropower stations at Kindaruma (para. 3.04), and as there are no
major tributary inflows over the intervening reach, it is essentially in
cascade with the Seven Forks stations (i.e. power stations between Masinga
and Grand Falls). However, as described below, the intervening unregulated
catchment will have a modest effect on yields and will also influence flood
characteristics and sediment inflow to the Kiambere reservoir.
3.            The land around the site is at present sparsely populated,
although there is evidence that immigration to the area has significantly
increased over the last few years (those people who have seen construction
of roads, camps, and airstrips, and the site preparation started to
immigrate for compensation), and is likely to continue due to population
pressure in the uplands, generally improved access and the possiblities of
employment offered by the new project.
4.           The area is arid, with an average annual rainfall of 700 mm
against a potential evaporation rate of 2100 mm/year.   In consequence,
agricultural   potential  is  low  and  the  predominant   vegetation  is
thornbush and thicket.
Hydrology
5.             Flow at the Kiambere  site derives  from two sources with
fundamentally  different  hydrology:  (i)  highly  regulated  flows  through
reservoirs above Kiambere (Masinga and Kamburu) and (ii) unregulated
seasonal run-off from the intermediate catchment downstream of Kamburu.
Flows to Kamburu are regulated through Masinga reservoir, with a storage of
1,400 million m3, which allows seasonal regulation of the river flows. The
hydrology of these flows has been well established over the course of a
number of previous studies and the record has recently been updated by
TARDA. It is estimated that the contribution of the unregulated area will
be only about 8% of the total flow at Kiambere. The total average flow at
Kiambere is about 113 m3/sec (30 years period 1947-77).  Dry season flows
are  unlikely  to drop  below  37 m3/sec.    Flood flow,  taking the upper
reservoir only, is calculated to give a peak flow of 5,500 m3/sec, one in
10,000.

ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 5
Geology
6.          The Kiambere site is located on rocks of the basement system,
which are derived from Pre-Cambrian sediments that have been subjected to
cyclic  tectonic  movements.    The dominant  rock  types  are  gneisses  and
granites.    There  is  considerable  surface  evidence  of  past  faulting,
shearing and jointing in the area as might be expected from the geological
history.     However,  as  these  movements  are  now  considered  to  be
long inactive, the presence of such fracturing in the rock should not be
detrimental to the planned project, given adequate sub-surface preparation.
7.              In general the geological situation at the dam site is
comparatively favorable and is less favorable at the shaft, surge chamber
and  the saddle  dam areas.    TARDA employed  independent  geological  and
hydrological conditions (based on the terms of reference approved by the
Bank) to comment on the original design.   Design review consultants have
also  made  recommendations  on  construction  methods.        An  engineering
geologist also participated  in the appraisal mission.   In general the
consultants  have  not  identified  any  risks  other  than  those  normally
associated with this type of project and no major geological difficulties
should be experienced during the construction.
General Layout
8.            The Kiambere hydroelectric project comprises:  a 110 m high
earthfill embankment dam on the Tana River; a 35 m high zoned--also
earthfill--dam closing a low saddle; a free overfall side channel spillway,
discharging through a chute in  the left bank and a fuse plug emergency
spillway adjacent to the saddle dam; two diversion tunnels, each 0.5 km
long, through the left abutment; an intake structure leading to a 6.1 m
equivalent diameter headrace tunnel 4 km long, with a 20 m diameter surge
chamber; twin vertical penstock tunnels; an underground powerhouse
containing two 70-MW generators driving by vertical Francis type turbines;
a 6.2 m equivalent diameter tailrace tunnel with the helical surge tunnel;
switchyard; two single circuit 220-kV transmission lines each approximately
40 km long; and access roads, etc.
Preliminary Works
9.               Preliminary  works  already  completed  or presently under
construction include: an existing camp at Kamburu; a new camp at Kiambere;
a 31 km long access road connecting the site to the Kangodi to Embu
government road; and a gravel surface airfield suitable for light aircraft
at Kambere. The general layout is shown on Map IBRD 16895.
Dams
10.        There are approximately 8,500,000 m3 of fill and 1,500,000 m3 of
excavation in various structures.   Core and shell material for the dams
will be borrowed within 2 to 4 km from the site. Sand for filters will be
borrowed from a pit again about 4 km from the dam site.  Total quantity of
concrete required for the project is approximately 185,000 m3 including
overbreak.   All the cement for the project would be supplied by local
market.



- 45 -                     ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 5
Spillways
11.        The spillway will be located on the left bank of the river where
a spur protruding into the main valley provides a suitable position for the
construction of the overflow section and low velocity trough.  The crest
will have a length of 300 m.  Two 3.2 m by 2.5 m vertical left gates will
be located in 'an outlet structure at the upstream end of the spillway
trough.  There gates will enable releases of compensation water of up to 50
m3/sec to be 'made Iduring periods when the power station is out of
commission.
12.           The emergency spillway will be of the erodable fuse plug
embankment type and will be located adjacent to the saddle dam at the head
of the Irinde Valley.
Diversion Tunnels
13.        The first diversion tunnel will have a length of 610 m and will
be of a modified horseshoe cross-section with a diameter of 10 m.  It will
be concrete lined throughout its length in order to improve the hydraulic
efficiency  and increase  the discharge  capacity.   The second diversion
tunnel will be unlined with a concrete invert except in areas of poor rock
conditions where a full concrete lining will be provided. This tunnel will
be 8.5 m in diameter and 540 m in length.
Cofferdams and Low Level Outlet
14.       The main dam will incorporate the cofferdams and will permit the
diversion of water during the initial construction period.
15.        In order to maintain river flows to downstream users both during
the period of initial filling of the reservor and subsequently in the event
of outage at the power station,  a low level outlet will be provided,
located in a bypass tunnel adjacent to the first diversion tunnel.   In
addition to its use in maintaining discharge to downstream users, the
facility will also permit the lake to be drawn down for maintenance works
to be carried out or in the interest of safety.   The discharge capacity
will be about 80 m3/sec (average).
Water Intake and Headrace Tunnel
16.        The intake structure will control the entry of water into the
headrace tunnel. The structure will contain the trash racks and to prevent
entry of debris, and intake gates which will permit the headrace to be
sealed and drained. The headrace tunnel will extend some 4,060 m from the
intake to the penstock bifurcation.   The tunnel has been optimized as a
6.1 m equivalent diameter concrete-lined horseshoe tunnel, unless the
geological conditions allow some unlined portions.
Shafts
17.       Twin pressure shafts 80 m deep and horizontal penstocks 30 m long
will connect the headrace tunnel to the turbines in the underground power



- 46-                        ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 5
house.   Penstocks will have a diameter of 4.0 m.   A concentric conical
taper will be provided at the downstream ends of each penstock to reduce
the size to that of the main turbine values, which have been optimized at a
3.0 m diameter.   Above the pressure shafts  twin butterfly valves will
permit each penstock to be sealed off and dewatered for maintenance
purposes without affecting power generation through the other unit.
Headrace Surge Chamber and Tailrace Tunnel
18.       The headrace surge chamber will limit the amplitude of transient
pressure waves resulting from regulation of flow to the turbines in the
pressure shafts and penstocks.  The chamber is a simple circular tank some
16.5 m in diameter. The chamber will be formed in reinforced concrete.
19.        The tailrace tunnel will extend some 1,400 m from the powerhouse
to the outfall in the Tana River adjacent to the Thura confluence.   The
tunnel has been optimized as a 6.35 m equivalent diameter concrete-lined
horseshoe section. An outfall structure will be provided at the downstream
portal of the tailrace tunnel to facilitate closure of the tunnel for
dewatering.   The structure will comprise a reinforced concrete operating
platform constructed above the tunnel portal and will carry the gate hoist
gantry and storage bins for the gates.
Power House and Switchyard
20.         The underground powerhouse will be located in a geologically
stable  block below  a small plateau   some  1.4 km  south of  the Thura
confluence with the Tana River. The access tunnel will be some 450 m long
and driven at a fall of 1 in 10 to provide vehicular access to the machine
hall.  The horseshoe-shaped tunnel will be about 6 m high and 5 m wide.
Once the access tunnel has been driven to the vicinity of the machine hall,
a specialist sub-contractor will be called in to measure the principal
stress in the rock.  This information will permit the optimum orientation
and design of the major cavern excavation to be determined.   A circular
service shaft 7 m in diameter and about 180 m deep will extend from the
loading bay side adit up to the control building and will accommodate the
main ventilation duct, lift shaft, stairs and cable ducts.
21.         The control building will be situated at ground level directly
above the service shaft providing access to the underground machine hall
below.    The  building  will  be  a  three-storied,  concrete-framed  and
masonry-clad structure.
22.         The switchyard will be situated to the south of the control
building and will be constructed on a level plateau formed in tunnel spoil.
23.        The underground powerhouse will be 18 m wide and 50 m long, and
will contain a turbine generator hall and a loading bay. The loading bay
and powerhouse will be serviced by two cranes, which can be coupled
together to provide a gross lifting capacity of 230 tonnes. The powerhouse
will have cooling water, potable water, and a compressed air system,
ventilation and air conditioning. An appropriate drainage system will also
be constructed.   Auxiliary power and emergency start systems, power line

carrier, and telephone system will also be located at the powerhouse and
control room.   Electricity will be generated at 11 kV and two 85 MVA
transformers will raise the power produced to 240 kV.

KIAMBERE HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Statements
Sales and Revenues
1.         KP&L's energy sales for each customer category appear in  Annex
7.    Revenues  from  1983  onwards  are  based  on  tariff  increase  of 13%
effective on June 1, 1983, and further yearly tariff increases of Ksh 0.08
effective each January 1 up to 1990.
2.           A consumption tax of 1 cent per kWh is levied on all energy
sales.
3.          The revenues of KPC and TRDC are their respective ascertained
cost,  the  amount  payable  by  KP&L  for  electricity  purchased  from  both
companies, which is described in para. 4.  The ascertained cost of TARDA
and KVA is based on their debt service plus a fixed charge to cover their
administrative cost related to their power activities and is described in
para. 5.  The ascertained costs of all power companies include a develop-
ment surchage as described in para. 6 below.
Ascertained Cost
4.        The bulk supply licenses of KPC and TRDC define ascertained cost
(on the basis of which their revenues are determined) as the actual audited
cost each year for the followig items:
(a)  Operations and administration.   This also icludes  the cost of
purchasing power from Uganda and from TARDA.
(b)  Interest and redemption payments for debt;
(c)  Income and other taxes; and
(d)  Such other charges as the Government shall consider proper to be
allowed. Under this authority a development surcharge (described
later in this annex) has been added, starting 1971 for TRDC and
1979 for KPC, as part of their respective ascertained cost.
In addition, ascertained cost includes small annual appropriations to a
Reserve and Equalization Fund which, with the interest on the securities in
which it is invested, is available for future capital expenditure or to
cover deficiencies in income and to pay for abnormal expenses.
5.          In the proposed lease agreement for the Kiambere hydroelectric
project 1/, KP&L has agreed to pay for the electricity purchased from
TARDA on the following basis:
1/ It is assumed that a similar lease agreement will be drawn up between
EAP&L and KVA prior to the implementation of Turkwel hydroelectric
project commencing in 1985.

ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 3
(a) All amounts due and payable by TARDA as principal, other charges
and interest on the outstanding balance of all external loans
directly contracted by TARDA for Kiambere;
(b) The principal amount required by TARDA to service its loan from
the Government for Kiambere and interest on the outstanding
balance of the loan; and
(c) An annual fixed charge to cover TARDA's administrative cost
related to its power activities.
Development Surcharge
6.          Development surcharge was principally designed to provide TRDC
and KPC with part of the funds required to pay the local currency costs of
their development projects as part of the cost of electricity KP&L
purchases from TRDC and KPC and is determined each year in relation to
their respective development activities.  According to the lease agreement
between KP&L and TARDA, a development surcharge at a minimum amount of 15%
of the total cost of Kiambere will be paid to TARDA during the implementa-
tion of the project.
Fuel Cost and Purchased Energy
7.           Fuel use for operating the KP&L group's plants is assumed to
decrease with the commissioning of a 15 MW geothermal unit at the end of
1982 and to increase with the load growth from 1985 to 1988 when the
commissioning of Kiambere and Turkwell, in mid-1988 and mid-1990, respec-
tively, will cause the fuel use to decrease. A provision for price escala-
tion of 7.5% and 7% for 1983 and 1984, respectively, has been made and 6%
for 1985 to 1990.
8.        KPC's annual purchases from UEB are assumed to be constant at 252
GWh at a total annual cost of KSh 15.9 million from 1983 onwards under the
existing contract. TRDC is assumed to purchase 85 GWh in 1983, 167 GWh in
1984, 170 GWh in 1985, 185 GWh in 1986, 189 GWh in 1987, 166 GWh in 1988
(commissioning of Kiambere), 174 GWh in 1989 and 163 GWh in 1990 from
TARDA's Masinga dam power stations at 0.32/kWh and a yearly fixed charge of
KSh 49.7 million. The estimated cost of this energy is based on a revised
agreement for electricity purchases by TRDC from TARDA.
Operating and Administration Expenses
9.         No increase in volume of operations are reflected in TRDC.  For
KPC, due to the addition of two geothermal units in 1983 and 1985
respectively, the expenses are expected to increase on an average by KSh 3
million for each unit. KP&L's distribution cost is expected to increase by
2% annually; the commissioning of Kiambere in mid-1988 will increase
operating/administration and insurance cost by KSh 17 million annually; and
the commissioning of Turkwell in mid-1990 will increase cost for that year
by KSh 5.5 million (Ksh5 million for operating/administration and KSh6
million for insurance annually).

Page 3 of 3
10.       In addition, provision for price escalations of 12% has been made
for 1983 to 1990.
Depreciation
11.         Depreciation is charged as a percentage of the revalued fixed
assets at the beginning of each year - KP&L 4.0%, KPC 2.9%, and TRDC 2.2%.
A depreciation rate of 5.1% on historical fixed assets has been used to
calculate  KP&L's  income  tax.    These  rates  are  consistent  with  past
experience. The depreciation for the years 1979 to 1982 is computed on the
historical cost of fixed assets, whereas for the period after 1982, it has
been calculated on revalued fixed assets.
Taxes
12.       TRDC and KPC's incomes are exempt from income tax.  KP&L's income
is subject to tax at present at the rate of 45%.
Dividends
13.         Dividends on 4% and 7% preferred stock are KSh 1.9 million per
year. Dividends on common stock of KP&L are assumed to be at the level of
13% for 1983 onwards.
Fixed Assets
14.       Fixed assets and depreciation for the years 1979 through 1982 are
at cost as shown in audited accounts. In 1983 and 1984, fixed assets and
accumulated depreciation have been increased to reflect estimated replace-
ment values by 9.1% and 8.5%, respectively and 7.5% for 1985 onwards to
reflect estimated price escalations in those years.
KP&L's Account Receivables
15.        These are assumed to be 18% of total revenues in accordance with
recent past experience.
Inventories
16.        KP&L inventories are assumed to be about 10% of gross revalued
plant in operation while those of KPC and TRDC are assumed to be constant.

KENYA
KIAMBERE HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
Loan Capital and Security Arrangements of KP&L, KPC, TRDC and TARDA
1.      This annex describes the loan capital of power companies of Kenya
and  the arrangements  securing  this  loan  capital.    The amounts  stated
represent the total amount of the loans contracted and not the amounts
outstanding, which are given in Annex 16.  Unless indicated otherwise, all
references to £ are references to £ Sterling.
KP&L
2.      KP&L's loan capital comprises loans from Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC), (KSh. 7 million, KSh. 58.88 million and KSh. 30
million), and from Glyn, Mills and Company syndicate (KSh. 57.75 million,
KSh. 4.328 million, KSh. 59.59 million and KSh. 4.8 million). The CDC loan
of £350,000 was secured by (i) KP&L's 8½% Debentures 1971-85; and (ii) a
Trust Deed dated November 1, 1968, which provided for a first legal charge
on specified leasehold properties of KP&L. The KSh. 58.88 million CDC loan
and the KSh. 57.75 loan from the Glyn, Mills and Company syndicatewere
respectively secured by Debenture Stock 1975-91 and 1971-80 respectively,
as well as a Trust Deed dated May 16, 1969.   This Trust Deed created
mortgages and charges on certain of KP&L's properties and assets and also
stipulated that KP&L was not to create any mortgage or charge ranking in
priority to or pari passu with that mortgage or charge.   The KSh.  30
million CDC loan and Glyn syndicate loans of KSh. 54.49 million and KSh.
4.8 million were secured by Debenture Stock 1979-88, and 1978-80
respectively, as well as a supplemental Trust Deed dated August 29, 1974
which made these loans to rank pari passu with the loans secured by the
Trust Deed dated May 16, 1969.  By the end of 1978 KP&L had also taken up
KSh. 1.296 million at 8% on an unsecured basis from a KSh. 15 million given
by the British Government to the Government of Kenya and a further KSh.
7.342 million on similar terms from a loan of KSh. 20 million made to the
Government of Kenya by the Finnish Government.
KPC
3.      In 1955 KPC floated a £7,500,000 loan by the issue of a £7,500,000
5½% Debenture Stock 1975/85.   £3,500,000 of this loan was subscribed by
CDC, and the balance was underwritten for public sale. The Debenture Stock
was secured by a Trust Deed Dated June 27, 1956, which among other things,
created a first legal charge and a floating charge in respect of KPC's
property and assets and stipulated that KPC was not to create any further
charges or incumbrances upon its undertakings and assets ranking in
priority to or pari passu  with the charges created under the Trust Deed
except in special stated circumstances.  The Trust Deed also provived that
any scheme for the reconstruction should require an extraordinary
three-fourths of the stockholders.   KPC also took up in 1977 an unsecured



- 62 -                          ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 3
9% loan from KP&L, in the amount of KSh. 26.34 million, repayable in 10
years commencing from the commissioning of the first geothermal plant as
well as KSh. 1.25 million of an 8.5% unsecured loan from TRDC totalling
KSh. 2.9 million (balance taken up in 1978) and repayable from 1979 to the
year  2000.    Both  of  these  loans  were  repaid  in 1978.  In 1980,  KPC
contracted with IBRD to borrow US$40 million at 7.95% annual interest and
repayable during 1985-1999, and with CDC to borrow £9.25 million at 8.5%
annual interest and repayable during 1982-1994 for installing the first two
units of the Olkaria power project.
5.      To  finance  the Olkaria  Geothermal  Power Expansion Project,  KPC
proposes to obtain a loan of US$12 million from IBRD, at a variable
interest rate US$8.3 million from CDC at 8% interest and US$8.8 million
from EIB at 8% interest.
TRDC
6.      TRDC's loan capital in 1978 came from CDC,  the Glyn, Mills and
Company syndicate (now Williams & Glyn's Bank Ltd.), KP&L, IBRD, the
Government of Kenya, from a SIDA credit to the Government of Kenya, and
from the Standard Bank Limited and export suppliers credits.  A Trust Deed
dated May 26, 1966 modified and extended by three Supplemental Trust Deeds
dated December 5, 1968, December 16, 1971 and March 10, 1976, secures the
following loans:
b) Sh. 9,240,500 and Sh. 5,380,000 B Debenture Stock 1971-87;
c) Sh. 6,040,000 C Debenture Stock 1971-87;
d) Sh. 81,300,000 E Debenture Stock 1975-96;
e) US$23,000,000 and US$63,000,000 IBRD loans;
f) L2,000,000 Debenture Stock 1980-91;
g) KSh. 2,000,000 loan from KP&L; and
h) KSh. 1,890,000 loan from the Government of Kenya.
The Trust Deed provided for the creation of a floating charge of TRDC's
undertakings, property and assets and also required TRDC (i) not to (A)
create without the Trustee's consent any mortgage or charge ranking in
priority to a pari passu with the floating charge of (B) create any
specific mortgage or charge over any of its immovable property or other
assets without prior written consent of the Trustee or have any subsidiary,
except with the prior written consent of the Trustee.  The Trust Deed also
provides for the creation and issue in specified circumstances of
additional stock to rank pari passu in point of security with the original
stock created under the Trust Deed.   These circumstances include the need
to secure any loan TRDC would need to finance later stages of the Seven
Forks Hydroelectric Project.

7.      In addition, TRDC has issued promissory notes in the amounts of Dm
22,553,000 and US$217,000 to cover part of the export suppliers credits
while DM 32,459,000 financed by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau is covered
by a guarantee from the West German Government. The loan from the Standard
Bank Limited was unsecured and repaid in 1978.
TARDA
8.      TARDA's  loan  capital  for  the  construction  of  the  Masenga
Hydrolectric Station came from the Government of Kenya.   The Government
provided KSh 944 million (US$75.5 million) at 3% interest to be paid in
equal installments of principal and interest over a period of 20 years
beginning July 1, 1982.

Electricity Tariff Structure
1.          KP&L's new tariff structure was developed in consultation with
the Bank.  It took effect on January 1, 1979 and comprises the following
six categories:
Method A:  covers consumers whose monthly usage does not
exceed 7,000 KWh.
Method B:  is applicable to consumers with monthly usage ranging
from 7,001 to 100,000 KWh.
Method C:  covers consumers whose monthly usage exceeds 100,000
units.
Method D: Off-peak supplies.
Method E:  Public Lighting.
Method F:  Company staff.
2.         In addition, there is provision for the introduction of a fuel
oil cost adjustment with the approval of the Ministry of Power and
Communications. This is a surcharge designed to allow KP&L to recover part
of any additional fuel costs from electricity consumers based on the
difference between actual fuel cost and a "basic price".   KP&L has added
surcharge at rates of 13.9 Kenya cents per KWh from August 1980 and 21.2
cents from July 1981 on all energy sales.
3.         Details of the tariffs are presented in the table on page 2 of
this annex.

KENYA
KIAMBERE HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
History of the Power Companies
1.      The Kenya Electric Supply Industry is presently comprised of four
organizations:
a) The Kenya Power & Lighting Co. Ltd (KP&L);
b) The Kenya Power Co. Ltd (KPC);
c) Tana River Development Co. Ltd (TRDC); and
d) Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA)
The Kenya Power & Lighting Co. Ltd (KP&L)
2.       KP&L, which is the sole distribution company, was incorporated in
1922 by the amalgamation of two undertakings which had supplied Nairobi and
Mombasa since 1907 and 1909, respectively.   It is a local private company
with authorised share capital of KSh. 250 million, of which KSh. 207.85
million is issued.   In addition,  loan capital amounting to KSh. 359.03
million was outstanding as at the end of 1981. Although formerly operating
throughout Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, its activities have been confined to
Kenya since 1964 due to purchase of the Uganda and Tanzania undertakings by
the respective Governments.   The company is primarily concerned with the
commercial distribution of electricity throughout Kenya.   At present, it
also generates the entire power requirements of the coast system covering
Mombasa, Malindi and Kwale, provides the necessary thermal back-up for the
main grid system, and operates generating stations in centers not connected
to the grid.   It also coordinates all sources of power, and staffs and
manages KPC and TRDC, and since August 1981, staffs and manages the Masinga
Dam powerhouse.
3.       In 1970, the Government acquired a controlling interest in KP&L
when it made a successful bid for all the shares on the London Register.
Since then the Government has been purchasing shares as they come on the
East African market, and its total holding together with that of
government-controlled agencies is about 57%.
The Kenya Power Co. Ltd (KPC)
4.          In 1955,  KP&L was faced with the  problem of  financing  the
construction of a 132-kV transmission line to interconnect the power
systems of Uganda and Kenya as well as other expansion requirements.. The
company did not consider it practicable to raise the required finances
through new equity issues because of conservative dividend policies due to
political pressures and the need for increased self-financing.   There was
also revived political pressure for nationalization. The company concluded
it was inevitable and desirable to increase public ownership and direct



- 67 -                             ANNEX 17
Page 2 of 2
government  participation  in  the  power  industry.    Accordingly,  it  was
decided to form a new company, KPC, in 1955 with an issued nominal capital
of KSh. 2000 held equally by KP&L, the Government and a UK finance house.
KPC's function was to construct the transmission line and to take over the
ownership of the two hydroelectric stations belonging to KP&L on the Tana
River.  KPC financed its requirements through issuance of KSh. 7.5 million
of debenture stock, the payment of the debt service on which was guaranteed
by KP&L's understanding to purchase KPC's entire production at "ascertained
cost".
5.        In accordance with its policy of increasing its participation in
the electricity supply industry, the Government acquired 100% of KPC's
issued share capital by buying out KP&L's and Power Securities Corporation
Ltd. in 1971.  Subsequently, in 1980, KPC increased  its share capital to
KSh. 60 million and contracted IBRD and CDC loans of US$40 million and
£ 9.25 million respectively to finance construction of the first two 15-MW
units of the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project.
Tana River Development Co. LTD (TRDC)
6.       A forecast of load growth after Kenya's achievement of independence
in December 1963 indicated that it would be necessary to commission further
major generating capacity by 1967-68, and a reappraisal of the Seven Forks
Scheme (the harnessing of the hydropotential of the Upper Tana) established
Kindaruma as the most economical first stage development.  TRDC was formed
in 1964 to finance the Kindaruma hydroelectric development for much the
same reasons as led to the formation of KPC.  The share capital of TRDC is
KSh. 120 million, all of which is held by the Government.   CDC supplied
KSh. 3.5 million of a total of about KSh. 6 million of loan capital which
was arranged for the Kindaruma project.   Kamburu Stage 1, comprising  the
first two generating units, was commissioned in July 1974 and the third
unit in 1976.  Gitaru, the last of the Seven Forks hydroelectric projects,
was commissioned in 1978.  Like KPC, TRDC sells its entire output to KP&L
at ascertained cost.
Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (TARDA)
7.       The fourth company, Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority, has
constructed the Masinga Dam on the Tana River primarily for irrigation
purposes.   Advantage  of  the  dam  has  been  taken  by  KP&L  to  complete
arrangements with TARDA to include a powerhouse and related structures and
equipment at the site.  KP&L pays a fixed charge of KSh. 49.7 million per
year to TARDA from the date the reservoir was first filled to the maximum
operating level and a usage charge of .32 per GWh.  This charge has been
adjusted in relation to the cost of fuel that this powerhouse displaces at
the time of commissioning.  All costs in excess of KSh. 4.9 for operation
and maintenance of the powerhouse and other direct power-producing
facilities, not including the dam, will be paid by TARDA.

KIAMBERE HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
Future Sales and Maximum Demand
Introduction
1.         KP&L, in accordance with sound engineering practices, regularly
revises the load forecast for the preparation of the next month's budget
and the yearly forecast for the next year's budget.   At the time of the
appraisal mission KP&L's revised load forecast was reviewed by using a
direct forecasting method and based on KP&L's consultants' load forecasts
prepared (by Merz and McLellan) in 1978, by WLPU and EP in 1981. This load
forecast was rechecked by the mission's consultant by using a comprehensive
statistical method. These two load forecasts gave almost the same results,
an average growth rate of 6% p.a. between 1982 and 1990, for annual growth
and consumptions of various consumer groups for future years.   Therefore,
the mission concluded that load forecasts are realistic and should be
accepted for the timing of the future generation projects and used for the
economic analysis.  The analyses of the mission's consultant are given in
the following paragraphs.
Geographical Distribution
2.          Historical growth and market composition figures for the power
and energy demand for the interconnected network are presented in Table 1
of  this  annex.    Historical  trends  indicate  that  sales  in the Nairobi
District as a percentage of total sales have declined slightly from about
60% in 1984-1975 to a present level of 56% while sales in the Western
District have increased from about 8% to 11% of total.   This change in
relative importance of market areas reflects the government's policy since
the early 1970's to stimulate development (particularly industrial) in the
Western region.   It is now expected that over the next ten years the
percentage of total sales in each area will remain constant at the current
level.
Consumption by Consumer Category
3.         KP&L has broadly grouped the various tariff categories as shown
in Table 1 of this annex, thereby permitting an analysis of market
composition by major consumer  categories.   The increased percentage of
large commercial and industrial sales from 56% in 1974 to 64% in 1982
reflects the rapid industrial growth as a result of Government policy and
the strong economic growth which occurred during the coffee boom of
1976-1978.    Interruptible  sales  (such  as  for  water  heating)  declined
slightly in absolute terms from 134 GWh in 1975 to 118 GWh in 1981.   This
decline is the result of increasing tariffs for this category and the
promotion of solar water heaters as a substitute for electrical water
heating.

Statistical Analysis
4.           A statistical analysis for the correlations between growth in
sales for the two major categories, (a) domestic and small commercial, and
(b) industrial and large commercial and growth in overall gross domestic
product (GDP), and manufacturing sector growth rates respectively was
carried out. A high correlation, at greater than 95% confidence level, was
found.   The data were smoothed in order to reduce the impact of random
events before carrying out a regression analysis to establish the
functional relationships between power sales and economic growth. Trended
growth rates for power sales and economic growth were computed on a five
year  basis  moving  forward  until  the  data  were  exhausted.    A  linear
regression analysis was then carried out on the smoothed data and the
following functional relationships determined:
(a)   domestic and small commercial power sales annual percent  growth
rate = 2.8% + 1.1 (GDP annual percent growth rate);
(b)   industrial and large commercial power sales annual percent growth
rate = 3.4% + 0.7 (manufacturing sector annual percent growth
rate).
6.            Power sales forecasts for categories (a) and (b) above were
derived using the functional relationships and on the basis of the Bank's
recent estimates of economic growth rates in Kenya to 1990:
GDP                                          1982-1985        1986-1990
-----Annual Growth %-----
Overall GDP                                    3.5-4.0          4.0-5.0
Manufacturing Sector                           1.5-3.0          4.0-5.0
6.        In addition to consumption forecasts for the two basic categories
prepared using these relationships, individual forecasts were made for
off-peak sales (interruptible supplies for domestic water heating and
irrigation pumping), and street lighting. The forecast of industrial sales
was then adjusted to take into account specific new industrial loads which
are linked to projects either under construction or with a high probability
of realization.  The overall forecast prepared as described above compared
closely with the forecast prepared by KP&L using a 6% overall growth rate
and this growth rate was retained for planning purposes. Details of the
demand forecast as discussed and agreed with KP&L are given on page 4 of
this annex.

Economic Analysis - Least Cost Solution
Generation Development Options
1.           The timing of additional new generating facilities has been
established on the basis of the forecast demand growth rate of 6% p.a.
(Annex 20, p. 4), the capacity of existing facilities, and the earliest
feasible on-line dates  of new plants.   Details  of existing generating
capacity are given in Annex 1, page 2.
2.        Additional energy requirement could be satisfied by:
(a) further development of Kenya's hydro and geothermal potential;
(b) the construction of thermal plants using imported fossil fuels;
or
(c) interconnection with Tanzania and/or Uganda.
There are many power generation project possibilities in the above
classification.   Feasible development alternatives to satisfy load growth
to 1995 have been determined from these generation options as presented
below.
3.        Indigenous hydro resources: Mainly two alternative hydro schemes
are available to be taken into consideration at this time; these are the
Kiambere and Turkwel projects as shown below:
Kiambere a/        Turkwel b/

ANNEX 21
Page 2 of 14
An initial feasibility study for Turkwel was prepared in 1979 by
Norconsult. Additional engineering and hydrological work was carried out
by SOGREAH and their report prepared in 1982 covered the initial field
investigations, hydrological data and preliminary design. It is estimated
that the earliest on-line date is 1990.
4.        Other Hydro Possibilities:
Other hydro possibilities include:
Installed    Average Generation  kW installed
Site        Capacity MW   GWh/year              cost (US$)
Mutonga               70              410                 4510

These plants have a higher unit cost than either Kiambere or Turkwel and
could not be built before the mid 1990s since no reliable data and suitable
study is available.
5.           Geothermal:   The third Olkaria unit (15 MW and 100 GWh/yr)
financed by the Bank will come on-line in 1985.  Additional units can be
constructed at Olkaria, however, the next three 15 MW units could not be
available before mid 1989.   In 1989, the new units could be expected to
produce about 70 GWh due to availability for no more than six months and
less than normal output during the commissioning period. Since experience
with geothermal operation in Kenya is brief, the availability of units 4, 5
and 6 and, hence, their firm energy capability has been assumed to increase
to  65%  by  1992  and  remain  constant  thereafter.    Capital  costs  for
development of the next units at Olkaria are assumed to be the same as for
the first three Olkaria units and, allowing 20% contingencies, the
estimated cost is KSh 2318 million (US$185 million) 1/ for 3x15 MW units
including transmission.   0 & M costs of KSh 33 million per year include
provision for drilling 2 new wells each year.
6.           Thermal Plants Based on Imported Fuel:  WLPU consultants with
Ewbank and Partners have examined a coal-fired and an oil-fired thermal
alternative to Kiambere.   Since no detailed studies of either alternative
are available, it is estimated that 1989 is the earliest on-line date.
Data used in the economic calculations relative to these alternatives are
shown below. WLPU/EP demonstrated that a coal-fired plant was cheaper than
oil-fired up to 12% discount rate. Considering that coal costs could be as
low as $50/ton, only the coal option was retained for this analysis.

7.           Gas Turbines:  The installation of gas turbines would provide
firm energy in a dry year and would permit the operation of the Masinga
reservoir to maximize average energy output of the Tana cascade plants.
Without the 30 MW gas turbine planned by KP&L in 1985, Masinga reservoir
should be operated  to maximize firm energy with a resultant reduction in
the  expected  average  annual  generation  from  the  Tana  cascade  plants
(requiring an increase  in thermal generation of about 50 GWh/yr).    The
firm energy capability would be reduced by about 130 GWh/year with a risk
of an energy deficit by 1986 unless the gas turbine is added.  Additional
gas turbines were also examined as a means of deferring high capital cost
plants such as Kiambere or Turkwel and as a means of firming up hydro
energy prior to the availability of geothermal or coal-fired plant in
1989.  Their use other than for peaking and standby would be very costly
and any economic advantage in deferring other plant additions would be
quickly lost.
8.         The cost of generation by gas turbines is estimated as follows:
- Capital cost/kW                          US$605
- Operation and maintenance costs          7% of capital a/
- Fuel cost (kerosene)                     $396/ton
- Fuel rate                                311 gms/kWh
- Availability                             50%
a/ Including fuel for weekly operation to ensure availability.
9.          Diesel Plant:  Additions of diesel plant were also considered to
firm up hydro energy in a dry year or to defer the addition of new hydro
plants in the event of capacity constraints.   As with gas turbines, their
use for base load generation would be expensive.   Given the  small unit
sizes (compared with load growth requirements) deferment of a large hydro

or thermal plant would be minimal.  The use of diesels as a substitute for
gas turbines (which have a lower cost per kW of capacity than diesels) or
for large thermal or hydro plants (with lower energy cost at high load
factor) has therefore not been further considered.
10.         Interconnection with Neighboring Countries:  The possibility of
importing power from either Tanzania or Uganda exists since large amounts
of relatively low cost hydro energy could be developed in those countries.
It is unlikely that Uganda would be able to increase its supply to Kenya
beyond the present level of 250 GWh/yr (existing 30 MW contract running to
2005) before 1990.   Kenya would then require major additions in thermal
capacity as a stop-gap measure prior to the availability of increased power
from Uganda.   The political climate would also need  to improve before
interconnection between Kenya and Tanzania would be a realistic alternative
to Kiambere. There is however a good possibility that imported power would
be the least cost solution to meet load growth following the achievement of
Kiambere capacity; however, due to the uncertainties involved, imported
power has not been further considered in this analysis.  Furthermore, in
keeping with Government objectives to ensure maximum national independence
in energy sources and since availability of the existing UEB supply cannot
be fully guaranteed, it is assumed, in determining the power and energy
balances (para. 12) that the UEB supply would not be firm beyond 1987.  Use
of UEB imports would, however, continue as a means of regulating reservoir
levels and displacing thermal generaration.
11.        Alternative Generation Development Programs:  The timing of new
plant additions has been established as required to meet constraints either
in firm energy or firm power based on 6% p.a. load growth.  The following
alternative development strategies which provide the same security of
supply without possible load shedding as a means of delaying plant addi-
tions were reviewed by the appraisal mission to determine the least cost
solution to 1994. Several other alternatives (essentially minor variations
of those shown) were also examined but were quickly eliminated as they were
evidently more costly in present value terms for discount rates up to 12%.
It is assumed in the following analysis that the 30 MW gas turbine would be
added in 1985.
Alternative A:  develop hydro first - Kenya's present development program
Gas Turbine 1985  (1x30 MW)
Kiambere 1988      (2x70 MW)
Turkwel 1990       (2x60 MW)
Geothermal 1992   (3x15 MW)
Alternative B:  develop coal first followed by hydro
Gas turbine 1985   (1x30 MW)
Gas turbines 1988  (3x25 MW)
Coal Plant 1989    (2x60 MW)
Kiambere 1992       (2x70 MW)

Gas turbines 1989       (35 MW)

Kiambere 1992           (2x70 MW)
Turkwel 1994            (2x60 MW)
12.           Power and Energy Balance:   Transmission,  distribution,  and
generating station losses totaling 15% have been added to the energy sales
forecast  to give  the total generation requirement  for each year.   The
system maximum power demand has been derived based on the expectation that
the overall annual system load factor will remain at its present level of
0.68.  A summary of energy generation and power capacity requirements are
shown on pages 8, 9 and 10 of this annex as are the capacities of existing
facilities and possible additional plant to be added in each alternative.
A year by year balance for alternative A is presented on pages 11 and 12.
Complete details of the power and energy balances for B and C are found in
the project file.
13.         The hydro plants on the Tana River system (the Tana cascade)
comprising Masinga, Kamburu, Gitaru, Kindaruma, and the proposed Kiambere
project would be capable of producing an average annual energy of up to
2,910 GWh based on KP&L estimates using a system simulation model 2/ and
the available hydrological record since 1947.   Due to storage limitations
and fluctuations of seasonal flows, the usable average annual energy at
present from the Tana cascade as shown by the simulation model at the
present demand level (excluding Kiambere) is 1,430 GWh and will grow to its
maximum of 2000 GWh when the annual generation requirement rises to about
6,700 GWh. Average annual hydro generation depends on the availability of
non-hydro energy sources (geothermal, other thermal and UEB imports) as
well as total system demand.   Generation by each type of plant has been
estimated by KP&L on the assumption that geothermal sources and UEB supply
would be used to their maximum followed by available hydro with the balance
provided by thermal plant. Estimates of hydro generation for this analysis
were based on interpolations of available data.
14.       The firm energy capability of existing facilities is based on the
assumptions  of  thermal  plant  availability  discused  above  and  the
hydrological record for the hydro plants. Imports from UEB are assumed to
continue at the present level of 30 MW firm power and 252 GWh/yr until
1987.   From 1988 onwards,  it is assumed that 252 GWh/yr would still be
available from UEB but the power or energy would not be firm.
2/ The Tana River Simulation Model was developed by Merz & McLellan (1978)
and extended by WLPU to include Kiambere.

15.        Reserve capacity margins equivalent to the largest thermal unit
(30 MW at Kipevu) and the largest hydro unit (75 MW at Gitaru) have been
assumed in deriving the power balance. This level of reserve capacity is
reasonable.
Economic Analysis of Alternatives
16.         Alternative A is capable of meeting load growth to end 1993,
while B and C can meet growth to 1995 and 1996 respectively before new
additions would be required.  As sufficiently reliable details of further
plant additions are not available to extend the period of load growth to a
point that equal capacities and firm energy capability under each alterna-
tive could be reached, a simplifying assumption has been made in the dis-
counted cash flow analysis of the three cases.  Alternatives B and C would
be comparable with Alternative A by assuming that the firm energy con-
straint would be reached by 1994 (as in Alternative A) and additional plant
would then be required.  Since the energy constraint in Alternatives B and
C would not be reached until 1995 and 1996 respectively, it has been neces-
sary to make the three Alternatives comparable in 1994 by allowing for the
residual value of the gas turbines installed in 1988 and 1989 in Alterna-
tives B and C.   Assuming a 15 year useful life for the gas turbines, a
residual value for the remaining life of each unit has been credited in the
cashflows in 1994 in Alternative B and C.
17.         The cashflow streams for the three Alternatives are shown in
Table 6 based on the foregoing considerations and the estimates of incre-
mental capital and operating costs of each new plant added.   Costs which
are comparable to each alternative, notably the 30 MW gas turbine in 1985,
have been omitted from the cashflow streams.   Incremental fuel costs in
Alternatives B and C (versus Alternative A) have been estimated according
to available information concerning thermal generation with and without
Kiambere.  The present values of cost of each alternative at discount rates
10-28% are shown graphically on page 14 of this annex.
Discounted Cashflow Results
18.         The equalizing discount rates for the three base case alterna-
tives are as follows:
Alternative A is cheaper than B and C for discount rates up to
22.5% and 24.0% respectively.
Alternative C is cheaper than B up to 21.5% discount rate.
Sensitivity
19.       If total costs for Kiambere increase by 10%,
Alternative A is cheaper than B up to 21.0%
Alternative A is cheaper than C up to 21.5%
Alternative C is cheaper than B up to 20.5%.

ANNEX 21
Page 7 of 14
If coal costs are $50/ton while project costs increase by 10%,
A is cheaper than B up to 18.5%
C is cheaper than B up to 17.0%.
Conclusion
20.         The foregoing comparison of the alternatives demonstrates that
the sequence beginning with Kiambere as the next major plant would be the
least cost solution.   The decision by KP&L to take the risk of an energy
deficit with the possible need for load shedding in 1987 by foregoing the
installation of the 30 MW gas turbines in 1985 does not materially affect
the results of the analysis.   In each alternative  the timing of plant
additions after 1988 should be advanced where possible (i.e. Kiambere and
Turkwel) to ensure system reliability, or continued risks of energy
deficits would occur in 1988 since the coal-fired thermal and geothermal
plants could not be advanced in Alternative  B or C respectively.   The
present value of costs of each alternative would increase by advancing
plant additions; however, the equalizing discount rate would not change
significantly.
21.       The power and energy balances for the case without the 30 MW gas
turbine in 1985 and without changing the timing of new plant additions are
shown on pages 8 to 12.

KIAMBERE HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.           The Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) of the Kiambere
project has been estimated as the discount rate which equalizes (a) the
present value of the total incremental capital, operating and maintenance
costs of the project plus the attributable incremental transmission,
distribution, and related operation and maintenance costs to distribute
Kiambere output to final consumers and (b) the present value of the
benefits as measured by fuel savings and incremental revenues derived from
sales  of energy  attributable  to Kiambere.   Tariffs used as proxy for
economic benefits, understate the true economic benefits of power supply as
they indicated lower value than the willingness to pay and, hence, the
minimum value of electric power to the consumer.  No attempt has been made
to estimate the consumer surplus.
2.               The  following  methodology  and  assumptions  were  used  in
calculating the economic rate of return:
Costs
(i) Costs based on mid-1983 prices, excluding IDC, duties and taxes
and price escalation; project costs according to project cost
estimates.
(ii) Foreign costs converted to Kenya shillings at 12.5 KShs/US$;
shadow pricing not applied.
(iii) Local labor estimated at 15% of total costs shadow priced at 50%.
(iv) 50% of second 220 kV transmission line Mombasa - Nairobi capital
costs (230 million KSh) on line 1990 attributed to the project.
(v) 6 million KSh/year general high voltage network reinforcement
1988-1992 and 50% of approximately 100 million KShs/yr low
voltage  distribution  reinforcement  and  expansion  1988-1992
attributable   to   the   project   (the   remaining   portion   is
attributable to subsequent generating projects necessary to meet
load growth atter 1990 when the next plant would be needed).
Source: KP&L Tariff Study, February 1982.
(vi) O&M costs - Kiambere 27.5 million KSh/year
- incremental transmission and distribution costs 10 million
KShs/year.
- incremental commercial and administration costs 0.02 KShs/kWh
sold.

Benefits
(vii) Kiambere output has been estimated by WLPU consultants (Table
6.8, Kiambere Project Summary Report, September 1982) using a
system simulation model to determine the thermal generation
required with and without Kiambere, Kiambere output being the
difference in thermal generation in the two cases.   The model
takes into account existing plant as well as future plant
additions  acording  to present KP&L  long  term plans.   Output
attributable to Kiambere which exceeds incremental sales plus
losses has been valued at KSh 0.79 per kWh generated, based on a
fuel  oil  price  of  US$180  per  ton.    Output  attributable  to
Kiambere would increase from 377 GWh in 1988 to a maximum of 910
GWh/year by about 2000.   Incremental sales are valued at the
present average tariff (effective June 1983) of KSh 0.70 per kWh.
Study Period
(viii) Discounting is done over 40 years corresponding to the project
construction period and the useful life of the Kiambere units and
incremental transmission and distribution facilities; a residual
value of 15% of total project cost was credited at the end of the
study for the dam and civil works.
Cash flows of costs and benefits and output attributable to Kiambere are
shown on page 3 of this annex.

Long Run Marginal Cost of Supply
1.              In order  that consumers receive the correct price signal
concerning the economic cost of electricity, tariffs should reflect the
Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of supply.   The LRMC has been estimated by
determining the Average Incremental Cost (AIC) of generation, transmission,
distribution, and commercial administration to supply consumers of each
voltage level. Details of the AIC calculation are to be found in the
project file and are summarized below.
2.             The AIC of generation has been estimated on the basis of
incremental sales that can be provided from the Olkaria third geothermal
unit and the Kiambere and Turkwel hydro projects which can satisfy load
growth to early 1992. Further geothermal projects have not been included
because costs are uncertain and there is a possibility that cheaper imports
could be obtained from Uganda.   Transmission and distribution costs not
associated with generation projects are based on data given in the EAP&L
tariff study of February 1982. Cost data and assumptions are the same as
those used in the least cost analysis, Annex 21.
AIC Generation and Network Transmission
AIC = Present value capital + 0 & M costs
Present value incremental generation
3.             In the period 1985  - 1991  all incremental generation is
attributable to hydro and geothermal plants and provides for load growth
and fuel displacement.   The incremental generation  (on a base of 1984
generation) is assumed to remain constant at the level of added capacity
(1192 GWh/yr) from 1992-2027, the end of the study.
AIC Transmission and Distribution
4.         Based on past and future extension and reinforcement costs, the
estimates for transmission and distribution facilities are as follows:
Kcts/kWh                Sales Weighting
(1983 prices)                 Factor
Transmission (EHV)        included with generation               0.02
Subtransmission (HV)                 5.9                         0.28
Distribution (LV)                    6.6                         0.70



- 94 -
ANNEX 23
Page 2 of 2
The weighted average cost of sales (according to the proportion of sales
and the cumulative cost at each voltage  level)  is estimated  to be 9.7
Kcts/kWh.
Commercial and Administrative Costs
5.        Average C & A costs in 1983 prices were estimated by KP&L at 6.7
Kcts/kWh.   Incremental costs would be considerably less than average and
are estimated at 2 Kcts/kWh.
Total Average Incremental Cost
6.        The total AIC of sales to final consumers is the sum of the above
costs assuming an opportunity cost of capital discount rate of 12%.
Generation incl. 15% loss                 70.6
Transmission and distribution             10.6
Commercial and administrative              2.0
Total AIC                              83.2 Kcts/kWh
The above estimated AIC of 83.2 Kcts/kWh is about 17% higher than the
present tariff level of 70 Kcts/kWh plus 1 Kct/kWh tax.  While financial
requirements can be met at the present tariff level, further increases
would be justified on the grounds of encouraging economic efficiency.
