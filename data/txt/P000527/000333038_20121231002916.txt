F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Government is committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In terms
of education, this means providing universal quality basic education by 2015. This
project is the first 5-year phase of this long term endeavor, which is one of in-depth
policy and institutional reforms. Its objective is to ensure that the framework for quality
universal basic education is in place and ready for implementation. It places an emphasis
on developing an effective partnership between the State and the communities, creating a
national technical capacity for curricula and textbook development, and improving basic
education quality and efficiency. At the end of the project, these objectives will translate
into stronger institutional and managerial capacity, increased enrollment rates, more
equitable access and better education quality and efficiency.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The Project Development objective is to (i) improve access and equity for primary
education, and (ii) increase capacity in strategic management and curriculum
development.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1. Chad is a landlocked country spanning 1.2 million km2; with a population of 11
million according to the 2009 Census and a growth rate of 3.6 percent, one of the highest
in the world. Since its independence in 1960, the country has experienced crises due to
cyclical and external factors, including instability and conflict—arising from tensions
between different religious and ethnic factions, further fuelled by interference from
neighboring states—which constrained its economic growth. The country began
producing oil in 2004, thus increasing its revenues substantially. In 2009, Chad was
among the poorest countries in the world, with around 55 percent of the population living
below the poverty line and about 36 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. 1
Poverty is primarily concentrated in rural areas, where 87 percent of the country’s poor
live. Chad is ranked 183th out of 187 countries on the 2011 United Nations Development
Programme3 (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI). Following the current trend,
Chad is not expected to attain any of the millennium development goals (MDGs) by 2015.
1.1.2. Chad, part of France’s African holding until 1960, had also endured three decades
of civil warfare, including a civil war in 1979, as well as invasions by Libya before
relative peace was finally restored in 1990. A democratic constitution was drafted and
flawed presidential elections were held in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke out
in northern Chad, which continues to flare up despite several peace agreements that had
been made between the Government and rebel factions. In 2005, new rebel groups
emerged in western Sudan that launched attacks into eastern Chad despite signing peace
agreements in December 2006 and October 2007. In 2005, President Idriss Deby held a
referendum successfully removing constitutional term limits, winning another
controversial election in 2006. Sporadic rebel incursions continued throughout 2006 and
2007, with N’Djamena (the capital) experiencing a significant rebel threat in early 2008.
In 2011, President Deby was reelected to his fourth term in a relatively fair election.
1.1.3. At the time of project appraisal in 2003, the education system in Chad consisted of:
(a) six years of primary education beginning at age 6; (b) four years of lower and three
years of upper secondary education; and (c) higher education at the University of
N’Djamena and in two specialized technical institutions. Teachers were trained at the
upper secondary level for service in primary schools and at the university level for
secondary schools. Primary and secondary schools as well as teacher training and literacy
programs were managed by the Ministry of Education (Ministere de l'Education
Nationale - MEN), while higher education was managed by the Ministry of Higher
Education and Research. Primary education was provided in three types of schools:
1.1.4. Public schools hosted 75 percent of students, and were heavily supported by
parents who hired and provided remuneration to many of their teachers.

                                            1
1.1.5. Private schools hosted 9 percent of primary students, 14 percent of secondary
students, 3 percent of vocational and technical education training (TVET) students, and
17 percent of tertiary education students.
1.1.6. Community schools. Following the country's independence in 1960 and the civil
war (starting in 1979), Parents’ Associations (Association des Parents d'Elèves - APE)
assumed increasing responsibilities for primary education. Community schools enrolled
19 percent of all students and had 56 percent of the teaching force working in primary
education in 2000. Between 1995 and 2000, Chad made remarkable progress in primary
education; the gross enrollment rate (GER) increased from 62 to 88 percent for boys and
from 32 to 55 percent for girls. Despite this encouraging sign, the education system had a
number of persistent weaknesses including:
1.1.7. Financial constraints: Although Government spending had shifted in favor of
education beginning in the late 1990s, reaching 21.4 percent of total current expenditure,
public expenditure on education accounted for less than 3 percent (2.8 percent) of GDP.
This had resulted in households’ needing to contribute substantially to the cost of
education (around 15 percent of total cost).
1.1.8. Poor infrastructure. Most schools had to be set up by parents and communities,
who could not afford to pay for permanent structures. Thus 52 percent of the classrooms
were held in open-air, thatched huts (seckos), or in other temporary structures (poto-poto).
As a result, classes were frequently cancelled due to inclement weather conditions.
1.1.9. Wide regional and gender disparities. Primary enrollment was almost universal in
some parts in the South, but the GER was less than 42 percent in most of the north and
eastern provinces. In addition to other factors, the choice of French as the sole language
of instruction and the lack of relevance of the existing programs to the cultural values of
most Arabic-speaking and/or Muslim populations have been major impediments to
achieving gender equity in the Arabic-speaking provinces. Moreover, 84 percent of
schools had no female teachers, which was also considered by many as another major
obstacle to girls’ enrollment.
1.1.10 Post- primary education. Enrollment in general secondary education rose
substantially, on average over 12 percent annually between 1995 and 2000. In addition,
on average there were 84 students per class, enrolled mostly in the study of arts and
humanities. Repetition rates fell between 24 and 44 percent depending on the grade level.
The enrollment ratio of boys to girls was 5 to 1. Enrollment in TVET represented 2
percent of total enrollment in secondary education, but was delivered in more than 60
(generally public) institutions under the direction of four different ministries, and
concentrated in the capital city and in the southern part of the country. Enrollment in
higher education increased sharply between 1996 and 2000 where total enrollment
doubled, reaching 6,700 students. The higher education system was facing serious
challenges related to education quality and relevance.
1.1.11. In January 2000, the Government prepared an education sector strategy that
focused, in particular, on primary education and literacy. The key policies and actions
that would ensure and sustain the operationalization of this strategy were to be addressed
by an education sector strategy support program which was estimated at US$ 119.6
million to be financed by various donors (see Annex 1b). The Bank released a Country


                                             2
Assistance Strategy (CAS) in May 2000 with the goal of establishing the foundations for
improved human development and to ensure the continued development of a labor force
that would be needed for the expected increase in the availability of oil revenues. The
education sector strategy support program would also help ensure that the majority of the
population in Chad had access to adequate primary education and literacy services
through increased and improved community involvement. The proposed International
Development Association (IDA) project of US$42.34 million (equivalent to SDR 32
million: SDR 14.5 million as a credit and SDR 17.5 million as a grant) was to contribute
to this goal by strengthening community participation in education policy formulation
and school management, and in piloting new types of literacy and non-formal education
programs.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
1.2.1. There were discrepancies in the wording of the project development objectives
(PDO). The original objective of the Project as stated in the Financing Agreement (FA)
was to assist the Borrower in developing its policy framework, strategies and means for
achievement of quality universal basic education and in implementing its strategy to
improve access to and equity of education.
1.2.2. The original PDO as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was to
ensure that the framework for quality universal basic education was in place and ready
for implementation. It placed an emphasis on developing an effective partnership
between the State and the communities, creating national technical capacity for curricula
and textbook development, and improving the quality and efficiency of basic education.
At the end of the project, these objectives were designed to translate into stronger
institutional and managerial capacity, increased enrollment rates, more equitable access
and better education quality and efficiency.
1.2.3.The key indicators of the project as stated in the main text of the PAD differ from
those found in Annex 1 of the PAD. Key indicators used by the Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR) team are taken from Annex 1 because these were
used during project implementation and include the following:

   1. Community schools are entirely integrated through application of the policy and
      management provision described in: (a) the state-community partnership dated
      August 23, 2001; (b) the Project Implementation Manual; (c) the operational
      directives for management of CTs; and (d) the Program;
   2. Curriculum and textbooks development capacity exists: (a) CP1 and CP2
      bilingual curricula are developed; (b) textbooks are available for all grades at a
      ratio of one reading and one math textbook for each student whereas for Grades 3
      through 6, science textbooks will also be available at a ratio of 1:2; and (c) the
      new primary bilingual curriculum is tested, published and ready for use;
   3. A new literacy strategy is put in place through successful adaptation of the
      outsourcing approach;
   4. The GER will climb from 72 percent in 1999/2000 to 87 percent in 2005/2006;
   5. The ratio of girls to boys in the elementary increases from 63 percent in
      1999/2000 to 77 percent in 2005/2006;


                                           3
   6. The 6th grade survival rate will increase from 44 percent in 1999/2000 to 70
      percent in 2005/2006;
   7. Enrollment rates in 8 regions, namely: Lac, Borkou, Ennedi, Tibesti, Salamat,
      West Bata, East Bata, and Biltine reach 65% where it was equal to or less than
      40% in 1999/2000.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
1.3.1. The revised PDO was to: (i) improve access and equity for primary education, and
(ii) increase capacity in strategic management and curriculum development. The revised
key indicators were the following:

   1.   Primary level GER in targeted zones;
   2.   Ratio of girls to boys’ primary level in targeted zones;
   3.   Interim Education Sector Plan (IESP) adopted;
   4.   Curriculum for Grades 1 to 4 validated;
   5.   Direct project beneficiary (number) of which female (%) of community teachers
        (CTs) and students in primary public schools in targeted zones.

1.3.2. The December 2010 Level 1 restructuring was meant to address issues related to:
(i) inconsistencies across documents (PAD, Legal Agreement, and Integrated Safeguards
Data Sheet (ISDS)) on formulation of the PDO, key indicators, and difficulties in
measuring indicators; (ii) poor project implementation performance due to a complex
design as a result of the weak capacity of the country to manage and implement reforms
in the education system; and (iii) limited/decreased relevance of some activities due to
the evolving context and the need to align project activities with the changes in the school
construction program that was being implemented under the President’s social
infrastructure construction program, financed through the oil revenue budget.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1. The original project beneficiaries included: (i) the school-age population falling
within the category of first and second cycle of basic education in particular the primary
education age cohort (children between the ages of 3 and 12) and especially girls and
those children living in disadvantaged geographic areas; (ii) teachers, particularly female
teachers; and (iii) young children (ages three to five), illiterate adults, out-of-school youth,
and APEs around school, and young women through its pilot programs in early childhood
development (ECD), literacy and non-formal education. The targeted project
beneficiaries were revised when the project was restructured to include the targeted
groups of the original project with the exception of children ages three to five and out-of-
school youth. The ECD sub-component was dropped because there was no provision of
funds in the project to support implementation of activities.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1. The project components as designed to achieve the PDOs are shown below:


                                               4
Component 1: Improving Access and Equity (US$50.42 million of which IDA
financing: US$16.59 million): Its objective was to increase access to and equity of
education. It sought to establish a sustainable strategy for the expansion of primary
school enrollment by targeting community initiatives, girls' education, and participation
of children living in under-served regions, including nomadic children. Component 1 had
three sub-components which were: support to community initiatives; promotion of girls'
schooling; and classroom, wells and latrine construction, maintenance and acquisition of
school furniture and equipment.
Component 2: Improving Quality and Efficiency (US$47.17 million of which IDA
Financing: US$14.36 million): The objective of this component was to improve quality
and the internal efficiency of primary and general secondary education by improving
curricula for training and teaching in basic education, increasing the availability and
quality of pedagogical and didactic materials, and introducing innovative programs (ECD,
Interactive Radio Instruction (IRI)) to increase access to learning and overall learning
achievement through schooling. Component 2 had the following eight sub-components:
curriculum renovation for basic education; support for the development and management
of textbooks, pedagogic and didactic materials; learning assessment and research; teacher
training; ECD program; national languages reading development program (ELN); IRI
Program; and school health and nutrition program.
Component 3: Literacy and Non-formal Education (US$7.99 million of which IDA
financing: US$3.73 million): This component aimed to pilot a new delivery mechanism
of literacy programs to support implementation of literacy and practical skills training to
out-of-school youth and adults in a sample of rural communities through private sector
providers that would be recognized by decision-makers as appropriate for nationwide
application. Activities under this component would be implemented through the
following four sub-components: literacy courses for adults (ages 15 and older); non-
formal education activities for unschooled and out-of school youth (ages 10 to 14 years
old); reading and basic skills strengthening in the target villages with post literacy
activities; and literacy program monitoring and evaluation (M&E).
Component 4 Strengthening Planning, Management and Program Monitoring
(US$13.54 million of which IDA financing: US$7.13 million): Its objective was to
provide the institutional capacity strengthening necessary for successful program
planning, activity management and M&E. The Component would strengthen specific
units within the MEN, such as the Planning Directorate, to encourage dynamic cross-
cutting interventions and strategic planning. It also included the establishment of a
permanent institution to be the locus of a major curriculum renewal effort. This
component had the following four sub-components: Establishment of the Centre National
des Curricula (CNC); Strategic Institutional Capacity Building for the Programme
d’Appui a la Reforme du Secteur de l’Education au Tchad (PARSET) -
MEN/Communities; Strengthening of MEN Planning and Monitoring Capacities; and
Strengthening of the Analytical Capacity, Policy Development, Monitoring and
Coordination.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1. The project was restructured in December 2010. Its design was simplified and the
number of components was reduced to two and the sub-components were reorganized
and regrouped in line with the new components. The number of sub-components was
reduced from 19 to 9. Some of the original sub-components/activities that were having a
marginal effect on the education sector were dropped because of their completion or
irrelevance within the restructured project. Two new activities were proposed, on a pilot
basis: (i) the provision of Information Technology (IT) laboratories, and library
equipment to new secondary education schools built under the Government School
Construction Program in Component 1 and (ii) a new scheme for direct provision of
School Grants to public primary schools under Component 2. As of December 2010, the
project had disbursed 75.4 percent of total funds (US$14.43 million as a credit and
US$20.91 million as a grant) with US$11.2 million remaining undisbursed.
Component 1: Improving access and equity to education (US$7.4 million): aimed to
increase access to primary education and reduce gender and regional disparities by
increasing the capacity of existing primary education schools and promoting enrollments
for girls and children in vulnerable areas. The revised Component 1 was divided in 5 sub-
components as follows: education infrastructure; support to secondary education; support
to girls’ enrollment; teacher training; and support to school health and nutrition.
Component 2: Enhancing institutional capacity (US$3.8 million): supported
strengthening some key capacities at the Ministry and local levels to manage the
education sector and the project. It includes the following four subcomponents: Support
to local school committees; Support to the CNC; Strengthening of the Education
Management Information System (EMIS) and project management; and developing
capacity for sector analysis and policy.

1.7 Other significant changes
1.7.1. During the April 2007 mid-term review (MTR) of the project (two months prior to
the initial closing date), the Bank and the Government discussed the possibility of a two-
year extension of the project closing date and revising the results framework. It was
decided that the extension would be undertaken in two stages: (i) one extension would be
made from June 30, 2007 to October 31, 2007; and (ii) a second extension would be
made from October 31, 2007 to June 30, 2009, because of low disbursement of funds
(37.2% of the credit and 33% of the grant) and flaws identified in the Project’s design.
Three years into project implementation, the PDO was rated moderately unsastifactory.
This weak performance was due to: (i) huge procurement delays; (ii) frequent changes in
ministers (having seven ministers in three years); and (iii) two suspensions of project
disbursements by the Bank (from September-November 2005, and January-May 2006).
In 2009, the former Minister of Education with two other ministers and several top
government officials were incarcerated, after being accused of fictitious bids on
textbooks to be purchased with the national budget. The MEN was without a minister for
months, which weakened significantly the decision-making process. However, project
funds were not involved in these allegations.



                                            6
1.7.2. A third extension of project closing date and reallocation of proceeds set the new
closing date for December 31, 2010. By then about 74 percent of the funds had been
disbursed. The third extension was granted to allow full completion of three main
activities: (i) construction of CNC; (ii) setting-up of the EMIS; and (iii) finishing the
construction of 190 wells. After an in-depth review of the portfolio, the Government
requested a reallocation of funds between disbursement categories to support increased
costs associated with the 190 wells, and reduce the resources allocated to goods and
community grants.
1.7.3. On December 29, 2010, a Level 1 restructuring was approved by the Bank’s Board
of Executive Directors. This restructuring included: (i) revisions to the PDO; (ii)
revisions to the results framework and targets; (iii) revisions to components and sub-
components; (iv) a reallocation of funds between disbursement categories, including
adding a new sub-category (5.e) for the provision of School Grants to public primary
schools, and increasing disbursement percentage of all IDA expenditures to 100%; and
(v) extension of the closing date of the project from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2012.
By this new closing date, about 95 percent of the funds had been disbursed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project Preparation:
2.1.2. Lessons learned: Lessons learned from previous IDA-supported projects were
taken into consideration in the preparation of the project, in particular the need to
promote effective communication to increase project ownership among stakeholders at all
levels. In addition, the project took into consideration the need to promote capacity-
building among stakeholders to increase the pace of school construction and to ensure
community participation in school management. Finally, an important lesson from the
Basic Education Project (IDA Cr. 2501-CD) that was taken into consideration was that
the partnership between the State and the communities should be based on clear
principles and well-defined responsibilities.
2.1.3. Choice of instrument: The preparation team initially considered a sector wide
education operation (Sector Wide Approach - SWAP) to be supported by an Adaptable
Program Loan (APL) instrument as it was considered a better fit given the sequence of
reforms envisaged, but ultimately this idea was rejected. An APL would have been good
at supporting a sequenced approach to reform in the context of the long-term
development objectives of this project, but APLs also require strong policy development
and implementation capacity, accompanied by good coordination among donors. These
conditions did not exist in Chad. The Government's education program documents at the
time provided a five-year perspective and had yet to include a longer term strategy or
strategic plans for developing and strengthening post-primary education. Moreover, the
Government was at an early stage of forging coordination between donors, and, as a
result, several partners did not confirm their financial support to the sector in accordance
with their stated intentions during the January 2000 Round Table. The preparation team
decided, therefore, that a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) would be more appropriate in
the Chad context, to provide focused support and to test pilot approaches for basic


                                             7
education, including providing specific support in addressing complex issues including
community teacher training and community participation in school management.
2.1.4. Preparation team and participatory process: The project was prepared over several
months which allowed for serious policy dialogue and the participation of key
stakeholders. This process helped build ownership of the project. The project preparation
team appears to have been strong, including the participation of several experts in various
aspects of project design. Further, several reports and studies complemented their
expertise and supported project design.
Original Project Design
2.1.5. Link with Government and Bank’s priorities: The original Chad Education Sector
Reform Project (ESRP) design fit into the first country Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP, June 2003 – which was being developed during project preparation), the
Education Sector Program (ESP, 2000) and the Bank CAS (May 2003) all of which
supported strengthening foundations for improved human development and a better
trained labor force in preparation for the availability of oil revenues. The results
framework for the project was aligned with the ESP and its objectives.
2.1.6. Project complexity: The project design attempted to: (i) lay the foundations for
long-term sector capacity-building; (ii) deal with short-term capacity weaknesses in
education delivery by involving communities and other stakeholders, namely non-
governmental organizations (NGOs); (iii) support a more equitable allocation of
government resources; and to (iv) improve the relevance of curriculum and textbooks
design and introduce innovative programs. These objectives were to be achieved through
the Project’s four components and 19 sub-components. While relevant to the country’s
education sector needs, this design proved to be too ambitious for a five-year SIL (2003-
2007).
2.1.7. Results framework: In addition, the project results framework had: (i) PDO
indicators that in most cases measured nationwide progress rather than the specific
impact of the project; 2 (ii) too many intermediate indicators; and (iii) some indicators that
did not pertain to project-funded activities. Moreover, there was no M&E system in place
to support project implementation making project and component monitoring difficult.
2.1.8. Given the above, the ICR team considers the original design to have been
overambitious, too complex, and weak in terms of its M&E.
Quality at Entry
2.1.9. During the project review meeting on March 20, 2003, there was a consensus that
the project design was solid and that it was technically and analytically sound.
Recommendations were made for improving the design in some key areas. These
included, among others, addressing the dual teachers’ recruitment mechanism and ways
that the project could support the Government in managing CT training. It was also


2
 Admittedly this was common practices for projects prepared in the early 2000s given the emphasis on the
MDGs and on Education For All (EFA).



                                                   8
recommended that the performance indicators be revised to strengthen their alignment
with the MDGs. Most of these recommendations were adopted and many adopted within
the M&E capacity-building activities.
2.1.10. Overall, Bank management felt that the project was ambitious but that this
reflected high harmonization of the project with the Government’s education reform
strategy as stated in the ESP and the PRSP. Project risks had also been identified and
mitigation measures to deal with the risks were put in place.
2.1.11. Although the review meeting team considered the design appropriate, the ICR
team considers their assessment as being overly optimistic in relation to the project
design and the capacity of the Government to implement the project, in particular, with
regards to the difficult issue of providing payment to the CTs. In fact, the Project’s MTR
also found the design to have been overly ambitious and pointed to implementation
problems related to limited capacity and flawed procurement processes.
Restructuring Design
2.1.12. Although both the Government and the Bank agreed on the need to restructure the
project during the MTR, it was only in December 2010 that the process was finalized.
However, after the MTR and the first extension of the closing date, the project was
monitoring progress based on revised indicators agreed upon during the MTR before
formal approval.
2.1.13. The 2010 Level 1 restructuring attempted to address the project design problems,
by: (i) restating the PDO; (ii) removing activities – and related output indicators- that
were not initially funded or that were not critical for the project revised PDO (ECD
activities, IRI program, non-formal and literacy activities); (iii) significantly changing the
PDO indicators to provide better measures of progress, mostly by dropping some
indicators, adding some new ones and replacing some targets 3; (iv) reducing the overall
scope of the project from four components with 19 sub-components to two components
with nine sub-components; and (v) introducing pilots of new activities related to
secondary education and school grants. These modifications were also aligned with the
Government’s own refocused priorities on secondary education and the President social
infrastructure program.
2.1.14. At restructuring 74% of the financing had been disbursed and activities for which
targets were revised were all completed. The ICR team believes that restructuring the
project was appropriate particularly in light of the infrastructure component, curriculum
and textbook development, and project implementation progress prior to the restructuring.
However, the Team also believes it could have been conducted at an earlier stage of
project implementation and that some of the indicators could have been further narrowed.




3
  The ratio of girls to boys in primary education and enrollment rates by department were kept as indicators
but were modified to focus only on targeted areas. The curriculum indicator was also kept but with a new
target.



                                                     9
2.2 Implementation
2.2.1. The success of project implementation varied greatly across the two main
implementation periods of the project: Phase one (from January 2004 to December 2010)
and Phase two (the post-restructuring period, from January 2011 to June 2012). On the
Government side, exogenous and endogenous factors complicated implementation.
Among the endogenous factors, there were many changes in the Government and project
team members which hampered the implementation of the project: ministers changed
twelve times, including all of the associated policy and staff, seven of the changes
occurring before the 2007 MTR, and there were two project coordinators (the first one
was suspended on alleged corruption). Among the exogenous factors, Chad faced civil
unrest and repeated rebels attacks on the country and the capital city, including: (i) a
teachers’ strike in 2007 for five months which delayed implementation of activities, in
particular, curriculum development and its pilot application; (ii) a rebel attack in 2004-
2005 which delayed community-based activities and construction outside N’Djamena;
and (iii) two rebel attacks on N’Djamena in 2006 and 2008 which seriously affected the
project. On the Bank side, the project had four task team leaders (TTLs) over the nine
year project life without any key team member remaining throughout project preparation
and implementation. In addition, the Project was suspended twice (from September-
November 2005, and January-May 2006) because of, respectively, the dismissal of the
first project coordinator and a suspension of all Bank operations in Chad due to political
issues causing substantial delays in project implementation.
2.2.2. During Phase one, the project disbursed 74 percent of its total net allocation. 4
However, the implementation record during this period is at best mixed. Difficulties in
project implementation started early on with a delay in effectiveness (which only
occurred nine months after the project was approved by the Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors) and the project’s launch (a launch workshop was held only seven months after
the project was declared effective, in July 2004, with the participation of representatives
from the Ministry of Education (MEN), the Community Initiative Support Agency for
Education Development (APICED), the National Federation of Parents' Associations
(FENAPET), NGOs and communities). Notwithstanding the challenges associated with
government ownership and the complexity of project design, some partial successes were
achieved. In particular: (i) key project staff were hired; (ii) schools construction began
with the completion of 400 equipped classrooms (during Phase one), 400 blocks of
latrines, and 113 wells; (iii) a national framework was developed and the development of
a new curriculum and new textbooks was launched; (iv) 3.7 million textbooks were
procured and distributed (by end of project); (v) staff and more than 10,000 CTs were
trained; (vi) bilingual education was piloted; (vii) communities sensitized and trained;
(viii) school health and nutrition activities implemented satisfactorily; (ix) and EMIS
activities were launched.

2.2.3. Six months after the launch workshop, rebels attacked the eastern part of the
country, delaying implementation of activities with community involvement, and 18


4
    Net allocation = SDR 32.0 million (Credit: SDR 14.5; Grant: SDR 17.5).


                                                    10
months after the launch workshop, the project coordinator was revoked, which led the
Bank to suspend the project from September to November 2005. Soon after resolution of
the issue related to the project coordinator, all Bank operations were suspended in Chad
(January-May 2006) and the Government’s political leadership was changing constantly.
These ministerial changes posed serious implementation challenges for the Project and
limited the administration’s capacity to set up a sound M&E system. Non-compliance
with procurement plans caused serious delays as was pointed out during the MTR.
2.2.4. During the MTR, both the Bank and the Government recognized that the project
design was complex and that indicators were poorly linked to project interventions and
difficult to measure. A two-year extension and reallocation of funds between categories
was agreed. However, ten months after the MTR, a rebel attack occurred in N’Djamena
(February 2, 2008) during which many of the project’s assets were destroyed including
offices. Due to security reasons, the Bank’s office was moved to Cameroon for seven
months during which it was difficult to monitor project implementation. Having a
functioning Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in place helped in continuing
implementation of activities. By 2009, it was clear that the project needed more
restructuring than just modifications to the results framework. Nevertheless, it took one
year to complete the process. The ICR team believes that the project team could have
undertaken project restructuring during or prior to the MTR since many of the
problematic design issues were already known at that time.
2.2.5. Between May 2003 and May 2005, the Bank rated the PDO satisfactory with a
disbursement rate of 12.14 percent. Despite a good disbursement rate of 72.4 percent
between May 2005 and June 2009, the project’s implementation progress (IP) and PDO
were downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory. The analysis of the results framework
during that period is difficult because of the lack of data to assess project achievements
relative to the project’s indicators. After the restructuring in 2010, the project was rated
moderately satisfactory, which reflected progress made around that time and the need for
an earlier project restructuring.
2.2.6. Notable gains were achieved during the last 18 months of project implementation.
After the restructuring, 95 percent of project funds were disbursed and project activities
were completed with the exception of laboratory equipment for secondary schools, school
grants, and the adoption of the IESP. The new results framework was improved with a
closer alignment with project activities and an improved ability to measure progress
towards achievement of the PDO.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design

2.3.1. The original results framework for the project was weak because: (i) only one PDO
indicator out of seven was specific to the project intervention, the other six were designed
to measure changes on a national scale; and (ii) some of the indicators were related to
implementation of activities that were not funded by the Project, and therefore, the
measured outcomes and could not be attributed to the project investment. Given the
complexity of the original results framework, monitoring was difficult both for the Bank


                                            11
and the various implementation agencies. After the 2010 restructuring, the PDO
indicators were revised to be more focused and more closely aligned with project
components. The intermediate indicators were reduced from 19 to 14, linking them more
explicitly to the project investments. However, the PDO and intermediate indicators
would have benefited from being even more focused. For example, expecting girls’
completion rate to increase in three entire regions in a short period of time while the
project component targeted only 264 schools seems unrealistic.

Implementation and Utilization of Monitoring and Evaluation:
2.3.2. Implementation of EMIS activities was moderately satisfactory because the unit
monitored more indicators than required by the project. By project closing, the Ministere
de l’Education Nationale's Planning Directorate (DAPRO), the central unit of the MEN
in charge of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating education data was operational with
key technical staff trained. However, timely production of data remains a concern; delays
in data production and incomplete information are recurrent issues in the sector, and the
reliability of data has been questionable. The size of the country (1.2 million km2) and the
limited communication infrastructure were major impediments to developing an efficient
education data monitoring system. The country’s education system would need to
enhance its EMIS using new technologies; in that endeavor, the EMIS tools would need
to reflect the diversity of stakeholders, such as migrant communities and students.
2.3.3. Implementation of the M&E indicators for project and sector purposes was
problematic during project implementation, with a weak dissemination mechanism. The
DAPRO was expected to produce national and regional statistics on an annual basis.
However, the Education Statistical Yearbook was published with at least one year delay
and had a limited dissemination, which reduced the use of information in policy dialogue
and in informing policy decisions. Although the revised project design objectives
included strengthening of the EMIS through capacity-building at all levels, the
production of the Education Statistical Yearbook remained delayed for the duration of the
project as a result of low capacity at decentralized levels. Consistency in indicators was
further complicated as a result of the use of population projections based on the most
recent census at the time (1999) which was used until 2009 when a new census was
conducted. Project implementation reports were prepared regularly and supported by
secondary sources of monitoring information such as independent technical and
procedural audits, as well as information from the semestrial supervision missions
conducted by the Bank task team in collaboration with the other development partners.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

2.4.1. The project was classified as a Category B based on the Bank’s Operational Policy
due to the potential environmental and social impacts of its construction program. An
Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP) was prepared and approved by the time of project
appraisal in 2003. The EMP included specific institutional arrangements to enable
execution of all measures identified. During the 2010 restructuring, which included the
construction of additional wells and latrines blocks, an Environmental and Social


                                            12
Management Framework (ESMF) was approved, and disclosed in the Infoshop. All
constructions of classrooms, wells, and blocks of latrines were implemented in existing
schools. There were no safeguard issues during implementation.
Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.2. The project was executed by the MEN through one coordinating unit (The PIU)
dealing with implementing agencies such as APICED and other entities of the MEN. The
PIU was responsible for all fiduciary requirements. The arrangements were adequate to
meet the needs for financial management (FM) under OP/BP 10.02. The PIU was
compliant with the submission of the quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs) at the time
of project closing, with some minor delays occurring during the implementation period
(mainly due to the country size and communication issues in receiving information from
the district education offices and the changes occurring within the accounting team). In
addition, there were delays in the provision of counterpart funds. The 2010 Audit report
was submitted on time and the auditor raised unqualified opinions. Following the last
supervision mission conducted in May-June 2012, FM was judged to be satisfactory and
related risks moderate.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.5.1. The Local Donor Group (LDG) is currently working with the Government of Chad
to prepare a new Global Partnership for Education Fund operation (GPEF) with the
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) as supervising entity. The new project is
expected to be delivered in FY13 and will focus on improving the access and quality of
education, through improving planning, monitoring and evaluation of basic education
services in deprived districts. The project will provide: (i) district grants to support school
construction, wells, and latrines, (ii) funding for teacher training, and curriculum scale-up,
(iii) support for more strategic and regular capacity-building activities for districts, school
management committees, and school directors, and (iv) funding for M&E. The Bank will
also provide a SIL of US$ 15 million to support the country’s national IESP and
complement the GPEF. Given the scope and nature of the planned activities under the
GPEF and the new SIL, the lessons learned from the ESRP will be of particular relevance.
The SIL operation will build on the experience of the ESRP and ensure sustainability of
its achievements. This includes building on the ESRP-PIU which by the end of the
Project had become fairly successful in delivering key outputs, and on community
strengthening initiatives initiated by the ESRP (moving further towards school
community based management). The new SIL will also make it possible to implement
measures which could not be initiated by ESRP, such as the transfer of funds to the APEs
for school grants.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objectives
3.1.1. Both the original and revised project objectives, which were derived from the 2000
ESP, continue to be relevant to the country needs as reflected in the 2008 Growth and
Poverty and Growth Strategy Paper II (SNRP II, adopted in April 2008), and the May


                                             13
2010 Interim Strategy Note (ISN, 2010-2012). Chad’s SNRP II continues to give high
priority to the education sector as one of the drivers of growth and poverty reduction. It
also reconfirms the continued relevance of the program, while continuing to prioritize
increasing access to education and training, focusing on bridging the gender and equity
gap, and improving the quality and efficiency of education service delivery. The ISN
supports the focus on targeted programs for the poor, while improving basic health and
education services through the decentralized system. Therefore, the overall relevance of
the project objectives is high.
Relevance of Design
3.1.2. The relevance of Phase one project design is considered to be modest. The original
project design turned out to be overambitious and complex, with some key sub-
components not funded. This makes it difficult to assess progress toward the achievement
of the PDOs. The relevance of the original design is therefore considered modest.
3.1.3. However, the relevance of the restructured design is considered as substantial.
This is due to the fact that the: (i) PDO and PDO indicators were better aligned with
project interventions, and (ii) components and sub-components that were not relevant
were eliminated, thus reducing challenges associated with implementation capacity.
These modifications helped reduce the complexity of the project, making it more realistic
and easy to implement.
Relevance of Implementation
3.1.4. The relevance of Phase one project implementation is considered to be modest.
The justification for this rating is mainly based on the implementation issues prior to
restructuring in relation to procurement and delays in activities implementation. However,
there was a high disbursement rate (74 percent) during Phase one associated with
successes in sound implementation of community grants, girls’ education activities,
school health (de-worming and micronutrients) activities, bilingual education pilot,
training of 10,000 CTs, as well as construction and equipment of 400 classrooms and
latrines, and 113 wells. In addition, CNC technical staff was recruited and trained, studies
that informed curriculum and textbooks development were completed, and the
development of the EMIS was launched.
3.1.5. The relevance of Phase two (the phase following restructuring) implementation is
considered to be substantial. The justification for this rating is based on the following: (i)
completion of infrastructure and equipment activities (wells and latrines); (ii) completion
of all planned studies; (iii) completion of curriculum and textbooks development
activities which encompassed the initial target and included the entire six years of
primary education; (iv) acquisition of micronutrients and de-worming; and (v)
completion of girls’ education activities. The incomplete activities relate to laboratory
equipment and libraries, transfer of funds to APEs for the school grants, and the adoption
of the National Interim Education Plan which only happened recently, on August 24th,
2013 (i.e., just after the closing date of the project).




                                             14
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
3.2.1. Before restructuring, data related to the original PDO indicators were being
collected for three out of seven indicators, and one partially, and this continued until
project restructuring; one indicator was on the list but no data were consistently available
(ratio girls to boys in primary, as in the ISR seq. 19). The August 2008 ISR introduced a
revision in the outcome indicators of the project. The status of the PDO indicators at
restructuring (December 2010) is presented in the results framework.
3.2.2. By restructuring, and after two extensions of the project closing date, three
indicators were showing some progress (indicator 2 on curriculum and textbooks;
indicator 3 on the literacy strategy; and indicator 4 on gross enrollment), with the last two
having achieved or being very likely to have achieved their targets; one indicator (ratio
girls to boys) had no available data, but according to information gathered some progress
has been made (although below target); one indicator (indicator 6 on the survival rate)
was partially monitored and showed deterioration; and two indicators (indicator 1 on
community schools and indicator 7 on enrollment by department) were not being
monitored by the ISR, the first one already achieved by project appraisal and the other
showing heterogeneous progress with likely some deterioration in some departments.
Based on the above, the achievement of the PDO prior to restructuring is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.
3.2.3. After restructuring of the Project, the revised indicators that were being monitored
and their values at project closing are indicated in the results framework. All of the PDO
indicators, with the exception of one, were either adjusted or changed. The five new
indicators monitored showed, at project closing, improvement, with two indicators
achieved (one after the closing of the project), one largely achieved, and two only
partially achieved. The section below provides more details by focusing on achievements
after the Project’s 2010 restructuring.
3.2.4. Primary education indicators in targeted zones: the aim of the Project was to
provide equitable access to primary education in four regions where the Project was
focusing on providing classroom equipment, construction of latrines and wells, providing
de-worming and micronutrients to students in deprived areas, improving the level of
qualification of community teachers as to enable them to deliver the curriculum, and
providing textbooks for students in these underserved areas. Progress in achieving the
PDO was to be monitored using the GER, the ratio of girls to boys, and the number of
direct beneficiaries from project interventions in the four main targeted regions. 5
3.2.5. The overall GER, which increased from 72 percent in 2000 to 91 percent in 2011,
was dropped at restructuring. In terms of regional enrollment, the target was partially met,
with a substantial increase in GER observed in two out of the four targeted regions,
exceeding the restructuring targets, namely Bata (76 percent), and Salamat (71 percent).
The overall girls to boys education ratio, which experienced a significant increase of

 It should also be highlighted that these two regions of the north have a very strong muslim culture/religion
which is generally not favorable to girls’ education.



                                                    15
about 12 percentage points between 2000 and 2011 but, at 0.75 remained below the 0.77
end of project target, was also dropped at restructuring replaced by the ratio in the four
main targeted regions. In these regions, project targets were achieved, or practically
achieved in Bata and BET (BET from a quite low level in 2008), while the ratios
remained below target in Salamat and LAC (at a level similar than in 2008). In Salamat
there is evidence that there was a steep increase in boys’ enrollment, while in LAC the
weak enrollment performance penalized girls.
3.2.6. At restructuring an indicator on direct project’s beneficiaries was introduced. The
number of direct beneficiaries from project interventions in the four targeted regions
reached 166,300 students and 13,200 CTs, exceeding the restructuring targets.
According to intermediate outcome indicators, about 11,180 community teachers have
received level 1 training (basic) and 1,700 level 2 training (full certification). At 34
percent, the proportion of beneficiary female students was lower than expected, but at 25
percent the proportion of beneficiary women community teachers was higher than
expected.
3.2.7. It is also important to highlight the positive performance of school nutrition and
deworming activities (with over 90,000 students receiving deworming and micro-
nutrients by project closing) and additional infrastructure construction (with 465 latrines
and 255 wells by project closing) as positive contributors to the GER, gender ratios and
project beneficiaries outcomes.
3.2.8. Management of the education sector: in addition to completion of the CNC
building, and piloting curriculum and textbooks for Grades 1-4 of primary education, the
project aimed to strengthen key capacities of the Ministry and local levels of the Ministry
to manage the education sector through building a national capacity to plan, develop, and
implement curriculum and related teaching materials, set-up a sound M&E system to
support sector analysis and policy dialogue. Progress in achieving the PDO, after
restructuring, was to be monitored through the development and adoption of the IESP,
the development and validation of curriculum for Grades 1-4, and the number of adults
enrolled in literacy programs. These were closely related to a set of intermediate outcome
indicators referred to below when relevant.
3.2.9. Construction and equipment of the CNC as well as training of technical staff were
completed. The CNC was strengthened to plan, develop, and implement curriculum for
the first time since the country independence. The CNC technical staff was able to
successfully develop and pilot the curriculum for all grades of primary education (from
Grades 1 to 6, exceeding Grades 1 to 4 as planned). Along with the curriculum, textbooks
and teaching materials were also developed and tested in 10 schools (instead of 30), and
teachers were trained. Stakeholders interviewed during the field mission reported that
having the CNC facilities and its staff trained had the greatest impact of all project
activities with high potential for the support of continuous quality improvement activities.
Although the CNC received training in learning assessment, it was not possible to
develop a learning outcome system because of the delayed curriculum implementation,
but the development of such as system is expected be supported under the new IDA
project.




                                            16
3.2.10. The preparation process of the EISP took longer than expected because of a lack
of local capacity and delay in the procurement of the international expert to support the
local team, but the EISP was eventually adopted by the end of August 2012. The
development of the plan was also made possible with support from the DAPRO. This
support was used to set up a data collection and analysis system to allow the production
of improved information on the education system. However, the collection of data was
delayed mainly due to limited communication capacity and the vast size of the country
which have impacted the timely availability of reliable information, complicating the
M&E of the project and contributing to the delay in the preparation of the plan. Overall,
the MEN EMIS staff is now able to report on project specific data, including key
performance indicators, which is a major step forward. Recent delays were, however,
recently observed in the publication of education data making continuous support of the
EMIS a priority for the new IDA project. Finally, a new literacy strategy was developed
and used to cover 20,000 adults (of which 70% women) from 2004-2009, so this target
was already achieved by restructuring.
3.2.11. Although some indicators are still below target (e.g., girl to boy ratio in primary
education and the enrollment rate in some targeted areas) and some management-related
activities have not been fully completed, many positive achievements in other targeted
areas and in the management of the education system have been observed so that the
achievement of the PDO after restructuring is rated moderately satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1. No Net Present Value (NPV) was calculated for the project nor was an economic
rate of return defined for the investment. An efficiency analysis was conducted based on
the assumption that investments in education are generally justified because they increase
the productivity of labor and are associated with beneficial social outcomes.
3.3.2. To assess the cost-effectiveness of the investments undertaken under the project,
the analysis took into account four main elements: (i) the internal efficiency of the
education system; (ii) teachers’ salaries; (iii) the unit costs of classroom construction; and
(iv) the purchase and distribution of textbooks and some additional elements affecting the
efficiency of implementation. (More details are provided in Annex 3).
3.3.3. The Project aimed to improve internal efficiency through an aggressive policy to
reduce repetition and drop-out, improve transitions among grades, training and
integration of CTs, and by the State taking over the entire cost of community schools.
While in 2010 the number of students obtaining their end of primary education certificate
rose to 308 (280 in the case of girls) and the repetition rate declined marginally, overall,
between 2000 and 2010 primary education internal efficiency deteriorated slightly instead
of improving (See Annex 3 for more details).

                  Drop-out Rate         10.8            17.4      11

                  Primary Survival Rate 44                  -     36
                  to Grade 6


3.3.4. In part this disappointing result is likely to be the outcome of too few additional
CTs trained at an advanced level (only 1,700 CTs were certified for level 2) – this target
could have been more ambitious. Over the life time of the project, CTs subsidies paid by
the Government increased from an average of CFA 240,000/year in 2000 to CFA
450,000 starting in 2005 (CFA 300,000 for CTs level 1, and CFA 540,000 for CTs level
2). However, instead of decreasing, the number of CTs (particularly level 1 CTs)
increased substantially from 8,600 in 2000 to 18,300 in 2010 (74 percent of all primary
teachers), more than the high scenario increase of CTs in the system set in 2020 (56
percent). Additionally, out of the 21,100 CTs in primary education in 2010, only 63
percent have received training and fewer than 2,000 CTs are certified. This evidence
likely suggests a lack of “value for money? as far as teacher salaries were concerned.
Upgrading the status and qualifications of the CTs was expected to have a favorable
impact on internal efficiency and learning outcomes under the project, but the increased
teacher subsidies were associated only partially with these desired effects.
3.3.5. The Project supported the construction of 400 classrooms, 265 latrines, and 255
wells. In addition, unit costs for school construction, latrines, and wells were estimated in
comparison with other similar countries. Implementation revealed that unit costs were
underestimated resulting in the construction of fewer classrooms than originally planned.
Delayed implementation of activities exacerbated by procurement delays and the long
approval process for contracts played a significant role in increasing unit costs of goods
and services. In addition, when the presidential program launched schools construction,
the unit costs were far higher than those of the project, thus creating an inflation of
construction cost. After restructuring, unit costs were unchanged until project closing.
Underestimated unit costs impacted negatively on the efficiency of the project.

3.3.6. Efficient implementation of the project was also constrained by in the difficulties
of developing an efficient education data monitoring system to allow for regular and
reliable measuring of the project’s outcomes and outputs and by the significant delays in


                                             18
the procurement of new textbooks. Overall, therefore, project efficiency is considered to
be low.
3.3.7. Nonetheless, the Project used the textbook funds to purchase 3.1 million textbooks
in French and Arabic, and editing teachers’ guides, which is above the restructuring
target and shows innovation and efficiency in the use of funds (adapting existing
textbooks instead of buying new ones). This justifies a slight upgrading of the project
efficiency rating after restructuring to modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
3.4.1. The overall outcome rating of the Chad ESRP is moderately unsatisfactory as
reflected by the two phases of project implementation. Phase one shows the overall
outcome to be moderately unsatisfactory: the project design was complex and beyond the
national implementation capacity, which makes implementation inconsistent (project
relevance overall modest), efficiency was difficult to measure and low according to the
efficiency analysis, and the achievement of the PDO prior to restructuring is rated
moderately unsatisfactory. Phase two shows the overall outcome to be moderately
satisfactory. This Phase included a more relevant project design with a more focused
results framework (project relevance substantial), and better results, with a PDO assessed
to be moderately satisfactory. (Efficiency gains remain modest). The overall project
outcome rating is considered to be moderately unsatisfactory because project
restructuring did not take place until 74 percent of funds were disbursed.
3.4.2. The tables below summarize the overall rating of the project and explanation of the
weighting procedure. Annex 2 gives more details on activities implementation and
project achievements.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
3.5.1. Data on poverty in Chad is lacking, with the main source of data being two
household surveys undertaken in 1995/1996 and 2003/2004. With around 55 percent of
the population living below the poverty line and about 36 percent of the population living
in extreme poverty, poverty in Chad is primarily concentrated in rural areas, where 87
percent of the country’s poor live. The Chad Education Policy Reform Project targeted
communities and children living in disadvantaged geographic areas where substantial
funds were channeled to support community schools and adult literacy programs, which
traditionally receive little support from the State. The project focused on geographic
equity, with the aim of generating greater equality in terms of educational opportunities
among provinces. It also focused on gender equity to bridge the gap between boys and
girls. As the provinces of LAC, Bourkou, Ennedi, Tibesti, Salamat, Batha East, Batha
West and Biltine had the lowest ratio of girls to boys, they were targeted to receive
interventions to stimulate girls' demand for education. These underserved provinces



                                             20
received the largest share of resources through construction of new classrooms, wells,
and latrines blocks. Under the project, progress has been made in some of the targeted
rural areas. The GER however appears to have decreased in Bourkou and Ennedi; this
could be due to the use of different population projections given the new census in 2009,
and improvements in data reliability. The girl-to-boy ratios have increased in most
targeted areas but have remained however below target in LAC and Salamat.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
3.5.2. Three key institutional changes were pursued under the project: (i) creation of the
CNC to develop national capacity in curriculum planning and implementation; (ii)
adoption of a strategy to support community initiatives; and (iii) develop a
comprehensive strategy to train and support CTs. For the first time since the country’s
independence in 1960, a CNC is in place with staff trained in all relevant aspects of
curriculum. Under the project, the CNC was built and equipped, and has developed and
conducted a pilot using of the country new curriculum and textbooks. In addition, a
national strategy on community initiatives has been adopted and has allowed the
development of an institutional framework for the state-local community relationship
using a national civil society organization (FENAPET) as its chief agent. FENAPET
supported by the APICED for channeling resources to the APEs was a deliberate choice
based on a management capacity analysis of MEN structures and is intended to speed up
payments and improve transparency. If FENAPET proved to be relevant in implementing
the national framework, in particular in supporting communities for school construction
and management, the work of APICED remained questionable in terms of promoting
transparency. Finally, the Government developed a strategy and a curriculum for training
CTs and providing funds to support communities in paying their stipends. Between 2005
and 2011, the Government transferred CFA 20 billion for the payment of CTs. CTs were
strengthened although their overall qualification level is still an issue.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
3.5.3. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a positive unintended outcome of the project’s
focus on underserved communities in the eight targeted regions is that schools are better
equipped to accommodate girls’ education. Schools with wells attract more students and
their parents with the opportunity to have clean water. In addition, parents, teachers, and
students interviewed reported that without the specific support to girls provided by the
project, many of the girls would not have achieved the level of schooling they have
achieved. This provides favorable expectations for the future given the Government’s
continuing efforts to support community schools, girls’ education, and APEs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not Applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: substantial
4.1 The risks identified during project preparation were generally appropriate: three were
rated substantial, two modest, and two negligible, thus overall risks was rated moderate.



                                            21
However, two risks, in retrospect, could have been rated differently. The modest rating
for political stability and good governance, and the substantial rating for procurement
capacity should have been rated both as high. The country’s recurrent political instability
and the forthcoming oil revenues should have led to greater concerns. Given the low
capacity and the limited good governance, procurement capacity and processes should
have been assessed more critically, and given a rating of high. In addition, inflation due
to oil revenues negatively impacted the project costing, which was not assessed as a risk.
4.2. Despite improvement in several aspects of the sector management at project closing
(DAPRO is producing sector data to allow better informed policy decision, CNC is fully
operational with trained staffs, FENAPET is in place and providing the needed support
for community development), there are still risks associated with governance and
political instability. Institutional capacity-building which occurred during project
implementation is likely to reduce the impact of risks on the overall sustainability of
gains.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.1.1. The project was relevant to the education needs of the country, and was prepared in
a timely and participatory manner. Additionally, it was innovative in directly attacking
community involvement in the management of education, setting up a system to transfer
resources to schools for CTs payment, and supporting the development of national
capacity in curriculum development. The project was also well aligned with the ESP,
PRSP, and CAS and preparatory studies were undertaken to support project design.
However, and importantly, the initial Project design was overly ambitious and would
have benefited from a results framework that was more closely aligned with the PDO and
targeted interventions. Additionally, design deficiencies and the lack of funding of some
key sub-components led to significant implementation delays and monitoring problems
which led to a restructuring of the project in 2010. During that restructuring, the Bank
addressed the overly ambitious nature of the Project by reducing the scope of the
interventions and revising the complex results framework. However, restructuring
happened too late in the project implementation and the lack of a robust M&E scheme for
sector monitoring – a design issue – remained a problem throughout project
implementation.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
5.1.2. The Bank conducted over 20 supervision missions during project implementation
and the aide-memoires and back to office reports on the bottlenecks faced by project
implementation, including procurement issues and delays in key activities were detailed.
The supervision team composition was also generally comprehensive, including the
required technical and fiduciary specialists. The closing date was extended two times and



                                            22
a reallocation was made to transfer more funds to school infrastructure (classrooms, wells,
and latrines) in order to ensure an improved learning environment for children.
5.1.3. In the 2007 MTR the Bank had already recognized that there was a need to
restructure the Project, narrow the scope of the interventions and link more closely the
results framework with project investments. The restructuring was greatly facilitated by
the relocation of the project TTL on the ground in 2009 and 2010. After restructuring,
project implementation support became even more proactive which helped reverse the
PDO achievement rating to moderately satisfactory. Monthly audio-video meetings took
place between the project team and the MEN including the PIU team.
5.1.4. At the same time, the Project had four TTLs and no key team member remained
throughout project preparation and implementation. Additionally, the Bank team could
have been more proactive in conducting project restructuring which was agreed on during
the 2007 MTR (although political economy issues, with the rebel invasion in 2008,
provide partial justification for this delay). Before the restructuring and after the MTR,
the supervision team monitored a results framework which had not been formally agreed
(and was only formally revised during restructuring), making project monitoring
cumbersome. Finally, the ICR team believes that project implementation may have
suffered from limited direct supervision on the ground (field trips to targeted regions),
admittedly made difficult by factors out of the control of the supervision team (security
issues). On the other hand, the relocation of the project TTL in Chad was greatly
instrumental to the successful restructuring of the project. Overall, on the basis of the
several positive but also some of the less positive elements highlighted above, the quality
of supervision on the Bank side is considered to be moderately satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.1.5. The Bank designed an original and relevant operation with a participatory approach.
It brought in appropriate technical expertise as needed in areas where it had a
comparative advantage. However, the risk assessment during appraisal underestimated
the country’s recurrent political instability and its possible impact on project
implementation. In addition, the absence of a long-term government strategy to address
key issues in relation to the achievement of MDGs limited the Government’s engagement
in putting in place an evolving process that could lead to more sustainable education
sector reform. Furthermore, frequent changes in key staff, an overly ambitious project
design, inadequate results framework, and delays in restructuring the project negatively
impacted the achievement of the PDO.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.2.1. The Government was actively involved in the preparation of the project, including
the support to community participation in education. Its 2000 ESP also provided a
strategic framework for its education sector.



                                            23
5.2.2. However, implementation of the government strategy and the project activities
were affected by instability in the country. Beyond the effects of many exogenous shocks,
effective project implementation was also made more difficult as a result of the frequent
changes in ministers, including all the associated policy and staff. In addition, long and
complicated national procurement processes and flawed procurement decisions delayed
project implementation substantially. The Government was also not able to timely
provide the agreed counterpart funding for the project. The changes and the delayed
national contribution to the project budget brought into question the Government’s
commitment to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy aimed at providing
social services to the needed communities.
5.2.3. While the vast majority of the project’s activities were completed by project
closing, indicating the Government’s renewed commitment, overall performance of the
Government is considered to be moderately unsatisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
5.2.4. An effort was made to keep the PIU adequately staffed in spite of the many internal
and external shocks and the unit remained committed to the project’s objectives until the
Project’s end and were, therefore, highly instrumental in project achievements by project
closing. The PIU was also duly involved in the preparation of the supervision missions
where it would always participate actively.
5.2.5. However, the PIU experienced shifts in staff including, in particular, a change in
the project coordinator as the project’s first coordinator was revoked on the basis of
alleged corruption. And the project implementation suffered from several capacity
constraints at the PIU level, including in undertaking procurement processes and M&E at
all levels. The PIU complied with the requirements to submit both IFRs and FMRs, and
all project audits were certified. This mixed record calls for a moderately satisfactory
rating.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.2.6. Based on the Government’s performance and its impact on implementation, as well
as on capacity constraints and staff turnover in the implementing agency, the overall
performance of the Borrower is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
Lesson 1: Project design needs to be made consistent with implementation capacity
constraints and national context. A complex operation takes time to prepare, own and
implement and cannot be undertaken in an unsecure context particularly when there is
limited institutional capacity. The Chad ESRP proved to be challenging to design and
implement, thus limiting the scope of the proposed activities. Soon after effectiveness,
the country experienced insecurity and instability slowing down implementation of
activities, and limiting donors’ contributions to fill the funding gap estimated at appraisal.
A project design with fewer and more focused components would have been more



                                             24
appropriate to the volatile insecure country context and the limited implementation
capacity in Chad.
Lesson 2: The project results framework should be explicitly linked to project
interventions and funding. The Chad ESRP original results framework was weak with
only one PDO indicator out of seven specific to the project intervention (the other six
were meant to measure increases on a national scale) and the intermediate outcome
indicators included some measures of activities that were not funded by the Project.
Overall, this resulted in the adoption of indicators which were not well-aligned with
project components, hindering the Bank and the Government’s ability to effectively
measure progress of the Project.
Lesson 3: Building and sustaining national capacity requires an efficient and timely
capacity building plan and a close monitoring of its implementation. Improving
capacity requires training on a continuous basis and a strong TA sub-component. The
ESRP provided sound TA and training to the CNC technical staff which was supported
over an extended period of time. This increased the impact of the training and has had a
lasting influence on improved capacity. The challenge being faced now is limiting staff
turn-over and renewal of staff contracts to ensure continuity and sustainability.
Lesson 4: Project design flaws need to be addressed at an early stage through a
restructuring to enhance project implementation and attainment of PDOs. Although
design problems were identified earlier and discussed extensively with the Government,
it was only two years after the MTR that restructuring was finalized when 74 percent of
the funds were already disbursed. Project restructuring might have been undertaken
earlier which would have provided a greater opportunity to achieve better outcomes.
Lesson 5: Recurrent changes in key stakeholders during project implementation
jeopardize implementation of activities and delays achievement of project outcomes.
The project experienced many changes from both sides in terms of project management;
from beginning to project closing, twelve ministers and two project coordinators
monitored the project and there were four TTLs. All of the project key staff changed
during the project’s life time. These frequent changes had a negative impact on policy
dialogue and implementation. It is crucial to ensure continuity of key technical staff to
manage a project.
Lesson 6: SILs have limitations in supporting policy reforms. Given the lack of long-
term vision, capacity for policy development and implementation, and coordination
among donors, other financing instruments were not selected to implement the Chad
ESRP. There was a need for policy initiatives that could have supported implementation
of various reform efforts, such as further support to community actions and the upgrading
of CTs. These measures and related activities, however, were dropped because of the
nature of the financing instrument. As a result progress on the policy side remained
limited confirming some of the limitations of SILs to support reforms to policy.

                                Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: Improving Access and Equity (US$50.42 million of which IDA
Grant: US $16.59 million), which was revised to Component 1: Improving access
and equity to education (US$7.4 million)
The objective of this component was to increase the access to and equity of education.
This was to be achieved through the following: (i) establishment of a sustainable strategy
for the expansion of primary school enrollment by targeting community initiatives, girls'
education, and participation of children living in under-served regions, including nomadic
children; and (ii) improvements in the teaching and learning environment of community
schools, through the provision of cost-effective, furnished classrooms to create favorable
learning conditions. By the 2007 MTR the Bank and the Government realized that this
component was overly ambitious and that the implementation process was more
challenging than originally anticipated, and they agreed on revision of both activities and
targets. Moreover, project activities were suspended twice from September to November
2005 due to the suspension of the project coordinator, and from January to May 2006 due
to Bank operations suspension in the country. In addition, the country was experiencing
difficulties due to the civil war which limited implementation of activities in some
regions of the country affected by the conflict. The table below presents component 1 and
revisions that were made.

                                           secondary education              piloted.


The revised Component 1 objectives focused on increasing access to primary education
and to reduce gender and regional disparities by increasing the capacity of existing
primary education schools and promoting enrollment of girls and children in vulnerable
areas.
Implementation of planned activities would: (a) increase Grade 1 (CP1) admission rate
from 82% in 1999/2000 to 90% in 2005/2006 (for girls from 70% to 85%); (b) improve
survival rate in Grade 6 from 35% in 1999/00 to 65% in 2005/06 for girls and from 53%
to 75% for boys.


                                                   29
The overall performance of this component is rated moderately satisfactory: Before
restructuring, implementation of activities under Component 1 was moderately
unsatisfactory and moderately satisfactory after restructuring. Although admission rate in
Grade a reached 120% in 2010 (108 % for girls), primary survival rate improved only
marginally over time to reach 36% in 2010-2011 (while it was 35% in 2000) with a rate
of 33% for girls.
The following activities were planned:
Original Sub-component 1.1 (Total US$ 18.11 million, IDA Grant US$ 3.40 million)-
Support to community initiatives: this sub-component was part of the initial project
design and was not supported under the restructured project. Its activities consisted of:
(a)    Establishment of a national agency for subsidizing community initiatives
(APICED): The agency was set-up since 2002 (Law No 23/PR/2002 of December 21,
2002), and is fully operational. It served to channel subsidies paid by the government to
community teachers directly using NGOs to channel funds from the center to
communities. It was agreed to sign contracts between APICED and communities through
which funds will be transferred. However, the Government decided that a contract
between the community and teachers would be sufficient to pay the subsidies using eight
NGOs for transferring funds and paying directly CTs. This mechanism was used until
2009, and later funds were being paid by the Government through APICED with support
of a commission composed of representatives from the Ministry of Education, the
Ministry of Finance, teachers unions, and APEs. From 2004 and 2011, CFA 30 billion
were transferred through APICED for the payment of CTs. For 2012, APICED is
channeling subsidies to 13,630 CTs.

(b)     Sensitization campaigns: it was planned to develop information campaigns to
reach the country's 6,500 APEs by 2005 (up from 4,000 in 2002) on how the Project
works and how they can benefit from planned activities. The FENAPET (Federation
Nationale des Parents d’élèves du Tchad) with support from the project implemented all
planned activities between 2004 and 2010 using different media and by conducting
workshops around the country. At project restructuring, FENAPET had implemented
successfully all planned activities. In total, 6,200 APEs around the country were
sensitized. FENAPET also provided support to 74 communities to build 74 classrooms in
existing schools.

(c)     APE training: It was envisaged that during the first four years of Phase one
approximately 3,000 APEs would have signed an agreement with the APICED to receive
training in organization, management, fundraising, project development, and networking
in order to better support primary schools and CTs in self-assessment. At the time of
restructuring date, 3,420 APEs had been trained by GIZ, and a network of 1,250 APEs
was established and is functional.
Revised Sub-component 1.2: Support to secondary education through the establishment
of computer centers, sciences laboratories and libraries in three targeted new public
senior secondary schools recently built by the Government. This activity has been
partially achieved. Studies for computer centers management, laboratories, and libraries
have been completed, but laboratory equipment and books have not been acquired.


                                           30
Original Sub-component 1.2 (Total US$ 1.76 million, IDA Grant US$ 1.62 million):
Promotion of Girls' Schooling, which was revised to Sub-component 1.3: Support girls’
enrollment. Initial planned activities included:
(a)    Sensitization campaigns (TA and training). Activities under this sub-component
included reaching at least 1,200 new communities through community level meetings as
well as radio and TV broadcasts in French, Arabic and other local languages. It was
expected that implementation of activities would increase girls’ Grade 1 GER from
69.5% to 90% by 2005. The planned activities were satisfactory implemented with GIZ
support. During project lifetime, girls’ GER in Grade 1 of primary increased from 91%
in 2004 to 108.0 in 2011, showing good results.

(b)     Increasing the number of female teachers in rural areas (TA): Under this sub-
component, a study was envisaged to: (a) estimate the number of women and girls that
can be trained as teachers; and (b) analyze the conditions that will allow the training and
the employment of the potential female teachers. Following the study, a hiring and
training plan would be developed in the second year of the Project and implemented in
the third and fourth years. Although the study was not conducted, results from the
education sector data show that the number of female teachers is very low (15.4% of total
number of teachers in 2010).

(c)     Setting up a tutoring program (grant scheme). The tutoring initiative, focusing on
children at risk of failing, was planned in its first year to be implemented in 50 primary
schools in grades CE2, CMI and CM2 where repetition and dropouts are high. The
tutoring was to be extended to 50 new schools every year, totaling 200 schools and
12,000 students over the first four years of the Project. The focus would be on math and
language, and schools with higher rates of repetition could be specifically targeted with
tutoring throughout the school year. A high-achieving student (student tutor) would assist
a low-achieving student during specifically designated moments in the weekly schedule.
The teacher was to serve as facilitator and community members were to help in the
supervision and monitoring. The successful implementation of the tutoring required close
collaboration between the school, the parents and the students. Teachers, APEs, including
female members as well as student tutors, were to all receive training. A tutoring program
was developed and implemented in 264 schools totaling more than 8,367 female students
throughout the project. Despite successful implementation activities, it has limited impact
on girls’ repetition and drop-out.

(d)     Involving and supporting mothers in APEs (Grant scheme). Through the GIZ
contract, APEs were reinforced with female members to support the tutoring program.
Members of the APEs benefited from literacy courses and training in the management of
activities aiming to support their schools.

(e)     Setting up Girls' Secondary Education Incentive Scheme (grant scheme). An
incentive system for girls was developed and has been operational since 2005 covering
all regions. The system targets females interested in science, and provides an annual prize
to 60 girls who successfully pass the BEPC or Baccalaureate with high marks in science.



                                            31
Project support provided prizes to 3,226 girls (26 at Baccalaureate level, 1,983 at the end
of lower secondary, and 1,217 at the end of primary).

(f)    Developing and integrating gender sensitization modules in pre- and in-service
teacher-training modules (TA and training). Since 2010, all teachers training programs
have gender modules integrated in their curricula.
Due to project achievements at the MTR, it was agreed to continue these activities
through a revised sub-component which would continue activities in 264 public primary
schools in targeted zones, including payment of teachers' overtime for girls' tutoring and
for Girls' Education Grants. At project completion all activities had been fully
implemented.
Original Sub-component 1.3 (Total US$ 30.55 million, IDA Grant US$ 11.57 million):
Classroom, wells and latrine construction, maintenance and acquisition of school
furniture and equipment, which was Revised to Sub-component 1.1: Education
infrastructure.
Initial planned activities included the following: 1,000 classrooms, 1,000 latrine blocks,
and 200 wells to be built in existing schools. At restructuring in 2010, the project had
achieved construction and equipment of 400 classrooms, 400 latrines blocks, and 113
wells. Based on the achievements under this sub-component, it was agreed to drop
construction of the remaining classrooms by setting 400 classrooms as the new target to
be achieved under project financing, and have additional 65 blocks of latrines to be built
through transfer to communities, and 112 wells to be built in existing schools totaling 255
wells, as well as equipment for 148 classrooms in targeted zones and more than 500
classrooms around the country.
As of project closing, the following was achieved: 400 new primary classrooms, 465
blocks of latrines, 255 wells, equipment of three secondary schools, and equipment of
400 classrooms.
Original Component 2- Improving Quality and Efficiency (US$47.17 million of
which IDA Financing US$ 14.36 million):
The objective of this component was to improve the quality and the internal efficiency of
primary and general secondary education by improving curricula for training and
teaching in basic education, the availability and quality of pedagogical and didactic
materials, and introducing innovative programs to increase access to learning and overall
learning achievement through schooling. Additionally, the objective of the new programs
was to test, evaluate and expand successful initiatives in ECD, language/reading
development, distance education/IRI, and school health and nutrition education. At MTR
in 2007, the Government and the Bank agreed on restructuring this component for
simplification of the overall project design and for more realistic indicators and targets.
The component was dropped because many of the activities could not be implemented
(i.e. ECD, IRI) due to funds unavailability. Activities that were under implementation
were either incorporated into new simplified sub-components (i.e., curriculum design), or
stopped and the achievements as of project restructuring considered as the end of project
targets. The table which follows presents the original and restructured sub-components.

The overall performance of this component is moderately unsatisfactory. Prior to
restructuring, implementation of activities under Component 2 was unsatisfactory and the
component was dropped at restructuring. However, activities related to curriculum testing
and learning assessment were incorporated to the revised Component 2, and the
curriculum development and the pilot were implemented by project closing.
The following activities were to be implemented:
Sub-component 2.1-Curriculum Renovation for Basic Education (Total US$ 1.76
million, IDA Credit US$ 1.48 million): The objective of this sub-component was the
development of a national core curriculum for elementary and lower secondary education
that was child-centered, promotes cultural diversity and understanding, and furthers
knowledge and skill levels which reflect established learning objectives and universal
standards. Successful implementation of the curriculum renewal program, including
testing and evaluating innovative programs, such as mother tongue instruction in the
early grades, would gradually improve teaching and learning, develop an effective
bilingual/ multilingual education model, and lead to a comprehensive curriculum policy.
Such policy would, in the medium and long term, improve the overall quality and internal
efficiency of primary and general secondary education in Chad. By the end of the project,
core curricula for first, second and seventh grades would be developed and published. To


                                              33
facilitate a coherent and effective approach to quality improvements in education, a new
permanent and autonomous institution to be created under the Project, the CNC was to
integrate related functions of curriculum development for student and teacher education
and training, learning assessment and research, support materials/textbook development,
and lead implementation of pedagogic activities. Under this sub-component, the
following activities were undertaken:
(a)     Training of technical staff at the CNC: all relevant technical staff of the CNC
were trained in various aspects of curriculum design, implementation, and M&E through
study tours, seminars, workshops, and structured training courses. By project
restructuring 10 staff were trained at MA level in curriculum related fields, and by project
closing, this activity had been completed successfully.
(b)     Establishing and publishing a curriculum development framework supported by
relevant studies, including a feasibility study to implement bilingual education in Chad,
research on key curriculum and language issues and successful classroom experiences in
Chad and elsewhere, as well as building a national consensus on curriculum reform
objectives. By project restructuring, planned studies had been conducted (6 in total see
Annex 9) including the feasibility study on bilingual education in Chad. The national
framework for curriculum development was designed, discussed, and adopted nationally.
(c)    Developing and testing by grade level new curricula (objectives, content, methods,
teaching materials including the gender dimension and other inter-sector questions) in
basic education. At project restructuring, finalization of curriculum for all grades of
primary education was about to be completed. The Government and the Bank agreed to
continue to support this activity but limit the testing to grades 1 to 4 (CP1 and 2) in 30
schools (under the revised component 2-sub-component 2.1). At project completion,
curriculum for all six grades of primary education as well as textbooks had been
completed and tested in 10 schools.
(d)     Classroom-based research and evaluation of specific curriculum innovations,
trial curriculum materials, and teacher practices in the classroom. Following CNC staff
training, limited researches were conducted by some of the staff on CTs performance and
how to improve their teaching practices. Findings and other educational issues were also
analyzed and published twice a year in the Chad National Review of Education (created
in 2009) with support from the national budget. In addition, more than 20 studies were
conducted on various aspects of the education system.
(e)     Nationwide discussion of the results of the evaluation, consensus-building, and
the decision-making process for nationwide implementation. This activity will follow the
pilot which was just completed. The activity was dropped under restructuring of project
due to time constraints to pilot and hold discussion before project closing.
(f)     Printing and distributing a new first, second and seventh grade curricula to all
schools for application in 2006-2007. The new curriculum were to be tested in seven
ENIs (of which three are bilingual) and 31 schools (satellites, urban, rural, and
demonstration schools): Faya (3), Mongo (3), N'Djamena (5), Abeche (5), Bongor (5),
Sahr (5), and Moundou (5) as well as in seven secondary schools. This activity was found
to be overambitious and was, therefore, dropped at restructuring.

Original Sub component 2.2 Support for the development and management of
textbooks, pedagogic and didactic materials (Total US$ 9.27 million, IDA Grant
US$ 5.25 million).
The objective of this sub-component was to improve children's learning opportunities by
providing textbooks and reading materials to schools, as well as didactic guides to
teachers and school management committees, in sufficient number and of adequate
content and pedagogic quality. Successful implementation of the project would mean:
each child had access to one reading and one math book (French and Arabic) in all
grades; all teachers and school committees were using the new guide books for each
grade and subject; and new manuscripts for CP1 mathematics and reading (2.French, 2
Arabic,) and four teachers' guides, were ready to be published. The following activities
were planned under this sub-component:
(a)      Acquisition of existing textbooks and distribution to schools: (i) 2.93 million
textbooks (reading, math, science for Grades 1 – 6); (ii) 500,000 children's literature
books in French, Arabic and national languages (approximately 120 books per school in
4,000 schools), including the schools experimenting with the use of national languages;
(iii) slightly more than 300,000 textbooks for junior high school (Grades 7 - 9) in math,
French, Biology and Physics and 4,500 teacher's guides; and (iv) a collection of reference
books including approximately 4,000 dictionaries in French or Arabic and teaching
materials for elementary schools distributed in metallic containers. At restructuring and
project closing, a total of 3.7 million textbooks and other materials had been purchased,
adapted, and distributed to schools around the country in 2004/2005.

(b)      Development of new teachers' guides, textbooks and support materials: (i) TA for
the DEL (Departement de l'Edition du Livre at the CNC) and the textbook editorial
commissions in textbook development, management and monitoring of editorial activities
(i.e. technical specifications of pedagogic materials, quality standards for approbation,
experimentation of manuscripts, and evaluation of new textbooks in the designated
languages of instruction); (ii) development of 16 new teachers' guides to improve the
pedagogic use of existing books for Grades 1 through 6 (both French and Arabic); and
(iii) development of four new manuscripts for reading and math books in French and
Arabic, grade one, and teachers' guides. This will be in line with the language of
instruction policy, to be adopted, and new curricula for students and teachers expected to
be available for Grade I at the end of Phase one. At project closing, activities related to
revision of existing textbooks were implemented with the development and distribution
of teachers’ guides. Manuscripts in line with the new curricula were to be developed and
tested.

(c)     Strengthening the management, distribution and use of textbooks: Establishment
of a textbook management unit (Unite de gestion du livre - UGL) at the MEN/DG. The
UGL is responsible for managing the entire textbook chain, from ordering new textbooks
to acquiring existing textbooks and ensuring their distribution to schools. It will do this in
conjunction with the CNC/DL, CNSALS (Commission Nationale de Sélection et
d'approbation du livre scolaire), DAPRO and the schools. Technical assistance and
training will be provided to the UGL, to address cost and quality issues in textbook
provision, strategic planning and distribution to schools, availability of books in the


                                             35
classroom, conditions and risks for national textbook production, and parents'
information/education in the use and maintenance of textbooks. The UGL was
established and benefited from training and technical support, which helped the
development of a textbook management guide and its distribution in 20,000 copies to
teachers and school directors.
Original sub-component 2.3 Learning assessment and research (Total US$0.68 million,
IDA Credit US$0.49 million)
The objective of this sub-component was to develop and implement adequate and
effective approaches to learning assessment and to monitor the quality of schooling
outcomes. Successful implementation of the project would include the further
development of diagnostic assessment tools and teachers trained in their everyday use in
the classroom, and the application of standardized tests in experimental and control
schools. Activities planned under this sub-component were dropped after restructuring
because only one out of five activities had been completed. Initially planned activities
included:
(a)     Training of the technical staff at the CNC: technical staff at the CNC were
trained.

(b)    Development and experimentation of diagnostic learning assessment tools in line
with the new elementary education curriculum. The new curriculum was not developed
and the activity was part of the piloting which ended in June 2012.

(c)   Training teachers in formative and summative assessment methods: Not
completed and dropped.

(d)    Development and application of standardized tests in CP mathematics, French
and Arabic, as well as in national languages in experimental schools. Not completed and
dropped.

(e)   A feasibility study to reform the overall examination system. Not completed and
dropped.
Original Sub-component 2.4: Teacher Training (Total costs US$ 25.72 million, IDA
Credit US$ 4.69 million) which was revised to Sub-component 1.4: Teachers training.
By the end of the project, the sub-component was to have ensured: (a) in-service Level 1
training for 8,000 CTs in the CFCs, of which 2,400 will have completed Level 2
certification by the end of the project; (b) in-service training in the ENIs for 2,400 CTs at
Level 2 (which corresponds to the basic teacher training program offered by the ENIs in
their regular program) of which more than 1,000 will be certified at Level 2 by the end of
the project; (c) pre-service training for 6,400 teachers in the ENIs (1,600) per year, and
(d) pre-service training for 500 teachers in the ISESCO training center. If these objectives
are reached, the percentage of teachers having reached Level 1 certification will increase
from 47% to 61% between the beginning and the end of the project (4 years) whereas the
percentage of teachers with Level 2 certification will rise from 40% to 43%.




                                             36
While assessing progress during the MTR, already 10,000 CTs had been trained for Level
1 certification and curriculum for teachers training had been developed. The Bank and the
Government agreed to have an additional 1,500 CTs trained for Level 1 and 1,700 CTs
trained for Level 2. At project closing a total of 11,500 CTs were trained for Level 1 and
1,700 certified for Level 2. In addition, 1,500 malettes pedagogiques were distributed to
CTs. The following activities were planned at project appraisal:
(a)     Strengthening the institutional capacity: This included: (i) improving the
relevancy of pre-service and in-service teacher training programs so that new teachers
coming out of the ENI will be well-prepared for the current working environment and
that the CTs will adapt and adopt teaching practice and theory along the lines of what is
being taught in the ENI; (ii) creating regional training networks emanating from the ENI
to the CFC, SAP and EEB; (iii) reinforcing these regional networks by setting up centers
for documentation and pedagogical information; and (iv) establishing connectivity
between these regional networks and establishing links with international training centers.
(b)    In-service Training of CTs: (i) in-service Level 1 training in the CFC and SAP
(approximately 2,000 per year) in three sessions in accordance with the newly revised
program, and (ii) Level 2 in-service training (approximately 3,400 teachers over four
years) provided in the 7 ENI during school vacations over a period of two years in
accordance with a new program and revised pedagogical strategies.
(c)      In-service training: (i) in-service training of a cohort of teachers (about 93 in the
7 ENI) for experimenting the new curriculum; (ii) in-service training of all CP teachers,
school directors, pedagogic counselors and inspectors in line with new curriculum,
pedagogic approaches and materials; and (iii) TA for a study to determine the most
appropriate in-service training model and pedagogic support to teachers (dispositif de
suivi et d'encadrement pedagogique).
(d)     Curriculum development for teacher education (CNC): (i) technical assistance for
developing a coherent pre- and in-service teacher education curriculum at the ENI and
CFC, as well as for instructors /teacher trainers at the ENI and ISSED; (ii) training of
technical staff in curriculum development, including classroom-based research, primarily
concerned with developing the reflective practitioner in the classroom, and gender
modules to promote gender awareness in the classroom; and (iii) development of all
training modules and materials for the training activities listed above.
(e)    Pre-service Teacher Training: The ENI will continue to provide pre-service
teacher training to 1,600 student-teachers per year, recruiting from among the pool of
high school graduates and offering a one-year training program.
Original Component 2.5: ECD Program (Total US$ 3.70 million, IDA financing
US$ 0.00 million)
The objective of this component was to develop, using 30 existing community structures
(CECR/U) and creating 30 new ECD Centers (Centres de Developpement de la Petite
Enfance), an integrated pilot intervention in early childhood and parental education, to
support cognitive, emotional, physical and social development of young children.
Initially, the ECD program was to be launched in 8 prefectures (Guera, Batha, Kanem,
Tandjile, N'Djamena, Kabia, Biltine, Barh-Ko), and 12,000 young children were to be



                                             37
beneficiaries during the four years of piloting. The results of the intervention were to be
useful as a model for nationwide application. This sub-component did not benefit from
the project funds and did not receive any other support, thus it was dropped at
restructuring. At appraisal, the following activities were planned:
(a)     Parental education strategy in 60 ECD community centers: APEs were to be
 trained to manage each ECD community center. They were to be responsible for: (a)
 mobilizing their communities for creating 30 new ECD community centers and
 rehabilitating 30 CECRIU; (b) ensuring proper maintenance of sanitation facilities. The
 60 ECD community centers were to be equipped with 120 latrines and 60 water delivery
 points; and (c) 6,000 families were to be trained in health, hygiene and nutrition
 education through 96 radio broadcasts and distribution of 500 educational guides; (d)
 240 stocks of pedagogical materials, toys, essential medicines and kitchen equipment
 kits were to be distributed in 60 ECD community centers to facilitate the implementation
 of the integrated ECD approach (health, nutritional and pedagogical activities).

(b)     Training and recycling program for the actors involved in the ECD
 subcomponent: Activities included: (a) TA for a review and adaptation of the
 pedagogical program existing in the CECRIU and validation in the 60 ECD pilot
 community centers, (b) development and implementation of a national language-friendly
 training program for 120 community monitors in pedagogical activities; (c)
 development, publication and distribution of 2,000 pedagogical workbooks and guides
 for the ECD monitors; and (d) development and implementation of a training program
 for 40 local supervisors in the ECD community-based approach.


(c)     Capacity building in ECD program management for the three relevant sectors
 (education, social protection and health): an inter-sector commission for the preparation
 of ECD component was to be created and integrated by the three relevant ministries and
 UNICEF. This commission was to be strengthened during the implementation and
 evaluation of the pilot. Each ministry was to have a specific responsibility in the
 implementation. A project coordinator was to be responsible for managing the inter-
 sector commission's meetings and ensuring follow-up on actions taken. The main
 activities were: (a) a participatory management and leadership training for the inter-
 sector team; and (b) study tours in other Africa countries, to exchange and learn about
 achievements of others programs, for the ECD coordinators in each participating
 ministry. ECD coordinators were to be freed of other responsibilities in their respective
 ministries during the project implementation period.


(d)     Follow-up and evaluation of the piloting: Because this is a new experience in the
 country continuous follow up and an evaluation of the strategy was planned. Activities
 included: (a) grade of children's development measured. (b) community's participation
 tested; (c) community monitors' activities evaluated; (d) follow up of the utilization of
 pedagogical programs, materials, training programs, emissions of radio, etc. (e)
 sustainability of the program identified; and (f) mechanisms to articulate the ECD




                                            38
community-based programs with the school's activities identified, to guaranteed the
preparation of young children to achieve schooling.
Original sub-component 2.6-National Languages Reading Development Program
(ELN) (Total US$ 1.22 million, IDA Credit US$ 1.07 million)
This subcomponent aimed to assist in the development of a bilingual pedagogy with
initial mother tongue instruction to facilitate communication between children and
teachers. Such an approach aimed to encourage active participation of children in the
learning process, in particular in learning to express oneself verbally, reading and writing,
thereby facilitating the transition to the 2nd or 3rd language of instruction (French or
Arabic). Successful implementation of the sub-component was to result in 90% of the
experimental school students repeating less often and in developing higher aptitude in
reading and writing in the 2nd and 3rd grades, and the CNC will integrate the bilingual
pedagogical model tested in the curriculum revision and textbook development processes.
Activities under this sub-component were successfully implemented by GIZ in 130
schools around the country and pedagogical materials were distributed to students. An
evaluation was carried which proposed an action plan for scaling-up the pilot. The
following activities were to be carried out:
(a)     Pedagogical materials and support to existing schools: (i) in-service training for
teachers of all grades (60 schools); (ii) development and distribution of pedagogical
materials and teacher's guides to teachers; (iii) distribution of textbooks and reading
books in 5 national languages; and (iv) continuous monitoring and assessment of results
of the implementation of the teaching programs and of learning outcomes by SES and
DEB (Division de l 'enseignement de base) in collaboration with DAPLAN.
(b)      Extension of mother tongue instruction/national languages: (i) TA for studies and
for setting up a rigorous M&E system; (ii) in-service training for 1,300 teachers (Grades
1 and 2) in130 number of schools, including didactic materials/teachers' guides in
selected languages; and (iii) acquisition and distribution of textbooks and reading
materials in national languages, French and Arabic for participating experimental schools.
Original sub-component 2.7-IRI Program (Total US$ 3.28 million, IDA financing
US$ 0.00 million)
The objective of this sub-component was to enhance the quality of primary education and
to increase enrollment through the development and launching of a multi-channel
learning program with IRI at its center. The low quality of instruction, especially in rural
"community schools," was a significant obstacle to improving education system
efficiency. IRI and other multi-channel strategies represent a relatively inexpensive tool
for improving the quality of teaching and system efficiency. During Phase one, multi-
channel learning strategies will be developed and implemented for the CP and CE sub-
cycles. Approximately 960 teachers, 120 school directors and 12,000 students in the CP
and CE sub-cycles will have received the radio broadcasts and accompanying
instructional materials by the end of the four year experimental phase.
Planned activities at appraisal included: IRI broadcasts, IRI workbooks and teacher's
guides, Teacher-training program, and Evaluation. However, no activity was




                                             39
implemented because of lack of resources, and the sub-component was dropped at
restructuring.
Original Sub-component 2.8: School Health and Nutrition Program (Total US$ 1.53
million; IDA Grant US$ 1.38million), which was revised to Sub-component 1.5:
Support to school health and nutrition.
The objective of this component was to enhance students' learning and educational
achievement through improved health and nutrition status of the children. If the sub-
component were successfully implemented, a 50 % reduction in the prevalence of
parasitic infection and micro-nutrient deficiencies was expected in the intervention area.
Additionally 10 % of the existing schools were to have appropriate and adequate
sanitation and 15% of current teachers were to be trained to provide health education.
These improvements were expected to contribute to the lowering of the rate of dropout
and the rate of repetition. The School Health, Hygiene and Nutrition program was to be
launched initially in 15 Departements with the expectation of full country wide coverage
during subsequent phases.
The MTR found that: (i) a school health policy was developed and disseminated country
wide, (ii) 180 latrines blocs and 180 wells were built in existing schools and communities
were trained to maintain infrastructures, (iii) teachers’ manual and tools were developed
and distributed to schools around the country following teachers training workshops, and
(iv) De-worming and micronutrients were distributed twice a year for 150,000 students
across the country. The Bank and the Government agreed to continue distribution of de-
worming and micronutrients to an additional 90,000 students and provide training to 180
teachers on HIV-related topics. At project completion, de-worming and micronutrients
for the 90,000 students had been received and were ready to be distributed at the
beginning of the following (next) school year, and 180 teachers have received planned
training. However, no impact evaluation was conducted to assess progress against the
2000 baseline study.
The activities described below were expected to become integral to all school programs -
public and private::
(a)    Development and dissemination of school health policies: through strategic
communications methods including radio and television which would cover the whole
country, and departmental discussions in all 29 geographic departments;

(b)      Sanitation and water: The infrastructure unit would build 2,200 new latrines blocs
and dig wells for 300 rural schools and extend water pipes to 80 urban schools. These
activities were to be achieved in four years covering 10% of the existing schools in 15
Departements. To ensure proper maintenance of these facilities, the school health
component was to create a cadre of local trainers to train approximately 990 APE
members (three for each school) who were also members of the local school health
committees in the proper care and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities.

(c)    Health, hygiene and nutrition education: Lessons, teachers' manuals and other
teaching tools for health, nutrition and hygiene education using life-skills methods to
cover approximately 1700 schools - 50% of 3400 existing schools in four years – were to


                                            40
be developed. 3,000 teachers and 700 health agents were to be trained by 150 trainers
from MEN and MOH, and approximately 4,200 school health guides were to be
published.

Original Component 3: Literacy and Non-formal Education US$ 7.99 million (IDA
financing: US$ 3.73 million). This component was dropped at project restructuring.
Activities completed were considered as the end of project revised targets. At appraisal,
the objective of the component was to develop a cost-effective, equity-enhancing model
for delivering literacy and practical skills training to out-of-school youth and adults
through private sector providers. At project restructuring, 20,000 adults (of which 60%
were women) were trained in literacy programs, and this achieved target was agreed to be
considered as the end of project revised target and all other activities dropped because
they were not funded. Given that a sound system was in place, the overall performance of
this component is considered moderately satisfactory.

literacy activities was to be provided to 50,000 adults with the priority of women
achieving an acceptable level of functional literacy (which is roughly equivalent to the
level obtained by primary education).

The objective of the original component was to provide the institutional capacity
strengthening necessary for successful program planning, activity management, and
M&E. The component aimed to strengthen specific units within the MEN, such as the
planning directorate, to encourage dynamic cross-cutting interventions and strategic
planning. The component also included the establishment of a permanent institution to be
the locus of a major curriculum renewal effort. Activities were to be implemented
through four sub-components: Sub-component 4.1: Establishment of CNC (Total US$
5.17 million, IDA Credit US$ 2.12 million) which focused on building and equipment of
the CNC office, and recruitment and training of technical staff; Sub-component 4.2:
Strategic Institutional Capacity Building for PARSET - MEN/Communities (Total US$
3.45 million, IDA Credit US$ 2.47 million) focusing on MEN capacity-building for
teacher training, MEN capacity-strengthening activities, and capacity-strengthening


                                                 42
activities for APEs; Sub-component 4.3: Strengthening of MEN planning and monitoring
capacities (Total US$3.22 million, IDA Credit US$1.66 million) to produce timely,
relevant, and reliable data on education; and Sub-component 4.4: Strengthening of the
Analytical Capacity, Policy development, Monitoring and Coordination (Total US$ 1.70
million, IDA Credit US$ 0.87 million).
While assessing progress during the MTR and for project restructuring, the following
activities were conducted: (i) construction and equipment of CNC and recruitment and
training of technical staff; (ii) support to FENAPET to conduct training and sensitization
of APEs, grant for the construction of 74 schools, training of 3,820 CTs, and signing of a
protocol with the Government; (iv) support to DAPRO to produce timely and reliable
education data; and (v) support to the PIU.
During project restructuring, the Bank and the Government agreed on continuing most of
the planned activities under a Revised Component 2: Enhancing institutional capacity
(US$3.8 million) which aimed to strengthen some key capacities in the central Ministry
and at the local levels to manage the education sector and the project. The overall
performance of this component is rated moderately satisfactory.
The revised component will be implemented through the following:
(a)      Subcomponent 2(a): Support to local school committees. School Grants to be
piloted in 150 public primary schools. Capacity of school committees (including APEd)
and school heads to be reinforced to manage the grants; sensitization and information
dissemination campaigns to be carried-out; and Local NGOs to be recruited to train and
assist them. This represented a new activity and included goods and services, consultant,
training and sub-grants.
(b)    Subcomponent 2(b): Support to the National Curriculum Center (CNC) -
Enhancement of the capacity of the CNC to manage and implement the curriculum
reform. The new curriculum for the Classes Preparatoires (first 2 years) and the Classes
Elementaires (next 2 years) was to be piloted in 30 schools. This included training and
workshops, works, equipment, books and furniture for the CNC, TA, printing of new
textbooks, curriculum and teacher guides.
(c)     Subcomponent 2(c): Strengthening of the EMIS and project management. MEN
would develop capacity at all levels for the production of timely Education Statistical
Yearbook and Key Education Indicators. It was to include TA, training/workshops,
provision of goods and equipment. In terms of the project management, the restructured
project was to continue to finance the operating costs, training and TA to the PIU and the
Direction des Projets Education in the MEN.
(d)     Subcomponent 2(d): Developing capacity for sector analysis and policy.
Preparation of the IESP by the MEN will be supported. Assessment of the innovative
approaches undertaken under the original project will be carried out. The restructured
project will cover the costs for technical assistance, goods, workshops, studies and
training/study tours.
At project closing, the following had been undertaken:
     Subcomponent 2a: the study on school grants implementation was carried-out.
However, the grant is not implemented, NGOs are not recruited and APEs not trained;


                                           43
        Subcomponent 2b: support to the CNC continued and curriculum for all levels of
primary (Grade-6) was developed and was being implemented in 10 schools. The pilot
report has been made available at the end of the school year in July.
       Subcomponent 2c: the EMIS was in place and was producing education
information. However, timely production of data as well as its reliability remain concerns.
        Subcomponent 2d: work on the IESP is still in progress. The Ministry of
Education has conducted assessment of innovative approaches developed under the
project, and the list of studies is in Annex 9.
In light of the above, the overall rating of project performance is summarized below:

                      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
At appraisal, a NPV was not calculated for the project nor was an economic rate of return
defined for the investment. However, a cost effectiveness analysis was conducted based
on an analysis of the internal efficiency of the education system, unit costs of
infrastructures, textbooks, and teachers’ salaries. The analysis conducted was based on
the assumption that investments in education are generally justified, because they
increase the productivity of labor and are associated with beneficial social outcomes.

Education financing: Between 1995 and 2000, government education expenditure trends
showed that government resources allocated to education stagnated or even decreased in
real terms. While the budget for educational operations increased at a faster pace than the
State's general budget (with an annual growth of 8.1% for education as against 6.2% for
the State budget), capital expenses set aside for education fell by 12.8%, as compared to
the State's investment expenditure as a whole, which stagnated. Education's share in
overall state expenditure fell from 16.3% in 1995 to 14.5% in 2000. Recurrent
expenditure on education and training rose at a mean annual rate of 14.1% in nominal
terms between 1995 and 2000.

During the project preparation in 2002, before Chad started benefiting from the oil
revenues, its economy was mostly driven by agriculture, and the country GDP per capita
was estimated at US$ 220, which is below the Sub-Saharan Africa average. After 2004,
resources available increased substantially, however the impact on poverty seems to be
limited. In 2008, the country’s GDP per capita had risen to about US$ 755, mainly due to
revenues generated by the oil sector (43 percent of GDP during the 2006-2009), which
represented about 70 percent of total government revenues during this same period.
Within priority sectors, the infrastructure and education sectors have the largest shares of
government revenues, at 13 and 12 percent respectively. However, education budget
execution is low (72.3 percent in 2007). The share of the Government’s budget allocated
to education declined between 2000 and 2010, from 14.5 percent to 12 percent. On a
positive note, education budget execution improved recently (97 percent in 2009)
indicating some efficiency gains.

Education financing was targeted to addressing some of the many issues that seriously
weakens the quality of education delivered in Chad. These obstacles relate to a lack of
human and physical inputs, insufficient educational support, inadequate school
infrastructure and shortage of school furniture, educational materials and textbooks. The
project financing supported interventions in these specific areas.
To assess the cost-effectiveness of the investments undertaken under the project, the
analysis took into account four main elements: (i) the internal efficiency of the education
system; (ii) teachers’ salaries; (iii) the unit costs of classroom construction; and (iv) the
purchase and distribution of textbooks.
Internal efficiency: The project aimed to improve internal efficiency through an
aggressive policy to reduce repetition and drop-out, improve transitions among grades,
training and integration of CTs, and by the State taking over the entire cost of community



                                             45
schools. Overall primary education internal efficiency did not improve between 2000 and
2010 illustrating high levels of wastage in the system.
In 2002 at the time of appraisal, the internal efficiency of primary education was low,
particularly for community schools students and girls.
Out of a cohort of 1,000 students entering the 1st primary school year in 2002:
       -     259 leave school without going beyond the 1st grade (268 in the case of girls);
       -     480 reach the 5th grade (434 in the case of girls).
In 2010, out of a cohort of 1,000 children entering 1st grade of primary:
       -     258 leave school without going beyond the 1st grade (350 in the case of girls
             only);
       -     480 reach the 5th grade (380 in the case of girls).
The diagram below shows the internal efficiency of the country’s primary education
system in 2010.

With regards to the transition from primary to secondary education the situation
improved slightly: in 2002, out of 1,000 students, 248 obtained their CEPE certificate
(213 in the case of girls), and in 2010, the number of students obtaining their end of
primary education certificate rose to 308 (280 in the case of girls). However, the
repetition rate declined only marginally from 2000 to 2010 and the drop-out rate did not
improve. As a result, between 2000 and 2010 the primary education internal efficiency
deteriorated slightly instead of improving.

Teachers’ salary: Over the life time of the project, CTs subsidies paid by the
Government increased from an average of CFA 240,000/year in 2000 to CFA 450,000
starting in 2005 (CFA 300,000 for CTs level 1, and CFA 540,000 for CTs level 2).
However, instead of decreasing, the number of CTs (particularly CTs level 1) increased
substantially from 8,600 in 2000 to 18,300 in 2010 (74% of all primary teachers), more
than the high scenario increase of CTs in the system set in 2020 (56%). Additionally, out
of the 21,100 CTs in primary education in 2010, only 63 percent received training and
less than 2,000 CTs were certified. This evidence suggests likely lack of “value for
money? as far as teacher salaries are concerned. Upgrading the status and qualifications
of the CTs was expected to have a favorable impact on internal efficiency and learning
outcomes under the project, but the increased teacher subsidies were associated only
partially with these desired effects.

Construction unit costs: The project supported construction of 400 classrooms, 265
latrines, and 255 wells. It also provided more than 12,000 student desks, and contracted
with eight NGOs through APICED and FENAPET to transfer funds to schools,
communities, and CTs. While classroom construction and wells contracts were managed
by the PIU, latrines contracting was delegated to APEs and communities. During project
appraisal, unit costs estimates were defined in comparison to other similar countries.
However, implementation revealed that unit costs were underestimated as per the table
below resulting in the construction of fewer classrooms than originally planned. Delayed
procurement and the long approval process of contracts played a significant role in
increasing unit costs of goods and services. After restructuring, unit costs were
unchanged until project closing.

Textbooks: In addition to investments made in infrastructure and equipment, the project
also purchased textbooks. Initially, the project planned to acquire 2.65 million existing
textbooks and to adapt them to the country context with teachers’ guides and training to
enable them to teach the content of the textbooks. The project used the textbook funds to
purchase 3.1 million existing textbooks in French and Arabic and to edit teachers’ guides.
While the procurement process was often lengthy, the project ended up successfully
meeting the objectives of purchasing and distributing textbooks and provisional funds
were sufficient to acquire the needed textbooks.

(A full version in French of the Borrower’s ICR is available on file).
The initial objectives of the project was to assist the Government of Chad in developing
its policy framework, strategies and means for achievement of quality universal basic
education and implementing its strategy to improve access to and equity of education.
The project restructuring addresses some inconsistencies on the project objectives and
focuses them on (i) improving access and equity in primary education and (ii) increasing
capacity in strategic management and curriculum development.
The project was not national in scope, but rather designed to assist 8 provinces, and its
objectives were in line with the poverty reduction (PRSP, June 2003) which was under
preparation during project preparation, the Education Sector Program (ESP, 2000) and
the Bank Country Assistance Strategy (May 2003). The project originally consisted of
four components and various subcomponents of activities. The revised project activities
were either reorganized under the restructured two components and nine sub components,
or dropped because of their completion or irrelevance within the restructured project.
Two new activities were proposed, on a pilot basis: (i) the provision of equipments to
new secondary education schools built under the Government school construction
program in Component 1 and (ii) a new scheme for direct provision of School Grants to
public primary schools under Component 2.
The original project design was overambitious and complex and the main implementation
sub-periods of the project have been characterized by an indecisive and unstable social
and political environment - leading some time to suspensions of activities. On the
institutional front, the political instability has been reflected in the repeated
reorganization of the education sector, and the constant merge/split of the ministry in
charge of education. In addition, long and complicated national procurement processes
and related decisions delayed substantially the implementation of the project. The
government was also not able to always and timely provide the agreed counterpart
funding for the project. These factors have all hampered and caused serious delay in the
execution of the project and its overall performance.
Nevertheless, the implementation of activities has had a lot of successes and the project
has effectively supported some key institutional reforms, which have been implemented,
notably the Center for National Curricula (with the successful completion of CNC
technical staff recruitment and training, as well as of important studies that informed
curriculum and textbooks development), the Agency for the Support of Community
Activities (APICED), the partnership between the MEN and the National Federation of
Parents Associations (FENAPET), completion of girls’ education activities, bilingual
education pilot, completion of infrastructure and equipment activities, training of
thousands of CTs; acquisition of micronutrients and de-worming, as well as the initiation
of the development of a sound EMIS. On the positive side, some sub-
components/activities experienced remarkable progress with respect to the originally
planned objectives, namely: the training of the community teachers, the national
languages program and the training of Parents Associations (APEs’).




                                            54
Conclusion: The results of the project demonstrated its relevance to the achievement of
objectives in the field of basic education. Delays in implementation were mainly due to
external factors (such as political instability) or procedural problems, including two
project suspensions which contributed to slowing down implementation, that were mostly
overcome with the Government’s support to ensure proper implementation of the project
but also the guidance and help of the World Bank to help improve the performance of the
project and its implementation paths.
There is a net positive contribution of the World Bank support for the education sector in
Chad. It is therefore recommended that the World the Bank continue to stay engaged in
the education sector for the long term and consider a new phase of investment operation
projects which should take into account the lessons learned from this phase.
