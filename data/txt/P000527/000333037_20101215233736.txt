                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A. SUMMARY

1.   The proposed restructuring will revise the PDO to become focused and measurable.
It will also narrow the scope of the project and reduce the number of components from
four to two. The restructured project will focus on addressing (i) access and equity
related issues, and (ii) the weak capacity to manage the education system.        .

2. The project's components have been reduced to two and the sub-components are
reorganized and regrouped in line with the two new components and their number
reduced from 18 to 9. Some of the original subcomponents that have marginal effects on
the overall education system will be dropped. Finally the project restructuring will align
the project activities with the changes in the school construction program that is being
implemented under the Government social infrastructure construction program, financed
through the oil revenue budget.

3. The results framework is revised to reflect the change in project development
objective and the new target values for some indicators, as agreed during the Mid Term
Review. The restructuring also proposes to extend the closing date from December 2010
to June 2012. This is a Level I restructuring, which requires a Board approval.


B. PROJECT STATUS

4. The project has been underperforming because of the difficult political context. The
project has been under implementation for almost seven years; however, because of
successive suspensions the project has been effectively active for less than five years,
resulting in a disbursement rate of about 74%. The project implementation performance
is rated unsatisfactory, mostly because the project has not achieved its objective for
quality education. Nonetheless, the project is on track with regards to the objective on
access to education. Key activities regarding classrooms construction, community
teachers training and textbooks provision have mostly been completed. The project
contributed to the increase of the Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) in primary education from
72% in 2000 to 87% in 2009, although the Primary Completion Rate (PCR) is low about
44% in 2009 as a result of combination of high dropout and repetition rates.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

        Project's Development Objectives

5. The project restructuring will revise the PD~ to reflect the aim of project
simplification and what has been learned through project implementation.


                                            4
6. The initial PD~ in the Credit Agreement was to assist the Borrower in developing its
policy framework, strategies and means for achievement of quality universal basic
education and implementing its strategy to improve access to and equity of education.
The initial PD~ varies'across the PAD, the origimil ISDS and the Credit Agreement. The
project restructuring will address this inconsistency.

7; The proposed revised PD~ is to (i) improve access and equity in primary education
and (ii) increase capacity in strategic management and curriculum development.

      Results/indicators

8. The results framework will be revised to simplify its presentation and to select
relevant indicators to measure the revised intermediate and final outcomes of the project.
Core indicators for the education sector and for the Africa Region are included in the
revised results framework.

9. In addition, the results framework will include the changes agreed upon during the
April 2007 mid-term review that have not been formally processed because of the Bank's
disengagement from Chad for almost two years. These changes consist mainly of
updating the intermediate indicators with new target values. The new target values are
currently achieved and relate to school construction and literacy activities.

 A total of 50,000 adults, of which
 60% women, enrolled in functional

 Program                                       50,000                  20,000


      Components

10. The existing project activities are either reorganized under the restructured two
components and nine sub components, or dropped because of their completion or
irrelevance within the restructured project. Two new activities are proposed, on a pilot
basis: (i) the provision of equipments to new secondary education schools built under the
Government school construction program in Component 1 and (ii) a new scheme for
direct provision of School Grants to public primary schools under Component 2.

Component 1: Improving access and equity to education - SDRS.07million (Credit
SDRl.OOmillion - Grant SDR3.07million)

11. Component 1 aims to increase access to primary education and reduce gender and
regional disparities by increasing the capacity of existing primary education schools and


                                            5
promoting enrollments for girls and children in vulnerable areas. Component 1 is divided
in 5 subcomponents as follows:

12. Subcomponent (l.a): Education infrastructure l . Construction oflatrines for 65 public
primary schools under the Community Grants to the APE; construction of wells for 65
primary schools; and provision of furniture to 132 classrooms in public primary
education and to 3 new public senior secondary schools.

13. Subcomponent 1(b): Support to secondary education. Establishment of computer
centers, sciences laboratories and libraries in 3 targeted new public senior secondary
schoois, recently built by the Government. These activities will be piloted for further
improvement of primary education teacher qualifications. It represents a new activity
under the project. It includes equipments, books, consultant and training.

14. Subcomponent 1(c): Support girls.' enrollment. Continued activities in 228 public
primary schools in targeted zones, including payment of teachers' overtime for girls'
tutoring and for Girls' Education Grants.

15. Subcomponent. l@): Teacher Training. Continued qualification of Community
Teachers to reduce turnover and thus improve student access to primary school. Over
1,500 community teachers will be trained to Level One.

16. Subcomponent 1(e): Support to school health and nutrition. Continued activities to
provide vitamins/micronutrients and de-worming for 90,000 students; 108 trainers from
teacher training centers will be trained on HIVIAIDS prevention.

Component 2: Enhancing institutional                        capacity      SDRl.60million        (Credit
SDR2.40million - Grant SDRO.20million)

17. Component 2 aims to strengthen some key capacities at the Ministry and local levels
to manage the education sector and the project. It includes 4 subcomponents.

18. Subcomponent 2(a): Support to local school committees. School Grants will be
piloted in 150 public primary schools. Capacity of school committees (including
Students' Parents Association -APE) and school heads will be reinforced to manage the
grants. Sensitization and information dissemination campaigns will carried out. Local
NGOs will be recruited to train and assist them. This represents a new activity and it
includes goods and services, consultant, training and sub-grants.

19. Subcomponent 2(b): Support to the National Curriculum Center (CNC).
Enhancement of the capacity of the CNC to manage and implement the curriculum
reform. The new curriculum for the Classes Preparatoires (first 2 years) and the Classes
Elementaires (next 2 years) will be piloted in 30 schools. This includes training and
workshops, works, equipment, books and furniture for the CNC, technical assistance,
printing of new textbooks, curriculum and teacher guides.

1 The restructured project will not build any classrooms because the GoC is currently implementing a broad
social infrastructure program under the oil revenue budget.
                                                    6
20. Subcomponent 2(c): Strengthening of the Education Management Information
System (EMIS) and project management. MEN to develop capacity at all levels for the
production of timely Education Statistical Yearbook and Key Education Indicators. It
includes technical assistance, training/workshops, provision of goods and equipment. In
terms of the project management, the restructured project will continue financing the
operating costs, training and technical assistance to the Project Coordination Unit and the
Direction des Projets Education in the MEN.

21. Subcomponent 2(d): Developing capacity for sector analysis and policy. Preparation
of the Interim Education Sector Plan (IESP) by the MEN will be supported. Assessment
of the innovative approaches undertaken under the original project will be carried out.
The restructured project will cover the costs for technical assistance, goods, workshops,
studies and training/study tours.

       Institutional arrangements

22. Regarding the Project sub grants, instead of providing grants to the FENAPET,
which is the National Federation of the Students' Parent Associations, the restructured
project will provide School Grants directly to local School Committees. School
Committees exist in all public primary schools and it entails representatives from local
authorities, students' parent association, teachers' association and the head of school. To
benefit from the School Grants, local School Committees need to submit to the Regional
Delegation for National Education (DREN) a request including a budgeted action plan to
address specific issues at school level. The action plan will be focused on clear objectives
and results. Criteria will be established and published for the selection of the beneficiaries
signing the Grant Agreement with the DPE, which in charge of the Project management.
Guidelines and procedures will be developed and integrated in the Implementation
Manual of the Project. To enable the School Committees to prepare action plans and to
manage the School Grants, local NGOs will be recruited to train and assist them.

       Financing

23. Disbursement percentages for the restructured project will be increased to 100%
IDA financing of all project expenditures (tax exclusive), in line with the Country
Financing Parameters (CFPs) for Chad. There is sufficient funding for this increase
because the numbers of classrooms to be built will be reduced from 1,000 to 400. In
addition, the activities to increase literacy will be dropped and the scope of the Ministry
of Education training program will be reduced. The Government's contribution will
include the payment of taxes and the salaries of the Project Coordinator, the Coordinator
for Pedagogy and Education Quality and the Monitoring and Evaluation Officer. To
enable the project to pay the salaries of the mentioned staff in a timely manner, the
Government will maintain a Project account in CF A francs to be replenished on a
monthly basis up to an amount equivalent to a total of CFA francs 40.000.000.

       Disbursement arrangements

24. Prior to disbursement for the activities under the new sub-components 2.a (School
grants) in Annex 2, the borrower will adopt new procedures for the School Grants to be
incorporated in the implementation manual.

       Reallocations

25. The project restructuring implies a reallocation of funds by spending category as
shown in Annex 2. In addition, a new sub-category (5.e) is proposed for the provision of
School Grants to public primary schools.

26. Allocation for Works and Goods will be increased to enable the project to build
latrines and wells at primary schools and to provide equipments and furniture to the new
primary schools built under the school construction program. Allocation for Operating
Costs is increased to cover the additional costs resulting from the extension of the project
closing date for 18 months. To cover those increases, allocation for Consultant, Training
will decrease. Allocation for Girl's Education Grants, Literacy Provider's Grants and
FENAPET Grants are adjusted to the actual costs of the related activities.

       Procurement

27. Procurement would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines:
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, revised October
2006 and May 2010; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, revised October 2006 and May 2010.
Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants", dated October 15, 2006 shall apply to the
project.

       Closing date

28. The closing date will be extended to June 30, 2012.

                                             8
D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

        Technical

29. The new.pilot activity on school grants to public primary schools will allow
improving the procedures for direct delivery to school. With this activity, the project
expects to (i) get around the critical issue on delivering educational inputs to school and
(ii) enhance local communities' capacity for school development and managemerit.

30. The pilot activity about the provision of equipments and furniture aims to support
the investments made by the Government of Chad (Go C) in infrastructure for secondary
schools. In addition to provide equipments and train teachers on computer and
laboratories related skills, the project will introduce new financing mechanisms of the
operating costs of these facilities.

        Environment

31. The environmental category of the restructured project remains B. An
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared in the original project, but it did
not include all the targeted areas and address all environmental impacts (such as the
construction of latrines and wells). At the request of the World Bank, the Chadian
Government has prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) to replace the EMP which includes the additional targeted regions and
safeguards procedures for the subprojects in the restructured project. This ESMF has
been consulted upon and disclosed on 07/07/2010. The ESMF has two key objectives: (i)
to mitigate the potential environmental impacts of the construction of latrines and wells
and (ii) to reinforce the capacity of the stakeholders, at different levels and from different
departments, for implementing measures to mitigate environmental and social impacts.
Once the sites and works are identified, EMPs will be prepared, consulted upon and
disclosed..

        Risk

32. The risks assessment has been revised to take into consideration the new School
Grants and the financial arrangement.
