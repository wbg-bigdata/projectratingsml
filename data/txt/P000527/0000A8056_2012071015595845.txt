                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As this is the last ISR of over a 9 years long project, the team ensured that the ISR report (i) takes into account the whole life of the project, and not only the recent implementation
                         post restructuring period; (ii) focuses on the overall outcomes of the project, where overall outcomes are measured along three dimensions i.e. relevance of objectives, design, and
                         implementation; efficacy or extent to which the stated objectives were achieved; and efficiency; and (iii) discusses major changes and related reasons during the life of the project.

                         Implementation was successful to a greater or lesser extent depending on particular periods and components of the project: phase one was the period of January 2004 to December
                         2010 ; and phase two, the post restructuring period, was from January 2011 to June 2012. Both the original and revised project objectives, which were derived from the 2000
                         Education Sector Plan (ESP), continue to be relevant to the country needs as reflected in the 2008 Growth and Poverty and Growth Strategy Paper II (SNRP II, adopted in April

                         2008), the May 2010 Interim Strategy Note (ISN). Chad’s SNRP II continues to give high priority to the education sector as one of the engines for promoting growth and reducing
                         poverty. After acknowledging the progress made in the education sector since 2003 with the implementation of the ESP, the SNRP II reconfirms the continued relevance of the
                         program. In this regard, priority will continue to be given to the promotion of human development, through increased access and participation in education and training; focusing on
                         bridging the gender and equity gap; and improving the quality and efficiency in delivery of education services. The 2010-2012 ISN supports the focus on targeted programs for the

                         poor, improving basic health and education services through the decentralized system (Local Development Program Support Project). Therefore, the overall relevance of the project
                         is high.

                         The original project design was overambitious and complex, with some key sub-components not funded, making it difficult to assess progress toward the achievement of the PDOs.
                         Therefore, the relevance is judged as modest. However, the relevance of the restructured design is judged as substantial. This conclusion is based on the fact that the: (i) PDO and
                         PDO indicators were better aligned with the project interventions, and (ii) components and sub-components that were not relevant were eliminated, thus reducing challenges
                         associated with implementation capacity. These modifications were primarily responsible for reducing the complexity of the project and made it more realistic and feasible to
                         implement.

                         The relevance and efficacy of phase one project implementation is judged to be modest. This is mainly based on the implementation challenges in particular with regard to
                         procurement and delays prior to restructuring. However, there were successes during the initial implementation phase with a high disbursement of funds (74 percent). These
                         successes were: (i)) successful implementation of community grants (FENAPET), girls’ education activities, bilingual education pilot, construction and equipment of 400 classrooms
                         and latrines, 113 wells, and training of 10,000 CTs; (ii) successful completion of CNC technical staff recruitment and training, as well as of important studies that informed curriculum
                         and textbooks development; and (iii) initiation of the development of a sound EMIS. The relevance and efficacy of the restructured phase is judged to be substantial. This rating is
                         grounded on the following: (i) completion of infrastructure and equipment activities (wells and latrines); (ii) successful completion of all planned studies; (iii) completion of curriculum
                         and textbooks development activities which encompassed the initial target to focus on the first four years of primary and included the entire six years of primary education; (iv)
                         acquisition of micronutrients and de-worming; and (v) completion of girls’ education activities and (vi) development of capacity in monitoring and evaluation and sector analysis and
                         policy formulation.. The incomplete activities relate to laboratories and libraries equipment, transfer of funds to APEs for the school grants, and adoption of the National Interim
                         Education Plan which is expected to be completed in the next two months.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the mission the project team (bank and PIU teams) discussed and agreed with the Ministry of Education officials plans to ensure continuity and sustainability after project
                         closure, in particular through the Global Partnership for Education program under preparation ($47,2 million has been allocated to Chad), as well as government's own budget. The
                         mission also discussed the (i) need to complete and produce statistics for 2010/11 by September 2012; (ii) complete necessary evaluation studies; and (iii) carry out activities related
                         to project implementation completion (ICR).
