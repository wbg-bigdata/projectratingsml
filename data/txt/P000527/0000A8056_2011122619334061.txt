                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This update is on the basis of the April/May 2011 supervision mission and several supervision audio and video conferences during the last few months. A supervision mission was
                         just completed in November 2011 and the team is yet to receive validated data to update the project indicators as well as the the government clearance of the Aide Memoire. The
                         proposed Implementation status and Results Report will be updated accordingly by end of January 2012.

                         Actions were taken to boost project implementation which was originally slowed by procurement issues last year, due to (i) institutional capacity issues delaying project processing
                         and decision-making; (ii) lagging performance of the consultants and contractors who have had difficulty completing major assignments in a timely manner; and (iii) deficiencies i■?
                         oversight and internal controls of the PIU resulting in quality concerns, and mistakes. These actions include, among others, an increased monitoring and evaluation by both the Bank

                         Progress towards the achievement of the project development objective indicators is substantial based on the last reports received from the PIU. Progress in reaching project
                         development objectives is also considered satisfactory, because of continued improvement in reaching development indicators, including gross intake rates, girls' gross enrollment
                         rates, Interim Sector strategy, etc...

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is advised to further accelerate implementation pace through (i) further progress on addressing procurement bottlenecks, (ii) hiring of a experienced and recognized

                         proposed Sector Strategy, and (iii) further improve monitoring and evaluation processes to closely watch and address potential delays, and record achievements in view of the project
