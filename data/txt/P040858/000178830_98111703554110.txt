A. Project Development Objectives
1. Project development objectives and key performnance indicators (see Annex 1):
The primary project development objective is to support the sustainable development of Sohag rural villages
through the participatory approach initiated by the National Program for Integrated Rural Development (SHROUK).
The project aims to (i) improve income and quality of life in rural communities; and (ii) improve equitable access to
credit for the rural poor, unemployed youth and women. In addition, the project would enhance the capacity of local
communities and local government at the village level to program, appraise, co-finance, implement and manage rural
infrastructure projects and services.
Progress towards these objectives would be measured and monitored based on: (i) percentage of village.
participation in investment and recovery of operation and maintenance (OQM) cost for rural infrastructure and
services; (ii) volume of credit benefiting women; (iii) percentage of credit recovery rate; and (iv) percentage of
infrastructure and services benefiting isolated hamlets.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 16533-EGT      Date of latest CAS discussion: May 29, 1997
The project supports two major objectives of the Egypt CAS for FY98-2000: improvement of (i) rural income,
and (ii) natural resources management. The project would also contribute to the following progress benchmarks of the
CAS, in the Sohag Govemorate: (i) improvement in cost recovery of O&M; and (ii) increased diversification in
agricultural production.
The project would support the Agricultural Strategy for the 1990s prepared in 1993 by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MALR) with the support of the Bank and other donors (Report No. 11083-EGT).
T-he strategy emphasizes: (a) the need to ensure increased productivity and environmental sustainability in the
management and utilization of natural resources; (b) the promotion of private sector development; (c) the need to
implement measures for the agriculture sector within the context of an overall rural development strategy; (d) the
recognition of the social and political issues and the need for social safety nets to ease the social impact of
implementing a comprehensive reform program; and (e) the need to initiate a program of institutional reform to deliver
agricultural services that are responsive to farmers' needs.
The project is fully consistent with the major recommendations of the Bank's Strategv "From Vision to Action
in the Rural Sector" (1997): (i) planning, execution and financing of rural programs and services must be highly
decentralized and participatory; (ii) special efforts must be made to bring improved and appropriate technologies,
capacities and resources to rural areas; and (iii) the World Bank Group must focus on the development of country-
specific strategies rather than regional and global sector strategies.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy    3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic
choices
The incidence of poverty remains high in rural The proposed project complements Bank's and IFAD lending
Egypt. Poverty in rural areas is more widespread than  portfolio in the sector and responds to the Government's
in urban areas, and is concentrated particularly in  priorities as indicated in its Agricultural Strategy and its
Upper Egypt of which Sohag is one of the poorest Rural Development Program.  The proposed strategy for
governorates. Its population of 3.2 million is 77 percent poverty alleviation emphasizes public sector initiatives that

is challenging the traditional sources of income security
for the poorest farmers.
In its efforts to alleviate poverty and protect vulnerable
segments of society, the Government of Egypt (GOE)

contribution would be matched with up front
villagers' participation of about 15 percent in
labor or cash or in kind. In particular, the
project would support:
(a) economic and municipal infrastructure
(potable water supply, small irrigation and
drainage systems, rehabilitation of rural
roads, etc.); and
(b) social infrastructure (youth centers,
women's clubs, etc).

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project would support the GOE's rural development policy aimed at administrative and fiscal devolution
and decentralization by gradually shifting responsibility and accountability to local government at the village level for
the delivery and maintenance of services. This will be accomplished by providing technical assistance and training
designed to improve institutional capability at the village level. The project would also support the reform of financial
institutions operating in rural areas such as the Sohag BDAC and the LDF.
3. Benefits and target population:
The project would improve access of the rural poor to sustainable basic economic and social services in the 5 1]
Local Administrative Units (LAUNillages) comprised of 268 affiliated villages and 1,217 hamlets of the Sohag
Governorate. The total population of Sohag is 3.1 million in 460,000 households; of which 30 percent are landless.
A 1995 survey estimated that about 52 percent of the population of Sohag is poor and about 36 percent is
"ultra poor." Despite efforts by the Govermment and NGOs, 60 percent of the adult population is illiterate (70 percent
for women), only 30 percent of the population is served by potable water networks, 30 percent have no health facilities,
and 90 percent no sewage system. The situation of women in Sohag is made more difficult by the high level out-
migration of men to the Delta and to neighboring countries. Unemployment among youth between 15 and 24 years oldl
is 20 percent in rural areas and reaches about 40 percent for university and high school graduates. This population
would be especially targeted by the Rural Finance component of the project which would promote access to credit for
income generating activities (such as on-farm production, food processing, packing and drying of fruits and vegetables,
apiculture, livestock fattening, dairy, off-farm activities, transport services for girls attending secondary schools, crafts,
etc.). In addition, the project would also benefit rural women by promoting their representation in Rural Development
Committees, especially at the village level.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period. The project would be implemented over a period of six years.
Implementing agencies
The Governorate of Sohag (GOS) would have overall project implementation and coordination responsibility
and direct executive responsibility for the Village Infrastructure component and the Local Institutions Strengthening
component. In conjunction with and under the auspices of the GOS and through Project Agreements: (i) the Ministry of
Rural Development's LDF would implement part of the Micro-Credit component; and (ii) the Sohag BDAC would
implement the On-Farm Technology Improvement and Rural-Based Investment sub-component and part of the Micro-
Credit.
Project management and coordination
The project would be coordinated by the GOS which would be assisted by a Technical Assistance Secretarial.
(TAS) with responsibility for project implementation, including coordination of project activities, preparation of annual
workplans and budgets, participatory planning, procurement (except for activities implemented by Sohag PBDAC and
LDF), disbursement, financial reporting, and monitoring and evaluation. The TAS would be staffed by four local
experts in administrative and financial management, procurement, rural development, and monitoring and evaluation,
as well as short term consultants. In addition, the GOS will benefit from the methodological support of ORDEV and its
SHROUK Technical Assistance Team  (STAT) currently assisted by the USAID-financed, Participatory Rural
Governance Program.
A Governorate Rural Development Committee, chaired by the Governor or Secretary General of Sohag and
composed of representatives of the elected Govemorate Popular Council, Line Ministries, Rural Development District
Committees, and NGOs acts as a Regional Steering committee with the Rural Development offices of the Governorate
acting as the executive secretary of the committee. This committee will ensure complementarity of proposed village
plans with other programs, as well as ensuring availability of funds for the proposed sub-projects. Rural Development
Committees working in conjunction with the GOS, at the LAU and district levels, are designed to allow for full
participation, collection and dissemination of information, training, and reviewing proposals. Under the project, final
review and approval of sub-projects will be done at the Governorate level. Assurances to this effect were given at
negotiation.

For the Rural Finance component, a Credit Steering Committee would be established in Sohag between the
Sohag BDAC, UNICEF, LDF, SFD, GOS, the Ministry of Social Affairs and NGOs active in micro-credit in Sohag.
The committee would monitor and update eligibility criteria for micro-finance schemes implemented through NGOs.
The adninistrative structure of the project's operations is spelled out in the Project Operation Manual and will
respond to a demand driven approach as well as decentralization of responsibilities and functions. The Operation
Manual ensures that information on local budgets for sub-projects are provided prior to introduction of the planning
process, in order to ensure that community decisions are made within clearly defined resource availability and
requirements.
At the national level, the Interministerial Committee for Rural Development will act as a National Steering
Committee, and will ensure coordination with other national programs.
On-lending Arrangements
Proceeds of the IDA Credit will be made available to the Sohag BDAC through a subsidiary loan agreement
between the GOE and the PBDAC. For the LDF, proceeds of the IDA Credit will be made available to the LDF
through the National Investment Bank (NIB) under two subsidiary loan agreements: a NIB subsidiary loan agreement,
in US dollars, between the GOE and the NIB; and a LDF subsidiary loan agreement, in local currency, between the
NIB and the LDF. Agreements were reached during negotiations on the terms and conditions of the subsidiary loan
agreements.
Credit for on farm-technology and rural investment would be regulated by the Manual for Credit and Financial
Policies Procedures for the PBDAC and the BDACs. approved by the PBDAC's Board of Directors on May 29, 1997.
Credit will be provided to the beneficiaries at PBDAC's prevailing interest rates credit - after a three percent reduction
by the Government in 1996 - of 11 percent for short term agricultural credit, 12 percent for medium term credit, and 13
percent for long-term. PBDAC is adding a service charge of 1.25 percent and is conunitted to continue to adjust its
interest rates to cover its costs. Assurances were received at negotiations that the PBDAC would apply interest rates
that would cover its cost, and allow a return on capital. On-lending term for micro-credit will be regulated by the
PBDAC Micro-credit Manual which stipulates that the interest rates to final beneficiaries will cover the cost of credit
and allow for a return on capital.
Micro-credit by the LDF would be regulated by the LDF Manual for Micro-credit. It was agreed during
negotiations, that LDF interest rates will cover credit costs and allow a return on capital.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements.
(a) Project Accounts: The GOS, supported by the TAS, which includes a financial management specialist and a
procurement specialist, would establish and maintain project accounts through GOS' accountants, in accordance with
internationally-accepted standards of accounting, satisfactory to IDA and IFAD. The GOS would maintain detailed
memoranda relating to village programs and budgets, including sub-projects appraisal, approvals, disbursements,
contribution from villages in investment cost, O&M arrangements, and follow-up actions. The Sohag BDAC and the
LDF would maintain detailed memoranda relating to sub-project cycle progress including appraisals, approvals,
disbursements, contribution from borrowers, interest charges, installments due, collections, overdue and follow-up
actions. The accounts would be computerized and an accounting package would be selected, and installed by an
accounting firn. GOS's accountants would be trained on IDA procedures by the World Bank Office in Cairo. As of
July 1, 1998, the BDAC has to follow international accounting standards as required by the Central Bank of Egypt.
The LDF is maintaining separate accounts, using local accounting standards and is expected to move towards sound
internationally recognized accounting standards acceptable to IDA and IFAD by December 31, 1999. Sohag BDAC's
accounts will be maintained by BDAC existing staff using a new MIS currently under installation in all BDAC's. LDF
would establish a MIS that would generate annual budgets, quarterly progress reports, summary loans statements, and
annual financial statements that reflect the financial performance and position of the credit lines. Agreement was
reached during negotiations that the Sohag BDAC would complete, by December 31, 1999, the institutional
development program currently under preparation through the Agricultural Modernization Project.
(b) Reporting andAuditing: GOS and LDF are subject to internal financial auditing by a representative of the Ministry
of Finance. Sohag BDAC has its own internal audit system, regulated by its Operations Manual. The accounts of the
Sohag project, PBDAC, Sohag BDAC and LDF would be audited each fiscal year in accordance with Bank guidelines

by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and selected prior to project's effectiveness. Auditor's opinion and reports
satisfactory to IDA would be provided within six months of the close of the fiscal year.
(c) Special Accounts: To facilitate disbursement against eligible expenditures, the Government would establish three
Special Accounts in a commercial bank to be operated respectively by the GOS, LDF and PBDAC (on behalf of lhe
Sohag BDAC), under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The Special Accounts would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and identified and selected before effectiveness. The audit report would be
submitted to IDA for review and approval within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements.
The TAS would be responsible for monitoring piogress against agreed-upon performance indicators specified
in Annex 1, and monitoring the efficiency and quality of the sub-project evaluation system. LDF and Sohag BDAC
would have their own monitoring systems but they would furnish the TAS with detailed annual reports for IDA and
IFAD review summarizing project operations and the utilization of project funds. Long-term impact evaluation would
be conducted through annual beneficiary assessments, assisted by qualified consultants from local universities or
NGOs. TAS, Sohag BDAC and LDF would prepare by December 31, 2001, a detailed mid-term report to serve as the
basis for a mid-term project review, scheduled for March 31, 2002. Based on contributions from Sohag BDAC and
LDF, the TAS would also prepare and submit an Implementation Completion Report to the Bank within six months of
the closing of the IDA credit. Agreement on these arrangements was reached during negotiations.
Co-financing arrangements.
IFAD would co-finance the same infrastructure, credit and institutional building components, as the IDA
Credit; however the borrower will assign expenditures entirely to IFAD or to IDA on the basis of separate contracts or
activities and will, to the extent possible, ensure that commitments under the two operations are made on a paripsu
basis. Concerning technical assistance expenditures, the GOE has expressed its strong preference for using grants
instead of credits and loans. The UK-DFID will continue to support environmental assessment and management in
Sohag under a separate project.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Village Infrastructure Component. One option for implementing this component would have been to use the
mechanisms set up under the ongoing Second Social Fund for Development Project (SFD) (Credit 2865-EGT) which
has already financed 391 public works projects amounting LE 41 million in Sohag. Although the proposed component
would finance rural infrastructure similar to that currently financed by the SFD, there will be significant differences
between the two approaches. Specifically:
(a)  The project will operate exclusively through the local administration structure in a participatory process
organized to reach small villages and hamlets; and
(b) Planning and financing mechanisms will be different and will involve strengthening village capacity in
decision making, management, budgeting and financial administration. Following the SHROUK
methodology, the village community sets priorities and participates in the financing with a contribution Df
at least 10 percent.
The proposed project will complement the on-going SFD II Project by increasing the planning and
implementation capability of the local administration and the local communities in Sohag.
Rural Finance Component. The proposal to select either the Sohag BDAC or the LDF to act as a financial intermediairy
for the Rural Finance Component has been considered during project preparation. A financial assessment of Sohlng
BDAC and LDF was carried out as part of project pre-appraisal (Annex 5). The conclusion was that both institutionis
were playing complementary roles although at very different scales of operation and deserved to be supported.
Although, it is confronted with managerial and financial difficulties, with a loan portfolio of LE 450 million the Sohag
BDAC is the main financial intermediary reaching every village in Sohag. Although operating at a very modest scale,
the LDF has been targeting rural women and unemployed youth and is supported by UNICEF to develop communitmy-
based micro-credit on the model of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh.

An Enterprise Development Component was considered during the IFAD General Identification Mission of January
1994. The component has been withdrawn from the project design to avoid duplication with the Enterprise
Development Program financed under the SFD. Instead, the project would target women and rural poor through micro-
credit.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
About one quarter of the Bank's Group lending in Egypt has been to the agricultural sector. Most of the
lending has been directed at alleviating the physical constraints on agricultural production, particularly in irrigation
and drainage. These projects have contributed significantly to enhance Egypt's ability to achieve and sustain high
levels of farm production. The Bank also served as an executing agency for three area-based rural development
projects financed by IFAD (Miniya Agricultural Development Project, Fayoum Agricultural Development Project, and
West Beheira Settlement Project). Lessons learned from these projects highlight the importance of ensuring the
following: (i) project implementation in planning should take into account delaying factors such as procurement
procedures, staff shortages, inadequate budgetary allocations, etc; (ii) projects should be implemented under a single
institution; and (iii) institutional strengthening is a critical factor in improving efficiency in project implementation in
the sector. Although, three institutions will be involved in the implementation of the project, they will have
complementary roles, and clearly defined responsibilities.
Furthermore, reviews of rural development projects highlight the need for greater participation of the
beneficiaries in project identification, preparation and implementation, and for more decentralization. Reviews have
emphasized the need for securing the support of local communities not only in planning but also during
implementation and cost-recovery, as well as for organizational arrangements involving existing institutions to ensure
close coordination. Since many changes occur in the rural sector, the design and implementation of rural development
projects should be flexible. These lessons have been reflected in the design of the proposed project. In addition, by
focusing on operation and maintenance of local infrastructure, the project takes into account an important lesson
learned from the USAID-financed, LDP-ll.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Government of Egypt initially requested IFAD to identify and support an agricultural development project
in Sohag in 1993. Subsequently, in recognition of the acute poverty in Upper Egypt and its low share of national
development initiatives, the Government felt that a broader rural development approach would be required. It
approached IDA to join IFAD in providing assistance to the Sohag Governorate.
The project would support an indigenous Egyptian initiative aimed at fostering decentralization and
participation in rural areas. The SHROUK program was first initiated in the Ministry of Local Administration by
ORDEV and launched in October 1994 by a National Conference for Integrated Rural Development. At the natioial
level, the GOE's financial contribution to the SHROUK program amounted to LE 91.6 million for 1997/98 of which
LE 4.7 million for Sohag. The Ministry of Planning has allocated the equivalent of US$23.6 million over the six years
of the project as Government contribution to project costs.
Project preparation was supported by a Japanese PHRD Grant and has been carried out by a national team
established between the Sohag Governorate, ORDEV, and MALR which have contributed to cover preparation costs.
S. Value-added of IDA support in this project:
IDA can make available to Egypt the best international practices and experiences in rural development and
rural finance. IDA would provide financial resources to expand successful micro-credit projects initiated by NGOs,
UNICEF and other donors. Through the on-going Agricultural Modernization Project IDA has been supporting
PBDAC's institutional and financial restructuring. The project would complement this support at the regional level in
one of the poorest governorates.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)

[x I Cost-Benefit Analysis: ERR= 12 percent minimum for sub-projects above US$250,000
[x ] Cost Effectiveness Analysis
It is difficult to calculate an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the whole project, given the nature of its
components. The Village Infrastructure Component will support small scale economic and municipal infrastructure as
well as human development and service infrastructure, for which it would be difficult to quantify benefits. Therefore,

infrastructure costing more than US$250,000 would require a cost benefit analysis. Criteria for sub-project evaluation
and selection would include: (a) sound technical design based on village sectoral plans, analysis of alternatives and
sectoral norms; (b) feasibility: available inputs, estimate labor content, and technical feasibility of implementation; (c)
cost parameters, including maximum cost per beneficiary or cost per unit for each type of sub-project, mninimum
beneficiary contribution, either in-cash or in-kind to investment cost; (d) environmental sustainability; (e) social equity
(location, priority, profile of beneficiaries, gender and income); and (f) project sustainability, including realistic O&M
arrangements and community commitment and plans for financing 100 percent of operation and maintenance costs
after three years.
For sub-projects costing more than US$250,000 and with quantifiable benefits, such as water supply, cost-
benefit analysis would be carried out and a minimum ERR of 12 percent would be required. Benefits estimates would be
based on, inter alia, the willingness to pay (water supply); cost savings (sanitation, health, roads), etc.
The Project Operations Manual provides detailed guidelines for feasibility studies for sub-projects. It delegates
the responsibilities for feasibility studies and the appraisal of sub-projects to the different administrative levels, where
sub-projects would be prepared at the LAU with the help of the District and appraised at the Govemorate level.
The type of investment financed under the On-Farm Technology Improvement and Rural-Based Investment
sub-component would be similar to those already financed under the Agricultural Modemization Project. Based on the
experience with ongoing activities, the FRR would be in the 20 and 40 percent range.
2. Financial (seeAnnex 5):
The project is financially sound. It would develop cost recovery mechanisms and help Sohag BDAC and LDF
to move towards market rates of interest. Concerning the Village Infrastructure Component, the financial assessment
of sub-projects would be an important criteria in the selection of technical alternatives by the villages as the level of
O&M costs would impact on affordability and sustainability. The project would support LAU financial management of
O&M through TA and training. Concerning the Sohag LDF and BDAC, the financial analysis shows that the project
would improve the profitability and thus the sustainability of these institutions.
The Sohag Bankfor Development and Agriculftural Credit (BDAC) (Annex 5A)
Ownership and Organization Structure. BDAC was established in 1976 under Law 105 and is wholly owned
by the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC). The PBDAC is fully owned by the
Minister of Agriculture and is set up under Law 116 of 1976. The authorized and paid up share capital has
been raised to LE 80 million as of January 1998. The management consists of a Chairman and Board of
Directors who are drawn from the governorate, agriculture sector, central cooperative society and employee
representatives.
BDAC is the main agricultural development bank in Sohag Govemorate and operates through a net work of 11
district branches and 71 village banks. It provides short-term loans for agriculture and working capital,
medium-term loans for investment in the areas of agriculture mechanization, horticulture, livestock, off-farm
activities, etc., and long-term loans for agribusiness and land development. Total outstanding loans amounted
to LE 450 million in 1997 of which 37 percent is for livestock.
Resources and Assets. The BDAC has a medium and long-term resource constraint and a high credit deposit
ratio of 211 percent. The shortfall in its deposit base is presently met by borrowings from PBDAC. It is,
however, continuing to mobilize rural deposits. On the asset side, loans constitute 88.2 percent of the total
assets. The proposed loan will assist BDAC to access low cost resources on a long term basis to on lend to
small and micro enterprises in a sustainable manner.
Lending Operations. The loan portfolio has been expanding significantly over the years to meet the demand in
both the farm and non-farm sectors. The portfolio has grown in real terms at a rate of 7.2 percent over the
previous year. The major growth in disbursements has been to the non-agricultural sector (Appendix 7). It is
expected that the proposed loan will enable BDAC to diversify to financing enterprise development activity.
Portfolio Oualitv. The portfolio quality continues to be an area of concern. The annual collection rates are 90.6
percent for investment loans, 85.6 percent for short-term agricultural loans, and reach 100 percent for loans



12                                                                  Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Prqject
under the SFD. The collection rate is expected to improve under the Institutional Development Plan, under
preparation, which will focus on and strengthen credit management and controls. According to the audit for
FY97 conducted by the Central Audit Agency (CAA) which is a GOE agency for public sector audits, there is
a shortfall of LE 40.7 million in loan loss provisions (provisions for FY97 are LE 9.2 million). As a first step,
BDAC has raised its capital base significantly from LE 16.1 million in FY97 to LE 80 million in FY98.
Profitability. The profitability has not been satisfactory. A nominal profit of LE 113,000 is shown for FY97
The weak profitability can be attributed mainly to the high cost of funds BDAC has to pay to borrow from
PBDAC to fund its assets and the non-performing loans in its portfolio. The below-market interest rates have
strained the intermediation margins and have hampered BDAC's ability toward increased viability. The lack
of surplus has been the contributing factor for inadequate provisioning. The PBDAC is comnmitted to increase
its service charge in stages to improve on the lending rates.
The Local Development Fund (LDF) (Annex 5B)
Ownership and Organization Structure. LDF was created within ORDEV in 1978 and capitalized through a
USAID grant. It is an autonomous legal entity and is tax-exempt. The initial share capital of LE 19.7 million
has been increased to LE 30.98 million in FY97. LDF is owned by the GOE and is under the administrative
supervision of the Ministry of Rural Development. The Board of Directors consists of 14 members and
comprises of officials from the Ministries of Planning and Finance, the stock exchange, and from the
governorates, district level and local administrative units. The Board is presided by the Chairman who is also
the Chairman of ORDEV. LDF is a small organization with a staff of 30 has its office in Cairo.
LDF operates through the large network of LAUs in the govemorates which are under the Ministry of Local
Administration. The employees draw their salaries from their respective organizations and the incentives are
paid by LDF. Because of the vast network of LAUs, LDF has been successful in financing small and micro
projects and on-lend to NGOs. In view of the limitation in resources, their operations have been on a smnall
scale. The scale of operations in Sohag is low, with only LE 7 million in loans since the inception of the fimd
in 1978, for 171 projects benefiting 6,508 households.
Resources and Assets. LDF's resources are mainly comprised of capital and grants received from the GOE, It
is not allowed to accept deposits from the public. LDF has been steadily building up its reserves from the
earnings. The equity base for FY97 was LE 36.9 million. The total loan portfolio was LE 32.4 million which
reflects the conservative lending approach of LDF management. The surplus funds are place in interest
bearing deposits with commercial banks. The proposed project will increase the resources of the LDF to target
rural poor and women in Sohag.
Lending Operations. The loan portfolio has been growing steadily and shows an increase of 23 percent over
FY96. The major lending activities cover poultry, transport, workshop and mechanization units. Loans are
processed through the local administration. LDF has adequate experience in project preparation and lending
activities. The average loan size has been LE 1,072, or about US$320.
Ponfolio      . The quality of the loan portfolio is satisfactory. The repayment rate is good (96 percenit).
They have an attractive incentive system which is linked to recovery. As LDF is a Development Lending
Institute (DFI), it does not come under Central Bank of Egypt prudential guidelines. However, the retained
earnings are adequate to cover provisioning requirements. In addition, under an agreement signed in 1996,
UNICEF would assist the LDF in diversifying into community based micro-credit.
Profitabilitv. LDF has been making profits. This is mainly due to its low operational expenses and its strong
equity base. It has not resorted to borrowings so far to finance its activities. As a tax-exempt institution, it is
in a position to retain the entire surplus. LDF has been in a position to pass on a part of its surplus by
financing at significantly lower than market rates. However, LDF has agreed to increase its interest rates to
cover its full costs and allow a return on capital. The profitability is expected to be satisfactory.
Fiscal Impact:
Developing a sustainable mechanism to ensure recovery of O&M cost is a main objective of the project.
Therefore, the project is expected to have a positive fiscal impact. However, because of the high poverty level
prevailing in Upper Egypt, full cost recovery of incremental operation and maintenance would be carried out over a



Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project                                                            13
three-year period. The willingness to contribute in the financing of investment costs will also depend on the
availability of alternative sources of financing that do not require the same financial commitment from the
communities.
3. Technical:
The project is technically sound. Technical criteria and standards are being developed for each sub-project type
based on existing norms available from the respective public agencies to ensure sectoral coherence and compatibility.
These norms are being incorporated into the Operations Manual's appraisal guidelines. The technical appraisal of
community projects would have to confirm that infrastructure, equipment and other inputs are consistent in scale,
quality and content with the norms established and that implementation is technically feasible. In addition, the
Governorate TAS would recruit qualified short term consultants to assist Line Ministries in Sohag in transferring skills
and responsibility for project preparation, at the village level.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies:
The Sohag Governorate. The Governor, by Presidential Decree, is responsible for all organizations and
activities within the Governorate. Second to the Governor, the Secretary General is responsible for the
administration of the Governorate. He has the mandate and authority to act as project manager and to ensure
coordination of the project. He will be supported by a Technical Assistance Secretariat (TAS). The TAS will
work in close collaboration with the representatives of the Line Ministries in Sohag in providing technical
assistance to the villages in preparing and evaluating projects. It will also have an important monitoring and
evaluation function to follow-up on project performance and impact. Project implementation would be flexible.
The activities to be financed would be prepared on a rolling program basis, with thirty villages included in the
first-year's program. The Operations Manual has been reviewed and revised to incorporate relevant guidelines
and manuals prepared under the LDPII project. The Village Infrastructure component would be implemented
using the participatory approach developed by (SHROUK). On July 1997, ORDEV was transferred to the
newly established Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), while the Ministry of Local Administration was
placed directly under the authority of the Prime Minister. At the Governorate level the SHROUK program
continues to be implemented through the local administration (Governorate, District, LAUI) under the
authority of the Secretary General and with the assistance of the ORDEV.
Sohag BDAC. The financial management and accounting weaknesses were identified by the financial
management review carried out under the on-going Agricultural Modernization Project. An Institutional
Building and Business Plan is currently under preparation. Agreement was reached during negotiations that
the plan will be implemented before June 30, 1999. In the meantime, with the support of the Agricultural
Modernization Project, PBDAC is implementing a rehabilitation plan including: training, re-capitalization,
and loan portfolio cleanup.
LDF. LDF activities in Sohag will continue to be managed by the local administration at Governorate,
District and Village levels. Decision making will be decentralized. It was agreed during negotiations, that the
LDF will update its accounting system to fall in line with the requirements of a financial intermediary,
particularly with regard to categorization of its loan portfolio, classification of assets, recovery performance, by
December31, 1999.
The project will have an important impact in strengthening Sohag BDAC and LDF.
b. Project management:
At the Governorate level, it is critical that the participatory approach be shared among all Line Ministries
involved in rural development. and not only by ORDEV. For this reason, project management would be
placed directly under the authority of the Governor and the Governorate Secretary General of Sohag.
Technical assistance and training would be provided to Governorate staff on participatory rural development,
and administrative and financial management. With competent management and staff, an efficient Operation
Manual, close cooperation with other agencies, extensive staff training, the Governorate is well positioned to
implement the SHROUK program in Sohag (see Annex 11).

5. Social:
A Social Assessment was conducted as part of project appraisal. In rural Upper Egypt, women, landless
farmers and less influential families have very few forms of organization and representation. Experience with
Government and NGOs programs, which are attempting to address this issue, shows that participation and
decentralization need time and patience and can succeed only with the collaboration of the more influential actors of
society (members of the elected and executive councils, natural leaders, etc). The project will encourage rural women
involvement in the different phases of the SHROUK process. Social traditions and sensitivities will require innovalive
approaches (SHROUK sub-comnmittee for women, role of female SHROUK delegate -manduba-). Conununity fonnal
and informal consultations were conducted by the SHROUK teams during field visits and the promotional stage. In
addition, extensive needs assessments have been conducted to ensure that community concerns and needs are being
addressed. Rural Development committees and delegates (mandubeen) will utilize existing village profiles to develop
equity and gender specific criteria for sub-project selection. The Community Development Associations (CDA) will be
involved in the implementation of the community based micro-credit.
6. Environmental assessment:  Environmental Category [ I A   [X] B   [] C
The proposed project has been placed in environmental screening category "B" and an Enviromnertal
Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared which provides support for a series of practical actions to address potential
environmental issues (see Annex 8). These actions include: (a) strengthening the Enviromnental Management Unit
(EMU) supported by UK-DFID in the Sohag Govemorate; (b) Sub-project environmental review; (c) environmental
awareness program; (d) environmental training program; and (e) monitoring and reporting.
It has been placed in this screening category due to the limited and predictable impacts of the types of smldl-
scale interventions it would support, and the ability to address these issues through the use of project specific
enviromnental guidelines, including procedures for a case-by-case "environmental review" and monitoring of these
actions by the EMU. Given the small-scale of the types of activities to be supported, emphasis on the rehabilitation of
existing infrastructure and the participatory basis for sub-project selection and design, it is not anticipated that the
proposed project would result in involuntary resettlement or have adverse impacts to archaeological and/or historical
sites. The project would include the use archaeological "chance find procedures" in case buried archaeological and/or
historical materials are discovered during construction activities.

Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project                                                            15
With the support of a Japanese PHRD Grant, the project was prepared by a local as well as a national team of
experts from the Governorate, ORDEV, MALR, and Universities. With the assistance of a team of international
consultants, the two local teams undertook socio-economnic and production systems surveys using participatory rural
assessment techniques (PRA), in 16 villages in Sohag. An interactive design workshop, was held, in Luxor in January
1996, with the active contribution of UNICEF. It included participants from the villages, the Governorate, central
government, NGOs and Donors. The workshop recommended to place the project under the National Program for
Integrated Rural Development (SHROUJK).
The SHROUK process that will be followed under the project includes the following steps: (i) Orientation and
Assessment through meetings convened at the Village/LAU level to establish a Village Rural Development Committee
(VRDC); (ii) Popular Participation. Meetings are held with focus groups of blocks of 10-15 households representing all
affiliated villages and hamlets to discuss the findings of the 'village profile", identify projects and willingness to
contribute in their financing. Each residential block selects two rural development delegates (mandubeen); (iii)
Planning. A meeting of the VRDC decides on priorities and village contribution in financing and implementation. A
Village Priority Development Plan (VPDP) is submitted to the Rural Development Governorate Committee chaired by
the Governor. At the national level the Rural Development Inter-ministerial Committee has the supreme authority for
the SHROUK prograrn; (iv) Implementation. Once the VPDP is approved and resources allocated on a matching grant
basis (minimum of 10 percent financed by the villagers), the VRDC decides on implementation and O&M mechanisms,
through a local NGO, a private contractor, or usually a line ministry; and (v) Monitoring and Evaluation. ORDEV
carries out regular monthly monitoring of project progress. Although the VRDC is expected to play a major role in
monitoring and evaluation, its role is too often very limited.
At the national level the SHROUK Program is supported by, the USAID-financed, Participatory Rural
Governance Program (PRGP), which is currently under evaluation. Verification of progress towards meeting the
benchmarks required for disbursement of the second tranche of the project should be undertaken in August 1998.
The project would address the constraints identified during the first year of implementation: (i) NGOs, small
hanlets and women are under-represented in Rural Development Committees; (ii) the respective role of the VRDC and
Village Local Council need to be clarified; (iii) villages are insufficiently involved in project management; and (iv)
VRDC have insufficient control over O&M. The project would enhance the participatory approach by: (a) increasing
the participation of NGOs and women at the village level; (b) supporting line ministries in Sohag in transferring skills
and responsibility for project preparation to the village level; (c) including environmental screening and mitigation
plans in the project design; and (d) including the preparation of an operation and maintenance plan at the sub-project
or village level as part of the appraisal process.
b. Other key stakeholders:
The local branches of International NGOs active in micro-credit (CARE, Catholic Relief Services, Save the
Children) have been consulted during the preparation of the project.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. SustainabUity:
Sustainability of community sub-projects would be ensured through:
*  high degree of participation of the various village social groups in project identification, preparation, appraisal,
implementation and supervision;
*  ownership by the beneficiaries, as evidenced by their participation, in-cash or in-kind for about 15 percent of sub-
project cost;
*  appraisal criteria that require presentation of an operation and maintenance plan and a commitment of the
beneficiaries to finance 100 percent of the incremental operation and maintenance cost after three years;

*  canying out a social analysis to assess the degree of participation by the beneficiaries in the preparation of the
proposed community project; and
*  beneficiary community training in social management and operations and maintenance of sub-projects where
necessary, including the establishment of committees for implementation and maintenance for sub-projects.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The participatory approach taken dunng project preparation has reduced the risk for controversial aspects. However,
the requirement for financial participation in the cost of village infrastructure may be questioned by villages which may
prefer to wait for other sources of funding. Experience shows that the financial requirement would function as a
targeting mechanism. Efficient implementation would be required to meet the high expectation created by the
participatory approach.

2. Other:
The following agreements have been confirmed during negotiations:
Management of the Project:
(i)   The review and approval of sub-projects under the Village Infrastructure component would be decentralized at
the Govemorate level. To that effect, the Ministry of Planning would provide the adequate budgetary allocation
mechanisms.
(ii)  The Rural Credit component implemented by the Sohag BDAC and the LDF would be carried out in accordance
with the Manual for Credit and Financial Policies and Procedures and the Micro-Credit Manual for the PBDAC
and the BDACs, and the Micro-Credit Manual of the LDF, respectively.
(iii)  The Institutional Strengthening component and the Village Infrastructure component will be executed by the
Sohag Govemorate according to the methodology of SHROUK.
Accounts/Audits

IDA to carry out the Institutional Development and Business Plan for the Sohag BDAC.
(v)  The GOS, Sohag BDAC and LDF will prepare and maintain project accounts in a form acceptable to IDA. The
account would be audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA. Annual audit reports and
project accounts would be submitted to IDA annually, with the report to be submitted within six months of the
close of fiscal year.
(vi)  LDF will update its accounting system to fall in line with a rural financial intermediary, particularly with regard
to categorization of its loan portfolio, classification of overdue assets, recovery performance and MIS by
December 31, 1999.
Flow and Utilization of Project Funds
(vii) Government will on-lend to LDF and PBDAC on terms acceptable to IDA and IFAD. Interest rates applied by
the BDAC would be those of PBDAC. Interest rates applied by the LDF would allow the LDF to cover its costs
and make a return on capital.
(viii) LDF procedures would be decentralized at the Govemorate, District and village levels.
Monitoring. Review and Reporting
(ix) The Sohag Govemorate, the Sohag BDAC and the LDF would submit to IDA and IFAD annual evaluation and

Annex 2
Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project
Project Description
A.    Local Institutions Stren-theninf ComDonent (US$5.5 million - base costs)
1.    This component would support the Local Administration and Line Ministries at the
governorate, district and village levels, in assisting local conmmunities in identifying, planning,
appraising, operating and maintaining rural infrastructure. Activities to be supported would
include:
(i)   At the Governorate Level (US$1.8 million)
2.    The project would establish a Technical Assistance Secretariat (TAS) in the office of the
Secretary General of the Governorate. The TAS would be staffed by four local experts, for a total
of 21 staff/years, in administrative and financial management, procurement, rural development,
monitoring and evaluation. They would be supported by 72 months of local consultants and 14
staff/weeks of intemational consultants. The project would also finance office equipment, vehicles,
training, study tours, and feasibility studies.
3.    Technical assistance would focus on fostering the popular participation in decision making,
improving the efficiency of internal systems and procedures, in project preparation and appraisal,
financial management, environmental monitoring, and operation and maintenance. This would
improve user's ownership, technical quality and environmental sustainability of village
infrastructure. The project would build upon the achievements of previous projects which have
focused on strengthening the local administration, such as the Local Development Project (LDP-l)
financed by USAID, and would complement the assistance provided by the UK Department for
International Development to environmental assessment and management in Sohag. The Project
Operation Manual is integrating the participatory approach of SBROUK. It also includes a
selection of manuals and guidelines prepared under LDP-Il on village planning, designs of rural
infrastructure, such as water supply systems, operation and maintenance, environmental review, as
well as on the methodology for the appraisal and supervision of projects, procurement systems, and
on evaluating the project's impact on the welfare of the beneficiary community. The Environmental
Management Unit, supported by DFID at the Governorate level would carry out the environmental
review and the mitigation plan would be included in the cost of the sub-projects.
4.    Support will be given to the Govemorate and the Districts to assist the Villages/LAU in
complementing and rehabilitating physical infrastructure- through training, awareness campaigns
on public relevance issues such as environment, health, literacy, obtaining the ID card, etc. The
TAS would also promote regional workshops on micro-finance and micro-credit, involving banks,
LDF, community organizations, donors and local administrations.



24                                                          Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project
(ii)  At the District and LAU Levels (US$3.2 million)
5.    The project would support Rural Development Committees at the LAU and District level
by financing equipment and training. Training programs would focus on needs identification,
awareness building, impact monitoring, health and family planning, and social intermediation.
Audience for training would be member of the committees and village delegates ('mandub' and
'manduba'), and their supervisors, whose work is key for the participatory rural development
process. Workshops on savings mobilization for mandub and manduba would strengthen their
knowledge on rural finance. The project would finance office equipment for the LAU and 11
districts. To ease the communication and transport constraints in the villages, the project woudd
finance a twincab pickup for each LAU.
6.    Yearly sessions at the village level will focus on how to utilize available socio-economic
data (village profiles, background studies) and update the analysis of village needs for project
selection, monitoring and coordination through the use of participatory rural assessment techniques
(PRA). Existing research at the village level will be used as well to train mandubeen supervisors in
needs identification, impact monitoring, health and famnily planning, and social intermediation.
(iii) Other Line Ministries (US$0.5 million)
7.    Other line ministries in Sohag participating in the Rural Development Program would be
supported through training and short-term TA to improve their capacity to assist VDRCs in
preparation and implementation, as well as in supervision and O&M. This would promote work
group cohesiveness and coordination among the staff and to enable them to share information and
experiences with other agencies and interact with the village and district committees. TA and
training would be administered by the TAS. Project financing would also include office
equipment.
8.    The effectiveness of the TAS and the Sohag team operations would be examined through
annual surveys of quality control, beneficiary assessments, and impact evaluations, which would be
contracted to independent agencies. The Management Information System (MIS) under design
will track progression of sub-projects, provide transparency and accountability of financial flows,
monitor civil works progress based on field supervision reports, and flag sub-project experiencing
unusual delays and cost overruns. MIS generated information will be used into the daily decision
making and operations of the project and will form an integral part of the reports submitted by the
Sohag Govemorate.
B.    Village Infrastructure Component (US$47.5 million)
9.    This component would support Village Priority Development Plans identified, prepared
and co-financed by the Sohag Villages through the SHROUK participatory process, in interaction
and with the support of the local administration and line ministries in Sohag. Based on SHROUR;'s
accrued experience in sub-project implementation, the project would provide grant financing to
support demand-driven community-based social and economic infrastructure sub-projects. This
component would improve access to basic economic and social services in the 51 Local
Administrative Units (LAUNillages) comprising 268 affiliated villages and 1,217 hamlets of the
Sohag Govemorate. The total population of Sohag is 3.1 million, in 461,000 households.



Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project                                                 25
The type of infrastructure financed by the project would include:
(i)   Economic and municipal infrastructure such as: village water supply systems,
wastewater and sanitation systems, small irrigation and drainage systems, rural
roads, canal covering in village streets, veterinary centers, slaughterhouse, and
environmental projects, etc; and
(ii)   Human development infrastructure and service sub-projects, such as: health centers,
classrooms, literacy centers, youth centers, women's clubs, cultural centers, etc.
10.   Sub-projects would be identified by the villages themselves as part of an on-going village
need assessment and planning exercise which has been initiated by the SHROUK's village profiles.
Under the project, representatives of the private sector and NGOs active in the village would join
the Executive Council, the elected Village Popular Council and natural leaders who are already
included in the SHROUK Committee. To avoid possible conflicts of responsibility and ensure
transparency and accountability, the respective roles of the VRDC and the Village Popular Council
would be clarified. Various options are currently under experimentation.
11.   The VRDC would develop Village Master Plans for key sectors, with the support of the
Village Information Decision Support Center and representatives of line ministries in the village.
The methodology is provided by the Project Operation Manual and manuals and guidelines already
available under the USAID financed LDII project. Project identification and preparation would be
done at the village levels with the support of the district and governorate. Project appraisal and
selection would be done at the Govemorate level, based on the following criteria: (a) sound
technical designs based on village sectoral plans, analysis of alternatives, and sectoral norms; (b)
feasibility: available inputs, estimate labor content, and technical feasibility of implementation; (c)
cost parameters, including cost per beneficiary or cost per unit, minimum beneficiary contribution
either in-cash or in-kind to investment costs; (d) environmental sustainability; (e) social equity
(location, priority, profile of beneficiaries, gender and income); and (f) project sustainability,
including realistic operation and maintenance arrangements and community commitment to
financing 100 percent of incremental operation and maintenance costs after three years.
12.   Sub-projects would be implemented through partnerships with the local government,
beneficiary communities, welfare and community organizations, such as Community Development
Associations (CDAs) and other NGOs, with beneficiaries making a contribution in cash or in-kind
of at least 10 percent. The maximum sub-project size would be US$500,000. Training would be
provided to farmer associations, community groups, and NGOs aimed at strengthening their
capacity for self-help and management.
13.   Sustainability of infrastructure and services through adequate organization and financing of
operation and maintenance, would be a prime objective of this component. The establishment of an
acceptable Village Operation and Maintenance Plan would be an important criteria for determining
eligibility for financing infrastructure in a particular village. The O&M Plan would include an
assessment of the financial capability and willingness of the community to participate in O&M
costs. Implementation arrangement would differ by type of investment. For example:
(a)   O&M of water supply, sanitation and sewage systems would be handled by the
workshops established under the Local Development Project II (LDP-ll) at the



26                                                          Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project
LAU, District, and Govemorate levels. The Project will experiment with several
management arrangements. One option will be to support the Govemorate in
reactivating the management of the workshops through management contracts with
a small technical team financed by the proceeds of the normal water fee and the
special fee established under Govemorate Decree No 242/1991. In addition, the
project would finance training, TA, and equipment needs of the workshop. Users
are expected to cover the full cost of O&M after three years;
(b)  for rura roads, maintenance would be done by the special unit working on
commercial basis established by the Sohag Road Department under the same
Govemorate Decree; and
(c)  the operation of health centers and one classrooms-schools would remain under thle
responsibility of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education respectively.
However, beneficiaries would participate in the cost of operating and maintaining
the facilities on a progressive basis. Commitment from the Ministries of Health and
of Education to provide qualified staff would be a criteria of eligibility for this type
of investment
14.   For each sub-project, the LAU would enter into an agreement with the sector Line Ministry
or agency and a local maintenance committee representing beneficiaries. NGOs or private
companies would be contracted to: (a) help create local maintenance committees where they do
not exist; (b) provide training in maintenance of physical facilities based on maintenance manuads
to be developed jointly with ORDEV and Line Ministries with participation of local communities;
and (c) train local committees in simple fund raising techniques, fund management, general
management, and supervision.
C.    Rural Finance Comuonent (US$23million)
15.   This component will help to improve standard of living of the rural poor in Sohag by: (a)
promoting increased economic activities, and (b) open access to credit for women and the ultra-
poor. The project would support two sub-components:
(1)   On-farm Technology Improvement and Rural-Based Investment (US$18.0 million)
16.   The project would provide long-term resources through a line of credit and institutional
support to the Sohag BDAC to increase agricultural productivity and rural income through on-farm
technology improvement and rural-based investments.
(a)   The Line of Credit for Agricultural Production and Rural Investmemts
(US$17.2 million) would augment the resource position of the Sohag BDAC and
make available to it a core base of long-term funds for on-lending. This would give
the BDAC the opportunity to address its critical financial issues more effectively
and build up community trust and participation. The line of credit would finance the
following activities:
(i)  Seasonal and short-term credit for seeds, fertilizers, machinery and labor hire
and pumping costs;



Egypt Sohag Rual Development Project                                                 27
(ii)  Medium-term credit (up to 5 years) for tractors, implements, threshers,
establishment of agricultural machinery hire services, rice and wheat mills,
livestock fattening, and equipment of dairy processing;
(iii) Long-term credit for land development and agribusiness (over 5 years) for
vegetable processing units, milk collection and processing units,  private
veterinary clinics, animal shelters, etc.
(b) Institutional Support to the Sohag BDAC (US$0.7) will complement ongoing
PBDAC efforts to address the financial and managerial problems facing the Sohag
BDAC, which are being reviewed by an ongoing financial management study
supported by the Agricultural Modernization Project: (i) the capitalization of the
BDAC has been increased to LE 80 million, which is placing the Sohag BDAC in
the group of BDACs with the highest capital; (ii) the loan portfolio will be cleaned
up of bad debts older than three years; (iii) a training program financed by the
ongoing Agricultural Modernization Project is underway; and (iv) the findings of the
ongoing financial management study of PBDAC and Sohag BDAC would be
translated into an institutional building and business plan which would be submitted
to IDA for review and approval before June 30, 1999. The project would finance
transportation and office equipment, training and technical assistance.
17.   This component would operate under the "Manual for Credit and Financial Policies
Procedures for the BDAC and the PBDAC" approved by PBDAC Board of Directors on May 29,
1997. Financing terms and conditions are included in the Operating Manual includes coverage the
following areas: financial arrangements, principal financing conditions, approval, target
beneficiaries, project criteria, size of loans, lending terms.
(2)   Micro-Credit for Income Generation (US$5.0 million)
18.   The project would support the Sohag BDAC and the LDF in Sohag to develop market-
oriented credit delivery for income-generating activities by the rural poor with special emphasis on
women, in a competitive and financially sustainable manner.
19.   This component would use two different mechanisms for the delivery of micro-credit that
have been successfully experimented in Egypt: (i) community-based lending targeted towards
women on a model inspired by the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, initiated by UNICEF in Sohag,
Assuit, Qena, and Alexandria governorates, under the Family Development Fund (FDF); and (ii)
individual micro-credit through existing banking institutions, on the model of the Special
Innovation Funds initiated by the Govermment of Netherlands with the Menufia and El Sharkiya
BDACs.
(a)   Community-based Micro-credit (US$2.3million)
20.   The project would finance a special wholesale credit window for NGOs. The credit
window would support eligible participating NGOs, including the Community Development

involved in community-based micro-credit with the rural poor and women groups that have
established a solid track record. The CDA, NGOs or PVOs would have to provide adequate
guarantee to the financial intermediary (BDAC of LDF), and would be responsible for the
community loans that would be at market rates to support the credit cost and risk. The line of
credit would be financed by IDA (50 percent) and IFAD (50 percent). The NGO would open an
account with the BDAC (or in a commercial Bank in the case of LDF) and route all its operations
of moneys collected and disbursed through this account. Initially, at the time of loan applicatior;
the NGO will prepare a simple project report outlining its experience to date, basic methodology,
and target groups it focus on and with the projected cash flow, profit and loss and balance sheet
based on anticipated levels of credit. The NGOs will be required to submit quarterly progress
reports on the loan portfolio and annual financial statements to the financial intermediary. This
component would be implemented by the Sohag BDAC and the LDF though two separate
subsidiary loan agreements: (i) a line of credit of US$0.9 million would be managed by the Sohag
BDAC; and (ii) a line of credit of US$1.4 million would be managed by the LDF in Sohag.
21.   CDAs or NGOs would provide loans to rural women organized in groups of about five
beneficiaries. Under the methodology of the FDF, loan size ranges between LE 200 and LE 1500
per beneficiary. Eligible income-generating activities include inter alia: handicrafts, animal
husbandry, small retail and trade activities, vegetable and fruit selling and processing. The loans
are extended to small groups (2, 2, 1) in a sequence. The neediest two members of the group are
expected to receive the first loan, then after a few weeks the second group of two receive a loan
provided that the first two beneficiaries pay back. The leader of the group will then receive a loan
only if all members of the group are paying back on time and attend weekly meetings organized by
the participating NGO. A similar methodology is successfully used by the local branches of
International NGOs such as Save the Children, Catholic Relief Services and CARE. Interest rates
for the beneficiaries are at market rate (15 to 18 percent per year).
22.   A credit steering committee would be established in Sohag between the Sohag
Govemorate, the Sohag BDAC, UNICEF, Save the Children, CARE, Catholic Relief Services,
LDF, and the Ministry of Social Affairs. The committee would establish and review eligibility
criteria for micro-finance schemes run by NGOs. These could include: experience in providing
financial services, saving component, integration of financial and social services (health, literacy),
activities in social intermediation (ex: ID card for women, assisting people in using post offices and
banks for savings).
(b)   Individual Micro-Credit (US$2.3 million)
23.   The project would finance a pilot line of credit for innovative credit delivery. Building
upon the successful experience of the Special Innovation Fund (SIF), financed by the Netherlands,
the main feature of the micro-credit line would be: (i) non-targeting: the credit can be used for any
productive (income generating) activity, such as farming, farm related activity, small trade,
handicraft; (ii) one standard market rate of interest is used, irrespective of type of the application of
the loan by the beneficiary; (iii) no collateral would be required for loan less than LE 1,500; (iv)
high performance targets: a repayment of 98 percent minimum would be aimed by approprialte
appraisal, sound monitoring and performance oriented staff motivation; (v) existing clients of
BDAC and LDF would be checked for credit worthiness; and (vi) simplified procedures for loan
application and simplified accounting would be used and the target for administrative expenses
would be 3 percent.

24.   Other features would include: (i) speedy decision making (approval in seven days); (ii)
existing clients of the program with good repayment records will be assured of continued credit
eligibility the subsequent year/season; (iii) the program would focus particularly on the needy
farmers and rural dwellers, with a loan amount limited to LE 5,000 per client; (iv) the maturity
would not exceed 12 months; (v) the possibility of introduction of a saving scheme would be
explored; (vi) quick and frequent feed back of financial performance to credit officers through
appropriate monitoring system would be expected; and (vii) credit to women would be actively
promoted.
25.   This component would be implemented by the Sohag BDAC and the LDF in Sohag. A
line of credit of about US$0.9 million would be managed by the Sohag BDAC and a line of credit
of US$1.5 million would be managed by the LDF in Sohag.
26.   The operation manual, simplified accounting system and computerized loan monitoring
systems successfully developed under the SIF would be used by the Sohag BDAC and the LDF in
Sohag.
(c)   Institutional suDoort to the LDF (US$0.4 million)
27.   The project would support the decentralization of LDF's decision making to Sohag.
Agreement was reached at negotiations that the LDF will decentralize its decision-making
operations: (i) LAU for loans up to LE 2,500; (ii) District for loans between LE 2,500 and LE
5,000; and (iii) Govemorate for loans between LE 5,000 and LE 10,000. A loan committee will be
constituted in each LAU. Down payment would be waived for small borrowers (e.g., loan
amounts not exceeding LE 1,500). The project would finance office equipment, training and
technical assistance. This would complement the technical assistance provided by UNICEF under a
management contract with ORDEV.
28.   The following agreements were confirmed during negotiations: (i) interest rates to final
beneficiaries would cover the cost of credit and allow a return on capital; and (ii) the NIB would
take the foreign exchange risk for the LDF.

36                                                          Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project
Annex 4
Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project
Economic Analysis
1.    Links to CAS and ESW. The project would address two objectives of the CAS: (a) improving
rural income; and (b) improving natural resource management by: (i) improving income and quality of life
in rural communities, and (ii) mobilizing and improving equitable access to credit for the poor and for
women. The project is specifically listed in the CAS. The project would also support the Agricultural
Strategy for the 1990s prepared in 1993 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation with the
support of the World Bank and other donors. This strategy identified, among others, the need to implement
measures for the agricultural sector within the context of an overall rural development strategy, which
should encompass aspects related to diversifying rural activities and provide key services, in particular,
sustainable intensification of agricultural production and essential social programs for health and education
2.    Adequacy of Policy Environment. The performance of the Egyptian economy has improved
markedly in the last two years. The GOE is committed to provide a political environment to allow a rapid,
sustainable growth to bring a solution to the pressing social and employment problems that are the key
challenges for the immediate future. The GOE has initiated decentralization of decision making and
fostering community participation through the SFD and the SHROUEK program. The institutional
framework for the Village Infrastructure Component of the project has been created in 1994 by the
establishment of the SHROUK inter-ministerial committee and by the establishment, in July 1997, of a
new Ministry of Rural Development. Concerning the financial sector, the project would build upon the
policy reforms initiated under the on-going Agricultural Modernization Project.
3.    Public/Private Sector Role. The project would support the decentralization of decision making
for public investment in Sohag. It would promote private sector and NGOs' participation in the
implementation of the sub-projects and in their operation and maintenance through contractual agreements
with the local communities. Public intervention is justified because the project: (a) supports activities
rightfully undertaken by the GOE because of their positive, public good, externalities; (b) targets benefits
to poor communities unlikely to be reached by the private sector; and (c) provides an impetus for new
approaches to poverty reduction and rural development which could be adopted by the private sector once
sufficient experience and familiarity with them has been gained.
4.    Economic Analysis for the Village Infrastructure Component  Following the standard
procedure applied in similar World Bank projects, the majority of sub-projects under the Village
Infrastructure component would be appraised against a cost per unit or cost per beneficiary criteria. A rate
of return calculation would be only required for a small number of sub-projects for econormic infrastructure
with both quantifiable benefits and costs exceeding US$250,000. This approach is appropriate given: (i)
the demand-driven and dynamic character of the sub-project identification, which does not allow a detailed
up front planning of the entire investment program, and (ii) the benefits of sub-projects which are not direct
quantifiable, i.e. one classroom-school. It is difficult to calculate a rate of return for the overall project,
given the uncertainty about the composition of the investment program and range of sub-projects.
Investment plans would be prepared during project implementation, comprising sub-projects identified by
villages and Local Administrative Units under the participatory SHROUK process. For the first project
year, the Sohag Govemorate prepared an investment program which would be financed by the project.



Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project                                                   37
The investment program contains sub-projects such as one classroom-schools, small water supply systems,
and pavement of rural roads. The sub-projects have been gathered from existing village plans which were
designed by SHROUJK committees.
5.    Cost Effectiveness Analysis for Sub-projects: For sub-projects with mainly non-monetary benefits,
i.e. health units, youth centers or one classroom-schools, and for small sub-projects for economic and
municipal infrastructure with an investment volume below US$250,000, a maximum cost per unit or cost
per beneficiary criteria would be determined based on the first year investment program and experience of
similar programs (LDP-II, SFD). Since the type as well as the size of sub-projects varies significantly, i.e.
upgrading or new construction, the cost per unit threshold is expected to change during project
implementation. The database would be continually updated and extended during project implementation to
become a practicable tool for sub-project appraisal. Investment cost per unit would be kept within
subsector norms and consistent with the norms used by the SFD. However, where site specific conditions
require a sub-project design which differs from the standard design, with cost exceeding the per unit cost
threshold, the decision makers are allowed to approve such sub-projects after the need for the higher cost
solution has been confirmed in a feasibility study.
6.    Feasibility studies would evaluate sub-project alternatives in order to identify sub-projects which
are both cost-effective and provide high benefits. The feasibility studies would consider both quantifiable
and non-quantifiable benefits from the different alternatives. The results of these studies would be
submitted to the decision makers and the SHROUJK committees at the village level in order to increase the
transparency and trust in the SHROUK process.
7.    An additional appraisal criterion would be the commitment of the beneficiaries to contribution: (i)
at least 10 percent to the investment costs, either in-cash or in-kind; and (ii) 100 percent to the incremental
operation and maintenance cost after three years. Furthermore, the design of adequate operations and
maintenance arrangements according to the Operation Manual would be required. These appraisal criteria
requirements would be assessed for each type of sub-projects and would be reviewed annually to
incorporate experience gained in field operations.
8.    Financial Analysis for the Rural Finance Component. The financial analysis for the Rural
Finance Component is based on (i) typical loans which the Sohag BDAC and LDF are currently providing,
and (ii) investment profiles prepared for the Agricultural Modernization Project in Egypt. The financial
analysis assumes a borrowers' contribution to the investment of 30 percent and an interest rate at market
rates of 16 percent with repayments over five years with a one year grace period. Financial cost of the
investment profiles include investment cost, operating cost, and additional working capital needed. The
average economic life of each enterprise is estimated between 8 and 10 years. For the calculation of the
Economic Rate of Return, direct transfer payments including taxes, duties and subsidies were, deducted
from financial prices to reflect the economic value of a particular enterprise. The rate of return calculation
for the selected investment profiles indicates a high profitability of the investment (see Table A),
9.    Investment Profiles: investment profiles are available for livestock production, agricultural
processing, honey production, and four agro-related enterprises based on the experience of the Agricultural
Modeniization Project (i.e. small and medium-scale custom service small operation, small-scale wheat
milling, and medium-scale horticultural sorting and packing station). Small livestock production does not
require investment in buildings, fixed equipment or land, thus, the proposed investment activities are
appropriate for poorer households which usually lack these assets. Further, dairy production has the
advantage that income is received on a regular basis, and calf fattening provides a rapid tum over. Farmers

would retail the milk and sell their meat at local markets. Investment in agricultural processing is based on
simple technology which is suitable for small-scale enterprises. Pickle and yogurt production are economic
activities which are likely to be attractive to women wishing to become involved in agricultural processing.
The agricultural processing activities generate employment because they require a relatively high input of
labor. The four agro-related enterprises require relative high investment. The Financial Rate of Return
(FRR) calculation indicates a high profitability of the investment activities (see Table A).

10.   Feasibility studies would be prepared for loan approval. Loans for agro-processing would require
an analysis of the relevant market. Loans under the Micro-Credit component would not require individual
approval as the Grameen Bank concept by definition transfers the responsibility for loan approval to the
small-groups who borrow from the BDAC or LDF, respectively. However, loan approval under the sub-
component Individual Micro-Credit would comprise several criteria such as repayment history oif
individuals.
11.   Risk Analysis. The three external key risks for the project are: (a) the financial and politicail
commitment of the GOE to decentralized rural development; (b) the participation of line ministries in the
participatory rural development process; and (c) the performance of the Sohag BDAC and LDF. The scope
of the Village Infrastructure component has been agreed upon with the Ministry of Planning which has
allocated an equivalent of US$23.6 million to the project. ORDEV is already a department of the newly-
established Ministry of Rural Development. The project would improve the capacity of the local
administration and NGOs through training and capacity building. The socially difficult participation of
women in the project's activities would be secured through a prudent and flexible approach where women.
would play an active role in the Village SHROUK committees and get access to credit. The project would

utilize the accumulated experience from local NGOs and UNICEF. An Institutional Development Plan is
under preparation for the Sohag BDAC and will be implemented under the project.
12.   Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery. Since the development of a sustainable mechanism to ensure
recovery of O&M is a main objective under the project, the long-term fiscal impact is expected to be
minimal. To minimize the impact on GOE budget, incremental O&M costs will be borne by the
beneficiaries after three years of operation. The willingness to contribute in the financing of investment
costs will depend on the availability of alternative sources of financing that do not require the same
financial commitment of communities.
13.   Institutional Capacity. The project would be part of the SHROUK program launched in 1994 by
ORDEV as the Village Infrastructure component would be implemented through this process. The
Governor of Sohag would be supported during project implementation by a Technical Assistance
Secretariat (TAS) to be established within ORDEV under a management contract and with staff seconded
form key Line Ministries. The TAS would provide technical assistance for the feasibility studies of village
projects. It will also have an important monitoring and evaluation function to follow-up on project
performance and impact. Project implementation would be flexible because of the demand driven and
dynamic character of the SHROUK process. The activities to be financed would be prepared on a rolling
program basis. The Rural Finance component would benefit from the activities of the Agricultural
Modernization Project which supports the PBDAC. Other institutions that would participate in the Rural
Finance component, e.g. UNICEF, have proven their capability to implement and support micro-credit
programs.

Annex SA
Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project
Financial Summary and Appraisal of Intermediaries
Introduction
1.    This Annex attempts to evaluate major institutional issues effecting the BDAC Sohag and Ihe
Local Development Fund and appraise their financial performance. The parameters of OD 8.30 have been
taken as a guideline for this appraisal. In the absence of financial projections provided, projections for Ihe
next five years have been based on the actual balance sheet and income statement for FY97 and an
assumed real growth rate as enumerated in the report.
2.    BDAC Sohag is a dominant rural bank with an extensive outreach of village banks which is critical
for extending micro enterprise credit and mobilizing savings of the rural households. Though BDAC does
not have prior experience in financing micro enterprises and NGOs, the TA and training recommended will
support and strengthen this component. The financial statements do not indicate a satisfactory situation due
to various weaknesses detailed in the report. However, under the ongoing Agricultural Modernization
Project, the World Bank is assisting in strengthening PBDAC and addressing its institutional and
sustainability issues. The proposed credit will in addition, augment the long-termn resource of the BDAC.
3.    LDF has an extensive outreach through the LAUs which operate at the village level. LDF hlas
proven satisfactory experience in financing small and micro credit enterprises/projects and NGOs. The
financial statements reveal the limited financial resources of the LDF to create a greater impact in rural
development. LDF has been relying entirely on donor support and grants until now. The proposed credit
will strengthen the long-term resource availability at a low cost and enable LDF to decentralize its
operations by delegating loan sanction authority at the Governorate level.
4.    Though financial intermediaries, LDF and the NGOs in Egypt are not allowed to accept deposits
from the public. The BDAC will therefore play an important and complementary role in mobilizing rural
savings through their village banks.
Sohag BDAC
Corporate set up and management
5.    BDAC is an independent corporate entity set up under Law 105 of 1976 and is owned 100 percent
by PBDAC (set up under Law 116 of 1976). According to the Law, each BDAC shall have a separate
budget to be prepared in accordance with the rules governing the budgets of the banking system. It is
responsible for paying taxes and dividends on its operations and meet with independent capital adequacy
standards.
6.    The management of the BDAC consists of the Chairman and a Board of Directors. PBDAC is not
represented on the Board. Though BDAC is an autonomous entity, it is wholly owned by PBDAC and is
dependent on PBDAC for its budget allocation, resources, loan approvals beyond a credit ceiling, etc. Law



Egypt Sohag Rural Development Project                                                               41
117 defines that all BDACs, their branches and village banks shall fulfill the objectives of the PBDAC
within the limits it sets for them. In effect, there is limited autonomy as lending targets, interest rates, etc.
are set by PBDAC. The Law in tum, places PBDAC directly under the jurisdiction of the Minister of
Agriculture.
7.     The network of BDAC comprises of 11 branches and 71 village banks. The branches are mainly
administrative units supervising village banks under their area The customer base is 247,211 covering an
area of 296,175 feddans. A significant part of the loan portfolio of approximately 37 percent consists of
loans to animal husbandry and calf fattening activities'. Total staff strength is 1680. Eleven branches and
eleven village banks are computerized.
Reliability and Acceptability of the Financial Statements
8.     The Balance sheet and Income statement for the past five years (FY93 to FY97) and the projected
Balance sheet and income statements for the next five years (FY98 to FY02) are attached in Appendix 1-4.
The accounts of the BDAC are audited by the Central Audit Agency (CAA) which is an independent
government agency. The accounting standards are not in conformity with intemationally accepted
accounting and audit standards particularly in the treatment of interest accrued on overdue loans and
classification of the loan portfolio. Since July 1, 1998, PBDAC and BDAC have to follow internally
accepted accounting standards as required by the Central Bank of Egypt.
9.     According to the CAA report, the Sohag BDAC did not show a distributable surplus in FY96.
Sohag BDAC has been incurring losses for the past few years and part of the costs have been absorbed by
PBDAC. They are not reflected in the financial statements. Table 2 indicates the past losses and the taxes
paid:

10.    BDAC has maintained good growth rates in mobilizing deposits.  BDAC offers 0.5 percent
additional interest for large deposits. However, the real growth in terms of new loans/disbursals is
questionable as the quality of the loan portfolio cannot be determined. There appears to be an incidence of
rolled over loans with interest capitalized, and rescheduled loans and this cannot be quantified until MIS is
fully operational and adequate records are maintained. Table 3 indicates the growth rates.

Analysis of Financial Statements
11.    According to the performance ratios (Appendix 2), the interest income from loans as a percentage
of average loans outstanding has increased from 12.03 percent in FY96 to 13.04 percent in FY97. This is
on the higher side as the average interest rates are around 12 percent (and less for loans under special
projects e.g., social fund etc.), and assumes a recovery rate of 100 percent. The interest expenses in table 4
are understated and should therefore be taken as mere indicators.
Table 3 (LE millions)
Average deposits                         93.0        97.4      121.8       145.0      179.2
Interest expense on deposits             10.3        10.9       16.5       12.7*       18.2
Average borrowings                       130.5      116.1      145.6       198.4      202.0
Interest expense on borrowings           29.9        16.9       12.7       16.5*       18.9
Note:
(a)    Figures for FY93 are outstanding (not average) amounts.
(b)    FY96 interest expense on deposits and borrowings are understated when compared to the growth over the previous year.
Since FY92, the difference/excess cost in borrowings has been borne by PBDAC to avoid showing losses.
(c)    Borrowings are understated and do not include LE 42.6 million (FY97) received from PBDAC under various
special projects (e.g., Social Fund, Agriculture Modernization Project, etc.).
12.    BDAC's lending rates were reduced by three percent with effect from  February 1996 at the
instance of the Government and this has further exacerbated the situation. A service charge of one percent
was introduced in the last quarter of 1996, and has been recently increased to 1.25 percent. PBDAC is
committed to continue to increase progressively the fee in order to reach market rates applied by
commercial banks (short term lending rates of other commercial banks in Egypt is 12.9 percent excluding
service charge and the average medium term loan rates are in the range of 15 percent).
13.    Interest income is overstated.  With overdue loans constituting 13 percent of the total lomns
outstanding, and below average rates being applied for loans under special projects, the reported high
interest income of 13.04 percent as a percentage of total loans outstanding (Appendix 2) suggests that
BDAC may not be reversing interest accrued on overdue loans from interest income.
14.    BDAC has an unusually high loan to deposit ratio (table 5). According to the Bank's operational
guidelines 8.30, a maximum ratio of 70 percent is usually considered a prudent limit. Though idie
percentage of loan to deposits has been decreasing, it is still very high and indicates that BDAC has been
lending irrespective of its capacity to mobilize deposits.

15.    Table 5 indicates the total liability position of the BDAC. Though deposits as a source of funds of
total liabilities have grown significantly over FY96, there is a very heavy dependence on borrowings to
conduct their operations.

BDAC has opened 12 new offices/village banks in FY96. Administrative costs have been steadily rising
(includes capital expenditure of LE 2.1 million in FY96 and LE 1.2 million in FY97). Total establishment
costs have increased by 45 percent in FY97 over FY96. The high operating expenses combined with the
loan arrears, is contributing to the poor margins of the BDAC. Table 7 highlights the trend in
establishment expenses.

Note: The figures furnished above do not tally with the "Income statemenet and should be treated as indicators.
Capital adequacy
17.    According to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), BDAC should have an authorzed share capital of
LE 100 million and a paid up capital of LE 50 million. The total equity in FY97 was LE 20.9 milion
consisting of a share capital of LE 16.1 million and reserves of LE 4.7 million. A decision by the Board of
Directors of PBDAC was taken to recapitalize all the 17 BDACs by appropriating the grants towards share
capital. As of January 1, 1998, BDAC received a transfer thereby increasing the share capital to LE 80
million. The capital adequacy analysis is attached in Appendix 5.
Loan portfolio and asset quality
18.    The sector-wise distribution of loans is attached in Appendix 7. The data indicates a decine in
lending to direct agriculture and an increase in lending to non-agriculture related sectors in FY97.



44                                                           Egypt: Soha Rural Development Project
19.   Though the loan portfolio has been growing, the quality of the assets is difficult to determine. The
aging analysis of overdue loans is not in place and the classification guidelines of CBE are not being
uniformly applied. See Appendix 6 for loan classification. Internal controls have been weak. For example,
failure to take serious and decisive measures against defaulters resulting in a drop in loan collection rates,
recurring occurrences of loans being disbursed for settlement of previous loans, etc.
20.   The annual loan collection rates for BDAC are 90.61 percent for investment loans and 85.56
percent for seasonal agricultural loans. The recovery of loans under the Social Fund For Development
projects are however 100 percent. Information on rescheduled loans is not available. O.D. 8.30 criteria
suggests that not more than 20 percent of the loan portfolio should consist of rescheduled loans and not
more than 5 percent of the portfolio should have loans rescheduled more than once. Accounting and
operating systems will be put in place to generate MIS on rescheduled loans.
21.   The existing provisions for loan losses constitute only 2.1 percent of the outstanding loan portfolio
and is a matter of serious concern. Loan losses are not written off as per present practice. According to
CAA, bad debts amounting to LE 2.7 million due since 1985 are still outstanding. This issue is currently
under review by a Financial Management Study, carried out under the Agricultural Modemization Project,
and will be addressed under an institutional development and business plan prepared as part of the study.
Audit of accounts
22.   The accounts of BDAC are audited externally by the Central Audit Authority (CAA) which is an
autonomous agency responsible for auditing government accounts. The audit is carried out according to
the prevailing laws under which the BDACs and PBDAC were constituted. BDAC has provided the Bank
with the audited financial statements and comments of the Auditors for FY96.
Financial projections
23.   The financial projections are based on the audited statements of FY96 and provisional statements
for FY97. The inflation rates are based on the CAS. PBDAC has provided the projected balance sheet and
income statements of the BDAC Sohag for the next five years ending FY02. However, in the absence of
data on assumptions e.g., projected real growth rates, interest rates etc., these were modified and are
attached in Appendix 3 and 4.
Requirements for Financial Reporting
24.   BDAC would maintain its accounting systems in accordance with sound internationally recognized
accounting standards acceptable to IDA and IFAD. It would maintain independent separate accounts in the
general ledger for amounts received and disbursed under the project. MIS will be strengthened to generate
information from its accounting systems on an ongoing basis on the progress in disbursements, recoveries,
arrears etc.
25.   In addition to the above, and as part of the Assets and Liabilities management, MIS would be
strengthened to generate funds flow statements, maturities of assets and liabilities, annual budgets aLnd
quarterly progress reports. BDAC would maintain detailed memoranda relating to sub project cycle
progress including appraisals, approvals, borrower contribution, disbursals, interest rates, installments due,
collections made, arrears and follow-up action.

26.   Auditor's opinion and reports satisfactory to IDA would be provided within six months of the close
of the fiscal year, in such scope and detail as IDA and IFAD may reasonably request. Agreement to these
accounting and auditing arrangements was reached during negotiations.
Conclusion
27.   BDAC Sohag is playing an important role in mobilizing savings in the rural areas of the Sohag
govemorate located in Upper Egypt. It is the only bank in Sohag with a network of village banks serving
the rural population. Having highlighted above the major issues, it is critical to extend support for
institutional strengthening and access to long term resources for financing rural development.
28;   Based on the conclusions of the external Financial Management Review which would include
critical areas of: evaluating the quality of the loan portfolio, extent of arrears, loan losses, rescheduled
loans, provisioning, accounting practices, treatment of interest income, and capital adequacy, a detailed
Institutional Development Plan will be prepared. It was agreed during negotiations that consultants with
qualifications and terms of reference acceptable to IDA to carry out the Institutional Development Plan will
be recruited before June, 1999. Training would form an important component under the technical
assistance. Appendix 8 identifies the areas of training.
29.   Asset and liability management will be introduced for efficient financial planning. BDAC will
prepare projected cash flows and maturities of its assets and liabilities for efficient liquidity management.
As part of the institutional strengthening component, experienced professionals/chartered accountants will
be hired for this purpose.
30.   As for the rural finance component, BDAC would have separate accounting in the general ledger
for the loans disbursed under the proposed project. MIS should be provided on a quarterly basis on the
status of the loan similar to the one under the Agricultural Modernization Project and in addition, a
supplementary statement as being provided to the Social Fund for Development.

Annex 5B
Local Development Fund (LDF)
Corporate set up and management
1.    LDF was established as an autonomous legal entity within the Organization for the Reconstruction
and Development of the Egyptian Village (ORDEV) under a presidential decree no 310 of 1978. LDF
commenced operations in November 1979. Though an autonomous institution, LDF is in effect, a part of
ORDEV, which was until recently under the direct control and supervision of the Ministry of Local
Administration. ORDEV and LDF are now under the Ministry of Rural Development. The Local
administrative units (LAUs) through which the LDF operates, remain under the Ministry of Local
Administration.
2.    The management of LDF consists of a Board of Directors of 14 members and a technical sub-
committee for sanctioning loans. The Board meets once a month and the technical committee as frequent
as two to three times a week depending on the volume of business. The Chairman of the Board is
appointed for a term of three years. The incumbent since the inception of LDF has also been the Chairman
of ORDEV. The term of the directors is one year. The Chairman has powers to appoint members of ihe
Board. The constitution of the Board is attached in Appendix 8.
3.    The LDF management is highly centralized in the Chairman. The LDF has an independent office
in Cairo which is computerized and headed by a chief executive and a staff of 30. The chief executive is a
member of the loan committee. The accounts of LDF are maintained by ORDEV and financial statemenits
are prepared by ORDEV staff.
4.    Sohag govemorate headquarters' is located in Sohag city. The district is headed by a Goverror
who is appointed by the Ministry of Local Administration. The administration covers 11 districts and 51
local administrative units (LAUs). In addition, there are 268 affiliated villages and 1217 hamlets. The
lowest administrative unit has an executive council (nominated), and a popular council (elected). LD)F
(though now under a separate ministry) will continue to utilize the network of LAUs to serve the rural
population.
Reliability and Acceptability of Financial Statements
5.    The Balance sheet and income statement for the past four years (FY94 to FY97) and the projected
balance sheet and income statements for the next five years (FY98 to FY02) are attached in Appendices 1
and 2. The accounts of LDF are audited externally by the Central Audit Authority (CAA) which is an
autonomous govemment agency. The accounting standards are consistent with those of a government
organization and not of a Development Financial Institution (DFI). The financial statements appear to be
fairly reliable and reflect the financial situation of LDF.
6.    The accounting policies differ from that of a financial intermediary. For example, the provision for
loan losses of LE 8.1 million for FY96, was converted as share capital along with a major part of ithe
retained earnings with the result that though the share capital has increased substantially, the provisioning
for loan losses is nil. According to the CAA's report for FY96, some items have been recorded as advance



Egypt Sobag Rural Development Project                                                            57
payments but not received from  certain govemorates and companies for over 10 years, and other
miscellaneous amounts have not been settled since 1991.
7.     As LDF is a developmental lending institution and is not allowed to accept deposits from the public
or borrow for its operations (except with specific approval from the Ministry of Finance), it does not attract
the prudential regulations of the Central Bank with regard to classification of the loan portfolio, aging
analysis, provisioning, and capital adequacy. However, to fall in line with internationally-accepted
standards, it is necessary for LDF to classify its loan portfolio, and meet the provisioning requirements
similar to those of other financial institutions. To assess the quality of the loan portfolio, provisioning
requirements, and the accounting systems, an external audit will be conducted similar to that proposed for
the BDAC. It was agreed during negotiations that the LDF would complete by December 31, 1999 the
implementation of a program to strengthen its financial management and accounting.
Financial Analysis
8.     The performance ratios are attached in Appendix 2. The growth rates of the loan portfolio has been
good in real terms (see Table 1).

9.     However, in spite of increase in loans, the eanings performance has been disappointing. Interest
income from loans as a percentage of average total loans outstanding has declined from 8.9 percent in
FY96 to 7.4 percent in FY97 (Table 2). This has been attributed to a relaxation in grace period from one
production cycle to two production cycles. Despite the reduction in revenues, LDF has shown a profit of
LE 1.9 million for FY97 (LE 274 thousand in FY96). This increase in profits is mainly due to non-
provisioning for loan losses during the current year. Surplus has been transferred to retained earnings.
Table 2 reflects the trend in income earned.

10.    The lending rates of LDF are below market rates and range between 10.3 and 11.2 percent. LDF
has agreed to increase its lending rates to effective market rates of interest.
11.    The net intermediation margin of 7.4 percent (Appendix 2) is high due to two main factors: (a)
LDF sources of funds are free of cost, and (b) the operating expenses are minimal. The expenses of LDF
are understated and not comparable to other financial intermedianes. LDF has taken advantage of
ORDEV and has reduced the overhead expenses substantially. For example, salaries of the employees are

paid by ORDEV and the allowances are paid by LDF. The staff at the Local Administrative Units (LAUJ)
draw salaries and allowances from the Govemorate and receive incentives from LDF (see Table 3).

Capital adequacy
12.    LDF was originally capitalized by a USAID grant of US$18.0 million in 1978. LDF has been
steadily building up their reserves and the equity base is LE 36.9 million. The equity base exceeds the total
loan portfolio of LE 32.4 million which is highly unusual for a DFI and reflects a high liquid situation. An
amount of LE 10.3 million which constitutes 23.4 percent of the total assets is placed with commercial
banks (includes LE 8.6 million in interest bearing deposits). The debt to equity ratio is zero as LDF has
been financed through grants and subsidies. Table 4 indicates the existing capital structure.
Table 4 (LE)
N................. .......---'''''''!.
.... ........................... .............   ......................,::
Share capital as of June 20, 1996                  30,980,205
Subsidy from local government                       4,000,000
Surplus for current year (FY97)                     1,954,004
Total equity                                       36,934,209
13.    During FY 97, LDF converted its provisions for loan losses and retained earnings into shatre
capital3. The reason behind the decision for increasing the share capital and eliminating the provisions :For
loan losses is not clear. According to CAA, there are old debts outstanding. This will be reduced from
capital to arrive at the net position. LDF will be required to follow the guidelines applicable to a financial
intermediary in this regard.
Loan portfolio and asset quality
14.    The project categories financed in FY97 is attached in Appendix 5. A project usually consists of a
small group of borrowers engaging in similar enterprise activities. Out of the total project disbursals,
poulty constituted 22.9 percent, followed by transport, 22.6 percent The maximum amount of loans
disbursed were to Dhakalia govemorate 20.2 percent, followed by El Gharbia govemorate, 17.6 percent
Share of loans to Sohag govemorate in FY97 was about 2 percent of total LDF disbursements (see
Appendix 5). The asset quality is difficult to determine in the absence of loan classification and aging
analysis.
3 See Balance Sheet, Appendix 1.

15.   The collateral requirements are less stringent when compared to commercial banks. Ordinarily, a
promissory note (called checks), asset acquired under the loan and two guarantees (of government
employees) are accepted. Borrower's contribution of not less than 20 percent and up to 45 percent in the
case of vehicle loans is insisted upon before disbursing the loan. Where the borrower owns land, this is
accepted as collateral in lieu of guarantees.
16.   The loan sanctioning powers of LDF are vested in the loan committee at headquarters. The loan
committee consists of 2 members from the Board and 8 permanent members from universities specialized
in areas which include agriculture, national planning and economics. Members are appointed by the
chairman for a term of one year. Meetings are presided by the Chief Manager of LDF and ORDEV.
Proposals are prepared and submitted by the specialist in feasibility studies. The committee meets at
frequent intervals. LDF has agreed during naegotiations, to delegate loan approval authority to the local
levels up to a ceiling of LE 10,000 per borrower. (LAUs LE 2,500, District level up to LE 5,000 and
Govemorate up to LE 10,000.)
17.   The loan appraisal standards adopted by the management are sound and on the conservative side
particularly with regard to borrower's contribution which is usually higher than the minimum set. This is
to ensure a higher stake of the borrower in the enterprise and to minimize the interest burden. The nine
feasibility study experts at LDF are well trained. However, the scale of operation of the LDF is very small
compared to those of Sohag BDAC.
18.   There is regular follow up from LAUs which are responsible for collections and the incentives
offered by LDF are linked to collections/recoveries. The recovery rate is 95 percent. About 18 projects
were rescheduled amounting to LE 930,000 in FY97. The decisions to reschedule loans are taken at
headquarters. For an accurate estimate of the asset quality, LDF has been required to put in place MIS for
arrears analysis, collection analysis, rescheduled loans, and classify its loan portfolio similar to those of
other DFI's.
19.   There exists a long standing dispute between the Ministry of Finance and LDF over the amount
apportioned by privatization of certain earlier projects. Initially, LDF was required to invest in the share
capital of the enterprise it financed. Subsequently, the govemment decided to sell these projects. The
amnount from the sale of about 23 projects was deposited with the government and LDF is yet to recover
their investment.
Audit of accounts
20.   The accounts of LDF are audited externally by the Central Audit Authority (CAA) which is an
autonomous agency of the government responsible for government accounts. The audit is however not
comprehensive and geared towards a DFI. For example, the audit report for FY96 provided, does not
cover the loan portfolio, lending practices, adequacy of provisioning, loan arrears etc.
Financial Projections
21.   LDF does not prepare business plans. In the absence of their forecast, the rnission has prepared
projections on conservative estimates. The projected balance sheet and income statement for the next five
years i.e., from FY98 to FY02 is attached, see Appendices 3 and 4.

22.   Income has been projected based on existing lending rates. At this growth rate, combined with low
levels of operating expenses, the profitability and the net intermediation margin appears to be satisfactory.
Introduction of market rates for lending operations would increase the profitability significantly.
Financal Reporting to the Bank
23.   LDF will be required to upgrade its accounting systems to conform to internationally recognized
accounting standards acceptable to IDA and IFAD. A separate sub account will be opened in the books of
LDF for the amounts received from IDA/1FAD and at the governorate level to monitor the performance
including: disbursals, arrears, and recoveries made under the project.
24.   LDF would establish a Management Information System (MIS) that would generate quarterly
progress reports, summary loan statements, and information reflecting the utilization of the credit line.
Audited financial statements and auditor's opinion satisfactory to IDA would be provided within six
months from the close of the financial year in such scope and detail as IDA and IFAD may reasonably
request Agreement on the accounting and auditing arrangements was reached during negotiations.
Conclusion
25.   LDF is playing a small but important role in providing access to credit to the rural population.
Limited sources of funding, combined with a conservative approach have constrained expansion. The
management team is extremely dedicated to the cause of rural development and deserves support. The
project appraisals are standardized and the LDF and LAUs have gained sufficient experience over thie
years in handling rural credit.
26.   LDF has agreed having its accounting and financial reporting upgraded to conform to that of a DFI.
To achieve this, it will be necessaiy for the proposed external auditors to review the existing accounting
and operating procedures and suggest changes that need to be made by LDF to fall in line with
international accounting standards (IAS). The recommendations will be implemented before December
31, 1999. The internal audit and accounting departments will be brought under direct control of LDF.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
A. Procurement Methods (Table A and B)
1.    The project elements, their estimated costs, and the procurement arrangements for the
components to be financed by IDA are summarized in Table A.
2.    All IDA-financed civil works, equipment and materials would be procured in
accordance with the Bank Procurement Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD and IDA
Credits published by the Bank in January 1995 and revised January and August 1996 and
September 1997. Procurement of Consultants services and technical assistance would follow
Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers
published by the Bank in January 1997 and revised September 1997. Preference for
domestically-manufactured goods will apply in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines.
Project components not financed by the World Bank would be procured in accordance with
national regulations or the guidelines of the co-financing institutions. The Bank's standards
bidding documents would be used for all procurement under International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) and, with modifications acceptable to the Bank and in Arabic language, also for National
Competitive Bidding (NCB). A procurement plan detailing the packaging and estimated
schedule for major procurement is presented in Table BI.
3.    Goods. To the maximum extend possible, the procurement of goods, including
vehicles and equipment, for the Local Institutions Strengthening component would be through
packages and lots of similar items. Each package would have and estimated contract value
above US$200,000 equivalent and would be procured using ICB procedures in accordance
with IDA guidelines. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) would apply for procurement of
goods at estimated contract values between US$20,000 and US$200,000 per procurement, up
to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$500,000 equivalent. Goods estimated to cost less
than $20,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$250,000
equivalent, may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of National Shopping (NS)
procedures by obtaining at least three quotations from capable local suppliers. Eligible
Egyptian manufacturers competing under ICB procedures may be eligible for Domestic
Preference in accordance with Appendix 2 of the World Bank Guidelines.
4.    Works. Civil works under the Village Infrastructure Component would include: small
potable water systems or extension of potable water systems, upgrading of rural road, village
youth centers, literacy centers, classrooms, etc. Civil works would consist of small works in
rural villages and hamlets. No ICB procurement of the works would be feasible, as the nature
and small size of the contract would be unattractive for international contractors. Civil works
exceeding a value of US$100,000 would be procured through NCB procedures, advertised
nationally, but foreign contractors would not be excluded. Works estimated to cost less than

$100,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000, may be procured
under lump sum fixed contracts awarded on the basis of quotations from community-based
contractors, responding to announcements posted in public places. Procedures used for
National Shopping shall be in accordance with paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 and 3.15 of the World
Bank Guidelines.
5.    Procurement of farm machinery, equipment and goods through the lines of credit
would follow commercial practices. This would involve numerous dealerships and
beneficiaries and a wide range of equipment. Most import orders would be in the range of
US$5,000 to US$200,000.
6.    Consultants and training services for institutional building and detailed engineering and
construction supervision services above an estimated contract value of US$100,000 would be
selected in accordance to the Quality and Cost-Based (QCBS) method. For others consulting
and training contracts, the selection would follow Consultant's Qualifications-Based (CQB)
and Individual Consultants (IC) method. Single Source selection would be used under special
conditions and require IDA's prior agreement.
7.    A procurement plan and standards bidding documents for NCB and community-based
procedures have been prepared as part of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP).
B. Prior Review Thresholds (Table B)
8.    All contracts for works, goods and equipment exceeding US$200,000, would be
subject to prior and approval by the Bank. In addition, the first three contracts to be advertised
for procurement of works, irrespective of value, would be subject to IDA's prior review. For
consultancy assignments financed by IDA, there would be prior review for contracts worth
US$100,000 and above for contracts with consulting firms and US$50,000 and above for
contracts with individual consultants. This would result in prior review for about 80 percent
for goods and 30 percent for works of Bank-financed procurement. The contract review
arrangements are summarized in Table B.
Disbursement
C. Allocation of Loan Proceeds (Table C)
9.    The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed against the project components as shown
in Table C. Agreement was reached during negotiations, that annual audit reports of the
project account and SOEs would be prepared by auditors acceptable to IDA, within six months
of the end of the fiscal year.
D. Use of Statements of Expenses (SOEs)
10.   Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOE) for contracts
for: (i) works and goods valued under US$200,000 equivalent; (ii) consulting services (firms)
valued under US$100,000 equivalent; and (iii) consulting services (individuals) valued under
US$50,000 equivalent.

E. Special Account
11.   To facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures, three Special Accounts would
be established for IDA, and three for IFAD. Each implementing agency (GOS, PBDAC and
LDF respectively) would have one account for each financing agency (IDA and IFAD). The
Government would establish four Special Accounts in a commercial bank: (i) two Special
Accounts for the expenditures under the local institutions strengthening and village
infrastructure components, with initial deposits of US$0.8 million out of the IDA credit and
US$0.8 million out of the WFAD loan; and (ii) two Special Accounts for expenditures under the
micro-credit sub-component managed by the LDF, with initial deposits of US$200,000 out of
the IDA credit and US$200,000 out of the IFAD loan. PBDAC would open on its books two
Special Accounts, with initial deposit of US$800,000 out of the IDA credit and US$800,000
out of the IFAD loan for expenditures under the rural credit sub-component implemented by
the Sohag PBDAC. The SAs will be replenished on a monthly basis or when at least on third
of the balance has been withdrawn, whichever occurs first. The Special Accounts would be
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit report would be
submitted to IDA for review and approval within six months at the end of each fiscal year.
Agreement was reached at negotiations on the above provisions for the operation and auditing
of the Special Accounts.
Co-financing Arrangements
12.   IFAD would cofinance the same infrastructure, credit, and institutional building
components as the IDA Credit; however, the borrower will assign expenditures entirely to
IFAD or to IDA on the basis of separate contracts or activities and will, to the extent possible,
ensure that commitments under the two operations are made on a pari-passu basis.

Annex 8
Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project
Environmental Management Plan
A.    Overview
1.    Introduction. The Sohag Govemorate is a long narrow strip of land along the west bank of the
Nile River and adjacent to the Red Sea mountain chain. The climate is hot and dry with a short cool
winter and negligible annual rainfall. The local ecosystem is very fragile with a limited natural resource
base. The objective of the proposed Sohag Rural Development Project is to support the sustainable
development of rural villages in the Sohag Govemorate through the participatory approach initiated by
the National Program for Integrated Rural Development Program (SHROUK). The project aims to
promote sustainable rural development by improving income and quality of life in rural communities
through infrastructure and by making access to credit more equitable for the rural poor, unemployed
youth and women. A subsidiary objective of the proposed Project will be to conserve natural resources
and improve environmental management. A review of the potential environmental issues associated
with the proposed Project was developed to support Project preparation and an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared to address environmental issues during the
implementation process.
2.    Environmental Aspects. Implementation of the proposed Project is anticipated to have an
overall positive environmental impact through support for improvements in village level infrastructure,
especially from new investments and rehabilitation of current investrnents related to water supply and
sanitation, health services and upgrading of rural roads. The Project has been placed in environmental
screening Category "B" consistent with the environmental procedures of the World Bank in
consultation with representatives of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) and local
environmental authorities. It has been placed in this screening category due to the limited and
predictable impacts of the types of small-scale interventions it would support and the ability to address
these issues through the use of project specific environmental guidelines. Given the small-scale types of
activities to be supported, the emphasis on rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and the participatory
basis for sub-project selection, it is not anticipated that the proposed Project would result in
involuntarily resettlement or adverse impacts to archaeological and/or historical sites. The Project
would include the use of archeological "chance find procedures" in case buried archaeological and/or
historical materials are discovered during construction activities.
3.    Three Complementary Components. The proposed Project includes the following
complementary interventions which have been individually subject to the environmental screening
process:
(a)    Component A - Local Institutions Strengthening Component (US$5.5 million) which
supports strengthening the capacity of local administration at the Govemorate, district
and local levels to assist communities in identifying, prioritizing, appraising and
maintaining the assets financed under the Project (environmental screening Category
"C");



86                                                       Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project
(b)   Component B - Village Infrastructure Component (US$47.5 million) which supports
identification, preparation and co-financing of Village Priority Development Plans
through the SHROUK participatory process (environmental screening Category "B");
and
(c)    Component C - Rural Finance Component (US$23 million) which would help
improve the standard of living of rural poor in Sohag by promoting increased economic
activities; opening access to credit for the ultra-poor; assisting in developing rural
financial markets, through the Local Development Fund (US$3.4 millioni for micro-
loans (environmental screening Category "C"); and the Sohag Bank for Development
and Agriculture Credit (BDAC) (US$19.9 million) to provide long-term resources
through a line of credit for small-scale on-farn technology and agro-business
investments and a line of credit for micro loans (environmental screening Category
"C").
It should be noted that the Development Credit Agreement includes specific language that loan
proceeds cannot be used under the Sohag BDAC Sub-Component for the financing of any type of
facilities for the formulation, packaging and repackaging of pesticides, including insecticides,
fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides, molluscides, fumigants or other hazardous chemicals;
B.    On-Going Environmental Activities
4.    National Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines. The EEAA, in cooperation with
all concerned ministries and national organizations, and with the assistance of the Danish Intemational
Development Agency (DANEDA), has prepared "Guidelines for Egyptian Environmental Impact
Assessment" (EIA Guidelines) in Arabic and English. These EIA Guidelines have been developed to
assist the competent authorities and licensing agencies in implementing the Articles of Law 4 of 1994
concerned with Environmental Impact Assessment requirements for new projects. In addition, the
Arabic and English versions of the World Bank Environmental Assessment Sourcebook are available
to provide complementary information on a wide number of sectors and issues. Egypt also has well
developed legislation conceming the protection of archaeological and historical sites and World Bank
guidance concerning these issues has also been prepared in Arabic and English.
5.    Environmental Action Plan for Sohag Governorate. In the context of the "Support to
Environmental Assessment and Management Project (SEAM)", an Environmental Action Plan (EAP)
for the Sohag Govemorate was prepared in January 1998, supported by the United Kingdom's
Department For International Development (DFID). The plan has identified a series of priority issues
which include the need for: (a) infrastructure and environmental service improvements; (b) improved
resource conservation, planning and development; and (c) a better environmental planning and
management system. The SEAM covered the legal and regulatory aspects of environmental
management including laws, decrees, bylaws, licensing arrangements, codes of practice and other
mechanisms. It also evaluated the use of economic instruments and institutional measures which could
be linked to environmental management actions. These recommended measures are designed to ensure
that future developments in the Govemorate will be environmentally sound, consistent with Law 4 of
1994, and monitorable in relation to established environmental criteria. They also support
implementation of Law 48 which aims to control pollution of both potable and non-potable waters hi
the entire Nile system, including the irrigation and drainage network.

C.    Elements of the Environmental Management Plan
6.    Environment in the SHROUK Process. The SHROUK process to be used in the Project
emphasizes the participation of village representatives in the identification of needs, selection of
priorities, financial participation in the cost of village infrastructure, and sustainable operation and
maintenance. Community development facilitators (mandub and manduba) at the village level play an
important role in facilitating the dialogue between the rural population and the administration. They are
also expected to play a key role in raising the environmental awareness of the rural population of the
Sohag Govemorate. The participatory process is designed to ensure that, prior to investment and
implementation, the selected activities are assessed for their technical and financial feasibility as well as
their enviromnental soundness and potential environmental impact. The environmental concerns of the
EEAA have been embodied in the SHROUK process by having the anticipated enviromnental impact
of a proposed investment described as an element of each feasibility study to be proposed for support
under the Project
7.    Elements of the Environmental and Management Plan. The Environmental Management
Plan for the proposed Project includes the following elements:
(a)    Strengthening the Environmental Management Unit;
(b)   Sub-Project Environmental Review;
(c)   Environmental Awareness Program;
(d)   Environmental Training Program, and
(e)   Monitoring and Reporting.
These elements are to be funded by contributions from the Government of Egypt and Govemorate of
Sohag; support from the UK-DFID under a separate project, the World Bank and IFAD. The EMP
would be implemented concurrently with the other elements of the proposed Project. The EMP has an
estimated budget over the life of the Project of US$976,081 which is summarized in Table 1. In
addition the UK-DFID is considering finance demonstrations projects for solid waste management for
an amount of about US$640,000.
8.    Role of the Environmental Management Unit. Under the proposed Project, the final review
and approval of sub-projects will be done at the Govemorate level. Consistent with this decentralized
approach to decision making, the Environmental Management Unit (EMU), which is directly affiliated
with the Governor's Office, will be responsible for reviewing the environmental aspects of the
proposed sub-projects. Currently, the EMU is staffed by a Director who is supported by a Secretary
and one Environmental Officer. As part of the proposed Project, the EMU will be fully staffed by the
Govemor's Office to include four full-time personnel to be assigned to a Secretariat and four
Operational Divisions: (a) Environmental Management and Monitoring; (b) Solid and Hazardous
Wastes; (c) Environmental Public Awareness; and (d) Studies and Research. In addition, arrangements
would be made by the Governor's Office to establish an operational relationship between the EMU and
locally based personnel responsible for archaeological and historical sites.
9.    Strengthening the Environmental Management Unit In order to strengthen the EMU to
support implementation of the EAP and to conduct environmental review of sub-projects under



88                                                       Egypt: Sohag Rural Developmnent Project
Component B - Village Infrastructure Programn of the proposed Project, assistance would be provided
by UK-DFID, IDA and IFAD to strengthen the EMU. The GOE would provide adequate office space
for the expanded EMU, as well as office furniture, storage cabinets and air conditioners, as a local
contribution to the proposed Project. Support from the project would be provided to train personnel
from the EMU and other cooperating local organizations, provide basic office equipment, selected
types of field equipment and a limited number of vehicles. The salaries and operational budget for the
EMU, including local travel costs to support environmental review of Project activities will be provided.
by the GOE as a counterpart contribution.
10.   Sub-Project Environmental Review. The EMU would implement a program of Sub-Project:
Environmental Reviews for activities proposed for funding under Component B - Village Infrastructure
Program that may have a potential adverse environmental impact. These sub-projects may have aL
maximum value of US$500,000, making them extremely limited in their size and scope. Therefore,
they are suitable for a simplified environmental review and monitoring procedure which is significantly
less complicated and expensive than a full Environmental Impact Assessment. As noted above in
paragraph 6, the approach adopted in the SHROUK process is designed to ensure that the anticipatecl
environmental impact of a proposed investment is described as an element of each feasibility study to
be proposed for support under the Project. These "environmental reviews" would be prepared by the
Sub-Project sponsor, as an integral part of the feasibility study, and would follow a standardized formalt
that includes the following elements: (a) review of the current environmental conditions at the site, (b)
assessment of potential environmental impact associated with the proposed activity, (c) assessment oiF
potential environmental impact associated with the implementation phase of the proposed activity, ancl
(d) review, in coordination with antiquities authorities, of potential impacts to archaeological ancl
historical sites from the proposed activity. In addition, the "environmental reviews" would consider any
required land acquisition for the proposed acfivity and identify any anticipated needs for involuntary
resettlement.
11.   Sub-Project Types Requiring Environmental Reviews. The following types of proposecl
sub-projects would be subject to these environmental reviews:
(a)   Road Overpasses;
(b)   Filling Up of WastewaterPonds;
(c)    Construction of Slaughterhouses;
(d)   Rehabilitation of Rural Health Centers;
(e)   Rehabilitation and Pavement of Rural Road;
(f)    Extension of Water Pipes;
(g)    Construction of New Wells; and
(h)    Construction of Pumping Stations.
Additional types of sub-projects may be added during the course of Project implementation and their
inclusion on this list would be by agreement between representatives of the implementing agency,
environmental authorities and IDA.
12.   Review and Approval Process. These "environmental reviews" would be subject to review
and approval by the EMU. This process would need to be undertaken in a timely manner consistent



Egypt: Sohag Rural Development Project                                             89
with established review and comment periods developed for activities under Component B. The EMN
would be expected to evaluate the "environmental review" for each sub-project, which would include
meetings with representatives of the organization(s) responsible for the design, implementation and
operation of the Sub-Project. In most cases, the EMU staff would be expected to make a site visit to
review the specific details of the proposed Sub-Project prior to providing an approval. The EMU
would be encouraged to discuss the environmental aspects of proposed sub-projects with local
officials, residents and NGOs.
13.   Environmental Awareness Program. The proposed Project would support training in
environmental awareness for personnel from the EMU, District Supervisors of SHROUK's community
development facilitators ("mandub" and "manduba") and selected NGO representatives. The focus of
the training program would be on the "training of trainers" to allow for a multiplier effect. In addition,
support would be provided for a series of Project supported outreach programs. Special attention
would be given to water supply and sanitation projects. The training will be delivered in conjunction
with regularly organized training sessions organized as part of the SHROUK methodology.
14.   Environmental Training Program. With the support of the United Kingdom, and potentially
other bilateral donors, an Environmental Training Program would be conducted at the level of the
Sohag Govemorate. This Program would focus on development of the skills of EMU personnel, other
Govemorate environmental personnel, staff from line ministries and NGOs, in regard to environmental
and natural resources management It is anticipated that the Program would include the following
activities:
(a)   Environmental Planning and Management Training would be provided to the
management staff of the Govemorate and Under-Secretaries of line ministnes in the
Govemorate concening: (i) effective management of natural resources and
environmental management with an emphasis on minimization of pollution; and (ii)
review and discussion of applicable environmental and natural resources legislation,
procedures, enforcement and monitoring programs;
(b)   Environmental Impact Assessment. Training would be provided to EMU staff, other
Govemorate environmental personnel, staff from line ministries and NGOs in
implementation of the new Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines. This would
include: (i) the legal requirements, methods and techniques of EIA; and (ii)
development of appropriate review procedures; and
(c)   Environmental Monitoring and Enforcement. Training would be provided to
professional and technical staff of EMU, Govemorate (including Districts and Local
Administrative Units); line ministries with responsibilities for sub-projects, and NGOs.
This would include training concerning: (i) development of technical skills for data
collection and interpretation; (ii) the importance of standardizing monitoring
techniques; and (iii) support for design of compliance strategies and monitoring
programs.
D.    Environmental Management Plan - Monitoring and -Supervision
15.   Monitoring and Reporting. The EMU will conduct routine monitoring of environmental
aspects of Project supported sub-projects, during their implementation and operational phases. as an
element of a work plan which would be agreed to on an annual basis between the implementing

agency, the EMU and the Bank. These monitoring reports would follow a standardized format and
would be based on field visits to representative and/or problematic sub-projects. They would be
included as an element of Environmental Reports which are to be submitted by the EMU to the
implementing agency and the Bank as an element of the Project reporting process.
16.    Project Supervision - Environmental Aspects. The Project Supervision Plan will include the
participation of an environmental specialist in selected missions, the Mid-Term Review and in the
Implementation Completion Report, to review progress in implementation of the EMP. These
supervision missions would include review of the performance and institutional development of the
EMU, implementation of the environmental review procedures for sub-projects, and progress in
environmental awareness activities at the local level. These reports would also note the status and
progress of bilaterally funded activities which support development of the EMU and implementation of
complementary actions to the E     in the Sohag Govemorate.

an element of Environmental Reports which art to be submitted by the BMU to the impleenting agency and thc Bank
as an element of the Project reporting process.
JUSThICATION/RAflNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CATEGORY:
The Project has been placed in envimental screnimg category "B" consistent with the environmental procedures of
the World Bank in consulution with representatives of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) and local
environmental authorities. It has been placed in this screening category due to dte limited and predictable impacts of the
types of small-scale interventions it would support and the ability to addrcs these isues through the use of project
speciiic eavironmena guidelines. Given the small-scale types of activities to bc suppurted, the cmphlsis on
rehabilitation of existing infiastucture and the participatory basis for sub-project selection, it is not anticipated that the
proposed Project would result in involuntariLy resettlement or advcrse impacts to archaeological andtor historical sites.
The Project would include the use of archeological 'chance find procedures" In case buried archaeol-,,ical and/or
historical mateals are discovered during construction activities.
