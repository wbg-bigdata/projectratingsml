BRAZIL
ELETROBRAS II Power Distribution Project
Project Summary
Borrower:            ELETROBRAS (Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A.)
Guarantor:           Federal Republic of Brazil
Amount:              US$250.6 million equivalent.
Terms:               Repayable in 15 years, including 3 years grace at the Bank's
standard variable rate.
Project Objective and Description:
The project would provide expansion of power distribution systems in
seven different areas of Brazil. ELETROBRAS would on-lend the proceeds of the
loan to seven different beneficiaries for subprojects covering subtransmission
lines (up to 138 kV) substations, distribution lines and associated transformers,
low-voltage distribution, common connections, general services and related
auxiliary equipment.
Benefits and Risks:
The expansion of the seven beneficiaries' distribution systems will
provide for extensions, strengthening and improvements, with emphasis on providing
electricity in rural areas and to low-income consumers. System losses will be
reduced, repressed demand will be satisfied, and about 2 million new consumers
will be connected, thereby improving the quality of life of about 8 million
people. There are no special risks involved.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Bank has made nine loans to the Brazilian power sector since
1976 of which six have been for power distribution projects (para. 2.24).
Three of these were made to ELETROBRAS (the holding and finance company for
the Brazilian power sector) for on-lending to power utility companies. These
loans financed sub-projects that were, in effect, portions of time-slices of
the beneficiaries' general investment programs for power distribution, and
all these sub-projects emphasized supply to rural and low-income consumers.
1.02      For the first two of these loans, (1300-BR and 1538-BR) the Bank
identified, helped prepare, appraised and supervised the respective sub-
projects. But starting with the most recent loan (2138-BR, approved in May
1982), ELETROBRAS has taken over the Bank's identification, preparation,
appraisal and supervisory functions (para. 2.24). This means that the role
of the Bank now consists in assisting ELETROBRAS in maintaining the required
capabilities, and in ensuring that the high technical and financial quality
normally expected in Bank financed projects is maintained.
1.03      There are various advantages in this new modus operandi, both for
ELETROBRAS and for the prospective beneficiaries, and, therefore, for the
whole of the Brazilian power sector. If the Bank were to continue with
direct appraisal and supervision of such sub-projects, staff limitations
would make it impossible to appraise and supervise the large number of
sub-projects currently envisaged: there were five subprojects in loan
2138-BR, seven subprojects have been included in the loan now proposed an,'
ELETROBRAS will identify further sub-projects for possible future loans,
Thus the assumption of the Bank's appraisal and supervision functions by
ELETROBRAS provides a strong multiplying effect for the Bank's influence.
1.04      ELETROBRAS and prospective beneficiaries alike appreciate the
benefits of the application of Bank techniques to technical, organizational
and financial problems, and are anxious for a wider application of the Bank's
influence. Also, the greater involvement of ELETROBRAS in power distribution
projects will counter-balance the natural tendency (in resource allocation
decisions) to neglect the more pedestrian power distribution projects in
favor of the more glamorous and sometimes grandiose generation and
transmission projects. Thus we are encouraging a healthier balance in the
development of the power sector as a whole.
1.05      The Project now proposed for Bank financing consists of seven
subprojects. These are to be carried out by 7 beneficiaries, and represent
portions of time-slices of their current investment programs. These
investment programs are designed to improve and expand the beneficiaries'
distribution systems, with emphasis on providing electricity in rural areas
and to low-income consumers. The programs provide for the use of consultants
as appropriate (para. 4.01), and the appraisal reports of ELETROBRAS contain
recommendations for institutional improvements where needed (para. 4.02).



- 2 -
1.06      The total project cost, including physical and financing
contingencies and front-end fee in IBRD loan, is about US$785.6 million.
Non-borrowing sources will provide for about US$336.9 million, local
borrowing for about US$132.0 million, and the proposed IBRD loan for US$250.6
million. This leaves a gap of about US$66.1 million that should come from
foreign commercial banks by way of cofinancing (para. 4.22).
1.07      In line with the role of ELETROBRAS, this appraisal has focused on
ELETROBRAS' financial situation and its capability for assuming the functions
previously carried out by the Bank. In general, the finances of ELETROBRAS,
which reflect the sector finances, show a deteriorating trend which will be
reversed during the project period. The project is technically,
economically, financially, and institutionally well prepared. Most of the
beneficiaries will benefit from the institution-
building influence of the project (paras. 4.01-4.07), and all subprojects
cover areas where there will be a significant social impact.
1.08      As for ELETROBRAS' capability, the progress of the previous loan
(2138-BR) and the completion of the appraisal reports are evidence of a
satisfactory situation. It will, of course, be necessary to monitor project
implementation as usual and to continue providing backup for preparation of
further projects and for supervision of those under implementation, but there
is no reason to expect that implementation would raise problems.
1.09      A proposal for another loan to ELETROBRAS is being considered by
the Bank simultaneously with this one. It is for Rural Electrification
projects in the states of Minas Gerais and Parana, and it is the first of its
kind for Brazil.



2. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
The Energy Sector
- Energy Resources
2.01      Brazil's energy resources comprise a vast hydropotential, as well
as oil shale, coal, nuclear fuels and biomass. Proven oil and gas reserves
are limited. Of the indigenous energy resources only hydro and biomass
currently play a significant role in the country's energy supply mix, though
oil production has increased significantly in the last three years and
currently covers about 24% of market requirements. The potential for
hydroelectric development is estimated at about 213,000 MW of which about
32,900 MW had been developed by the end of 1982 and about 10,000 MW of
additional hydro capacity are scheduled to be commissioned by 1987.
Presently the government is making important efforts to both increase oil
production and substitute alcohol, coal and other energy sources for oil.
The alcohol program, introduced in 1975, has already resulted in an average
alcohol content in automotive fuel of 19% (1980) and it is expected that by
1985 it will have risen to 39%. Coal now represents about 4% of the energy
supply and, by using it in coal-fired thermal power plants and in industry,
the government expects that by 1987 it will provide 6% of the total energy
supply. Brazil is also developing a nuclear generating capacity which should
have an important role in electricity generation beyond the year 2010, when
most of the economic exploitable hydro resources would be already utilized.
Efforts are also being conducted for a more intensive utilization of other
energy resources, including burning wood and sugarcane bagasse for
electricity generation in isolated areas.
- Energy Demand and Supply
2.02      The table below illustrates the structure of Brazil's primary
energy balance and final use of energy by sectors in 1981, and compares these
to the 1976 figures. As may be seen, even though oil production has
increased 30% between 1976 and 1981, approximately one third of energy
requirements are still met through imports, thus reflecting the vulnerability
of the economy to fluctuations in foreign oil supplies and prices.   Never-
theless, oil participation in the energy balance has decreased from 47% in
1976 to 40% in 1981 mainly due to the increasing utilization of alcohol whose
share in the country's energy supply grew from 7% in 1976 to 10% in 1981.

- National Energy Policy
2.03      National energy policy has the following main objectives:
(a) conservation and rational use of energy to encourage maximum
efficiency in the utilization of energy resources;
(b) substitution of imported by domestic energy sources, especially
"renewables", wherever technically and economically feasible, to
reduce dependence on imported petroleum and coal;
(c) exploitation of existing domestic energy resources and
intensification of search for new sources; and
(d) promotion of electricity usage through extension of distribution
coverage in urban and rural areas.
The Power Sector
- Policies and Objectives
2.04      The power sector has a major role to play in achieving the national
energy policy objectives listed above. Pricing is of key importance in
conservation, and in this area progress has been made through marginal cost
tariff studies undertaken under loans 1300-BR and 1939-BR. Recent legisla-
tion permits the implementation of the results of these studies, which is
expected to take several years. In August 1982 differentiated tariffs for
peak and off-peak demands, and for wet and dry periods, were offered, on an
optional basis, to high-voltage consumers. On average, current tariffs would
have to be increased by 40% - 50% to catch up with long-run marginal costs.
This gap will progressively narrow with the implementation of the tariff
agreement reached between the Bank and the Government (para.2.19 & 2.20).
2.05      The energy policies in the power sector give emphasis to the use of
indigenous primary energy resources (hydro power, coal, and uranium; see'
para. 2.13). The scope for further substitution of oil in power generation
is presently very limited in the main interconnected systems (in 1981 96% of
energy generated was hydro) but oil-fired plant is still required for some
isolated systems, specially in the North. Current expansion programs assume
that increase in demand up to the year 2000 will be met mainly by hydro
plants and that coal and nuclear plants will mainly provide the required
energy reserve for dry hydrological conditions. The substitution policy at
the consumer level is based mainly on replacing the widely used liquid
petroleum gas (LPG) fueled appliances (mainly cookers and water heaters) with
electric appliances. This substitution is slow, due to the consumer's
reluctance to invest in new appliances, and expensive, given the large
investments required for expanding of distribution networks.
2.06      Present government plans also provide for the gradual substitution
of electricity for petroleum products in the transportation sector (railways
and urban transport) and in industry ("Eletrotermia" program), taking
advantage of existing hydro capacity. Interruptible service at low rates is
currently being offered in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, to
induce industry to increase its use of electricity. Autoproducers with
oil-fired generating capacity are also being induced, through tariffs, to
increase their purchases of electricity generated from hydro sources.



-6-
- Organization
2.07      The institutional develcpment of the Brazilian power sector over
the last 50 years has been characterized by progressive nationalization and
growing centralization, resulting in the consolidation of a few large and
hundreds of smal'l utilities into E. relatively compact structure of state and
federally-owned utilities.  The power sector is under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Mines and Energy (HME) (See Annex 2-1), created in 1960. Since
then the drive has been towards increasing sector efficiency and coordination
with the establishment of Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (ELETROBRAS) in 1962
(para. 3.01) and the strengthening of the Departamento Nacional de Aguas e
Energia Eletrica (DNAEE) as regulatory agency. The aim has been to combine,
as far as possible, regionalization of operations with country-wide
optimization.
2.08      Though compliex and one of the largest in the world, the electric
power sector is well organized and past policies have generally been well
formulated and applied. Decree 60,824 of June 7, 1967 established the
current sector organization under which DNAEE performs regulatory functions,
grants licenses for generating plants, assigns concessions, sets tariffs
(after approval by the Ministry of Planning), and approves expansion plans.
ELETROBRAS serves as a utility holding company, administers public funds for
use by its subsidiaries and by staLte-owned utilities and coordinates external
borrowings. ELETROBRAS also analyzes expansion plans for major generating
and transmission facilities and cc'ordinates and supervises the public power
system (See Chapter 3).
2.09      Government guidelines contained in the 1967 decree mentioned above
promote consolidation of public electricity services in the individual states
into single state-owned utilities. This has resulted in the absorption by
the major state-owned companies of many municipal and privately owned
utilities. Despite this process of consolidation, the sector still comprises
600 concessionaires, of which 25 are state companies and the rest small
municipal and private undertakings,
- Growth of Demand and Supply
2.10      During the 1977-1981 period electricity production by the public
supply system rose from 100,000 GWh to 140,000 GWh, at an average annual
growth rate of 8.7%.  The 1981 national average production of electricity was
1,011 kWh per capita.  The industrial sector uses 57% of the electricity and
the residential sector 20%. Due to the high industrial and urban
concentration in the states of Sac, Paulo and Rio de Jane:iro the geographical
distribution of demand is uneven. Less than 60% of Brazilian households are
electrified but in the rural area about 19% of dwellings are electrified; the
rural electrification ratio goes from 40% in the state oi Rio de Janeiro to
an insignificant 1% in Bahia.
2.11      Comprehensive projections of electricity requirements based on
detailed sectoral analysis, prepared by ELETROBRAS in 1982 showed that demand
was expected to grow 9.0% p.a. in 1983; about 11% p.a. in 1984-1988; and 7.3%
p.a. in the period 1988-1996. Revised demand forecasts, which take into
account the increases in electricity consumption observed through mid-1983,
show slower growth expectations (about 10% p.a. for 1984--1988), and ongoing
revisions that should be completed in early 1984, may reasonably be expected
to further lower the above figures, at least for the next two years.



-7-
- System Expansion Planning
2.12      ELETROBRAS has the primary responsibility for the coordination of
planning in the power sector and for the preparation of system generation and
transmission expansion plans. Distribution planning is the responsibility of
each individual utility company. ELETROBRAS is subject to the supervision of
DNAEE in the preparation of its plans, and the plans themselves are subject
to the formal approval of the Ministry of Mines and Energy. However, in
practice, DNAEE tends to concentrate on tariff planning and on the sector
budgeting exercise, which provides financial projections for the ensuing
three years. In the last two years the responsibility for approving the
investment programs of public utilities has been exercised by SEST/SEPLAN
(para. 3.12). Brazil's ongoing construction program of generating plants and
transmission lines is based on ELETROBRAS' earlier demand forecasts which are
now seen to have been too optimistic and to have assumed an availability of
financial resources to the sector which failed to materialize fully. This
program resulted in commitments for large generating plants (Itaipu, Tucurui)
and the corresponding large transmission systems which are now nearing
completion but which leave a significant financial burden.
2.13      In 1982 ELETROBRAS prepared a generation and transmission
development plan to meet demand through the year 2000, in the so-called
"Plano 2000". This plan, which provides a firm construction program for the
period 1983-1990, a tentative construction program for the period 1991-1995
as well as a reference program beyond 1995, is the result of a comprehensive
planning process which includes evaluation of energy resources, inter and
intra sectoral coordination, continuous methodological research and follow-up
of program implementation. It focuses on the problems originated by the size
and complexity of the Brazilian Power Sector in the context of the most
critical problem confronting the Energy Sector: its heavy dependence on oil
imports. Current planning, corresponding to a more mature stage of
ELETROBRAS' planning, is well conceived and is being well implemented. Based
on the national energy policy, Plano 2000 taps only indigenous resources -
hydro, uranium and coal - for expanding the generation system. The resulting
generation expansion plan for the period 1983-1990 recommends installing
about 34,700 MW of generating power, of which 89% would by hydro, 2%
coal-fired thermal and 9% nuclear. A comprehensive revision of the Master
Plan study is scheduled for 1986, but partial revisions have already been
needed due to lower demand growth rates being observed in 1982 and 1983
compared to previous expectations (para.2.11). Resulting from these
revisions, construction has been slowed down when economically feasible in
the major plants under construction. Despite this, excess installed capacity
is expected until 1986-88.
- Rural Electrification
2.14      While there has been good progress in rural electrification in the
more developed states, coverage for the whole country is still poor (about
19%) as compared with the urban coverage (about 85%). At the national level,
rural electrification is promoted by the Grupo Executivo de Eletrificacao
Rural (GEER), supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture and by ELETROBRAS'
distribution department. However, there is no coordination between the



- 8 -
activities of these two entities. This lack of a common national rural
electrification program under a single agency has been a major obstacle to
progess in this neglected area of the sector, but in connection with a Rural
Electrification project in Minas Gerais and Parana proposed for IBRD
financing, the Federal Government has started preparation of measures for
coordinating Rural Electrification between all the agenci'es concerned. The
SAR on Rural Electrification gives further details on this matter.
- Electricity Revenues
2.15      The regulation of electricity rates in Brazil is the responsibility
of the Ministry of Mines and Energy which exercises its authority through
DNAEE. The Water Code of 1934, as amended, established the principle of
service-at-cost plus an adequate return on capital. After 1971, power
companies were allowed to earn, at DNAEE's discretion, a rate of return
between 10 and 12% on remunerable investment.1/ Since 1981 DNAEE's
responsibility regarding sector tariffs has been reduced by effectively
transferring the authority for tariff approval to SEAP/SEPLAN, which reviews
these within a broader policy context.
2.16      Consumer bills contain the following charges (See Annexes 2-2/3 and
2-3/2):
A.   The tariff, which on a nationwide basis, provides about
80% of revenues collected from consumers.
B.   The sole tax (IUEE) on residential, commercial and small
industrial2/ consumer bills, which provides about 12% of sector
revenues. Forty percent goes to federal sector agencies, fifty
percent to state and federal district utilities, and ten percent to
municipal utilities; and
C.   The Compulsory Loan (8% of revenues), an obligatory investment
scheme under which industrial consumers using more than 2,000 kWh
per month acquire ELETROBRAS bonds (20-year maturity yielding 6%
annual interest and revalued through monetary adjustments).
2.17      A single tariff structure is applied to all interconnected systems,
and slightly higher tariffs are applied in isolated thermal systems. Until
1980, the Global Guarantee Fund (GSF), financed through a surcharge of up to
2% on assets in operation, was used in the tariff equalization process to
supplement the earnings of eligiblea utilities. In recent years, the sector
as a whole has been obtaining rates of remuneration lower than the 10%
allowed by law (para. 2.19) and in January 1981 the Brazilian government
expanded the role of GGF, from a tariff equalization instrument to a rate of
remuneration equalization instrument. Thus at present the annual guarantee
quota is calculated based on the difference of remuneration in relation to
the average remuneration of the sector.
1/ Remunerable investment is equa:L to net revalued assets plus an allowance
for inventory and net working capital, plus (or minus) the difference
between the prior years' ac:tuaL and allowable return, less contributions
and grants.
2/ Industries using less than 2,000 kWh per month.



-9-
- Sector Finances 1/
2.18      Over the last ten years, sector investments increased considerably
because of major electricity generation projects such as Itaipu, the nuclear
program and Tucurui, while sector revenues did not keep pace with the rate of
growth of investment. As a result of a debt service that took increasing
portions of the internally generated funds, sector finances show a funding
composition with increasing reliance on borrowings. Since the major
hydroelectric plants under construction and their transmission systems will
begin to be commissioned in the next two years (Itaipu in 1984 and Tucurui in
1985) and because there will be an excess of installed capacity owing to a
slowdown in market growth (para. 2.11), the pace of investment will drop in
the coming years, providing the sector with some financial breathing space
for a reversal in past financial trends. Thus, from 1982 to 1986,
consumer-based contributions are expected to increase from 3% to 35%, and
borrowings are expected to be reduced from 87% to 57% of total financial
requirements (see Annex 2-3/1, 2-2/2). Notwithstanding the decreasing
reliance on borrowings as a percentage of total sources, the sector will need
about US$11.4 billion of borrowings during the 1983-87 period, as shown in
the following table which summarizes Annex 2-2/2:
SECTOR'S PROJECTED FINANCING SOURCES (1983-87)

Total sources of funds                          9,128    19,456        100.0
2.19      Under previous Bank loans, borrowers were required to maintain
their revenues, including transfers from the GGF, at levels consistent with
sound financial practice and in conformance with Brazilian legislation for
the sector (para. 2.15). However, in the 1978-1981 period most of the Bank's
borrowers or beneficiaries had a rate of remuneration which was below the 10%
allowed by Brazilian law. Because of concern over the deterioration of
sector finances, a special agreement was reached with the Brazilian
Government in September 1981 which provided the following:
(a) an annual rate of remuneration, for the electric power sector as a
whole, of 10% of the current net value of remunerable investments
(as defined by present Brazilian law), and the recovery of past
shortfalls in achieving such rate of remuneration since 1978,
should be attained as soon as possible;
(b) the Brazilian Government would carry out a program of increases in
the level of total charges per kWh to the final consumer; such
increases to be not less than 3% in real terms in 1982 and 5% in
each year thereafter, until such 10% rate of remuneration has been
achieved and shortfalls have been recovered;
(c) the above increases would be achieved through a series of quarterly
tariff adjustments;
1/ See Annexes of group 2.



- 10 -
(d)  each of the Bank borrowers and beneficiaries would maintain every
year a rate of remunerat:ion at least equal to that year's average
rate for the sector;
(e)  the Government of Brazil would consult with the Bank and would
provide periodic reports on the execution of such program; and
(f)  the Bank would not enforce the covenants in its loans relating to
rate of remuneration as long as the Brazilian government and its
agencies and power companies comply with the above provisions.
2.20      In 1982, the first and second quarterly tariff increases were
properly carried out, on the dates and in the percentages established in the
agreement. However, the third and[ fourth increases were delayed by two
months and by seven weeks, respect:ively. These delays resulted in about
US$280 million of foregone revenues for the sector, and the average tariff in
real terms was about 12% lower in 1982 than in 1981. The Brazilian
government made equity contributicins to the power sector to compensate for
the foregone revenues caused by the delays in tariff increases. To address
these problems, in meetings held in Washington before negotiations, the
Brazilian Government agreed to amend the September 1981 agreement in the
following manner:
(a) the Government undertakes to achieve the following annual rates of
remuneration for the sector as a whole: not less than 5% in 1984,
6% in 1985, 7% in 1986, 9% in 1988 and 10% in 1989 and thereafter,
and failure to achieve these targets would allow the Bank to
suspend disbursements on. all outstanding loans to the power sector;
(b) to achieve the agreed rates of remuneration, in 1984 and 1985
tariffs would each year be increased by 5% in real terms, through
quarterly tariff increases of which the February and May increases
would each provide half of the 5% real increase and the following
two increases would just adjust to inflation; and
(c)  in January 1986, the Bank and the Government would meet to
determine what tariff actions and other measures would be required
in 1986 and future years to achieve the agreed rates of
remuneration.
2.21      Financial projections for the sector show that the agreed tariff
increases for 1984 and 1985, complemented by cost reductions ensuing from the
Government's policy to keep wage increases and industrial price increases
below inflation levels (as measured by the INPC), will allow achieving the
agreed rates of remuneration, and will result in progressive recovery of
sector finances. However, a new factor in the operating costs of the
Brazilian power sector will be the energy purchased from the Itaipu
Binational entity, which is expected to start commercial generation of
electricity in 1984. The Brazil-Paraguay agreement for the construction of
the Itaipu plant established a tariff scheme based on the debt service. As
an increasing portion of Itaipu financing in recent years has been short-term
financing, a tariff for the bulk sale of electricity based on the debt



- 11 -
service would mean high tariffs at the beginning and low tariffs at the end.
Because the present binational agreement will most likely be revised, iin the
financial projections the cost of the Itaipu energy has been considered equal
to the bulk electricity price in the South-Southeast region (US$mills
14.5/kWh in 1984), with an annual real increase equal to that applied to
sector tariff levels. Even though this price is much lower than the price
corresponding to an opportunity cost of capital of 11% (US$mills 35/kWh), it
still means that a growing percentage of sector revenues (1.2% in 1984 and
8.2% in 1987) will go towards paying for Itaipu energy. During negotiations,
the Government agreed that if Itaipu tariffs are increased above the forecast
levels, the Government will promptly take all measures required to offset the
ensuing cost increases and ensure that the agreed rates of remuneration are
achieved (para.6.03(e).
- Bank Participation
2.22      Since 1949, the Bank has made 35 loans to the Brazilian power
sector, amounting to about US$1.9 billion. Most have been for hydroelectric
plants and associated transmission facilities in the Southeastern and
Southern regions. Bank participation has also contributed to sector
organization and planning and has facilitated foreign commercial financing to
the sector. Eight project performance audit reports on nine power plants
and five distribution projectsl/ have been distributed to the Executive
Directors. These reports conclude that, despite construction delays and cost
overruns in some cases, the projects were substantially successful.
ELETROBRAS' performance in on-going projects is satisfactory.
2.23      The most recent loans have been mainly for transmission and
distribution projects, as shown in the following table:

3. THE BORROWER
Background
3.01      ELETROBRAS - Centrais E:Letricas Brasileiras S.A. - was created in
1962 by Law No. 3890-A as a vehicle for consolidating existing public utilities
centralizing management of the sector and encouraging orderly regional expansion
and long-term growth. ELETROBRAS is a mixed economy corporation, operating
under the jurisdiction of the Min-istry of Mines and Energy (MME) and the
regulatory authority of DNAEE (para. 2.07). Under law, at least 51% of the
company's voting stock must always be owned directly or indirectly by the
Government of Brazil, and currently the Government holds 99.6% of total company
shares and 100% of voting (common) stock. In addition to common stock, company
equity includes Class A preferred shares owned by state, municipal and other
shareholders and Class B shares of which non-governmental shareholders own 20%
(Preferred shares are not convertible and have no voting rights, but have
certain prior rights in the distribution of capital and dividends.)
3.02      Commencing operations in 1962, ELETROBRAS gradually achieved its
current position in the electric power sector by absorbing existing federally
owned utilities and acquiring over time several foreign electric power
companies operating in Brazil, including subsidiaries of the American and
Foreign Power Co., which had a strong presence in Brazil. Among the federal
utilities transferred to ELETROBRAS were two regional generation and
transmission companies -- FURNAS Centrais Eletricas S.A. servicing the
Southeast and CHESF (Companhia Hidroeletrica de Sao Francisco) servicing
the Northeast. Later, two new regional subsidiaries were formed -- in 1968
ELETROSUL (Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil S.A.) responsible for the
Southern region and Mato Grosso do Sul, and in 1973 ELETRONORTE (Centrais
Eletricas do Norte do Brasil S.A.) responsible for the Northern region.
3.03      In addition to the four regional subsidiaries, ELETROBRAS also owns
ESCELSA (Espirito Santo Centrais Eletricas), the power distributor for the
state of Espirito Santo in the Southeast. In January 1979, ELETROBRAS acquired
an 83% participation in LIGHT - Servicios de Eletricidade S.A. from BRASCAN
Ltd. of Canada. LIGHT was Brazil's largest electricity distribution company at
that time, servicing the area of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Since then it
has sold the Sao Paulo subsystem to ELETROPAULO, a mainly state-owned company.
ELETROBRAS also holds the Brazilian Government's 50% interest in the Itaipu
Binacional, the binational agency set up in April 1973 by the governments of
Brazil and Paraguay to build jointly the 12,600 MW Itaipu hydroelectric
facility on the Parana river.
3.04      ELETROBRAS' regional subsidiaries are responsible primarily for
generation activities and high-voltage transmission systems (above 138 kV)
covering several states. They act as bulk suppliers to state and municipal
utility companies which generally have responsibility for sub-transmission
(69-138 kV) and electricity distribution (up to 69 kV). Since 1967, Government
policy has been to consolidate as far as possible local companies and services
at the state level under the state utility companies. In line with this
policy, any existing distribution activities under ELETROBRAS ownership are
gradually being transferred to the state companies. In addition to its
subsidiaries, ELETROBRAS has a minority participation (usually below 15%)



- 13 -
in most of the state and municipal companies of the electricity sector. A list
of the subsidiaries and associated companies and ELETROBRAS' equity share in
each is attached (see Annex 3-1).
Organization and Management
3.05      ELETROBRAS is governed by an Administrative Board of Directors
comprised of the President (appointed by the President of the Republic of
Brazil); five Directors who are elected at the General Shareholders meeting for
a term of 3 years and who head up the various directorates of the company
(Coordination, Operations and Systems, Economics and Finance, Planning and
Engineering, and Corporate Management); four Counselors, elected for a term of
3 years, who are associated with public power companies under federal
concession and have experience in technology, finance or business management;
and two Counselors, again elected for a term of 3 years, one representing
public bodies other than the Federal Government and another representing
private shareholders. Both Directors and Counselors can be reelected.
3.06      The Administrative Board of Directors sets business policy for the
company and specifically is responsible for investment and financing of the
public utilities, domestic and international borrowing and approving the annual
budget. It also calls the General Shareholders' Meetings and is, of course,
answerable to its principal shareholder, the Federal Government. An Executive
Board, comprised of the President and the five Directors, manages the day to
day activities of the company under guidelines set by the Board. It also has
responsibility for making policy recommendations to the Board.
3.07      The five directorates of the company are its operating arms and
reflect the various services ELETROBRAS provides -- funding and investment,
planning, technical assistance, managerial assistance and regional and inter-
national coordination (see chart at Annex 3-2).
(a)  The Directorate of Economics and Finance has responsibility
for obtaining funds through its Department of Resources; also
for the financial analysis of projects and investments, and
budgeting for the sector through its Department of Investments.
Preparation of medium- and long-term financial planning is
also conducted in this directorate through the Department of
Financial Planning.
(b) The Directorate of Planning and Engineering is responsible
primarily for the technical planning on a regional and national
basis, as well as analysis of projects and investments from
the technical and economic points of view. During the budget
process, this directorate reviews from a technical standpoint,
the annual budget, proposed projects and general expansion
plans of subsidiary and associated companies. Its Departments
of Market Studies and Energy Studies conduct the technical
long-term planning for system expansion. Another department
within this directorate is assigned responsibilities for
rural electrification.
(c) The Directorate of Corporate Management helps subsidiaries
and other sector companies to strengthen administrative and control
systems.



- 14 -
(d) The Directorate of Systems Operation is in charge of coordi-
nating inter-regional sysl:ems and also supervises the regional
coordinating groups (GCOI's) set-up to plan and achieve the
most economic operation of interconnected systems. And,
finally,
(e)  The Directorate of Coordination is responsible for (i) relations
between sector and industry, (ii) international relations
concerning energy and power, and (iii) conducting and supporting
studies for the development of non-conventional sources of energy,
and maintaining a technological research center, CEPEL (Centro de
Pesquisas de Energia Eletrica).
3.08      ELETROBRAS as the parent company of the regional generating and bulk
transmission companies, and through its minority participation in state utility
companies, acts as a holding company for the sector, providing a variety of
services. It provides financing for the sectcr, analyzes investment and expan-
sion plans of sector companies, plays an important role in budgeting for the
sector, undertakes technical and financial plannling, provides technical and
managerial assistance to sector companies, coordinates regional and inter-
national activities and supports research on technology and energy sources.
Financing Role
3.09      Because of its function as holding company and financial agency
for the Brazilian power sector, ELETROBRAS plays a pivotal role in the
development of the sector and becomes heavily dependent on sector based
resources for its finances. This dependence coupled with its pivotal role
tends to make ELETROBRAS' financial conditions mirror the trends in the
financial state of the sector.
3.10      ELETROBRAS raises funds from four sources -- statutory resources,
government funds, internally generat:ed funds and borrowings.
(a) Statutory Resources
ELETROBRAS receives and distributes funds from three statutory
sources--the Sole Tax, the Compulsory Loan and the Global
Reversion Fund (para. 2.16).
(b) Government Funds
There are two sources of funding from the Federal Government--its
reinvestment of dividends and special appropriations. In the past,
government policy has been to reinvest 95% of dividends it received
from ELETROBRAS by increasing its share capital in the company. For
specific projects, ELETROBRAS also receives special appropriations
from the Federal Budget or in special legislation.



- 15-
(c)  Internally Generated Funds
ELETROBRAS' internal sources of funds are dividends paid on its
investments in subsidiaries and associated companies and payments
of interest and repayments of principal on loans advanced to
those companies. ELETROBRAS determines dividend payments for
its subsidiary companies after review of operating results and
other financial data. ELETROBRAS frequently reinvests its
dividends in support of capital needs of sector companies;
under several Bank loans, it is obliged to do this. In some
cases, it is also converting debt service and outstanding
loans to equity. In lending from its general resources,
ELETROBRAS requires a period of 10 years with a 3-year grace
period and a rate a interest of 10% (plus a tax of 0.5%) plus
monetary correction. Borrowers guarantee their loans with their
statutory IUEE quotas (sole tax). Domestic or external borrow-
ings specifically re-lent to utilities carry the conditions
of the respective financing.
(d) Borrowings
(i) ELETROBRAS raises both domestic and foreign currency loans,
under its own name in local and international markets, then
passes on the funds to subsidiaries or associated companies.
In addition to the bulk of ELETROBRAS' borrowing being passed to
the sector, the larger and more experienced companies have
sometimes taken loans in their own names, especially when
related to specific projects.
(ii) Annual borrowings targets for ELETROBRAS are established on a
yearly basis and in accordance with the sector budget approved
by SEST. Approach to the banks for obtaining offers is
submitted to specific controls by the Central Bank, which has
the responsibility for organizing a queue of borrowers. The
company has become increasingly sophisticated in its funding
program in recent years due to the creation of the Department
of External Resources, later renamed Funding Department,
within the economic and financial directorate. That department
seeks to diversify ELETROBRAS group sources of funding in the
international market, studying potential new markets, new
types of operations, both in the financial and capital
markets, and developing contacts with banks operating in
these new markets or new banks operating in traditional markets
(like the regional banks in the Euromarket). This department
is also responsible for raising local funds from Banco do
Brasil, BNH (Banco Nacional de Habitacao), BNDE (Banco Nacional
do Desenvolvimento Economico), Caixa Economica Federal, and
FINEP (Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos). It also analyzes
conditions of FINAME (Agencia Especial de Financiamento
Industrial) loans for ELETROBRAS subsidiaries, and seeks ways
to familiarize international markets with its lesser-known
companies.



- 16 -
(iii)  ELETROBRAS consolidates its activities in the international
financial market through traditional operations handled by its
subsidiaries and new types of operations handled directly by
the company. Concerning capital markets, foreign bond issues
in new markets are sought when conditions are favorable. During
1982, in spite of all problems in the International Market,
ELETROBRAS Group borrowed US$1,610 million, through supplier's
and buyer's credits (US$610 million) and currency loans
(US$1,000 million). The most significant operations were the
US$300 million syndicated loan led by Bank of America for
ELETROBRAS and the US$70 million Club Deal managed by UNIBANCO,
which was the first deal for ELETROBRAS in the International
Market led exclusively by a Brazilian Bank.
Planning and Budgeting
3.11      ELETROBRAS has long been at the center of sector planning, both in
the short-term through the budgeting process and associated planning of
financial requirements and in medivum and long-term technical and financial
planning. Up until 1980, both subsidiary and state companies submitted their
budget estimates to ELETROBRAS for review by the company's technical and
financial analysts, who then established project and other budgetary
priorities. Once this information was aggregated and financial requirements
identified, ELETROBRAS' recommendations were submitted to the Ministry of Mines
and Energy, and to the Ministry of Planning for review and final approval,
which was generally forthcoming.
3.12      Since 1981, however, ELEIROBRAS' responsibility for the budgetary
process has been reduced with the centralizing of decision-making in SEST (an
agency of the Ministry of Planning). Projected budgets of the state
utility companies for 1981, for example, have been submitted directly to
SEST for review (although ELETROBRAS was asked to comment on them). Pro-
cedures have been streamlined in 1982 with ELETROBRAS taking responsibility for
the budget submissions of its subsidaries and associated companies.
Uncertainties regarding expected economic development in the country have made
the budgeting process in 1983 even more cumbersome than in the past.
Investment ceilings for 1983 were approved only in July 1983 (para. 2.12).
3.13      Besides budgeting and related financial planning ELETROBRAS has
primary responsibility for the coordination of medium and long-term planning in
the power sector and preparation of system expansion plans. Formulation of
plans for system expansion is the responsibility of the Directorate of Planning
and Engineering which has a technical staff comprised of experienced engineers
and economists. Complementary financial planning is conducted within the
Directorate of Economics and Finance. ELETROBRAS relies on the regional
subsidiaries to conduct planning studies in their respective areas, and state
utility companies also undertake independent planning exercises. The size and
complexity of the sector require this division of responsibility, but
it creates problems in coordination of planning. Moreover, there is no clear
division of responsibility between DNAEE and ELETROBRAS with respect to overall
planning.



- 17 -
Policies and Procedures
3.14      ELETROBRAS is regulated by a legal framework within which it has
developed financial policies. The resource allocation process gives highest
priority to large projects considered strategic by the Brazilian government,
and to the generation and transmission projects of ELETROBRAS. Under Loan
2138-BR, ELETROBRAS has provided the Bank with statements of its financial
policies and has agreed to discuss them with the Bank before making any major
change. During negotiations it was agreed with ELETROBRAS to maintain this
agreement under the proposed new loan (para.6.04(a).   The financial monitoring
indicators corresponding to this agreement are shown in Annex 3-5/3.
Training and Staff Relations
3.15      Many of ELETROBRAS' professional staff have had experience in utility
operations in the Brazilian power sector and some have had training in foreign
utilities both in Europe and in North America. In some cases, staff members
came to ELETROBRAS from the private sector where they had specialized training
as is the case of members of the external funding department that came from
commercial banks. ELETROBRAS has a very comprehensive and updated training
program for personnel of Brazilian power utilities that also benefits its own
staff members. This training program has been extended to other South American
power companies, members of the Interregional Electric Commission (CIER).
3.16      ELETROBRAS' professional staff is competent and well trained.  In the
past no major difficulties had been encountered in recruiting qualified
personnel. At present time, however, some difficulties in recruiting and
maintaining staff exist because, in order to fight inflation, ceilings for
salaries of top management of government-run entities have been established and
salary increases have not kept up with inflation.
3.17      In its fight against inflation, the Federal Government has estab-
lished a zero-growth rate in the number of personnel of ELETROBRAS. With these
constraints, in salary levels and number of personnel, ELETROBRAS
will be obliged to improve the productivity of its staff. Currently the
situation is satisfactory; during supervision, the organizational structure and
staffing should be kept under review to ensure that work continues to be
handled adequately.
Accounting and Auditing
3.18      The accounting system of ELETROBRAS is satisfactory and well suited
to ELETROBRAS' needs. Internal control functions are vested in the Internal
Auditing Department which reports to the President. Internal Audit carries an
adequate program of financial audits and follow-up on past recommendations.
ELETROBRAS employs as its external auditors the firm Boucinhas, Campos & Claro
S/C which is acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.29(a)). In addition, the Fiscal
Council, appointed by the Shareholders' meeting, carries out external control
duties in accordance with Brazilian legislation.



- 18 -
Appraisal and Supervision Capability
3.19      Over the last five years, and in collaboration with numerous
preparation missions from the Bank, ELETROBRAS has developed an adequate
capability for appraisal and supervisory work. Special teams from the
engineering, the financial analysis, and the management departments work with
the relevant staff of prospective beneficiaries in identifying and preparing
sub-projects (which are portions of time-slices of overall investment programs)
on the same principles that would have been followed by Bank staff in similar
identifications and preparations (para. 4.02). Following the Bank's advice,
the Corporate Management Directorate now participates fully in the appraisal
and supervision of IBRD financed projects regarding institutional aspects of
the beneficiaries. This effort is having better than expected results since it
has become a vehicle for intra-sector transfer of know-how: staff from
different utilities and with great experience in their particular fields are
coordinated by ELETROBRAS in making the institutional diagnosis of each
beneficiary, and a plan of action for institutional improvement during project
execution is prepared in collaboration with the staff of each beneficiary.
Its capability enables ELETROBRAS to continue selecting priority investments in
the sector and to arrange for the respective financing on the basis of sound
technical, economic, financial and institutional principles. A pipeline for
future similar projects is already in preparation.
3.20      These ELETROBRAS teams have completed the appraisal reports for the
sub-projects and investment programs of all beneficiaries, and they include
recommendations for the institutional improvements of the beneficiaries identi-
fied by ELETROBRAS during appraisal.
Finances I/
Performance
3.21      ELETROBRAS, as the holding company and development bank for the
sector, handles the funds from statutory sources, government funds, internally
generated funds, and borrowings (see para. 3.10). During the 1973-1982 period,about
60%  of   ELETROBRAS' revenues originated from loan interest charges, and the
remaining revenues came mainly from shareholding profits. The decreasing
remuneration on investment (see Annex 2-2/4) and the heavy interest expenses
faced by the operating Brazilian power companies have also affected negatively
the net income 2/ of ELETROBRAS' subsidiary and associated companies. The
clearly defined negative trend for revenues from shareholdings was broken in
1978 and in 1979, basically because of new accounting methods approved by the
Brazilian Government, 3/ it continued its decline in 1980 and recuperated in
1981 and 1982 (Annexes 3-3/1 and 3-5/1). ELETROBRAS' general and
1/   See group 3 Annexes.
2/   In this analysis, net income is utilized without taking into account the
monetary correction.
3/   The new law allows the holding company to register as revenues the net
increases in equity derived from operations and not only the dividend
payments.



- 19 -
administrative expenses were on average 8% of total revenues for the period,
while interest on debt increasred from 12% of total revenues in 1973 to 38% in
1982, which reduced net income from 83% of total revenues in 1973 to 55% in
1982.
3.22      Because of a decreasing consumer-based contributions in face of a
relatively heavy investment program, the composition of ELETROBRAS' funds for
the 1973-1982 period shows an increasing reliance on borrowings (from 4% of
totalling sources in 1973 to 25% in 1982, see Annexes 3-3/2 and 3-5/2). The
result of the increasing borrowing meant also an increasing debt service burden
(exacerbated by harder capital market terms) on ELETROBRAS' finances which, in
turn, diminished substantially its net internal cash generation available for
investment (from 40% of total resources in 1973 to 29% in 1982). ELETROBRAS'
degree of financial autonomy has also been affected during this ten-year period
since the capital service 1/ coverage ratio decreased from 4.5 times in 1973 to
1.9 in 1982). The net internal cash generation has been reinforced by other
consumer-based contributions 2/ which help to make up for a positive but
decreasing total consumer-based contribution to expansion (from 93% in 1973 to
67% in 1982).
3.23      As a result of decreasing net income and increasing borrowings, the
debt portion in the capital 3/ structure of ELETROBRAS has been growing (Annex
3-3/3) and, therefore, the debt/equity ratio has been increasing during the
period from 44/56 in 1973 to 53/47 in 1982. The current ratio4/ which was
greater than 1.0 in 1973, became 0.7 in 1974 and remained lower than 1.0 until
1982. Loans to subsidiaries and associated companies had an increasing share
in assets (from 50% in 1973 to 63% in 1982) while shareholdings had a
decreasing share (from 36% in 1973 to 37% in 1982).
Forecast
3.24      Financial projections for the 1983-1987 period show that ELETROBRAS
will reverse the trend of increasing participation of borrowings in its
financing plans (only 20% in 1987). To achieve this objective, and because
government equity contributions are not likely to be forthcoming, ELETROBRAS
will have to rely increasingly on consumer-based contributions (see Annexes
3-4/2 and 3-5/2). According to Brazilian legislation, the 40% of the sole tax,
allocated to the Federal Government and previously passed to ELETROBRAS as
equity contributions, is fully retained by the Federal Government since 1982.
Similarly, the compulsory loan is supposed to terminate at the end of 1983.
However, ELETROBRAS' projections assume that the compulsory loan will
continue. During negotiations the Brazilian Government agreed that the
compulsory loan scheme would be continued during project execution (para. 6.03(d).
1/   Capital service includes total debt service and net dividend payments.
2/   Sole tax, compulsory loan and reversion quota.
3/   Capital as the aggregate of debt and equity.
4/   Current ratio:  current assets/current liabilities.



- 20 -
3.25      The income statement of ELETROBRAS projected for 1983-87 (see Annexes
3-4/1 and 3-5/1) shows that heavy interest payments by operating companies
coupled with a low rate of remuneration, will make for low revenues from
ELETROBRAS' shareholdings in these companies. Interest receipts from loans
will become the basic revenue for ELETROBRAS during the projection period. On
the expense side of the projected income statement, interest on debt will
absorb decreasing portions of revenues through 1987 when they will become about
41% of total revenues.
3.26      ELETROBRAS' sources of funds shows an increasing reliance on
consumer-based contributions especially in the last portion of the projection
period, and a corresponding reduction of borrowings. The following table gives
a summary of ELETROBRAS' projected funding mix, as shown in greater detail in
Annex 3-4/2 and graphically in Annex 3-5/2:
ELETROBRAS' PROJECTED FINANCING SOURCES (1983-87)
(in mid-83 prices)
- Cr$billion  US$million       %
Net consumer-based contributions        3,173       6,763         64.1
Equity contributions                       94          200          1.9
Non-borrowing sources                3,267        6,963         66.0
Borrowings                             1,684        3,589         34.0
Total sources of funds               4,951       10,552        100.0
The effect of the composition of funding sources on the accumulated values of
the balance sheet show that ELETROBRAS' loans remain a significant part in its
asset composition (about 63% of total assets) and its capital stock investments
remain less so (about 37% of total assets). The share of debt in the capital
structure of ELETROBRAS has been growing in the past and is expected to remain
almost constant in the projection period (about 65/35).
3.27      Because loans have a greater role in asset composition, and interest
receipts in total revenues, ELETROBRAS is more of a bank and less of a holding
company for the power sector. There exists a strong interrelation between
these two roles of ELETROBRAS: an increase in the interest rate it charges to
its borrowers means a decrease in the dividends it gets from its subsidiary or
associated companies, which are also its borrowers. Although the financial
trends of the past will be difficult to reverse, ELETROBRAS has pointed out
that the projections show their intention to reverse these trends.   Under loan
2138-BR ELETROBRAS has agreed to use as limits, during the project execution
period, certain specific ratios relating to spread, new borrowings for debt
servicing, indebtedness, and capital servicel/. During negotiations,
ELETROBRAS agreed to include the same ratios for the proposed new loan (para.
6.04(b).
Performance Indicators and Reporting
3.28      During the appraisal mission some basic financial indicators were
agreed with ELETROBRAS to be considered for supervision purposes as goals to be
attained in the projected period. These are shown in Annex 3-4/4.
1/   See Annex 3-5/3.



- 21 -
3.29      During negotiations ELETROBRAS has agreed:
(a) to provide financial statements audited by independent
accountants acceptable to the Bank together with a report on
the audit, not later than four months after the end of each
fiscal year (para. 6.04(c); and
(b) to prepare such other reports as the Bank may reasonably
request, including project completion reports (para. 6.04(d).

4. THE PROJECT
Description
4.01      The Project consists of seven sub-projects, each of which consists of
portions of the investment programs cf the seven utility companies selected by
ELETROBRAS as beneficiaries under the proposed loan. These 1983-88 investment
programs provide for the purchase and installation of sub-transmission lines
(up to a voltage of 138 kV, but mainly at 69 and 34.5 kV), substations and
associated transformers, distribution, lines and transformers (primary feeders),
low voltage distribution lines (secondary circuits), consumer connections,
general service equipment, and related auxiliary equipment needed for the
appropriate expansion 1/ of the capacity of the respective beneficiaries'
systems; in addition for 2 of them, rehabilitation   of generating plant will
also be required. These programs include the use of consultants where needed.
Objectives
4.02      The main objectives of the sub-projects are to meet more efficiently
the needs of the market by expanding and modernizing distribution networks, in
line with national energy policy (para 2.03).  This should remedy
unsatisfactory system conditions arising from inadequate planning and from the
lack of sufficient investment by the beneficiaries in the past. Other
important objectives are the strengthening of the beneficiaries' organization
and the improvement of their technical and financial capability. The proposed
project would also consolidate ELETROBRAS' capability for appraising and
supervising projects in accordance with standard Bank methods and procedures.
This has already been achieved in part, as demonstrated by the completed
appraisals.
Characteristics
4.03      The investment programs were developed originally by the
beneficiaries; however, there has been considerable input by ELETROBRAS in the
course of identification, preparation, and appraisal that follow closely Bank
procedures and practices in regard to such matters. The result of all this is
that the programs, as now put forward and appraised, are carefully planned, and
represent optimum solutions in technical and economic terms, based on
conservative market assumptions.
Selection of Beneficiaries
4.04      The selection of the various beneficiaries has been made by
ELETROBRAS on the basis of need and willingness to cooperate in sub-project
preparation on the lines necessary for a Bank type appraisal by ELETROBRAS.
The needs are of different origins, arising in part from geographical location
in the less-developed regions of the country, and in part from organizational
and structural inadequacies which ELETROBRAS desires to address with the
assistance of the Bank's  lending techniques.   Further potential beneficiaries
for possible future loans are being identified.
1/   Expansion includes extensions, strengthening and improvements.

Appraisal Criteria
4.05      In appraising the beneficiaries and their respective programs,
ELETROBRAS applied criteria and used methods similar to those that would have
been used by the Bank in appraising similar programs and sub-projects (para.
5.10). ELETROBRAS has developed an instruction manual that provides
orientation for the prospective beneficiaries in project preparation and
provision of information needed for appraisal. Also, ELETROBRAS follows up
with repeated preparation missions and has adopted the project brief approach
used by the Bank for initial identification of costs and issues, etc. Before
accepting the market assumptions and forecasts made by the beneficiaries,
ELETROBRAS reviewed the market studies, and where needed, caused them to be
revised. ELETROBRAS has a department that specializes in market studies, and
experts from this department were brought in to make the necessary revisions.
The resulting market assumptions are sober and conservative, and are consistent
with the currently known Federal and State Government plans for the development
of the various areas concerned. We can, therefore, say that the market
forecasts are reasonable and realistic.
4.06      On the technical side, ELETROBRAS has used the study of alternatives
to determine the least-cost solution for the development and/or rehabilitation
of the systems concerned. This work is being carried out under the direction
of engineers with great experience in distribution design and planning, with
the assistance of various specialists from other parts of the ELETROBRAS
organization. The ELETROBRAS technical team ensures that the technical
proposals constitute adequate and least cost solutions in line with appropriate
standards for security of supply in the regions concerned. ELETROBRAS has also
developed a financial analysis manual that follows the general Bank guidelines
for this purpose and has defined a group of significant financial indicators
that are included in the appraisal reports.
4.07      The ELETROBRAS appraisals also deal with institutional (i.e. opera-
tional and managerial) problems of the beneficiaries, and contain appropriate
recommendations regarding technical and financial planning, data collection and
processing, billing and collection, training, structural adjustments, and so on
(para. 5.03). These recommendations will be reflected in the on-lending loan
agreements with the beneficiaries.
Costs
4.08      Cost estimates for the programs and subprojects used in the
ELETROBRAS appraisals are based on the estimates prepared by the beneficiaries,
revised and up-dated by ELETROBRAS on the basis of actual recent experience in
procurement for Loan 1538-BR provided by CAEEB (the procurement consultants and
agents) from their records, and cross-checked by ELETROBRAS with their own
industrial department. Cost estimates have been based on December 1982
prices, and adjusted for the February 83 maxi-devaluation. Engineering and
administration costs are included at about 10% of total base costs, and taxes
and duties on goods and services are also included at about 10% of total base
costs, considering that Bank financed goods and services will be exempt from
taxes and duties. Physical contingencies have been assumed at 10%. Price
contingencies for the foreign costs are based on 8% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984,



- 24 -
7.0% for 1985, and 6.0% for 1986 arnd thereafter.  Price contingencies for the
local costs were estimated assuming that the exchange rate for the Cruzeiro
would be depreciated according to domestic inflation in 1983 and 1984; and that
after 1984, it would be depreciatedL according to the differential between
domestic inflation and international inflation. The costs, including
contingencies of the 1984-87 Bank financed sub-projects are shown in Annex 4-1
and summarized as follows (in US$ millions):
LOCAL   FOREIGN   TOTAL
CERON                             43.7       28.9      72.6

US$316.1 million represents the equivalent of 100% of the estimated foreign
component of the seven sub-projects, and includes the cost of inspection at
the factory, assumed at about 3/4% of total foreign costs..
4.09      The relation between the subprojects and the investment programs of
the beneficiaries are detailed in Annex 4-2 which shows basic costs that
include physical contingencies but exclude price contingencies. This
comparison may be summarized as follows (in US$ millions):
Subprojects as %

4.10      Project briefs have been completed  for all beneficiaries and all
appraisals are ready for Bank review. Each project brief includes an adequate
definition of the project, cost estimates, implementation schedules, and a
statement of the main issues facing the beneficiary and ELETROBRAS's
recommendation for dealing with these issues.



- 25 -
Implementation
4.11      Most beneficiaries have capability for carrying out engineering and
construction supervision with their existing staff; they would be assisted,
where appropriate and recommended by ELETROBRAS, by Brazilian consultants; the
related costs have been included in the estimates at about 5% of the base costs
of the substations and other installations concerned. 1/ Larger works would be
built under local contracts, and smaller works would be carried out by the
beneficiaries' own staff, as is normal utility practice.
4.12      The construction programs have been reviewed by ELETROBRAS and
revised to ensure realistic timing. The appraisal reports prepared by
ELETROBRAS contain construction schedules that will provide a basis for
monitoring progress during the sub-project construction period.
Procurement
4.13      Equipment and materials financed under the loan would be procured in
accordance with Bank guidelines, through international competitive bidding,
except minor quantities (each item not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent, and all
items totalling not more than 5% of each sub-loan) where special reasons (such
as high degree of technical sophistication, or standardization, or
compatibility with existing equipment, or urgency of delivery) justify limited
international tendering (LIT). Within the same limitations, direct purchases
may be made for the rehabilitation of thermal generating plant if the original
manufacturer is the only source of supply. Possible Brazilian suppliers of
items included in the sub-projects are reasonably competitive; as in previous
power loans, Brazilian suppliers whose bids contain components manufactured in
Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the bid would be given a margin of
preference of 15% or the applicable import duties, whichever is lower.
4.14      The total foreign costs of the project are estimated at about
US$316.1 million equivalent. About US$250 million equivalent for equipment and
materials to be financed from the proposed loan will be acquired through ICB in
accordance with Bank Guidelines (except as already noted above); and, on the
basis of past experience, Brazilian suppliers would be awarded up to two-thirds
of the value of the contracts. Equipment, materials and services not financed
under the proposed loan would be procured locally under the beneficiaries'
normal procedures which are satisfactory. An analysis of the contracts thus to
be established showed that a limited number would, in effect, amount to
reserved procurement owing to the nature of the contracts involved. This
reserved procurement is not expected to have any adverse effect on project
costs or execution, as the number of Brazilian suppliers is large and their
prices are generally competitive. The foreign content of these reserved
procurement contracts was estimated at US$28 million; these foreign costs will
not be financed from the Bank loan.
4.15      For the smaller beneficiaries, the procurement would be handled by
CAEEB who over more than 20 years have been procurement agents for
beneficiaries under previous Bank loans. The costs of CAEEB's services have
been included in the estimates at about 2% of the cost of the equipment and
materials concerned, 1/ but actual charges will use a time basis, as practiced
in the current project (Loan 2138-BR). As the Borrower wishes to minimize the
mis-procurement risk for his beneficiaries, a $200,000 threshold for prior
1/   Equivalent to about $6,000 per man month.



- 26 -
review of bid award decisions by the Bank has been agreed.  This is the same as
previously agreed for Loan 2138-BR, and should cover about 80% of the
procurement dollars with a prior review.
Disbursement
4.16       Preparations for procurement of goods and services are well advanced
so that bid invitations may be issued without delay once the loan has been
approved. ELETROBRAS expects that disbursements will build up quickly after
the first year and would be completed in about 4-1/2 years after Loan
approval. This is a reasonable target, but it would be prudent to allow for
an additional 6 months of disbursements, i.e. a total of 5 years after loan
approval. Compared with the disbursement profile of previous similar projects
in Brazil, 5 years would achieve about 80.0% disbursement; however, in view of
the advanced state of preparation and the nature of the project (no large civil
works are involved) and since this :is the 2nd ELETROBRAS distribution project,
a 100% disbursement in that time is considered a realistic estimate. The
projected disbursement schedule is Shown in Annex 4-3. Disbursements would be
fully documented, and would be made for 100% of foreign expenditures for
imported equipment and materials, or the ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured equipment and materials. To give an additional margin of six
months, the closing date would be June 30, 1988.
4.17       To reduce the impact of the time between billing and collection due
to continued devaluation of the Cruzeiro, a Special Account for US$22 million
will be opened with the Central Bank for payments to Brazilian suppliers.
Withdrawals from this account will b3e made after exchange rate prevailing on
the date of the expenditures. The Central Bank will send the corresponding
statements of Expenditures to the Bank which would then replenish the Special
Account.
Environment
4.18       The beneficiaries intend to route most of their lines overhead and
to locate their substations so as to minimize their visual impact in a manner
consistent with economic and financial considerations. Environmental impact
will therefore be negligible.
Social Impact
4.19       The investment programs of beneficiaries are designed to expand and
improve their distribution systems, with emphasis on providing electricity in
rural areas and to low-income consumers.  The total impact of these extensions
is not yet fully known, but it is probable that they will result in connections
to about 2.0 million consumers (about 7% of all existing consumers in Brazil).
This will be monitored by ELETROBRAS by means of the usual key indicators
included in their appraisal and progress reports.



- 27 -
Risks
4.20      There are no special risks involved in the sub-projects where the
works will follow normal practices and procedures that have been tested and
found practicable. Weaknesses in the beneficiaries' organizations will be
counterbalanced by consultants, and by the influence of ELETROBRAS who will
monitor closely the beneficiaries' performance. ELETROBRAS has adequate
arrangements for obtaining required counterpart funding, primarily from state
governments and federal agencies. The sub-projects represent generally less
than 50% of the respective investment programs (see Annex 4-2) and constitute
priorities for the beneficiaries. In addition, the federal government has
provided assurances that the beneficiaries' sub-projects will be supported by
adequate counterpart funding (para. 6.03(a).
Financial Analysis
4.21      The financial analysis of the beneficiaries' projected financial
statements for 1983-1988 has been carried out by ELETROBRAS on the same basis
as that normally adopted by the Bank for power utilities. The standard
financial indicators used in Bank appraisals have been included so as to allow
adequate monitoring during supervision. In line with the September 2, 1981,
agreement between the Bank and the Brazilian Government (para. 2.19 & 2.20),
the annual rates of remuneration for each beneficiary are assumed to be the
same as for the expected sector averages 1/, attained not only through tariffs
but also through the utilization of GGF resources. The funds thus generated
will be sufficient for the envisaged investment programs of each beneficiary2/.
4.22      The project costs for the seven beneficiaries are estimated
to come to about US$860.5 million equivalent, including physical and price
contingencies, and front-end fee for IBRD loan. The table below shows the
costs of the individual sub-projects and the corresponding financing plan:
1/   The September 2, 1981 agreement established that power utilities that are
beneficiaries of World Bank loans will maintain a rate of remuneration at
least at the average level for the sector, and for the sector it has been
assumed that the growth in the market will be the same as the growth in
remunerable investment so that the average rate of remuneration would
grow at the same rate as the tariff increases.
2/   Annex 4-4 includes Investment and Financing plans of all beneficiaries.

commercial banks, and ELETROBRAS will assist the beneficiaries in obtaining the
relevant cofinancing loans. Funds are expected to be needed in 1986 so that
adequate time would be available for making the necessary arrangements.
4.24      To ensure completion and adequate funding of the beneficiaries'
sub-projects, during loan negotiations it was agreed that the loan and
guarantee agreements contain the following conditions:
(a) The Federal Government will not interfere with timely execution of
the beneficiaries' sub-projects (para. 6.03(b).
1/   Figures in local currency have been omitted because the continued steady
devaluation of the local currency makes such figures meaningless, and
because they would detract from a clear presentation.
2/   The sector has traditionally received financing from BNDE, FINEP, FINAME,
BNH, and other development finance entities.



-29 -
(b) Before approving them, ELETROBRAS will discuss with the Bank any
modifications in the beneficiaries' investment programs that are
greater than 15% of the cost in real terms in any one year (para.
6.04(e).
(c) ELETROBRAS will undertake to inform the Bank annually of
funding requirements for satisfactory completion of the bene-
ficiaries' investment programs (para. 6.04(f).
(d) ELETROBRAS will assist in obtaining the necessary cofinancing or
counterpart funds to ensure satisfactory completion of the
beneficiaries' subprojects (para. 6.04(f).
Economic Analysis
4.25      ELETROBRAS has developed a long-range generation and transmission
investment program which optimizes project costs on a country-wide basis
(para.2.13). Within the context of this program, each utility has the
responsibility for developing its own distribution program, which is the case
of the beneficiaries of the proposed loan.    All program alternatives--
utilizing different voltage levels--have been selected through the method of
least-cost solution, with a discount rate of 11%, taken to be the opportunity
cost of capital in Brazil.
4.26      The economic analysis of the beneficiaries' investment programs has
also been carried out on the same basis as that normally adopted by the Bank in
appraising power projects. Since most costs and benefits of the sub-projects
cannot be segregated from those of the investment programs, the economic rate
of return was calculated for the programs as a whole. Because the economic
benefits of the programs cannot be properly quantified for this type of
project, the incremental revenues have been used as a proxy for economic
benefits (since tariffs are centrally controlled, they probably understate the
consumers willingness to pay). Revenues, which include the sole tax, were
calculated taking as a starting point the tariff levels for December 1982, and
adding the real increases of 5% in 1983 and in subsequent years, as established
in the September 2, 1981 agreement between the Bank and the Brazilian
government, when the sector achieves the 10% rate of remuneration and complete
recuperation of past shortfalls in remuneration (see paras. 2.19 & 2.20).
4.27      The calculation of rates is based on conservative assumptions.
Furthermore, the social impact of the Project is difficult to measure. Less
conservative assumptions, and inclusion of social benefits, would show higher
internal rates of return. Sensitivity analyses are also carried out in the
appraisals, as is normal Bank practice.



- 30 -
4.28      The appraisals of the beneficiaries' investment programs show the
following economic rates of return:
Economic
Beneficiary                 Rate of Return(%)
CERON                            11.0
MANAUS                           13.0
CEMAR                            14.6
CEPISA                            9.8
CEAL                             24.5
LIGHT                            28.3
ELETROPAULO                      31.7
The significant difference between t'he economic rates of return of the two
major distribution companies (LIGHT and ELETROPAULO) and those of the smaller
ones arises from the effects of the tariff equalization scheme currently
applied to electricity consumers in Brazil (para.2.17), and reflects the
different characteristics of the beneficiaries (see Annex 5.1).



- 31 -
5. THE BENEFICIARIES
5.01      There are wide variations in the general characteristics of the
prospective beneficiaries, as may be seen from the information provided in
Annex 5-1. The only common features are that they are all joint stock
corporations, and that they distribute electricity within their concession
areas from sub-transmission systems at 138 kV and lower voltage levels,
mainly 69 and 34.5 kV.  The location of the beneficiaries is shown in
Map No. 17091, and general data are given in Annex 5-1.
5.02      The organizational structures vary from case to case, but generally
there is a Board of Directors headed by a President who acts as the Chief
Executive Officer. The Board is appointed by the shareholders, and normally
its composition reflects the interests of majority and minority shareholders
in reasonable proportions.
5.03      In the appraisal reports prepared by ELETROBRAS the beneficiary
organizations are described and subject to critical analysis. Recommendations
are made for improving structures, and for obtaining support from consultants
where needed. The ELETROBRAS appraisal team is bringing in specialists from
other departments of ELETROBRAS and from other utilities to come to the
assistance of the beneficiaries, and the interaction between ELETROBRAS and the
beneficiaries shows improvements in organizational, operational, technical and
financial aspects (para. 4.07) even during the appraisal stage.
5.04      ELETROPAULO is by far the largest of beneficiaries, in terms of
energy sold (32,652 GWh) and consumers served (3.6 million). Its concession
covers the city of Sao Paulo and adjacent areas, known as "perifericos." The
sub-project is located in these outlying areas, where it will provide
electricity mainly for rural and low-income consumers; about 550,000 new
consumers are expected to be connected as a result of this subproject. This
beneficiary is a state-owned company.
5.05      The next largest beneficiary is LIGHT, the distribution company
for the city of Rio de Janeiro, with sales of 13,941 GWh and 2.0 million
consumers. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ELETROBRAS. Its sub-project is
designed to provide and improve electricity supply mainly in the "favela"
districts of Rio, in areas where currently there is no supply at all, or only
sub-standard supply distributed by "pirate" type small entrepreneurs at
exorbitant rates; about 450,000 new consumers are expected to be connected as
the result of this subproject.
5.06      As for the remaining beneficiaries, it will be seen from Annex 5-1
that they are all much smaller than the first two mentioned above. Except for
Manaus, temporarily owned by ELETRONORTE (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
ELETROBRAS) they are companies supplying electricity throughout their respect-
ive states, which are the principal owners, with ELETROBRAS having a minority
share-holding. Sales range from 724 GWh for CEAL (Alagoas) to 131 GWh for
CERON (Rondonia), and consumers vary from 214,945 for CEAL to 38,016 for CERON.



- 32 -
5.07      All these smaller beneficiaries operate in the less-developed areas
of Brazil (see Map 17091), where the expansion of existing distribution systems
is essential to the development of the areas concerned. Rondonia is a
state currently growing at the rate of about 25% per annum, and expansion of
electricity supply is one of the Government's highest priorities. This
explains why for this beneficiary, the sub-project to be financed constitutes
more than 50% of the total investment program.
5.08      The distribution system covering the city and surrounding areas of
Manaus is temporarily owned and administered by ELETRONORTE, since the state-
owned company, CELETRAMAZONAS, did not have the resources, financial and other-
wise, to take over this company which formerly was privately owned. ELETRONORTE
is responsible for generation and transmission in the Amazonas state and
adjacent territories, and is temporarily operating the Manaus system, which has
its own thermal generating plant. A hydroelectric project (Balbina) is
currently under construction, but its costs etc. have been excluded from those
of the Manaus distribution system since it is completely separate from it, and
all other generating plants owned or being built by ELETRONORTE have also been
excluded.
5.09      Except for a small loan to LIGHT ($20 million) in 1973, none of the
beneficiaries have previously been beneficiaries of Bank loans, but they
have all responded eagerly to the p;roposal presented to them by ELETROBRAS to
participate in this project. Technical and institutional improvements are
already showing, and ELETROBRAS is applying the experience gained during the
preparation of the previous loan (2138-BR, approved in May 1982) to their
handling of the beneficiaries. The manuals and methodologies developed during
that first project have made it possible for ELETROBRAS to identify, prepare,
and appraise 7 sub-projects in the short time of 12 months, without a dilution
of the high quality expected from work conducted according to Bank standards.
5.10      The ELETROBRAS project briefs and appraisal reports give all details
for the beneficiaries, providing all, the information (technical, economic,
financial, and institutional) which would normally be given in a Bank-style
appraisal. This is an indication that ELETROBRAS has successfully absorbed the
Bank's normal appraisal techniques and managed to get them accepted by these
new beneficiaries.

6. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following matters:
6.01      As conditions for effectiveness:
(a) the Brazilian Government will have enacted the February 1, 1984
tariff increase according to the September 2, 1981 agreement, as
amended (paras.2.19 & 2.20); and
(b) ELETROBRAS will provide the Bank with the respective onlending
agreements for at least three beneficiaries.
6.02      As condition for disbursement for each project category, ELETROBRAS
will provide the respective onlending agreement for each beneficiary.
6.03      The Brazilian Government will:
(a) ensure that adequate counterpart funding will be available to the
beneficiaries for the timely execution of the appraised subprojects
(para.4.29);
(b) permit completion of the appraised subprojects (para.4.24(a);
(c) provide the beneficiaries with tariff levels that are sufficient to
attain the 10% rate of remuneration, according to Brazilian
legislation and in line with the September 2, 1981 agreement, as
amended, (para.4.21).
(d) provide for the continuation of the compulsory loan after 1983
(para.3.24); and
(e) if Itaipu tariffs are higher than the bulk tariffs of the
South-Southeast region, undertake all measures required, in terms
satisfactory to the Bank, to insure that the agreed sector rates of
remuneration are achieved (para.2.21).
6.04      ELETROBRAS will:
(a) during the life of loan, discuss with the Bank before making any
major modifications in its policies and procedures for funding and
investment (para.3.14);
(b) during the project execution period, use as limits for its finances
specific ratios relating to spread, new borrowings for debt
servicing, indebtedness, and capital service (para.3.27);
(c) provide financial statements audited by independent accountants
acceptable to the Bank together with a report of the audit, not later
than four months after the end of each fiscal year (para.3.29(a));
(d) prepare such other reports as the Bank may reasonably request,
including project completion reports (para.3.29(b));



- 34 -
(e)  before approving them, discuss with the Bank any modifications in the
beneficiaries' investment, programs that are greater than 15% of the
cost in real terms in any one year (para.4.24(b));
(f)  undertake to inform the Bank annually regarding funding requirements
for satisfactory completion of the beneficiaries' investment programs
(paras.4.24(c);
(g)  assist in obtaining all the necessary cofinancing or counterpart
funds to ensure satisfactory completion of the beneficiaries
subprojects (para.4.24(d);
(h)  include in the onlending agreements the standard covenants of
Bank-financied power projects (such as reporting, access to works and
beneficiaries, connections for low-income consumers, reinvestment of
dividends, commitment of counterpart funding from State Governments,
accounting records, independent audits, indebtedness and debt service
coverage ratio, etc.) and. the specific recommendations included in
each of its own relevant appraisal reports; and
(i)  onlend the proceeds of the loan to the beneficiaries on the same
terms and conditions plus a charge of 1% on the outstanding balance,
with the foreign exchange risk being borne by the beneficiaries.
Recommendation
6.05      Given the above agreements, the project constitutes a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$250.6 million equivalent to ELETROBRAS to be repaid over
a period of 15 years including three years of grace.

FINANCIAL MONITORING INDICATORS
ELETROBRAS, in aiming to reduce the participation of borrowings in
its funding composition of its investment program, will use the following
ratios as limits during the project execution period:
1. With respect to any new borrowings to be relent to Sector
utilities, the relending terms and conditions will be the same as
as the borrowing terms, except that they will include an additional
relending charge of at least one percentage point on the
outstanding balance.
2. With respect to all debt, the interest rate on total loans
(calculated as the interest earned during the year divided by the
total loans at the end of the year) will be at least tw percentage
points higher than the interest rate on debt (calculated as the
interest paid or accrued during the year divided by the outstanding
debt at the end of the year).
3. For ELETROBRAS and its subsidiaries, new borrowings not for
relending or for direct investment, as a percentage of total debt
service on indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies, will not
exceed 100% in 1983, 88% in 1984, 80% in 1985, 70% in 1986, and 60%
in 1987.
4. The share of debt, excluding the reversion funds and the compulsory
loan, as a percentage of total equity and liabilities will be less
than 35% in any year. For this purpose, the reversion funds will
mean the net balance in the account used to control funds, under
this name and under the responsibility of ELETROBRAS, generated
according to Law No. 5,655 of May 20, 1971, as amended. The
compulsory loan will mean the net balance of the account used to
control funds, under this name and under the responsibility of
ELETROBRAS, generated according to Law 6,180 of December 11, 1974,
as amended.
5. The capital service coverage ratio will be maintained every year at
a level greater than 1.5. This ratio will be calculated as the
aggregate of interest, amortization, and dividend, reversion,
compulsory loan and sole tax, receipts net of operational and
general and administrative expenses, divided by the aggregate of
interest, amortization and dividend payments (receipts and payments
to be considered as net of reinvestment).
