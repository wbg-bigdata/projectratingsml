MEMORANDUM AND REOOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDUNT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT A8SOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE 8 REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE HENAN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENf PROJECT
1.        Ths following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit
for SDR 81.4 million (US$110 million equivalent) to the Poople's Reyublic of
China is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 35 years maturity. Proceeds of the IDA credit would be onlent by
the Ministry of Finance to the Henan Provincial Government (lMP) at an
interest rate of 5 5%, with repayment over 15 years, Lncluding a five-year
grace period. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by HPG. On-lending
rates to farmers would be no less than Agricultural Bank of China (A3C)
charges for subloans for similar purposes wlth simllar maturities and on-
lendlng rates for enterprises would be no less than People *s ConstructLon Bank
of China (PCBC) charges for subloans for similar purposes with similar
maturltles.
2.        Backoound. Agriculture ln Chlna, lncluding crops, livestock,
forestry and flsheries, provldes sustenance for over one bJllion peoples it is
an important source of lncome for some 190 million farm families and accounts
for about 30% of the country's GDP. Only about 137 million ha of China's land
area of 960 mllion ha are arable. Farming system are intensive wLth heavy
inputs of labor, chemical and organic fertilizers and small machinery. Narly
half of the cropped area is irrlgated. Foodgrains occupy about 70% of total
cropland and account for about one-third of the agrLiultural output.
Intensive farming has allomr' ChLaa to meet the basic food requiroments of its
populatLon, about 22% of the world's total, and to produce an lncreasingly
sophisticated mix of cash and co_merclal crops from less than 11% of the
world's arable land. China's decade-long rural reform program has revitalized
the agricultural sector, provlded impressive growth and structural changes
through the introductLon of the I %ductLon responsiblilty system, lncreased
producer prices and enlarged the r.le of the market. The gross value of
agricultural output lncreased by 83% in real terms during 1978-88 at an
average annual rate of 58, substantially more than that of the prevlous 25-
year period (3 2%). While sLgnLficant growth has bon achieved, the
Government's central concern ln recent years has been stagnating graln
productlon, whlch peaked at 407 million taos in 1984. Major recent efforts
have ben made to increase grain production and the 1984 record was surpassed
with the production of 435 millon ton  in 1990.
3.        Recent Government strategies to increase grain production lnclude
increasing state and local lnvestment ln agrLculture, mainly in lrrlgatLon
expansion and rehabilitation, and introducing partLal reforms in graln
procurement, distribution, prices and subsidies. Local governments ln
particular have placed hlgh priority on Lnvestments in uplands, natural
pastures, and bodies of water for expanding production and productivlty of
nonstaple food and commercial crops to moeet growLng demand for these
commodLtLes and increase local entlty proflts and farmer Lncomes. This has
enabled China to achieve significant lncreases ln the own area, productivity
and output of major industrLal crops and fruits.



4.        Lessons Learned from Provious IDA o2eratons.  Lending to date to
China's agricultural sector has included 25 operations involving a total
assistance of about US$2.5 billion, covering virtually every agricultural
subsector and every region of the country. Implementation of most of these
projects is both on schedule and satisfactory. Three IDA-financed
agricultural projects and one IFAD-funded project in China have recently been
completed (North China Plain Agriculture Project (Cr. 1261-HA), Heilongjiang
Land Reclamation Project (Cr. 1347-CHA), Rural Credit Project (Cr. 1462-CHA),
and Hebei Agricultural Development Project (IFAD Ln. 107-CHA). The Project
Completion Reports for all four projects indicate that project implementation
was successful, that economic rates of return were excellent, and that the
technology used for land development and drainage (in the North China Plain
and Heilongjiang projects) was sound and appropriate for wider application.
The IPAD project in Hebei, which has similar ecological conditions to Henan
was successful in increasing agricultural production through a program of
groundwater development, improved drainage and reduced salinity. The lessons
learned during the implementation of this project have been incorporated into
the design of the present project. These lessons weres (a) effective
salinity control has to carefully balance conjunctive use of surface and
groundwater; (b) alfalfa is a *uitable crop for reducing soil salinity, and
(c) the nutritional value of crop residues for animal feed can be
significantly increased by ammonification.
S.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The paramount objective of the
project is poverty alleviation, through relaxation of the major constraints
limiting agricultural productivity and rural value added in the poorest parts
of Henan Province. In the dry North China Plain region, this prooess starts
with expansion of irrigation and improved drainage, but must be augmented by
livestock and other commercial agriculture and agroindustry activitLes to
maximize income-earning opportunities. IDA involvement has been important in
asuring that design of each component meets the highest international
standards, that environmental considerations are incorporated into design of
each activity, and that valuable approaches are broadened province-wide.
6.        Proiect Obiectives.  The project would support Henan Province's
development plan, which aims to alleviate poverty and increase farmer lncomes
in 20 of Henan's poorest counties by increasing the proenctivity of
agriculture, livestock and fishery and developing agroindustries. The project
woulds (a) provide additional water and inputs to allow intensification of
productivity of existing low-yielding crops and diversification of the
cropping pattern; (b) alleviate soil salinity and waterlogging problems; (e)
develop marginal lands for alfalfa and fruit production; (d) develop low-lying
areas for fish productions (e) promote an effective use of crop residues ln
expanding livestock production; (f) invest in agroprocessing and agroindustry
to make use of agricultural by-productsl (g) improve the province's ability to
manage water resources effectively, and (h) strengthen province-wide research,
extension and environmental protection programs.
7.        Proiect Descrintion. The project would:  (i) provide additional
irrigation water by improving and expanding four Yellow River DiversLon
Schemes, and sink 4,900 wells inide and 8,600 wells outside the schemes; (li)
eliminate waterlogging and salinity problems by providing dralnage and flood



-3-
protection schemes; (iii) set up a water monitoring and evaluation system and
develop a water resources plan for the province; (iv) provide inputs, improve
seed production facilities, strengthen agricultural research and extension;
(v) increase efficiency in ruminant productlon through improved feed, breeding
and veterinary services; (vi) increase involvement of households in commercial
pig and poultry production; (vii) promote use of cotton stalk and wheat straw
in paper manufacturing and increase processing of agricultural products into
industrial inputs; (viii) develop about 1,000 ha of low-lying land for fish
production, modernization of hatcheries and feed mills, and (ix) provide
equipment, facilities, training and technical assistance for environmental
monitcring and protection programs. The project, to be carried out over five
years, provides funds for works; vehicles, machinery and equipment;
fertilizer, pesticides and materials; and training and technical assistance.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$196.0 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$91.2 million (470). Retroactive
financing of up to US$9 million is being recommended for expenditures made
between November 1, 1990 and the date of signing of the Development Credit
Agreement. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are showi in schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. The project is in an advanced
state of preparation and is ready for implementation. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are
given in Schedules C and D respectively and a map is attached. The Staff
appraisal Report, No. 9041-CHA dated April 16, 1991, is also attached.
S.       Actions Aree. The principal assurances obtained from the
national and local governments are as followss (a) four revolving funds would
be established by county Bureaus of Finance for wells and water saving pipes,
farm inputs, orchards, and livestock activities for onlending to farmers at
interest rates no less than ABC's prevailing rates; (b) no wells in the
project area other than those financed under the project would be drilled or
rehabilitated except as agred with IDA based on a final assessment of
groundwater resources; (c) draft operational guidelines of agroprocessing and
agroindustrial enterprises would be provided for review by IDAs (d) project
funds would be made available to enterprises and farmers at interest rates no
less than PCBC or ABC charges on subloans for similar purposes and terms; (e)
operation and maintenance (06M) plans for each irrigation scheme would be
revised by December 31, 1992, and water charges would be increased annually to
fully cover the 051 costs; (f) the Project Management Office would price farm
inputs to farmers to reflect the import cost plus distribution margin and
would review these prices each year; (g) all agrochemicals financed undor the
project would be approved by IDA and used in accordance with guidelines
acceptable to IDA, and (h) the Provincial ZEvlronmental Protection Bureau
(PEPB) would approve the final designs of waste treatment facilities for each
agroprocessing and agroindustrial enterprise prior to construction and the
enterprises would implement and maintain effluent monitoring and treatment
systms according to the P3PB-approved designs. Understandings were obtained
at negotiatlons that passenger vehicles would be provided by Henan, and a
review of cotton price incentives would be undertaken each year and the
results and recommendations would be communleated to the National Prlce Bureau
and IDA.

9.        §SMc4l IEmhais (lUmacts on Poverty and NRsMlI* The projeCt would
contribute significantly to poverty alleviation by increasing rural incomes
through crop diversification, higher yields, and livestock, fishery, end
agroprocessing activities. On average, 630,000 poor farm families would be
enabled to double their incomes, many from such a low base that increases in
welfare would be very great, as has occurred in previous projects in the North
China Plain region. Much of the. increases ln farm family income would be
generated by increased gainful employment of women, presently the most
severely underemployed segment of the population. The project would
specifically cater to their needs by specifying recruitment and training of
approximately 8,500 female village farmr technicians to serve the special
needs of women farmers, but much of the diversification of rural activities
embodied in the project would automatically bnefit women.
10.       Benefits and Justlficaton. At full development the project would
produce 633,000 tons of crops valued at US$94 million, 145,000 tons of frults
valued at US$30 million, and 27,700 m3 of tiber and 11,250 tons of wlcker
valued at US$3 million annually. Incremental production of fish and livestock
would be US$9 million. Value added of agroindustries would be US$10 m$ilion
annually. The economic rate of return for the project as a whole is 36%.
11.       RJsks. The project faces no major organizational or technical
risks. The Provincial Government is highly committed to it. The risks that
do exist are either small or have been effectively minimied. The risk that
the development of well irrigation might adversely affect wetlands has been
minimized by delaying implementation in Yanjin County until satisfactory
environmental evaluation ha been made. The risk that the groundwater
recharge technology might not be effective has been minimLzed by limiting the
scale of the ubcompon_t to a pilot scheme. The risk of inadequate
counterpart funding has ben minimLsed by assurances from Henan that it would
annually provide IDA with proposed and approved budgetary allocations in
advance and that the Project Leading Groups at each levl would mobillze
counterpart funding.
12.               *Ln   I am satisfied that the proposd Credit would
comply wlth the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
