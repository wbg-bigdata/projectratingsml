PRQJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
(LOAN 2330-EGT)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Road Maintenance
Project (Loan 2330-EGT), The loan was for the amount of US'24 million and was
approved on November 14, 1983. It was closed on June 30, 1990, three years
behind schedule. An amount of about US$0.97 million remained undisbursed, and
was thus cancelled on the closing of the loan account.
2.    The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division
of the EMENA Regional Office and the Borrower. The former prepared the
preface, evaluation sunmnary, and parts I and III, while the latter prepared
part II.
3.    Preparation of the PCR started after the Bank's final supervision
mission of the project in February 1990. Its contents are based, inter alia,
on the Staff Appraisal Report, the President's Report, correspondence between
the Bank and Borrower, inaternal memoranda, supervision reports and
consultants' reports.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
(LOAN 2330-EGT)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obioctive
1.    The objective of the Project was to support the Government's efforts to
improve road maintenance and help improve road planning, training and traffic
safety and control (para. 3.01).
ImpleULentation Experience
2.    The original closing date had been over-optimistic and the loan closing
date was extended three times at the request of the Government (para. 5.02).
At the time of closing, most objectives had been met, but the road maintenance
plan was delivered ,.ith more than one year delay, and the upgrading of the
district workshops responsible for executing equipment repairs was not carried
out (paras. 5.05 and 7.08). Also, because of the delay in preparing the road
maintenance plan, the review of performance of first year maintenance was
replaced by a National Traffic Census (para. 7.05).
3.    The Project encountered negligible procurement problems.  There were
some procurement delays, but most deliveries, with the exception of a
cancel,d order for eight agricultural tractors, had been made at loan closing
(para. 5.04).
4.    Although the Bank had given Copies of the Guidelines for Financial
Reporting to RBA, audit reports (carried out by the Government's Central
Auditing Organization) were insufficient, and not in accordance with Bank
requirements (para. 5.06).
5.    At the closing of accounts, an undisbursed amount of US$967,412.79 was
cancelled; 96% of the loan was actually disbursed. Delays in proiect
implementation caused the cost of individual loan components to rise
significantly over the appraisal estimates. Disbursements far equipment and
spare parts were 108% of the estimated cost, followed by consultants se,.vices'
cost which were 182% of the original estimations. Fellowship disbursements
received the highest share of increase at 290.5% of the original estimated
amount (para 6.01). All increases were made from Category 4, Unallocated.
Results
6.    Overall, the project was rated as having only moderate problems
throughout the implementation period. Despite the frequent delays and its
generally slow implementation, the project did achieve its main objectives.
Output for the road maintenance plan for 1988 was only 50% of the minimum
program that was supposed to be carried out to eventually reach the preferred
program, though RBA disputes this assertion (para. 7.02). In any case, the
preferred program was not executed before the loan closinE date.



. iii -
7.    By March 1989, most axle-load controls had been installed and fines were
being imposed for excessive loads (para. 7.03).
8.    The Traffic Signs Workshop started operating in January 1990 when
electric power was finally installed. In February 1990, familiarization of
operators started to take place (para. 7.04).
9.    The national traffic census, added to the project in July 1987, was
completed as scheduled in February 1989. Permanent and periodic counting
stations continue to monitor traffic volumes automatically (para. 7.05).
10.   The training center was updated and trainees received the planned 150
hours of professional instruction which has provided them with hands-on-
experience of the required hardware and software packages used in the computer
system. All fellowships were completed in July 1988. In addition, on-the-
job training was undertaken and RBA extended the consultants' contract by six
months to increase its staff training (para 7.06).
Project Sustainability
11.   Economic rates of return have been re-calculated and vary from 110
percent to 480 percent for roads with an ADT of 4,800 and 19,000 respectively
(para. 8.05).
Project Sust'inabilitv
12.1 Sustainability of road maintenance depends, to a large extent, on future
government budget allocations. As for the axle-load controls, income
generated from the fines and other road-related revenues would afford future
expansion in other parts of Egypt.
12.2 The effectiveness of the traffic census component should aid RBA in
planning for future maintenance, rehabilitation and construction.
12.3 The upgrading of the training workshops in Nasr City and instructors'
capabilities under the project should ensure that future generations of RBA
staff will receive a high standard of training similar to that received by
their colleagues from the consulting firm.
Findings and Lessons Learnt
13.   Although the project has been successful in meeting most of its
objectives, a number of lessons have been learnt. These lessons should be
used to improve future projects in Egypt:
(i) A more realistic time frame must be taken into consideration when
dealing with the Egyptian road sub-sector in the future. A
somewhat longer profile should be used when designing future
projects. Time must also be allowed for the inexperience and
bureaucratic procedures that generally hinder the dealings of the
Egyptian Government.



- iv -
(ii) Many of the project implementation delays could have been avoided
had a committed project unit been formed. This was the first Bank
operation in highway maintenance in Egypt and the Appraisal
milssion should have recognized that implementation delays were
predictable given the inexperience of RBA staff in following Bank
proecdures (para. 13.01).
(iii) Concerning the delays and quality of audit reports, the Bank staff
should establish early contact with Government auditors to
familiarize them with Bank auditing requirement:.
(iv) For future training programs to fulfill objectives, participants'
weakness or lack of knowledge of English must be taken into
account. Training should be conducted as far as possible in the
local language.
14.   The project was successful in achieving its important institutional
objectives of upgrading RBA staff training and helping improve planning,
traffic safety and control. It was less successful in other respects: only
about 50X of the Minimum Desirable Routine Maintenance Program (MRMP) was
achieved while the upgraaing of the district workshops in charge of equipment
repairs was postponed. In future, the Bank should examine carefully
Government's ability to execute projects of such a magnitude and agree on more
realistic implementation dates.

2.0  Background
Inr_odugtion
2.01 The road maintenance project was the Bank's first association with the
Egyptian road sub-sector and the tenth Bank-financed operation for transport
sector development in Egypt. Pr-evious loans and credits assisted with the
rehabilitation of transport facilities in Egypt. They included three loans
for the development of the Suez Canal (Loan 243-EGT of 1959, US$56.59 million;
Loan 1064-EGT of 1974, US$50 million; and Loan 1482-EGT of 1977, US$100
million), one credit and one loan for the modernization of the Egyptian
Railway (Credit 284-EGT of 1972, US$30 million; and Loan 1098-EGT of 1975,
US$37 million) and one loan for the rehabilitation of Alexandria Port (Loan
1239-EGT of 1976, US$45 million); two other loans involved the construction of
a new port in El Dikheila (Loan 2183-EGT of 1982, US$132 million) and the
improvement of the efficiency of public transport in Cairo (Loan 2176-EGT of
1982, US$59 million); and a tourism project (Credit 909-EGT of 1976, US$32.5)
which included, among its many infrastructure components in Luxor, the
widening of the corniche road and the upgrading of the airport, together with
the provision of new cruiser docks and ferry landings.
2.02 The condition of the transport network at loan preparation and appraisal
was considered generally poor. In addition to the negative effects of tbe
1973 war which restricted road maintenance, pressure on the then existing and
long suffering infrastructure facil!ties was increasing because of rapid
population growth. In fact, road facilities had reached their maximum
practical capacity.



2-
2.03 In 1976, the lcansport Planning Authority (TPA) conducted a two-phased
National Transport S.udy (NTI) completed in 1977 and 1981 respectively. TPA
then allocated LE 408 million (then US$583 million; LE 0.70/IUS$l) for the
five-year Transport Plan (1983-1987) and LE 1,735 million (US$918 million; LE
1.89/US$l) for the three-year period 1988-1990 for new road construction,
rehabilitation and maintenance.
2.04 The appraisal mission visited Egypt in November 1980 and an update
mission was conducted in February 1983. The long interval between these
missions was due to the Government's initial desire to finance the project
from IDA rather than IBRD funds. Negotiations were completed on May 17, 1983.
At the last moment, the Government preferred to exclude road rehabilita%:ion
from the loan, financing it from its own resources. Accordingly, the proposed
loan amount was reduced from $63 million to $24 million. The Bank obtained a
separate commitment that RBA would finance rehabilitation of 500 kilometers a
year by 1987. This level was reached in 1988.
Sector Development Objectives
2.05 In 1980 Egypt had 28,725 kilometers of main and secondary roads. This
extensive network had deteriorated as a result of lack of maintenance and
increased demand through high population growth. At appraisal, it was
estimated that 60 percent of the roads were in need of either widening or
rehabilitation, and that increasing per capita income would increase the
demand for improved roads.
2.06 Although at appraisal it was estimated that there were about 22 motor
vehicles per 1000 inhabitants (which was considered low in comparison to other
countries at a similar level of development), the ratio was considered high
when compared to available roads. Most of the road network in the Delta and
along the Nile had not been designed for modern, heavy vehicles and their high
proportion of total traffic. At the time of project appraisal, the growth
rate of passenger cars was 14% p.a., and that of heavy buses and vehicles was
43% p.a. Heavy traffic represented between 30% and 60% of all traffic on the
roads.
2.07  High traffic volumes and growth rates coupled with an inefficient road
network and insufficient maintenance led to congestions, particularly near the
urban areas. Most of Egypt is desert with the main habitable areas of the
country in the Delta and along the 900 kilometers north/south of Nile valley
which has o.nly 39,000 km2 of usable land; this restricts east/west development
of roads in order to preserve agricultural land. Thus the aim of the project
was to assist in optimizing use of the existing main and secondary network
through better operational arrangements and the strengthening of the
maintenance capabilities of transport agencies. Completion of the project was
expected to lead to savings in vehicle operating and delayed road
rehabilitation and increased safety.
2.08 An axle-load survey carried out in 1981 by RBA staff and Cairo
University found that 17% of all axles exceeded the legal limit of 10 tons,
causing 80% of all road damage. On this basis, it was decided to include the



purchase of fixed and mobile weighscales in tAhe project so as to regulate
overloaded trucks.
2.09 It was also noted that road signs were of poor quality and could be
contributing to lack of road safety. RBA's manual workshop produced 50 signs
a day, whereas a new upgraded workshop, to be included in the project, could
produce up to 150 signs a d.y in both Arabic and English. Driver education
programs wore also included.
2.10 RBA also proposed the purchase of a computer based data processing
equipment and traffic counting machinery to keep track of tra;fic volumes ar.d
be able to make decisions related to maintenance, rehabilitation and
construction, mnder a contract to be signed with Cairo University. In the end
this contract was not signed; instead, a National Traffic Census was carried
out by consultants (para. 7.05).
2.11 The Bank recommended that RBA undergo intensive staff and instructor
training so that they would be able to meet the demands of sustaining improved
maintenance programs in the future. The same instructors responsible for
training RBA employees also reviewed the needs of RBA workshops and found them
lacking modern equipment.
2.12 Thus the economic basis of the maintenance program was the protection of
past capital investments by means of annual marginal expenditures. The
upgrading of RBA's training facilities would enhance RBA's capabilities in
road mait.tenance and rehabilitation while the augmentation of road safety
conditions would reduce accident rates.
PolLCX C2=93xt
2.13 The five year plan (FY82-87), of which the Road Maintenance Project
formed a part, comprised investments of about LE 35 billion (then about US$50
billion). More emphasis was placed on agriculture and the mobilization of the
country's private and public savings towards more efficient expenditure.
2.14 The Egyptian Government had realized that sustaining growth of the
economy required efforts to overcome the constraints of poverty and
unemployment by (i) mobilizing both national and foreign resources to finance
high levels of investment and (ii) increasing the productivity of labor and
capital through institutional and organizational reforms and effective
investment planning.
2.15 The policy framework of the five year plan took into account reforms
previously suggested by the Bank such as tax reform, targeting of subsidies
and a more effective energy program. Following the same policy, the Transport
Plan, recognizing the importance of increasing transport prices, recommended
new regulations for the administration of land transport services, and
proposed a series of other projects with the aim of increasing the capacity of
existing infrastructure facilities to accommodate the expected growth in
traffic (at the time of appraisal, total freight transport was expected to
increase by 55% by 1987, passenger traffic was predicted to increase by 75X by



1987, and railways and inland waterways were also expected to increase
through future Bank projects in these areas).

3.01 The main objectives of the Project were to (i) assist the Government in
improving the road network by emphasizing the maintenance of existing roads,
(ii) furnish technical assistance during the implementation of the project,
and upgrade RBA staff training to strengthen the institutional capabilities of
RBA within the framework of organizational reform going on in the country as a
whole, and (iii) help improve road planning, traffic safety and contrcl.
Proiect Components
3.02 At appraisal, tile components of the project were:
(i)   a two year (1984-1985) program to improve routine road maintenance
over the entire road network of 13,000 km administered by RBA,
including the purchase of road maintenance equipment and spare
parts needed to complete and expand, as necessary, the fleet for
routine road maintenance in the eight maintenance districts;
(ii) the upgrading of the training capabilities of RBA to meet the
increased needs of the routine road maintenance and rehabilitation
programs inclvting the improvement of existing installations,
workshops, laboratories, training aids and the provision of
technical assistance and fellowships; and
(iii) an action plan to increase traffic safety, control and RBA's
planning cavabilities, including the purchase of a new roadsign
workshop, traffic control and counting equipment, the purchase and
installation of mobile and fixed weighscales and a computer-based
data processing system for traffic census.
4.0 Proiect Design and Organization
4.01 The RBA, having prepared a satisfactory study in 1982 on Optimum
Maintenance Policies for the Paved Delta Network, decided to prepare a routine
maintenance action program to be implemented by eight regional districts that
supervise the network of 13,000 km of paved lanes. Forty-five operational
units would carry out routine maintenance, with each unit responsible for 290
km of roads. Of the 45 units, 25 would cover routes in the Delta and Nile
valley, and the rest would cover desert roads.
4.02 It was agreed that training would be provided to RBA's staff of
engineers, assistants, operators, supervisors and mechanics. RBA already had
a training center (30 permanent and part-time instructors) in the outskirts of
Cairo. However, the quality of training needed to be improved since the
training facilities available in the center were outdated.



4.03 To strengthen RBA's institutional potential and operational efficiency,
and increase the staff's knowledge and skills, the project included upgrading
of staff and workers' training capabilities as follows:
(i)   Qualified consultants provided 50 man-months of technical
assistance to help identify RBA's staff needs, training
specifications, the required improvements in installations,
training schedules, and upgrading of instructors; and
(ii) Fifty man-months of fellowships for instructors and other RBA
staff.
4.04 Before appraisal and together with Cairo University, RBA conducted an
action plan to improve traffic safety, achieve better control of heavy traffic
and establish a system for traffic counting. Therefore, the project included
a new sign workshop -o improve road and bridge signalling and marking, fixed
and mobile weighstations to control overloading, and a computer-based data
processing system to improve traffic counting. Other steps to be undertaken
in association with Cairo University, were driver education programs and
revisions to traffic regulations.
4.05 RBA executed the project. Equipment lists prepared by RBA were reviewed
and approved by the Bank. The consultants recruited by RBA were selected in
accordance with the Bank procedures and guidelines for the use of consultants
of 1981. The project was expected to be completed by June 30, 1986, and the
loan closing date was expected to be June 30, 1987.
5.0 Proiect Im21.mentation
5.01 Following the first two years of project implementation, which reflected
RBA's inexperience with Bank requirements, the project improved its execution
as the following paragraphs show. Tables 1, 2 and 3 present the project
timetable, the staff inputs and mission date, respectively.
Loan Effectiveness. Start-up and Closing Date
5.02 The loan was signed on November 14, 1983 and became effective on April
10, 1984. The loan closing date was extended three times at the request of the
Government. The original closing date had been over-optimistic and these
extensions allowed the Government to implement the road maintenance program
which only started in January 1988 due to delays in the delivery of equipment.
In general, there were long delays between bids, signing of contracts and
delivery of equipment. The slowness and long delays in the execution of other
components of the project were attributable to bureaucratic procedures, RBA's
inexperience and unfamiliarity with Bank procedures, and to the Bank's
unfamiliarity with the road subsector in Egypt. The final closing date was
June 30, 1990, although disbursements continued until October 31, 1990. At
loan closing, most objectives had been met. The only objective that was not
optimally realized was the upgrading of the district workshops responsible for
equipment repair (see para. 7.08). Because of the delay in preparing the road
maintenance plan, and in view of the limited road maintenance carried out in



the first year (paras. 5.05, 7.02), the component for the review of
maintenance performance was replaced by a National Traffic Census (para.
7.05).
Studies
5.03 An in-house plan for the Review of the Maintenance and Repair of
Equipment and Vehicles, the rudiments of which were satisfactory, was prepared
by RBA with a one-year delay. The reason for the delay was that most
engineers responsible for the study had been sent abroad on the fellowship
program. Because of continuous delays, implementation of the plan had not
started by the time of the Closing of the Loan.
Procurement
5.04 Bids for the procurement of the main list of road maintenance equipment
were opened on October 1, 1985, about two years after the time estimated in
the SAR. Evaluation and proposals for contract awards and contract signature
took more than one and a half years. Bids for the procurement of additional
equipment were opened on September 15, 1988 and the Bank approved five
contracts as recommended by RBA. All deliveries, with the exception of a
cancelled order for eight agricultural tractors which were part of the
additional equipment, have been made. Again delays in procurement were due to
slow decision making, Government regulations and bureaucracy.
The Maintenance Plan
5.05 A contributing factor to the delay in project implementation was that
the Road Maintenance Program, which was originally scheduled to have been
delivered in October 1986 to the Government by consultants, was deferred to
December ; 87 with the Bank's concurrence since a more comprehensive data-
base was to be developed by that later time. RBA started executing a "Minimum
Desirable Routine Road Maintenance Program" (MRMP) only in January 1988 (para.
7.02).
Audits and Reportina Delays
5.06 Although the Bank had given copies of the Guidelines for Financial
Reporting to RBA, audit reports (carried out by the Government's Central
Auditing Organization), when received, either in Arabic, or in English were
incomplete, and not in accordance with Bank requirements. Furthermore, the
Government Auditors refused to sign any statement not written in Arabic and
refrained from giving an opinion as to the soundness of the financial
statements provided. Another serious problem was that only disbursements from
the proceeds of the loan, without reference to the local counterpart funds,
were given in the auditors' certificate. Up to the closing of the loan in
June 1990, RBA had not sent to the Bank audit reports that conformed to the
Bank's guidelines. At the closing of the loan, audit statements for 1989/90
had not been submitted. The Bank sent continuous reminders to RBA to submit
acceptable audit reports, but remained unsuccessful. Acceptable progress



reports were received regularly although they became very sketchy after the
departure in December 1988 of the road maintenance consultants.
Other Delam
5.07 Negotiations for the purchase of technical books worth UK pounds 30,000
collapsed because the supplier failed to provide the price of each book as
requested by RBA. Other negotiations with the same company concerning the
purchase of training aids were discontinued because equipment suppliers made
more attractive offers.
6.0 Project Cost and Disbursement
6.01 Although only 96X of the estimated loan was actually disbursed, the cost
of individual project components rose significantly over the appraisal
estimates because of the delays in project implementation (para. 6.02).
Disbursements for equipment and spare parts were 108Z of the estimated cost,
followed by consultant services' costs which were 182X of the original
estimations. Fellowship disbursements received the highest share of increase
at 290.5Z of the original estimated amount. The reason that these higher
costs could still be absorbed by the loan is that an unallocated amount
originally estimated at US$3.64 m was redistributed among the three
components, and only US$967,412.79 was cancelled (Tables 4 and 5).
6.02 The loan disbursement profile was 3-1/4 years longer than that expected
at appraisal (see Figure 1). By the end of June 1987, the original loan
closing date, only about 22X of the loan proceeds had been drawn down. At the
actual loan closing in June 1990, about 84X of the loan had been disbursed.
Disbursements, however, continued until October of the same year, and the
total amount withdrawn was US$ 23.03 million, i.e., about 96X of the original
loan amount. Table 6 shows the project cost estimated at appraisal and its
final cost, while Table 7 gives the estimated and actual disbursements from
the loan account.
7.0 Project Results
7.01 Despite the frequent delays and its generally slow implementation, the
project did achieve its main objectives.
Road Maintenance Program
7.02 Expenditure for road maintenance for calendar year 1988 was only 50X of
the minimum program that was supposed to be carried out to eventually reach
the preferred program. Although expenditure does not give a full picture of
implemented road maintenance, it is a reference point to assume that roughly
one half of the minimum program was carried out. However, RBA maintained that
such figures did not include the salary of personnel, which would make the
minimum program executed at 1001. However, either way, the minimum program
did not increase to the preferred program before the end of the project.
Table 8 indicates the maintenance expenditures for the above programs as well



. - -
as the expenditure during 1986/87, the year before the minimum program
started.
Axle-Load Control
7.03 Delays in acquiring the needed equipment (which were delivered in 1986)
delayed the control of the axle-load, but by March 1989 most had been
installed and fines were being imposed for excessive loads.
The Traffic Signs Workshop
7.04 Although completed in November 1988, the Traffic Signs Workshop started
o-erating only in January 1990 when electric power was finally installed.  In
February 1990, familiarization of operators started to take place.
Traffic Census
7.05 The National Traffic Census, added to the project in July 1987, was
completed as scheduled in February 1989. Permanent and periodic counting
stations are already monitoring traffic volume automatically. All data are
currently being sent to the main computer where they are processed and stored.
Training Program
7.06 Nine trainees finished the planned 150 hours of professional instruction
which provided them with hands-on-experience of the required hardware and
software packages used in the headquarter computer system. All 66 fellowships
were completed by July 1988. In addition, on-the-job training was undertaken
to make RBA district staff familiar with all the computer center's functions
to ensure their readiness to take up data processing duties. In light of the
satisfactory outcome of the traffic census, RBA extended the consultants'
contract by six months to increase its staff training. A problem that faced
the foreign instructors was the poor level of English of some of the
participants. The more fluent students, however, provided help to the less
fluent ones (for details of other training see Tables 9-13).
UD!rading the Training Center
7.07 It took two years for the laboratory equipment purchased for the
training center to be installed and reach its final stage due to continuous
delays in restructuring the laboratory.
Upgrading of Workshops
7.08 The district workshops were not adequate for the rational utilization of
the project equipment repairs. Although RBA assured that local district funds
were available to upgrade the shops, RBA did not proceed to improve the
workshops. The equipment, which was new, did not need excessive repairs, but
the situation should change in a few years.

8.0 Economic Evaluation and Rates of Return
8.01 The economic basis of the project was that the whole economy would
benefit from increased road maintenance since it entails a reduction in
continuous and costly road repairs. Upgrading RBA's staff capabilities would
support the continuity of road maintenance in the future, while the
reinforcement of the traffic census component would help avoid further road
deterioration, increase road safety and collect fines (para. 2.12).
8.02 Although the economic rate of return (ERR) calculations at appraisal
included the costs of the training facilities together with the costs of
materials and supervision, the benefits considered were only those accruing
from the road maintenance program. Economic rates of return for the road
links included in the project ranged from 40% to 100% with net present values
at a 12% discount rate per km of road of LE 100,000 to about LE 300,000. The
first year expected benefit/cost ratios ranged between 50% to about l207.
These high ratios indicated that the proposed road maintenance program would
be fully justified from an economic point of view.
8.03 The rates of return accruing from technical assistance, training and
traffic census (later added to the project), all satisfactorily completed,
were not calculated at appraisal.
8.04 Benefits stemming from a road maintenance program are reductions in
vehicle operating costs (VOCs, Table 14). Research indicates that: (i)
annual routine maintenance results in a saving of about 15 percent of VOCs,
(ii) timely periodic maintenance (surface dressing and asphalt overlay) saves
about 30 percent in VOCs and (iii) delayed rehabilitation results in an
increase of VOCs of about 50 percent for each year that the roads were to be
allowed to remain in a badly broken state. These percentages have been
confirmed by consultants financed by the Road Maintenance Project.
8.05 Using the results of a 1989 traffic census (the latest one available),
the ERRs have been re-calculated for a typical road stretch of ten kilometers
and an average daily traffic (ADT) of (i) about 4,800, (ii) about 9,600, and
(iii) about 19,000. The ADTs consist of passenger cars (about 80 percent),
busses (7 percent), light trucks (8 percent), and heavy trucks (4 percent).
Based on a cost of rehabilitation of LE 1,260 thousand, annual costs of
routine maintenance of LE 30 thousand, a cost of surface dressing of LE 72
thousand (six years after rehabilitation), a cost of asphalt overlay of LE 410
thousand (six years after surface dressing), and an expected life of 20 years,
and using the percentages of the above para. 8.04 (assumed delays of three
years for rehabilitation and asphalt overlay), results in ERRs of 110 percent
for a road with an ADT of 4,800, 230 percent for a road with an ADT of 9,600,
and 480 percent for a road with an ADT of 19,000. Table 15 shows details of
costs and benefits streams. The overall ERR is estimated at 175 percent.
Such high ERRs are not unusual for road maintenance projects. They are higher
than those established during appraisal since fuel costs have risen more
sharply than costs of commodities following general inflation, and a three
year delay in program execution led to higher traffic levels than at
appraisal, thus, increased the potential losses to be avoided by routine and



-10 -
periodic maintenance. The reduction of the minimum maintenance program (para.
7.02) affected the total number of kilometers rather than the quality of
works.
9.0 Impact of the Project
9.01 At present, it would be difficult to attempt to evaluate the long run
impact of the project on the transport sector in Egypt. Upgrading the
workshops and training the staff and workers of RBA should eventually help
upgrade the institution as a whole and provide some of the reform needed.
Income from axle-load controls should help extend the control to other parts
of the network. The new traffic signs should become conducive to smoother
traffic. Concerning the third component which is road maintenance, it is
unfortunate that only the MRMP was executed rather than the preferred program.
9.02 In addition, the appraisal report had expected traffic to increase by
55X by 1987. Setting aside the three and a half years delay (and consequently
the even larger increase in traffic), Egyptian returnees from Kuwait and Iraq
and Kuwaiti refugees have already overstrained traffic in the country's
capital. Whether the maintained roads and new traffic signs will absorb this
unexpected increase remains to be seen.
10.0 Environmental ImRact
10.01 Routine road maintenance, carried out through systematic engineering
methods, has improved road trafficability, drainage, repair of shoulders and
provided new road signs and markings, all of which have had a beneficial
impact on the environment.
11.0 Pro1ect Sustainabilitv
11.01 Sustainability of road maintenance depends, to a large extent, on future
Government budget allocations. Reduced budget allocations are, however, not
expected to impede the quality of maintenance works (para. 8.05). As for the
axle-load controls, income generated from the fines and other road-related
revenues could afford future expansion in other parts of Egypt. However such
data remains unavailable.
11.02 The effectiveness of the traffic census component should aid RBA in
planning for future maintenance, rehabilitation and construction.
11.03 The upgrading of the training workshops in Nasr City and instructors'
capabilities under the project should ensure that future generations of RBA
staff will receive a high standard of training similar to that their
colleagues received with the consulting firm.
12.0 Bank Performance
12.01 The Bank was overly optimistic as to the Borrower's ability to
implement such a multi-component venture. This could be explained by the
Bank's unfamiliarity with the road sub-sector in Egypt. Thirteen supervision



- 11 v
missions, spread over five years, by experienced Bank highway engineers
provided guidance, quality control, procurement advice and additional
technical assistance, all aimed at improving the rate and quality of the
project implementation. However, the presence during supervision of a
financial analyst and/or an economist could have improved substantially the
monitoring of project's costs and the disclosure of accounts.
13.0 Borrower Performance
13.01 Whilst the project was effective in attaining most of its objectives, a
few observations could be made regarding the Borrower's performance. The
Borrower was inexperienced with Bank regulations and performance was hindered
by many bureaucratic routines and internal regulations at RBA. These
procedures conitributed to the delays in implementation such as procurement of
equipment, decisions in awarding contracts and lack of adherence to audit
covenants. Other delays were due to lack of coordination between Government
entities, such as the Cairo University, which was supposed to implement a
traffic census, but long delays made its execution uncertain (para. 5.02), and
the Electricity Authority, whose procrastination in connecting the new Traffic
Signs Workshop with electricity caused a 14 months' delay in its operation
(para. 7.04). The creation of a Project Coordination Unit within RBA at the
outset of the project would have certainly enhanced its implementation.
14.0  Bank - Borrower Relationshig
14.01 The relationship between the Bank and RBA and other Government officials
was excellent with a strong focus on problem solving. The presence of regular
Bank's missions was used by RBA to solve administrative and technical problems
arising between its Departments or with outside Administrations.
15.0 Consulting Services
15.01 Two consultancy firms were employed to provide the required technical
assistance. Both firms worked in association with Egyptian consultants. The
first firm (U.K.) was concerned with training and upgrading programs and road
maintenance, while the second (U.S.A) was responsible for the traffic census.
The consulting services rendered by the firms that undertook the training and
in traffic counting were so successful that RBA has extended their contracts
by several months to ensure staff ability to continue after the departure of
the consultants. Notwithstanding delays in installing the needed equipment,
training and fellowships were eventually satisfactorily completed. Reports,
appraisals and course outlines prepared by the two firms were satisfactory.
16.0 Project Documentation and Data
16.01 The SAR was comprehensive and provided a strong base for the evaluation
of project implementation. The legal documents provided a satisfactory
framework for project implementation. The main problems of implementation
were the over-optimistic project execution time plan proposed by the Bank and
the delays in audits and financial reports presented by the Government which
failed to submit audits that follow the Bank requirements.



- 12 -
17.0 Status of Covenants
17.01 With the exception of the following, covenants were complied with. RBA
did not respect the deadline of a covenant related to the preparation of a
training program because the consultant was hired in 1985 rather than in 1984.
Covenants regarding financial reports and audits were also not complied with
(para. 5.06). The status of compliance with covenants is shown on Table 16.
18.0  Les&2jns and Recommendations
18.01 Although the project has been successful in meeting most of its
objectives, a number of lessons have been learnt. These lessons should be
made use of to avoid similar pitfalls in future projects in Egypt:
(i)   Fuller analysis during project preparation of the institutional
and operational aspects of the Government agency(ies) responsible
for implementation of the project (particularly for a first
project in the sub-sector) would have demonstrated the need for
prudence in estimating the implementation schedule and
disbursement profile.
(ii) A more realistic time frame must be taken into consideration when
dealing with the Egyptian road sub-sector in the future. Time
must also be allowed for the inexperience and bureaucratic
procedures that generally hinder the dealings of the borrower's
agencies. A somewhat longer profile should be used when designing
future projects. Increased technical assistance by consultants
would have been beneficial to speedier implementation.
(iii) Many of the project implementation delays could still have been
avoided had a committed project coordination unit been formed.
Due to the many commitments of RBA officials, it would have been
more practical to form a "project unit" whose sole interest would
have been the execution of the project. A "project launching
seminar" could have been given to this project unit by the Bank in
implementation procedures, taking into account current internal
regulations of the Government. Such a seminar would not have only
benefited the project, but also give the Bark a better
understanding of the institutional constraints facing RBA.
(iv)  Concerning the delays and quality of audit reports, Bank staff
should establish early contact with auditors and accountants to
familiarize them with Bank auditing requirements.
(v)   In order to maximize benefits of future training programs,
participants' weakness or lack of knowledge of English must be
taken into account. Training arrangements should mandate to the
extend feasible courses conducted in the local language. Another
limitation the training consultants complained of was the
tardiness of the decisions to authorize selected staff to attend
training courses. As a result, some trainees were not available



- 13 -
at the time of the courses. The project unit mentioned in sub-
para (ii) above might have helped to resolve these problems.
19.0  Conclusion
19.01 The main objectives of the project were only partially achieved at loan
closing. They were the realization of only 50X of the Minimum Desirable
Routine Maintenance Program (MRMP) and the postponement in upgrading the
dis.rict workshops in charge of road maintenance. The project was more
successful in achieving its other equally important objectives regarding
technical assistance, the upgrading of RBA staff training and helping to
improve planning, traffic safety and control. In future, the Bank should
examine carefully Governments' ability to execute projects of such a magnitude
and fix more realistic implementation dates for such ventures.

PROJECT COMPETIO  REP
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
ROAD MAINTENANCE PROJECT
(LOAN 2330-EGT)
PART II PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.0   EvaluStion of Bank's Perform nce  "rIng the Evolution and the
Implementation of the Prolect
1.01 World Bank mission members were highly qualified in their respective
fields. They made it possible for RBA the cooperation during the evolution
and implementation of the project, which has been done in a satisfactory way.
But we have some comments on Bank's performance:
(i)   The checking and approval of the inspection and processing
committees by World Bank sometimes take more time to clarify
technical and financial points;
(ii)  RBA asked the World Bank to extend the validity of the loan,
because the original period was not sufficient for tendering,
processing and recommending the companies to be awarded. The
approval of World Bank for these results needed negotiations and
correspondences and telexes that took a long time, while the
delivery period proposed by some suppliers was about six months;
and
(iii) World Bank mission made visits to Cairo to follow-up the project
and solve problems or studying recommendations of RBA but these
visits more than six months apart caused delay in taking decisions
in these problems 1/.
2.0   lesson Learned
2.01 RBA propose in future that World Bank can have a permanent
representative in Cairo during the time of processing and awarding of contract
for the supply (equipments...etc.,) who 3hould have the full authority to make
decisions and recommendations.
~./   Note: For most of 1986-87 the missions were about three months apart.
In one case the Government requested a mission postponement because too
close to the previous one.



- 15 -
3.0   Evaluation of the Borrowers Own PerforMAnce during the Evolution and
ImRlementation of the Project
3.01 The performance of RBA in the overall project was quite good and
benefited in different activities of the loan such as Routine Road Maintenance
Program, including the procurement of equipment required for Road Ma:ntenance
and upgrading the Training Center, Traffic Census and Signs Workshop.
3.02 Implementation of Road Maintenance Project begun later than scheouled
due to the delay in the process of supplying the required equipment as a
result of issuing tenders for all items (about 25 item) of equipment at the
same time, which needed a longet time to finish inspections, checking and all
other processes to choose the successful offer.
3.03 At the same time RBA had given all effort to reach the minimum routine
maintenance program which was carried out with little or no problems.
3.04  With respect to Tiaffic Census, after the final report finished by the
consultant, RBA for the second year continued successfully the counting of
traffic all over the network.
4.0   Lessons Learned
4.01 Good preparation and planning for projects and exact estimation for time
needed for each step to fulfill the fixed period for execution are required.
To undertake a large program RBA needs to employ consultants to assist it in
the implementation or reduce the program to relate it to its implementation
capacity.
5.0   The Effectiveness of the RelationshiD between the Bank and the Borrower
aurina the Evolution and Im2lementation of the Protect
5.01 The relation between RBA and World Bank was wonderful and featured by
complete understanding and response on the part of World Bank to all the
demands and recommendations of RBA technical and financial affairs which have
received the utmost attention and follow-up of World Bank officials in charge
of Loan 2330-EGT. For example, when the additional equipments financed under
the loan had to be shipped after June 30, 1990 (Loan closing date) World Bank
advised an alternative system for payments of contracts so as to
satisfactorily fulfill the contractual obligations with the suppliers.
