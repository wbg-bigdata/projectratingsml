I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic Geography and the Transport System
1.01     Egypt has a land mass of about 1 million sq km.  However, most of its
43 million population and nearly all economic activity are confined to no more
than 4% of this area, the remainder being desert and wasteland. The main
economically active parts of the country are the 900 km long valley of the
Nile, especially its Delta, the area adjacent to the Suez Canal, and small
areas in both the eastern and western deserts. Nearly half of the population
lives in urban centers, of which Cairo with about 10 million inhabitants (and
accounting for about half of the nation's industrial output) and Alexandria at
the western corner of the Delta with 2.6 million, are the largest.
1.02     The most important transport corridors in Egypt are between Cairo and
Alexandria, and along the Nile. Other corridors lead to the Suez Canal from
the Nile Valley. Outside of urban areas, transport demand is greatest in the
densely populated Delta area, where agricultural development and its potential
are considerable, and where urban development is giving rise to increasing
intercity transport.
1.03     Egypt's diverse transport network is generally adequate in cover-
age, with road transport the dominant mode. The war years ending in 1973 left
the transport system in a dilapidated state, both with regard to its physical
assets and the organizations that are responsible for the sector. The main
physical deficiencies have been: (i) in the railways, with shortages of
locomotives and rolling stock, (ii) at Alexandria port which suffered
congestion through lack of handling facilities, (iii) the poorly maintained
road network; and (iv) waterways which are also in poor condition and operate
with an inadequate fleet. Since 1975, the Government has been correcting some
of these deficiencies with increased allocations for infrastructure in both
railways and ports (in which the Bank Group played a part with two railway
projects and a port project). The railways have not recovered significantly
as yet, because of the restrictive nationalized system under which it
operated. However, with a reform law in 1980, the railways have become
semi-autonomous and this provides a basis for reconstituting them as a viable
enterprise. For ports, the Government has embarked on a long-term port
development program based on the recently completed National Transport Study
(NTS) (para. 1.06) to alleviate capacity shortages at all ports.
1.04     Transport growth rates since 1975 (Table 1.1) have been about 12%
p.a. and are expected to continue at about this level in the coming years in
view of the anticipated rapid economic growth and the increase in population.
Road transport has been able to meet the growth in demand that other modes
have not been able to meet, but with increasing traffic, many roads will soon
reach capacity. The entire road network urgently needs improved maintenance,
and about 60% of the roads are in need of rehabilitation. With the increasing
demand, all transport tacilities are likely to come under severe strain.

B. Transport Organization, Coordination and Planning
Transport Organization and Coordination
1.05    Four principal government agencies are responsible for the transport
sector: (i) the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Shipping for main
and secondary roads, inland waterways, ports and shipping and the railways;
(ii) the Governorates for tertiary roads (local roads, both urban and rural);
(iii) the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation for airports and aviation;
and (iv) the Ministry of Petroleum for pipelines. Two other ministries also
participate:  the Ministry of Development, Housing and Land Reclamation in
infrastructure investments in the Suez Canal Zone, the Sinai and the western
desert and in specific urban development projects; and the Ministry of
Industry in industrial and mining projects, including the related transport
facilities. Roads, railways, and ports built by the latter two ministries are
normally handed over to the in-line Ministries for operation and maintenance.
Transport coordination is mainly handled at Cabinet level in which the
Governorates have participated through their Governors who since 1979 have
ministerial status in the Government. The Secretariat for Local Government
represents Governorate interests and acts directly through the Prime
Minister's Office for operational control.

Transport Planning
1.06    Transport planning had been fragmented and uncoordinated until 1973
when the Government set up the Transport Planning Authority (TPA) within the
Ministry of Transport and Communications. In 1976, the TPA initiated a
two-phased comprehensive National Transport Study (NTS), the first phase of
which was completed in 1977, and the second phase in March 1981. On the basis
of the NTS, TPA prepared a five-year Transport Plan for 1983-87; this has been
incorporated in the Government's National Development Plan covering the same
period. On the basis of recommendations of the NTS in April 1982, the Roads
and Bridges Authority (RBA) of the Ministry of Transport and Communications
completed a study on maintenance and rehabilitation of the road network and an
allocation of EE 200 million (US$238 million) for road rehabilitation and new
construction was included in the National Development Plan. Simultaneously,
routine road maintenance reorganization started and budget allocations were
increased.
1.07    The proposed Transport Plan combines several policy recommendations
regarding pricing, regulation and administration of land transport services
along with a series of projects designed to increase the capacities of basic
infrastructure to meet the expected growth in traffic. The NTS projects total
freight transport to increase by about 55% by 1987, reaching 24 billion ton-km
level. Roads will continue to carry the bulk of this traffic; however, both
railways and inland waterways will also move increasing volumes of freight.
Passenger traffic is expected to grow even more rapidly, about 75% during the
same period reaching 60 billion passenger-km annually by 1987. The Plan
places emphasis on greater utilization of the existing facilities through
rehabilitation, better operational arrangements, and the strengthening of the
maintenance capabilities of transport agencies. The new projects proposed
under the Plan primarily serve the heavily used corridors such as
Alexandria-Cairo and other routes in the Delta area as well as projects in
upper Egypt and the Sinai.
Transport Constraints
1.08    The main constraint in the sector is the weakness of the various
transport agencies, especially in planning and operational activities. All
transport agencies are confined by restrictive civil service regulations and
suffer from low salary structures and limited career development
opportunities. Several agencies have successfully introduced supplementary
bonus and incentive systems to help them overcome this constraint. In RBA,
these systems appear to work since applications to join RBA are increasing and
more staff is being retained; RBA staff increased 10% during the period
1980-82.
1.09    The choice of transport mode is free in Egypt.  However, the railways
cannot meet all of the traffic demand mainly due to inadequacies of
locomotives, and public sector bus and trucking companies are not competitive
because of the poor quality of their services, which is mainly due to
government controls. As a result, freight is being diverted to private
truckers, and intercity taxi services have been able to cut substantially into
the passenger market at the expense of the public bus service and in some
cases railways even though both bus and railway tariffs are held low.



- 4 -
1.10    Transport accounts for about 30% of domestic petroleum consumption.
In recent years, the Government has raised the domestic price for premium
gasoline, although gradually, and at the current level of EE 0.15 per liter it
now approximates the economic cost (based on February 1983 prices of US$27.5
per barrel for Egyptian crude).  However, the gas oil price at EE 0.03 per
liter is well below its economic cost of about EE 0.18 per liter. The
implicit economic subsidy on gas oil was estimated at about EE 255,000 in
1979.  The Government intends to reduce and eventually stabilize the level of
the implicit economic subsidy to transport users.  But the price distortions
which result from the different subsidies prevailing throughout the economy
make the achievement of this goal a very difficult task.
1.11    The NTS Phase II Report contains several specific recommendations on:
(i) operational improvements in the different transport agencies and
companies, (ii) revisions of the laws and regulations controlling transport,
and (iii) appropriate levels of user charges and tariff structures.
Implementation of these recommendations has started and is being coordinated
with Government's plan for further reforming the public sector transport
agencies and companies.
C. The Transport Modes
(i)    Roads
1.12    The roads subsector is discussed in Chapter II.
(ii)   Railways
1.13    The Egyptian Railways (ER) operates a standard gauge system of 3900
route-km of which 950 km is double track. The only electrified line is a 25
km suburban link between Cairo and its industrial suburb Helwan. The system's
main trunk runs from Alexandria to Cairo and up the Nile to Aswan. In the
Delta, this trunk is fed by an extensive network of main and branch lines that
link it with all important economic centers.
1.14    For many years, due to inadequacies of maintenance facilities,
critical shortages of locomotives and rolling stock have affected all
operations, especially freight traffic which fell to 2 billion ton-km in 1976.
Since then, ER has invested heavily in new equipment and under two Bank
financed projects, initiated measures to improve its maintenance facilities.
A crash program to eliminate the backlog of track renewal requirements of the
network is also underway. As a result, ER has achieved a modest gain in
modernizing its operations and since 1973, passenger traffic has grown at an
average rate of about 3% per annum, but most of this growth occurred on the
Helwan suburban line.
1.15    ER has incurred operating losses during recent years.  In 1980,
legislation was passed to make ER semi-autonomous, so that it could operate
more freely and be independent of civil service regulations and the Government
salary structure.



-5-
(iii) Inland Waterways
1.16    The primary waterway systemn consists of Lake Nasser between the
Sudanese border and the Aswan High Dam; the Nile River between Aswan and
Cairo; and the Beheiri and Nobaria Canals between Cairo and Alexandria; in
all somE 1500 km. In addition, there are about 1850 km of secondary water-
ways in the Nile Delta. Inland waterway services are provided by three public
sector companies, private motorboat operators and traditional sailing boat
operators. Inland water transport is hampered by the aged condition of the
fleet inadequate inner port facilities and by navigation conditions that do
not permit boats to be loaded to their capacity. Total traffic is estimated
at 1.5 billion ton-km for 1979, i.e. about two-thirds of rail freight
movements. Petroleum products for Upper Egypt are the most important
commodity group, followed by minerals and coal.
(iv) Ports
1.17    The Port of Alexandria is by far Egypt's largest port.  The ports at
Suez and Port Said, at either end of the Suez Canal, are much smaller. Other
ports are Safaga, a phosphate port on the Red Sea coast and Mersa Matruh, a
lighterage port serving regional needs of the Western Mediterranean coast.
1.18    In 1976, the Port of Alexandria embarked on a program of rehabili-
tation and expansion to alleviate congestion and meet short-term needs. Cargo
handling and operational equipment was modernized; and accumulated maintenance
dredging undertaken. Construction of new deep water berths is still
underway. Throughput at Alexandria reached 14.7 million tons (excluding
petroleum) in 1980 and over 18 million tons in 1981. With the expected growth
in traffic, these new facilities should be fully utilized as soon as they
become available in 1984. Additional port capacity is therefore urgently
needed, but Alexandria Port, encircled by the city, cannot be further expanded
easily.
1.19    Based on the findings of several country-wide port studies and Phase
II of the NTS, the Government has initiated a port development program. The
first phase of the proposed Dikheila Port for which the Bank made a loan in
1982 (Loan 2183-EGT) is the priority project within this plan. In addition,
the plan provides for construction of a new port at Damietta at the eastern
corner of the Delta. The first phase of Damietta is to proceed in two



- 6 -
stages. The first stage is scheduled for completion in 1986, the
commissioning of the second stage is expected to require an additional two to
three years. When completed, Damietta Phase I will provide a capacity for
about 6 million tons for grain imports, timber and general cargo including
container facilities. There are also plans to allocate some capacity for
container transit traffic.
(v) Pipelines
1.20    The pipeline network of Egypt comprises about 1400 km of pipe carrying
crude oil and petroleum products and about 600 km of pipe carrying natural
gas. These networks carry all the natural gas and about 50% of the crude oil
and petroleum products. The remaining petroleum products are carried by road
and inland water transport.  Six oil refineries at various sites in lower
Egypt were operating in 1980 near capacity, with a throughput of about 13
million tons per annum.  New crude oil and petroleum product pipelines are
planned to meet the expected increases in demand.  For the most part, the
existing natural gas pipelines together with those under construction and
planned, are expected to meet demand through the 1980's.
(vi) Civil Aviation
1.21    Of the six main airports in Egypt, only Cairo is of international
standards. Egyptair is the only authorized carrier for scheduled air services
within Egypt. Tourist traffic which comprises almost all the domestic traffic
is concentrated on the Cairo-Luxor-Aswan-Abu Simbel corridor. Domestic
traffic has been increasing at 17% p.a. since 1972 and reached about 450,000
passenger movements in 1978. Cairo Airport handled 6 million international
passenger movements in 1982, an increase of 13% p.a. since 1976. The volume
of air freight is insignificant.
D. Previous Transport Projects
1.22    The Bank Group has made one IDA credit and five Bank loans to assist
with the rehabilitation of transport facilities in Egypt. Loan 243-EGT of
1959 (for US$56.5 million) repaid in 1974, Loan 1064-EGT of 1974 (for US$50
million) and Loan 1482-EGT of 1977 (for US$100 million) successfully supported
the development of the Suez Canal. The canal is an international transport
facility and, as such, its development and operations are considered
separately from the rest of the Egyptian transport system.
1.23    IDA Credit 284-EGT of 1972 (for US$30 million) and Loan 1098-EGT of
1975 (for US$35 million) provided support for ERs' 1971-1977 rehabilitation
and modernization program.  Credit 284-EGT was closed on June 30, 1980.  The
Second Railway Project which had strong institution building objectives and
financed the NTS suffered a setback when ER's operating and financial
conditions deteriorated. However, with the 1980 reform law, and the
implementation of the recommendation of the NTS, the performance of the
railways is expected to improve.



- 7 -
1.24    Loan 1239-EGT of 1976 (for US$45.0 million) helped to finance the
rehabilitation of Alexandria port. The project included a comprehensive study
of Alexandria Port Authority's management, organization and finances.
Execution of the project has been delayed, partly due to delays in contract
award for civil works in what was the Bank's first involvement in Egypt's port
sector. Project design included in the appraisal has been modified to cater
to increasing container traffic and completion is now scheduled for December
1984.
1.25    Loan 2183-EGT of 1982 (for US$132.0 million) is designed to assist the
Government in the construction of a new port at El Dikheila (10 km. west of
the existing port of Alexandria).  The project includes much needed facilities
for containerized cargo and a jetty for the reinforcing bar mill to be built
at El Dikheila. The project also provides for the continued modernization of
Alexandria Port and its integration with El Dikheila Port and is expected to
be completed by 1986. The new facility will be an important addition to the
country's port capacity and generate substantial benefits in the form of
uninterrupted deliveries, and reduced transport and cargo handling costs. The
project will also enable the Bank to continue its efforts in institution
building and strengthening the transport agencies' planning capabilities.
1.26    Loan 2176-EGT of 1982 (for US$59.0 million), the greater Cairo Urban
Development Project, aims at initiating a new approach to urban transport in
greater Cairo based on low cost traffic engineering and management measures,
at improving the efficiency of the public transport system and at the
strengthening of institutional capabilities for urban planning, management and
service delivery in the greater Cairo area. The loan became effective on
February 16, 1983 and the start of implementation is satisfactory. Already a
substantial portion of detailed designs have been completed, some of the key
advisors have been appointed and procurement of some items has been
initiated. The project is expected for completion in 1987.
1.27    Bank lending in the transport sector and, in particular, Bank
involvement and financing for the NTS, has successfully contributed to the
establishment of Egypt's strategy for transport development for many years to
come.
II. THE ROADS SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01    The overall road density of about 50 km per 100 km2 in both Upper
and Lower Egypt is adequate for the present needs of the country, but the
condition of the road network is poor. Also, with growing population
densities and with per capita income increasing, the demand for more and
improved roads is rising. In the Nile Valley and the Delta the network has
for the most part evolved from the gradual upgrading of roads which were not
originally designed for modern, heavy and high speed motor vehicles, nor for
the mix of this traffic with slow moving local traffic. The need to preserve
agricultural land prevents acquisition of extensive right-of-way for roads and



- 8 -
thus forces traffic to concentrate on the present network. Most of the paved
roads no longer have the bearing capacity to meet present traffic demands, and
all of them have suffered from lack of maintenance. The NTS evaluated that
the condition of 28% of all roads was poor and of 33% fair with the remainder
in good condition. Thus, about 60% of main and secondary roads need
rehabilitation, some need widening as well, and all roads need routine
maintenance. The proposed project will assist with road maintenance over the
main and secondary road network while the Government will continue road
rehabilitation from its own resources.
2.02    Out of a total road network of 28,725 km (Map IBRD 15377R), about 52%
are paved, of which about 18% are classified as main roads (Table 2.1). The
network is divided into the main and secondary roads administered by the Roads
and Bridges Authority (RBA) (about 40% of all the roads - 5100 km of desert
roads and 7900 km of country roads), and the tertiary roads administered by
the Governorates and other agencies. Most of the RBA roads are paved, while
most of the Governorate roads are unpaved. About 80% of all paved roads have
a carriageway of 6m or less.

B. Traffic and Road Transport
2.03     The motor vehicle fleet has grown at an annual average rate of
about 17% from about 226,000 vehicles in 1972 to 932,000 in 1981; 57%
of these are passenger cars and taxis. The development of the fleet
during 1972-81 is shown in table 2.2.

2.04     Overall, there are about 22 motor vehicles (12 passenger cars and
taxis) per 1,000 inhabitants, which is low compared with countries at a
similar stage of development but high when compared to the paved road
network. The motor vehicle fleet increased significantly since 1976 with the
lowest rate for passenger cars (14% p.a.) and the highest for trucks and buses
(25% p.a.). Heavy vehicles (buses and trucks) now constitute about 43% of all
vehicles. Current traffic volumes, coupled with these high growth rates, have
led to congestion on many roads, in particular, near the main cities and in
the Delta. Heavy traffic represents between 30% and 60% of all traffic on the
main roads. The NTS estimates interurban road transport at 27.8 billion
passenger-km and 15.7 billion ton-km for 1979. Passenger transport is
predominantly on buses (45%) and taxis (37%), with private cars accounting for
the remainder (18%).
2.05     Freight transport services are provided by five public sector
trucking companies, private sector trucking cooperatives and independent truck
owner/operators, generally in competition with each other. Road freight
transport is not regulated and, except for normal registration and licensing,
there are no restrictions on entry into the industry, nor on the specification



- 10 -
of vehicles and their operation. However, all heavy vehicles imported in the
country have to be approved by RBA, who controls their compliance with
approved standards to avoid import of vehicles liable to be overloaded. The
public sector companies have been expanding at much lower rates than private
truckers in recent years, though they have increasingly assumed the role of
brokers between public sector consignees and private truckers, thus exerting a
balancing influence on truck rates.
2.06     Intercity bus services are provided by four regional public sector
bus companies. Taxi licences are issued freely and do not contain limitations
as to routes or areas of operation, but bus fares are Government regulated in
order to provide low cost transport for the poor. The fleet growth between
1975 and 1979 was 3% p.a. for public sector bus companies as compared with 8%
p.a. for the taxi fleet, and this indicates the extent to which taxis are
taking up the demand that the public bus companies cannot meet.
2.07     In response to recommendations of the NTS, an axle load survey was
carried out in 1981 to update information of a limited survey conducted in
1978. The survey, done by RBA staff assisted by experts from Cairo
University, concluded that 17% of all axles exceed the legal limit of 10 tons,
causing 80% of all damage to the roads. Consequently, RBA has started spot
checks to control and discourage overloading. The proposed project includes
the purchase of fixed and mobile weighscales to assist RBA in setting-up this
program (para. 3.09). When completed, the results of the program could lead
to revisions of road design standards, vehicle standards, axle load
regulations and enforcement. Assurances were obtained from the Government at
loan negotiations that RBA will start a two-year nationwide axle weighing
program to determine loading trends and control overloading starting July 1,
1984 when new weighscales are expected to be available, (Loan Agreement -
Section 4.03). The findings of the survey would be reviewed with the Bank
during supervision of the project.
2.08     Traffic safety standards are low in Egypt, both with regard to driver
behaviour and the standards of road structures. The high incidence of
accidents and the associated loss of property and life are a cause for growing
concern. Following the completion of the NTS, RBA conducted a study on road
safety which concluded that major deficiencies existed in road and bridges
signalling and marking. RBA produces its own road signs in an outdated almost
entirely manual road sign workshop. It produces only about 50 signs a day
which are of poor quality. Tender documents are under preparation for the
purchase of a new road sign workshop capable of producing at least 150 signs
per day in Arabic and in English. The proposed project includes the financing
of this workshop and additional road marking equipment. Other aspects of road
safety such as driver education, black spot improvements are being considered
by the Government and would be implemented gradually (para. 3.10).
C. Administration
2.09     The administration of the main and secondary road system is the
responsibility of RBA (Chart. Annex I) which is a department of the Ministry
of Transport. Following the recommendations of the NTS, RBA is being
reorganized to emphasize the differentiation between "monitoring and planning"



- 11 -
and "execution" ta:3ks now under single authorities.  The execution department
would, in particular, be responsible for road maintenance and rehabilitation.
This reorganization is already operating de facto since the start of improved
maintenance and the road rehabilitation programs. This set-up is adequate at
present but the consultants, who will review the performance of the
maintenance program (3.04) will also review the organization of RBA and make
recommendations on any further improvements which also may be needed. During
loan negotiations, the proposed terms of reference for the consultants
services were revised accordingly (Annex V). RBA operates through 8 regional
districts comprising 30 subdivisions for road maintenance. These will be
increased to 45 divisions, 20 for desert roads and 25 for Delta and Nile
Valley roads.
2.10     With a total of about 7,200 staff RBA suffers from a shortage of
experienced and competent personnel. There is a small core of competent, well
experienced staff, but the RBA lacks suitable main grade staff in most
disciplines and has to rely on a large number of junior inexperienced
personnel. The main causes of staff shortages are the low Government salaries
and limited career opportunities. The emigration of competent Egyptian
nationals further aggravates the problem. The RBA recognizes this problem and
has established an incentive and compensatory payments plan which is included
in its budget. Incentives consist of housing, transportation and
supplementary payments. Furthermore, RBA is hiring more female staff at the
engineer and assistant engineer level and is preparing revised regulations to
encourage this trend. Because of the large number of junior staff, training
is of the utmost importance for RBA to meet the needs of its substantially
increased programs (para. 2.22).
D. Planning
2.11     With the rapid increase in road transport, road planning has become a
priority. In the past, TPA has carried out this planning for RBA, but with
the increase in the planning load, RBA now carries out detailed road planning
and data collection itself within the framework set by TPA and the
recommendations of the NTS. One of main recommendations relates to the
setting-up of a nationwide program for continuous and periodic traffic
counting. RBA has started periodic countings since 1956 but is now in the
process of setting-up, in cooperation with Cairo University, a program for
continuous traffic counts. Data generated will be stored and used for
planning of maintenance, rehabilitation and new construction programs.  The
proposed project includes the purchase of a computer based data processing
system and traffic counting equipment to assist in this program (para. 3.10).
RBA is preparing the terms of reference for these actions which would be
reviewed with the Bank prior to the procurement of the equipment.
2.12     The NTS proposed a five year plan (1983-87) and a prospective plan
(1988-2000) for road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance amounting to
£E 408.0 million (US$486 million) and £E 1,735.0 million (US$2,065 million),
respectively. Also NTS included recommendations for a series of short term
actions including: (i) the preparation of a road maintenance and
rehabilitation program, which was completed in April 1982; and (ii) the



- 12 -
raising of the routine road maintenance budget in line with equipment
allocations. RBA has generally accepted the recommendations of NTS and the
maintenance study and the Government has already allocated for 1983-87 £E
100.0 million (US$119.0 million) for rehabilitation in line with RBA's target
of rehabilitating 500 km of road sections per year by 1987 (para. 3.07). RBA
selected the projects for the Development Plan, taking into account the
Phase I NTS recommendations to initiate much needed road rehabilitation, thus
reversing their previous trend of building new roads at the expense of
maintaining and rehabilitating the existing network (Table 2.3). The main
components of RBA's Plan are: (1) new construction and paving of about 1000 km
of main highways; (ii) rehabilitation and widening of about 2000 km of main
highways; (iii) construction of 265 km of four-lane highways; and (iv)
construction of bridges across the Nile and other waterways.
E. Financing
2.13     Road maintenance and construction are financed through the general
budget and through the revenues of a special tax on gasoline directly
transferred by the oil company, 70% to the Governorates and 30% to RBA.
Revenues collected from all forms of taxes and duties imposed on road
transport are not earmarked for the road sector but passed on to the general
budget. The annual expenditure on the road sector represents only a fraction
of the revenues collected. Annual expenditures of the RBA are shown in
Table 2.3

2.14     Since 1979, there have been considerable increases in RBA allocations
for road rehabilitation and road and bridge construction. These are now
adequate and in line with RBA's implementation capabilities. Total
maintenance expenditures increased substantially in recent years following

additional equipment purc-ases on the re ommendations of NTS.  The low routine
road maintenance expenditures ItE !ID - $i3i per Km/alnnum.  ela' e to the small
maintenance equipment fleet. These expenditures are expected to rise
substantially in fiscal year 1984 with the supply of equipment provided for
under the project (para. 3.15), and a commitment on the level of funding for
maintenance was obtained from the Government during loan negotiations.
F. Engineering
2.15     RBA is responsible for the technical aspects of road projects.
Feasibility studies are generally done by consultants, while technical
studies, in particular for rehabilitation projects, are prepared by RBA's
design office and by the district offices with the assistance of the
laboratories and Cairo University for pavement design and more complex project
engineering. Loading patterns are taken into account in pavement and overlay
design. The NTS reviewed design standards used by RBA and found those
adequate. The laboratories suffer from a shortage of equipment. The proposed
project, therefore, includes provision to upgrade the equipment of the central
and district laboratories (para. 3.07). Since the central laboratory oversees
the operations of the district laboratories and is located on the same grounds
as the training center, the same consultants who will assist in the review of
the training program (para. 3.06) will also review the needs of the
laboratories.
G. Construction
2.16     Road construction and rehabilitation is mainly executed on the basis
of unit price contracts. The Egyptian road contracting industry consists of
public, private national and foreign firms. RBA has established a list of
registered contractors prequalified according to capacity including 7 public
contractors and about 25 private contractors including about 5 foreign private
firms. About 80% of all road construction and rehabilitation is executed by
the public road construction companies. The road construction industry is
adequate to execute the Government's proposed road rehabilitation program.
2.17     The Construction/Contracting Industry study completed in 1981, in
collaboration between the Ministry of Housing and the Bank identifies a number
of weaknesses in the sector, including the road construction subsector, which
impede growth and limit productivity. The study also includes recommendations
to address these issues and Bank assistance for a proposed project is being
discussed. The main weaknesses of the sector are: (i) excessive Government
dominance which limits self-management and productivity; (ii) deficient
construction resources in terms of manpower, materials, equipment, technology
and finance; (iii) organizational inadequacies and lack of coordination; (iv)
inefficiencies in planning, in particular, at Government level with regard to
evaluation of construction output; and (v) inadequate growth of the
contracting capacity by favoring growth of large public companies. To
overcome these problems the Government should ensure that adequate resources
are earmarked and that improvement measures are well coordinated. The study
has identified an extensive package of policy reforms which are under
consideration by the Government.

H. Maintenance
2.18     All through the 1960's and 1970's little attention was paid to road
maintenance and the building-up of a road maintenance organization.
Reinforced with the NTS recommendations, the Government recognizes the
importance of road maintenance and has been allocating increasing funds for
rehabilitation and maintenance (Table 2.3). In April 1982, RBA, with the
assistance of Development Research and Technological Planning Center, Cairo
University (DRTPC), completed a study on optimum maintenance policies for the
paved road network in the Delta. During the preparation of the study, RBA,
following recommendations of NTS, purchased about 25% of the equipment needs
to improve routine road maintenance, and accordingly the corresponding
expenditures increased from £E 500,000 in 1981/82 to £E 1,500,000 in 1982/83.
On the basis of the report, the conclusions of which were extended to the
entire road network, RBA prepared with the 8 district offices a plan of
maintenance operations and corresponding equipment, materials and staffing
needs distinguishing units by region (desert or Delta and Nile Valley). The
proposed project includes the purchase of the additional maintenance equipment
required to expand the existing fleet and to meet the objectives of the
improved maintenance program (para. 3.03). The NTS makes recommendations on
monitoring and planning of routine maintenance operations, all of which are
being followed by RBA and are acceptable to the Bank.
2.19     Maintenance of RBA equipment is done in 7 district maintenance
centers, each of which is equipped with a mobile workshop, and 2 central
workshops in Cairo, one for vehicles and one for heavy equipment. Major
maintenance of equipment is done in the central workshop which is adequately
staffed and has an extensive and well organized spare parts store. Spare
parts management is being improved through the introduction of a new microfilm
inventory system. The vehicle workshop is less well equipped and vehicles are
mainly maintained at dealer workshops. A program to improve the vehicle
workshop is underway and tools for the workshop are included in the project.
Maintenance arrangements for equipment are satisfactory.
I. Training
2.20     The Training Division of RBA has a large training center with
adequate classrooms and mechanical workshops at Nasr City on the outskirts of
Cairo. Short classroom courses are given there for engineers, surveyors,
mechanics and equipment operators. In addition to its own staff, RBA provides
training to staff from the Governorates and from public and private
contracting firms. RBA also arranges for a few professional staff to take
fellowships abroad. During 1982, the center provided 17 courses for a total
of about 250 personnel.  However, the improved maintenance and rehabilitation
programs require more trained staff and the existing training program and
facilities need to be upgraded. The proposed project provides for technical
assistance (about 50 man-months) to assist RBA in assessing its needs and
define improved programs. The project also provides for improvements to the
workshop, the training aids and the laboratories (para. 3.08). Those
improvements would be defined in agreement with the Bank following the
recommendations made by the consultants provided for under the project.

III. The Project
A. Objectives
3.01     The proposed project would support the Government's efforts to
improve road maintenance and help improve planning, training and traffic
safety and control.
B. Description
3.02     The components of the project are;
(i)  a two-year (1984-85) program to improve routine road maintenance over
the entire road network administered by RBA (13,000 km) including the
purchase of road maintenance equipment and spare parts to complete
and expand, as necessary, the fleet for routine road maintenance in
the eight maintenance districts and the provision of technical
assistance to review and modify the program as necessary;
(ii)  the upgrading of the training capabilities of RBA to meet the
increased needs of the routine road maintenance and rehabilitation
programs including the improvement of existing installations,
workshops, laboratories, training aids and the provision of technical
assistance and fellowships to upgrade the training programs; and
(iii)  an action plan to increase traffic safety and control and RBA's
planning capabilities including the purchase of a new roadsign
workshop, traffic control and counting equipment, the purchase and
installation of mobile and fixed weighscales and a computer based
data processing system.
Routine Road Maintenance
3.03     Following the recommendations of the NTS in March 1981, RBA, with the
assistance of a consulting team from Cairo University (DRTPC), prepared a
study on Optimum Maintenance Policies for the Delta Paved Road Network. The
study, completed in April 1982, dealt with routine maintenance operations and
rehabilitation. On this basis, RBA has prepared a routine road maintenance
action program to be implemented by its eight regional maintenance districts
over the entire network of 13,000 km of paved roads under its responsibility.
Routine maintenance would be carried out by force account by 45 operational
units of the regional maintenance districts. Each operational unit would
cover about 290 km of roads. Indicative programs for 1984/85 and 1985/86 were
discussed at loan negotiations.  The list of equipment (Annex III) to be
supplied for the routine maintenance program was prepared by RBA following
review of the needs of each of the maintenance districts including the desert,
Delta and Nile Valley districts. The list was confirmed at loan negotiations
(Annex III). During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that RBA will carry out the maintenance program in accordance with
annual programs setting forth physical targets, equipment and staffing needs
and funding requirements to be communicated to the Bank for review and comment
prior to April 30 of each year starting in 1984, and that it will ensure the



- 16 -
timely availability of staff and maintenance equipment required for the
carrying out of the program. (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03)
3.04     The major cost components of the 1984/85 and 1985/86 tranches of the
maintenance program are as follows:
ti) Capital Costs
(a)  additional road maintenance equipment and spare parts for
routine road maintenance; and
(b)  workshops, maintenance yards and buildings for regional
maintenance districts.
(ii)  Recurrent Costs
(a)  fuel, oils and lubricants for existing and additional
maintenance equipment;
(b)  materials and supplies;
(c)  full maintenance, depreciation and renewal of all equipment; and
(d)  labor, administration and management.
Minimum budgetary allocations for the two years of the program were agreed
upon during loan negotiations. The project capital costs are listed in Table
3.2 while the budget allocations for the recurrent costs of the routine road
maintenance exclusive of any general overlaying or substantive repairs are
listed in Table 3.1.

3.05     Besides the training (para. 3.06) to be provided to ensure the
successful implementation of the maintenance program, the project would also
provide technical assistance to help evaluate performance at the end of the
first year and prepare an action plan, if necessary, to adjust staffing,
organization, management, equipment and financing of the maintenance program.
Terms of reference for these services were agreed at loan negotiations
(Annex V).
3.06     The maintenance program was prepared on the basis of (i) a
reconnaissance of about 4,400 km of road sections; (ii) an evaluation of
different maintenance strategies; and (iii) an analysis of operations of
maintenance divisions. These studies (available in the project file) showed
that because of inadequate maintenance in previous years, about 60% of the
reference network needed rehabilitation, and on that basis, RBA has initiated
the rehabilitation of roads from its own resources.  Up to May 1983,
rehabilitation of about 1500 km of road sections has been started under the
program and about 1200 km of road sections have been completed.  At loan
negotiations, the Government confirmed that RBA will continue road
rehabilitation in accordance with its current plan with a target of 500 km per
year by fiscal year 1987 and that the related expenditures will be met through
direct budgetary allocations. The program is in line with the recommendations
of the study and within the capabilities of the road construction industry.
Training
3.07     RBA started training of its staff, engineers, assistants, operators,
supervisors, mechanics, etc. in 1956 upon completion of its training center on
the outskirts of Cairo. In 1982, the center, which has about 30 permanent and
part-time instructors provided training for (i) 30 civil engineers, (ii) 20
mechanical engineers, (iii) 94 assistants in various disciplines including
laboratory work, surveying, construction and maintenance of roads and
maintenance of equipment, and (iv) 110 heavy and light equipment operators.
The training courses last from one to four months and are available for RBA,
the Governorates and public and private construction companies. For various
disciplines, the courses include practical training in a production unit
(TPU). Although an adequate number of staff received training in 1982, the
quality of the training was deficient because the training installations,
courses, training aids, programs, workshops, laboratories, etc. are outdated
relative to the needs of RBA's growing construction and maintenance activities,
3.08     To strengthen RBA's capability to administer, control, and manage the
improved road maintenance operations and the expanded road rehabilitation
programs, the project includes the upgrading of existing training capabilities
for staff and workers at all levels. The aim is to improve staff productivity
and operational efficiency. This would be achieved by the provision of:
(i)  technical assistance (about 50 man-months) from qualified consultants
to help identify RBA's and the road construction companies' staff
needs, the corresponding training requirements, the needed
improvement of installations, new programs and training schedules,
and a program for the upgrading of instructors;



- 18 -
(ii) fellowships (about 50 man-months) for instructors and RBA staff to
become familiarized with training efforts elsewhere and to upgrade
knowledge and skills;
(iii) improved installations, workshops, laboratories, training aids,
equipment, etc.
3.09     The upgrading of the training program would be carried out according
to terms of reference agreed during loan negotiations (Annex VI). Assurances
were obtained from the Government that the training program which would result
from the study would be reviewed with the Bank by June 30, 1984 and would be
carried out in accordance with a time schedule satisfactory to the Bank. (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.04)
Traffic Safety and Control
3.10     Following the recommendations of the NTS, RBA in coordination with a
consultant's team from Cairo University has initiated an action plan to
improve traffic safety, to control heavy traffic and to establish a system for
permanent traffic counting. The first steps to be taken are to improve road
and bridge signalling and marking, to establish permanent and mobile
weighstations to control overloading and to improve traffic counting. Seminars
for traffic engineers and assistants are currently conducted at RBA's training
center and would be reviewed under the training program. To assist in the
implementation of the action plan, RBA is negotiating a contract with Cairo
University to help set-up permanent and mobile traffic counters and, in
particular, to establish a traffic data bank to be used for planning
purposes. During loan negotiations assurances were obtained from the
Government that RBA will review the status of the action plan regularly with
the Bank. (Loan Agreement, Section 3.05).
3.11     To support the various actions envisaged for improving traffic safety
and control, the project includes the purchase of (i) a new sign workshop to
replace the existing outdated shop; (ii) fixed and mobile weighbridge stations
and scales; and (iii) a computer based data processing system for traffic
counting. RBA has collected information on black spots in the road network
and has included their improvement in the road rehabilitation program. To
further improve road safety, driver education programs and revisions in driver
and traffic legislation are also under consideration by RBA in association
with Cairo University.
C. Engineering
3.12     RBA with the assistance of DRTPC prepared the "Optimum Maintenance
Policies for the Delta Paved Road Network". This study was completed in April
1982 for roads to be included in the first five years of the program and
appraisal of the road maintenance component of the project is based on this
study. The engineering studies on these roads have been carried out in
accordance with acceptable technical and economic criteria. The technical
criteria take due account of current and foreseeable loading patterns.

D. Cost Estimates
3.13     The total capital cost of the project is estimated at US$26.7 million
equivalent, (net of duties and taxes) with a foreign cost of US$24.0 million
including the front-end fee of 0.25%. The cost of individual project
components is summarized in Table 3.2.
3.14     Estimates for road maintenance equipment are based on bids received
by RBA in mid 1982 for similar equipment financed from the Government's own
resources, appropriately adjusted to January 1983.  Consultants services under
the project total about 80 man-months. The average estimated cost of these
services in January 1983 prices is $11,000 per man-month including travel and
subsistence. These estimates are based on similar services rendered by
foreign consultants.
3.15     Physical contingencies for maintenance equipment are estimated at 5%
while for all other components, a contingency of 10% is taken into account.
E. Financing
3.16     The proposed loan of $24.0 million would finance the foreign exchange
cost of the project including the front-end fee. The Government would finance
the local cost of US$2.7 million equivalent from the budgetary allocations of
RBA and the recurrent costs for routine maintenance and training, all of which
are adequately provided for under the budget. During loan negotiations an
assurance was obtained from the Government that minimum budgetary allocations
of US$5.0 million equivalent in constant 1983 prices will be available for
recurrent expenditures for routine road maintenance in 1984/85 and 1985/86
(para. 3.04).
F. Implementation
3.17     RBA will be responsible for implementing the project.  Project
implementation will be spread over a period of four years with one year for
initiating actions, followed by two-years of operational programs 1984/85 and
1985/86 and one year to complete all disbursements. The Implementation
Schedule (Annex II) was discussed and agreed during negotiations.
G. Reporting
3.18     To enable the Bank to monitor project implementation, RBA will
prepare and send to the Bank the following reports for review and comment:
(a) the annual program for routine maintenance starting in April 1984
including scheduled operations, staffing, equipment and funding requirements;
(b) the performance report of the previous year's routine maintenance program
starting in September 1985 including operations completed as compared to
anticipated, actual staffing, equipment and expenditures; (c) by June 1984,
the report on the proposed upgrading of the training program including

recommendations for equipment, training aids and improvements of workshops and
laboratories; (d) quarterly progress reports within two months of the end of
each quarter. Details of the information to be provided in the annual and
quarterly reports were discussed and agreed with the Government during loan
negotiations.
H. Procurexuent
3.19     The road maintenance equipment would be procured on the basis of ICB
in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Bids would take into account cost,
delivery time, and reliability of dealer services on the basis of a point
system which was discussed with the Bank during loan negotiations and would be
finalized in the tender documents. Domestic preferences in bid evaluation
would be applied in accordance with current Bank policies. Spare parts would
be procured either, for purposes of standardization, directly from the
suppliers or manufacturers of the equipment for which the spare parts are
needed, or when spare parts cannot be grouped into packages estimated each to
cost not less than $50,000 equivalent, on the basis of contracts directly
negotiated or awarded after limited international tendering.
3.20     Workshop and laboratory equipment, training aids, the sign workshop,
the weighbridges and the computer equipment for traffic counting will be
procured on the basis of ICB.
3.21     Consultants services will be provided by qualified and experienced
consultants, in accordance with terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
1. Accounting and Auditing
3.22     In order to ensure the timely and satisfactory accounting of the
resources allocated to the project including counterpart funds, it was agreed
with the Government during loan negotiations that RBA should maintain separate
accounts and lines in the budget for all the transactions related to the
project. The accounts of the Government are audited annually by the Central
Accounting Organization (CAO), which is satisfactory to the Bank. RBA would
maintain separate accounts reflecting all expenditures on account of which
withdrawals are requested from the Loan Account on the basis of Statements of
Expenditures and retain, until one year after the closing date, all records
evidencing such expenditures. RBA's accounts would be audited for each fiscal
year by the Central Accounting Organization and a certified copy of the audit
report would be furnished to the Bank not later than six months after the end
of each fiscal year. This audit report would include a separate opinion in
respect of expenditures and records for which withdrawals from the Loan
Account would have been requested on the basis of Statements of Expenditures.
(Loan Agreement, Section 4.02).
J. Disbursements
3.23     The proceeds of the proposed loan of US$24.0 million will be
disbursed according to the following schedule:

Total Loan              $24,000,000
3.24     Disbursements for spare parts procured locally for purposes of
standardization would be based on Statements of Expenditure, grouping on an
annual basis local spare part purchases in accordance with the procurement
procedures agreed during loan negotiations. Full supporting documentation
would be retained by RBA for inspection by the Bank during project
supervision. Disbursements for imported spare parts, equipment, and
consultant services would be on a fully-documented basis.
3.25     Since there is no experience with prior road projects in Egypt, the
estimated disbursement schedule is based on the anticipated implementation
schedule confirmed with the Government during loan negotiations but takes into
account standard disbursement profiles in Egypt (Table 3.3). Since the main
components of the project consist of implementing normal although increased
operations by RBA, from a technical viewpoint, the project should be completed
by mid 1986. However, a margin of a further year is considered advisable to
take account of possible delays in supply of equipment. The loan closing
date, therefore, is June 30, 1987.                                                           A
K. Environmental Impact
3.26     Improvements to road maintenance, repairs of shoulders and pavements
and new roadsign and markings would have a beneficial effect on the physical
environment and would enhance public safety.

IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Basis of the Proposed Project
4.01.    Road transport is by far the most important mode in Egypt both for
freight and for passenger movements. The role of road transport is of crucial
importance in the Delta where a predominant portion (43%) of the population is
located and where distances are relatively short favoring road travel.
Parallel to the gains made in the economic development of the country during
recent years, road transport activity has experienced a quantum jump. With
further development and diversification of the economy, road transport is
expected to play an increasingly important role.
4.02     The road system has suffered from underinvestment and insufficiency
of funds over a decade. As a result, the road network had deteriorated so
that most pavements do not have the structural strength for the increased
traffic loads that they now carry. In an effort to provide an adequate and
safe road network, in 1982, the Government launched a program based on the
recommendations of the NTS.  The current Five-Year Development Plan
incorporates the road rehabilitation and maintenance program recommended by
the NTS.



- 24 -
4.03     The economic basis of the maintenance program is the protection of
past capital investments in roads by means of marginal annual expenditures.
The optimal level of such expenditures based on the relation between the
marginal costs of increasing the maintenance effort beyond that which would
just prevent the road from complete impassability and the resulting decrease
in Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC), periodic maintenance and reconstruction
costs is achieved in terms of present worth at the (projected) opportunity
cost of capital. RBA's maintenance program has been based on a study on the
Optimum Maintenance Policies for the Delta Paved Road Network. The economic
analysis carried out in this study has been used to determine the level of
annual maintenance expenditures which would lead to the least cost
combination. Achievement of this least cost is the relevant test for the
economic value of the proposed project rather than estimated Economic Return
on the invested capital.  However, the economic evaluation of the project also
includes an estimate of the economic rate of return taking into account only
those benefits which are readily quantifiable.
B. Main Benefits
4.04     Benefits expected from the project will accrue to the whole economy
in terms of substantial reductions in transport costs, avoidance of costly
repair of road network which would be needed in the absence of the maintenance
program, increased safety, and improvements in RBA's road maintenance
capabilities. Specific benefits of the proposed project components are:
(i) the road maintenance component of the project will lead to lower
operating costs, increased productivity in maintenance operations and
the postponement of road rehabilitation works;
(ii) the upgrading of RBA's training facilities will support project
component (i) and will enhance RBA's capability in eliminating the
backlog of road maintenance and rehabilitation needs of the country;
and
(iii) the enhancement of road safety conditions is expected to reduce the
accident rates and increase the reliability of road transport.
C. Economic Evaluation of Project Components
4.05     In the economic evaluation, only the benefits resulting from the
maintenance programs have been quantified.  Benefits to be generated by                 A
investments in training facilities, have not been quantified. However, they
are an integral part of RBA's efforts to increase its capabilities, to
eliminate the vast backlog of road maintenance needs of the country and to
augment its output of routine maintenance to avoid further deterioration of
the road network. The rate of return calculations include the cost of
training facilities which represents about 5% of the total cost of the
maintenance program.

D. The Road Maintenance Program
4.06     The economic evaluation of the road maintenance component of the
project is based on the findings of a detailed study on a reference network of
4,400 km in the Delta. The study arrives at optimal maintenance policies for
each homogeneous group of road links (237) by comparing the costs involved in
increasing che maintenance effort beyond the level which would just prevent
the road from complete impassability and the resulting decrease in vehicle
operating costs, periodic maintenance, and future reconstruction costs.
Existing traffic volumes, estimates of equivalent single axle loads and the
current road surface conditions were derived from surveys and traffic counts
carried out in 1981. Future traffic volumes on each road link were determined
on the basis of the forecasts made by the NTS.
E. Vehicle Operating Costs
4.07     Vehicle operating costs were derived for nine different classes of
vehicles; (i) passenger cars; (ii) intercity taxis; (iii) pick-ups; (iv)
43-seat buses; (v) 53-seat buses; (vi) 8-ton trucks; (vii) 20-ton truck +
trailers; (viii) 30-ton trucks + trailers, and (ix) tractor - semi trailers.
For each type of vehicle operating costs were estimated on the basis of
resources used under conditions with the project and without the project. On
this basis, the savings in vehicle operating costs, on the average, amount to
20% for passenger cars, to 27% for 53-seat buses and 30% for 30-ton trucks.
F. Results of Economic Evaluation
4.08     The results of economic analysis are summarized below.  Details of
the economic evaluation for each road link and for each type of activity, i.e.
are to be found in "Optimum Maintenance Policies for the Delta Paved Road
Network" which is in the project file.
4.09     Economic rates of return obtained for the road links included in the
project range from 40% to 100% with net present values at a 12% discount rate
per km of road of £E 100,000 to about EE 300,000. The first year benefit/cost
ratios range between 50% to about 120%. These very high ratios and NPVs are
not unusual for programs of this kind. They simply indicate the maintenance
program to be initiated under the project is long overdue and much needed. It
must be noted also that these results reflect only that portion of benefits
which are quantified in the analysis.
G. Project Risks
4.10     The urgent need for the project which has been demonstrated by the
high rates of returns indicate that risks of not attaining a satisfactory
return on the project are non existent or minimal at worst. However, there
are two main potential risks in the implementation of the project which, if
occurred, would reduce somewhat the expected returns. The first risk is the
event that all equipment which is required to achieve optimal road maintenance
operations will not be available in a timely manner. As a result, the level
of operations would be reduced and there would be a loss in the efficiency of
the existing equipment. The second risk is associated with the ability of RBA



- 26 -
to carry out the program according to the schedule. These risks are
considered to be small as the Government has amply demonstrated its commitment
to eliminate the backlog of road maintenance needs of the country. Moreover,
even if such occurrences were to come about, they would lead only to delays in
realizing benefits and therefore to minimal decline in the economic rate of
return on the project. For instance, the NPV (at a 12% discount rate) for a
typical road link studied under the program would be reduced by about 20% if a
two-year delay in implementation were to occur. Under such assumptions, the
ER of the program would range from 30% to 90% which are still far above the
acceptable levels.
H. Other Project Components
4.11     No attempt has been made to quantify the benefits expected to accrue
from technical assistance and from measures designed to reduce accident
rates. The technical assistance will lead to better project preparation,
highway development planning and higher efficiency in maintenance operations.
Traffic safety programs will be instrumental in reducing the accident rate
which is currently very high and causing substantial losses in terms of lives
and property.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01     During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
RBA will:
(i) undertake regular axle load surveys over a period of two years
starting from July 1, 1984 (para. 2.07);
(ii)  carry-out the maintenance program in accordance with annual programs
setting forth physical targets, equipment and staffing needs and
required funding and furnish each such program to the Bank for its
review and comments, not later than two months before the beginning
of the year covered by it, and ensure timely availability of staff
and maintenance equipment required for the carrying out such programs
(para. 3.03);
(iii)  prepare by June 30, 1984 with the assistance of consultants, a
program for the upgrading of the training capabilities of RBA
including the budgetary requirements for the carrying out of such
program and after reviewing the proposed program with the Bank carry
it out in accordance with a time schedule satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 3.08); and
(iv)  review regularly with the Bank, the implementation of its action plan
for the improvement of road safety and control and coordinate with
such implementation the procurement of equipment and installation
works provided for in the plan (para. 3.09).

5.02     Agreement having been reached on the issues set forth in this report
the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$24.0 million (including the
financing of $59,850 for capitalization of the front-end fee) to the
Government of the Arab Republic for a 20-year term including a 5-year grace
period.

Roads and Bridges Authority
Terms of Reference for Review of the Maintenance Program
I. Introduction
1.       The Roads and Bridges Authority (RBA) has initiated a program to
improve routine road maintenance of the entire road network under its
supervision. Routine road maintenance is done by force account by 8 district
offices of RBA according to annual programs setting out physical targets and
budgetary allocations.
2.       Substantial increases in routine road maintenance equipment and
budgetary allocations took place in 1983/84. RBA is now proposing to review
performance of the program and make adjustments if necessary.
3.       RBA intends to employ a team of consultants to provide about 30
man/months of services over about 6 months to review the program and make
recommendations to improve its performance.
II. Objectives
4.       The objectives of the review are:
(i) to compare actual and planned budget allocations for previous years
globally and by district;
(ii) to compare actual and planned physical targets including work
programs, staffing, equipment availability and materials globally and
by district;
(iii) to identify a productivity coefficient based on capability and actual
performance;
(iv) to recommend an action plan to improve performance and increase
productivity including actions on finance, equipment and spare parts,
including workshop, management, staffing, organization and work
programs.
(v) to recommend on the organizational set-up of RBA to implement
effectively the maintenance program.
