BURKINA FASO
SECOND BOUGOURIBA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1097-BUR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second
Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project in Burkina Faso, for which Credit
1097-BUR in the amount of US$ 16 million was approved on January 28, 1981.
The Development Credit Agreement became effective on December 4, 1981. The
Credit was closed on March 31, 1989, two-and-one-half years behind schedule.
An outstanding balance of SDR 2,888,339 (US$ 3.8 million) was cancelled as
of November 30, 1989.
The PCR was prepared principally by Mr. Celestin Bado of the Bank's
Resident Mission in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, and by Ms. JoAnne Nickerson
who did research on the project's design and results and prepared the
relevant tables (Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of the PCR was started during the latter half of 1989,
and is based, inter alia on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement,
supervision reports, and correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower.

SECOND BOUGOURIBA AGRICULTURAL DEVELO)MENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1097-BUR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
The Second Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project, which was
identified in 1977 and appraised in February/March 1980, was designed as a
follow-up to the first Bougouriba project.   It was to consolidate the
experiences of the first project, reach a greater number of farmers without
increasing the number of extension agents, and increase agricultural and
livestock production over a period of five years. The project also stressed
the improvement of farming systems under rainfed agriculture and the
distribution of agricultural inputs and credit.  Animal health activities
started under the first project would be followed up, as well as activities
geared toward improving livestock practices in the zone.
The "Training and Visit' extension system was to be introduced with
the help of the project to reorganize the extension agents' work program,
improve their technical competence and effectiveness by providing them with
better extension delivery techniques and technical messages better adapted
to farmers' needs.
The project was also to create a supply and credit service to assure
a regular supply of inputs and equipment for the region's farmers. In order
to maintain its operations without burdening the CRPA financially, the cost
of this service was to be financed through a mark-up on agricultural inputs
and machinery including veterinary products, in an amount sufficient to cover
its total charges.
Implementation Experience
Initially planned to last five years, project implementation took
eight years in the end, which corresponds to the regional average for
agricultural projects.
Several important modifications were made during the life of the
project.   The most important were:  (i) staff changes especially in the
management team of the executing agency, (ii) changes in the structure of the
executing agency, (iii) modifications in the extension system. If certain
changes in the management team and in the extension system did not ad.-ersely
affect the project, the abolition of the ORDs in May 1986 did have a
demobilizing effect on the personnel responsible for project execution
because of the uncertainties brought on their futures.   The CRPAs, which
replaced the ORDs, were not established until 1987.



- iv -
Project execution brought out once again the difficulty of having
several distinct services work together on the same program.   The most
obvious case is the ORD and the Livestock Service which share the same
technical ministry, but nevertheless have great difficulty coordinating
their field operations.
Project Results
The overall economic rate of return has been re-estimated at 18? as
compared  to  23Z at  appraisal.    The  project's  quantitative  objectives
concerning production and the number of farmers reached by extension were not
fully met. This was essentially due to: (i) the droughts in the first and
third years of project implementation; (ii) the poor quality of the region's
initial prcduction statistics which led to the establishment of unrealistic
quantitative objectives; (iii) insufficient consideration and/or poor
knowledge of the project area's sociology on the part of the extension staff;
and (iv) the extension agents' initial inexperience and generally low level
of expertise.
Nevertheless the project fostered the start-up of a dialogue with
Government at the macro-economic level on the abolition of fertilizer
subsidies.  Regarding human resources the project helped put into place a
more experienced extension team, even though some weaknesses remain which
could ultimately be eliminated. It also fostered progress in intensive
production system technologies (animal traction and fertilizer use).
Concerning the conservation of renewable natural resources the project
contributed to the farmers' awareness of the process of desertification, and
launched two modest reforestation (trees and fruit trees) and water
conservation programs which created a demand for such works beyond the CRPA's
capacity to deliver.   As a result,  the private sector embarked on the
dissemination of fruit tree seedlings.
Sustainability
The sustainability of a project, understood in the sense of the
executing  agency's  ability  to ensure,  through  its  own  resources,  the
continuation of activities initiated by the project, was not achieved, but
nor was it a project objective.  The extension activities for farmers in the
project  zone will  continue  to  be  financed  by  state  funds  under  the
Agricultural Support Services Project (Cr. 1979-BUR).
Lessons Learned
One lesson to be learned from the Bougouriba II Project is that a
good understanding of an area's sociology is a prerequisite for designing an
effective extension program and for establishing project objectives.
Another lesson to be learned is that efficient cooperation among
several government services in the field is difficult, even when precise
institutional arrangements have been designed at appraisal, when those
services belong to the same technical ministry, and when they address the
same target groups.

SECOND BOUGOURIBA AGRICUilAJRAL DEVELOPMF.NT PROJECT
(CREDIt. 1097-UV)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.        Project Identity
Name of project:    Second Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project
Credit No.:          1097-BUR
Region:              Africa
Country:             Burkina Faso
Sector:              Agriculture
2.        Background
2.01      Burkina Faso is one of the world's poorest countries.  The country
covers an area of 274,000 km2, lying between the Sahelian region to the north
and the Sudano-Guinean region to the south.  Average precipitation varies
from less than 300 mm in the north to 1,000 - 1,200 mm in the south. Burkina
Faso's economic development is centered on agriculture, which employs 80-90X
of the population and accounted for about 30Z of GDP in 1989 and a high
percentage of export revenues.   The government's agricultural development
strategy has emphasized food security. To this end, the following policies
have been implemented:
Ca) development of rainfed agriculture through the dissemination of
modern farming practices;
(b) integration of cropping and livestock activities;
'c) resettlement of areas in the Volta river valley freed from
riverblindness by people from the overpopulated central plateau;
(d) development of irrigated crops to mitigate the detrimental effects
of climatic fluctuations;
(e)  support   for   the   establishment   of   precooperative   farmer
organizations, the Groupements Villageois.
2.02      Implementation of these various actions was the responsibility of
the Ministry of Rural Development (subsequently split into three autonomous
ministerial departments:    Agriculture  and Livestock,  Water,  and Rural
Cooperative Action). The institutions specifically responsible for field-
level implementation of agricultural development policy are the public
agencies known until 1986 as Regional Development Organizations (ORDs). In
1987 they were abolished and restructured as Regional Centers for Agro-
pastoral Production (CRPA). They cover all parts of the country, except in
the areas newly freed from riverblindness, which are managed by the Volta
Valleys Authority; the latter is also being restructured. Each ORD/CRPA is
responsible, in the area it serves, for:



-    disseminating  new  farming  practices  developed  by  agronomic
research;
-    encouraging the formation of farmer organizations and providing
supervision and training for their members in cooperative
procedures;
-    supplying plowing equipment, vehicles and farm inputs to farmers
for cash purchase or on credit.
-    monitoring the progress of each cropping season and producing
statistics.
2.03      The aim of the Second Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project,
which followed the first project (July 1975 - June 1981), was to enable the
farmers of this high-potential agricultural region to increase their incomes.
It was intended to raise the per capita income range of US$314-871 to
US$513-l,467 by project completion, and bring the inhabitants of this region
up to a level well above the national per capita average (US$180 at the start
of the project).
3.        Project Objectives and Description
3.01      The Second Bougouriba Project included the following elements:
(a)  expansion of the existing Training and Visit (T & V) system to
cover the entire ORD area;
(b)  creation of a service within the ORD responsible for training staff
to meet extension service needs;
(c)  creation of an input supply and credit service responsible for
centralizing and managing equipment and inputs supplies;
(d)  provision of a line of credit for the purchase of equipment and
inputs;
(e)  support  to  the  animal  health  services,  and  initiation  of  a
farmstead  tree  plantation  program  for  fruit  and  firewood
produc ion;
(f)  institutional  support  to  the  ORD  in  the  form  of  technical
assistance and office construction;
(g)  creation of a monitoring and evaluation un3.t.
3.02      The resources made available under the Project were intended to
enable the CRPA, over a five-year period, to consolidate the achievements of
the first project and to increase crop and livestock production. The project
aimed to increase the number of farmers receiving extension services from



13,000 to 22,000 without actually increasing the number of extension agents.
4.        Project Design and Organization
4.01      The second Bougouriba project was based on the same model as that
used for the' agricultural development projects carried out in the areas
served by the Volta Noire and Hauts-Bassins ORDs (now the CRPAs of Mouhoun
and Hauts-Bassins), namely the West Volta Agricultural Development Project
(Credit 706-UV) carried out in the two regions in 1977-83, and th,- two
follow-up projects which were carried out in both CRPAs (Credits 1284 and
1285).  The project was prepared with assistance from consultants (SATEC,
France), but was couipletely redesigned at appraisal because of poor data
quality. A huge quantity of statistics had been collected by the Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit under the first Bougouriba Project, but were neither
pro''ssed nor used for managerial purposes. The main thrust of the project
was  0o:
-    reorganize and strengthen the agricultural extension services to
make them more efficient;
-    suggest priority messages to be disseminated among farmers (crop
farmers and herders);
-    establish a line of credit to allow farmers to purchase needed
equipment and inputs;
-    establish a monitoring unit responsible  for measuring project
impact;
-    carry out an applied research program to test technical innovations
developed by national research before passing them on to farmers.
4.02      This classic design for a rural development project has proved its
worth in the regions bordering on the Black Volta and Hauts Bassins, situated
to the north and north-west of the project area, respectively, and in
ecologically similar or slightly less favorable areas. All these regions are
served by identical institutions both for extension services (CRPA) and
product marketing,  and credit.   Consequently,  given the availability of
natural resources and technologies proven in similar or less favorable
regions, and the experience gained from the first project, one can say, in
retrospect, that: (i) the project design was adequate, (ii) the roles of the
implementing agencies were clearly defined and, since the services expected
from them were exactly in line with their established functions, there should
have been no coordination problems between them.



5.        Project Implementation
5.01      Although originally scheduled to start on June 5, 1981, the project
did not actually begin until six months later on December 4, 1981.  Nine
months elapsed between the signing of the Credit Agreement and project
effectiveness; this correspoads to the average (8.5 months) for agreements
signed in Burkina Faso between 1978 and 1982.
5.02      Overall,  aside  from the various  delays  that occurred  in the
procurement of goods and services (vehicles, consulting services), the
project  activitiec were  carried out  as planned:    establishment  of an
extension system, preparation and implementation of the training program for
extension agents, supply of equipment and inputs for cash or credit.
Extension services
5.03      The type of extension service planned was similar to the Training
and Visit (T & V) syctem, with the following differences:
(a) the extension agent addressed all the farmers, without making any
distinction as to their initial level of production or technical
knowledge;
(b) the concept of contact farmers (paysan-contact) and follow-up
farmers (paysan de suivi) was not systematically applied;
(c) there were no subject matter specialists.
5.04      These changes were made in view of (a) the homogeneity and low
technical   level of farmers in the project area, and (b) the extension
workers' initial inexperience. The new system was introduced gradually, and
by the end of the third year it had become operational throughout the area
served by the CRPA.  This system was adjusted in Year 6 of the project to
serve as a rtest' for efforts to restructure and revitalize extension at the
national level. Thus:
-    the concept of subject matter specialist was introduced to provide
extension workers with continuing training and assistance;
-    contacts were established with the national agricultural research
agency not only to test technologies at the Points d'Appui de
Prevulgarisation et d'Experimentation Multilocales (PAPEMs) but
also with a view to providing specialized training for the subject
matter specialists;
-    extension subsectore were aligned to the region's administrative
subdivisions and transformed into departmental agricultural
services, their number increasing from 20 to 24;



- 5 -
-    livestock experts were added to the extension service staff to
train extension workers and farmers in animal husbandry and health
care.
5.05      The new system was tested during three crop years (from Year 6
through Year 8 of the project).   The results being satisfactory in the
Bougouriba CRPA and other CRPAs, the system was adopted for the nationwide
Agricultural Services Project (Credit 1979-BUR), and was further adjusted as
follows:
(a) the training is carried out not on the farmer's own land but on a
community demonstratior. plot;
(b) the concept of contact farmers or follow-up farmers was
eliminated;
(c) farmers are addressed in groups, either through the village
association when it exists in the village, or if it does not, an
ad hoc group is formed on a voluntary basis.
Input Supply and Credit Services
5.06      The ORD/CRPA office responsible for supplying inputs and farm
equipment was established in 1983, and has been operating on a regular basis
since then.  Accounts for this activity have been kept separate from the
ORD/CRPA accounts and have shown consistently improving positive net results.
5.07      The products supplied include fertilizer, phytosanitary products,
selected seed, veterinary products and supplies for horticultural farmers -
the first two items (fertilizers and pesticides) accounting for more than
502 of sales. In this context, it should be noted that after the ORD/CRPA
were restructured in 1987, they were no longer legally entitled to deal with
input supplies, thus depriving the project executing agency of one of its
income-generating activities.
Livestock Component
5.08      Under the project, a small-scale program was developed to improve
animal husbandry, including genetic improvement. The actions undertaken not
only involved cattle but also small ruminants, swine and poultry. The focus
was on improved livestock feed and animal traction.
5.09      The program animal production improvement got off to a tentative
start, for lack of livestock personnel in the extension service staff until
the sixth year of the project (1986-87 crop year). The project did begin a
few forage crop trials; farmers were encouraged to collect harvest residue
for use in supplementing animal feed and to carry out manure production
tests.



5.10      The project also provided for the vaccination of all cattle over
six months old for three consecutive years, followed by a program to
vaccinate only young calves aged six months to two years against rinderpest
and pleuropneumonia. Vaccination coverage rates were as follows during this
three-year period, compared to the 902 target rate for each of these
diseases:
Year 1        Year 2        Year 3
Rinderpest           63             44            74
Pleuropneumonia      44             44            50
5.11      After a slow start, the livestock unit attempted to catcl up over
the next few years. The annual vaccination rates, which were to have dropped
to 352 for both diseases during the subsequent period, actually increased,
as shown below:
Year 4    Year 5    Year 6        Year 7    Year 8
Rinderpest        42        45         51           43        46
Pleuropneumonia  37         43         39           42        45
5.12      No  improved health measures  were  taken  for  swine.    Poultry
vaccination, one of the project's innovations, actually began in year 1, but
failed to meet the tatget (3,000 units against 7,000) and did not progress
much during the life cif the project.
Feeder Roads
5.13      Although no formal road-building component was included in the
Second Bougouriba Project, a road-building component was successfully carried
out under the first Bougouriba Project, then transferred to the Fourth
Highway Project, which did not become effective immediately, resulting in
improper maintenance of existing roads.   This problem was raised by Bank
missions in 1982, twice in 1985, and in 1986; the lack of good roads created
major marketing difficulties, and therefore discouraged farmers from
increasing production further.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.14      A monitoring and evaluation unit was established under the Project,
but no steps were taken to hire the technical expertise required to help it
develop the data collection and processing methodology.   This proved a
significant handicap for the unit, which could only produce statistics on
crop year performance.   The entire study component, including studies of
farmers' incomes, herd ownership structure and systems, project impact, etc.,



was simply ignored by the Project management. This obviously makes it very
difficult to evaluate the impact of the project; only the additional
agricultural production can be taken into account because there are no data
on the effects of the project on livestock, forestry, farmer income, etc.
6.        Project Results
6.01      The basic project documents (appraisal report and working papers)
show that the targeted increases in production were to result from the
adoption of simple farming practices (seed dressing, high density row
seeding, two weedings and hoeings, moderate use of mineral fertilizer). The
technological changes were purposely kept at a modest level in order to take
account of the very low level of farmer expertise in the region as a whole,
the need for a very gradual approach, and the time needed for the new methods
to produce any demonstration effect.
6.02      Despite the c. .e taken to keep targets low, results were still
disappointing. The following table shows the discrepancies between actual
and estimated figures.  This might mean that the rate of farmer acceptance
of the new methods was still overestimated at the time of project preparation
and appraisal.
Year 1               Year 8
Targeted  Actual  Targeted  Actual Achievement rate
No. of farmers            13,000   13,427       22,000   17,627        80
Cereals production(T)    33,000   28,000        46,500   46,300      lO00
Cotton production(T)        5,000    4,178       9,000    7,500        83
Groundnut prod.(T)          2,900    2,417       6,100    3,402        56
Root Crops production (T) 6,000    2,417         9,500    2,767        29
Fertilizer (T)                700      801       2,000    1,173        59
6.03      The data used at appraisal for setting the target figures were
probably unreliable, with the exception of the number of farmcrs reached by
the first project, the level of cotton production and the volume of
fertilizer used. This resulted in overoptimistic production forecasts.
6.04      In order to evaluate the overall project results, however, it must
first be kept in mind that the project area has a very solid and rigid type
of social organization in which the individual does not have the right to
distinguish himself from the group, which is strictly governed by its own
law. As a result, advice to individual farmers to increase production was
hampered by the group's pressure to maintain homogeneity. Secondly, it must
be remembered that the extension service was not installed until the first
project was under way, and that the extension systems underwent considerable
changes in the course of these two projects, calling for progressive
adaptation on the part of the personnel concerned. Thirdly, the experience



level of the extension agents differed widely. Although most were from the
region, the program was not designed to take into account the region's
sociology; the opposite approach would have possibly resulted in much greater
farmer acceptance of the innovations proposed.   It would have required
identifying decision-making centers, obtaining their confidence, convincing
them of the efficiency of the methods proposed, etc.   These factors help
explain why many of the quantitative targets were not met.
6.05      Economic Rate of Return.  The economic rate of return has been re-
estimated at 182 over twenty years, as compared to 23Z at appraisal. No
separate calculations to re-estimate the ERR of the agriculture and livestock
components were undertaken because of the lack of data on livestock and
forestry. The above-mentioned constraints, the severe droughts in the first
and third years of project implementation and a lesser one in the sixth year,
and the farmers' lower-than-expected rate of adoption of recommended
technologies all explain why the economic rate of return is lower than the
appraisal estimate. Furthermore, there were major cost overruns (more than
20Z) on expenditures for agricultural training and headquarters, and lesser
overruns (less than 2OZ) on the monitoring and evaluation component.   No
further droughts were assumed beyond the project implementation period; the
production was valued at border prices and a shadow rate CFAF 500/manday was
used for incremental labor. Details are given in Part III, Section 6(B).
6.06      The project has had a significant impact in several areas, however.
At the macroeconomic level, the project served as the starting point for a
dialogue with the government on abolition of the fertilizer subsidy. While
the project, as prepared, was not the best instrument for conducting such a
dialogue it nevertheless provided an opportunity for making the government
aware of the dangers inherent Ln uncontrolled expansion of input subsidies.
The process of reducing the subsidy on imported chemical fertilizers was
later implemented within the framework of the Fertilizer Project (Cr 1550
BUR).
6.07      With respect to human resources,  the project was to cover the
training needs of extension agents, farmer representatives, and livestock and
forestry staff, the aim being to integrate livestock and forestry themes into
the workprogram of the extension agents. Experiences and materials were to
be drawn largely from the West Volta Project. The project gave the CRPA an
experienced training team, thanks to the T & V system. Improvements are, of
course, possible and advisable, particularly in terms of an approach that is
sensitive to the local sociological environment 1 and more tailored to the
existing social organization, and the use of R & D and monitoring and
evaluation to orient the development process.
6.08      The  project  also  served  as  a vehicle  for  the  launching  of
nationwide activities, such as (i) the functional literacy program for
farmers; (ii) the Pilot Program for the Strengthening of Extension Services;
and (iii) monitoring of the technical know-how of the farmers through
1 See Aide-memoire, para 5 from the June 1987 mission.



participation in the preparation and execution of a survey.
6.09      With respect to renewab'le natural resource management, the project
started a program to alert farmers to the dangers of desertification. This
action led to the launching, on a small scale, of a progran. to build
water-erosion control structures, and plant trees. The program has been so
successful that this activity is being continued in the northern part of the
project area with very little support from the extension service, the farmers
being trained to build erosion control structures themselves. Furthermore,
the demand for seedlings increased beyond the CRPA's capacity to deliver. As
a result, the private sector became involved in the distribution of fruit
tree seedlings.
7.        Project Sustainability
7.01      The two Bougouriba projects helped to establish the Bougouriba ORD
(which later became the South-West CRPA) and make it operational. Although
the CRPA is an "Etablissement Public a Caractere Industriel et Commercial",
it is obvious that such an institution will never become self-financing
because the services it provides are not sold. It would not be feasible to
ask the direct beneficiaries to pay for the extension services they receive.
Hence the question of the CRPA's profitability should not arise. From this
standpoint, it goes without saying that for as long as extension cervices are
provided free of charge the State will have to continue to finance the
extension structure out of its own budget or with external aid. Attention
should be paid to the efficiency of the system and the appropriateness of its
recommendations  to farmers to overcome problems on their farms.   This
improvement in the farmers' technical level can be measured by how well they
are equipped and by the extension messages they have adopted.
7.02      Examination of the rates of adoption of the innovative methods
suggested by the extension services shows an encouraging trend. Progress is
slow, however, and corrective measures must be taken to ensure that any
extension system that is set up is better able to listen to the farmers,
understand their constraints, and help them find appropriate solutions. To
this end, the following steps need to be taken:
(a) a socioeconomic study should be conducted to identify the various
types of social organizations existing in the project area and
suggest different kinds of approaches tailored to the systems
already in place;
(b) the entire extension system (village-level workers, section chiefs,
subject matter specialists, etc.) should be trained in application
of these approaches.  Unless this social variable is taken into
account, the pace of farming system modernization will continue to
be slow.

8.   Bank Performance
8.01      The  supervision missions  focused mainly  on  the  agricultural
component of the project, an area in which the results were fairly good on
the whole.   The other components,  namely forestry and livestock,  were
somewhat neglected, but their performance indicators were reported. However,
the presence of cattle on most farms in the region made it desirable to place
importance on obtaining better knowledge about the herd and its management
in order to identify possible methods of improvement.
9.        Borrower Performance
9.01      Overall, the government's performance was adequate in meeting its
obligations throughout the life of the project.
(a)  Except for the 1983/84 and 1987/88 cropping seasons, the project
did receive the financial contribution the State was required to
pay the executing agency to enable it to operate normally;
(b)  A sufficient number of government workers was maintained.   It
should be pointed out in this respect that the Bougouriba project
has had some good-caliber staff who have shown imagination and
adaptability (in such areas as launching the literacy program,
adaptation and testing of the new extension system);
(c)  The project enabled the government to start the process of reducing
the subsidy on imported mineral fertilizer.   This process was
continued  within  the  framework  of  the  Fertilizer  Project
(Cr.1550-BUR), until the subsidy was completely phased out.
10.       Conclusion
10.01     In conclusion, the project may be regarded as having successfully
set up an extension system capable of providing effective assistance in
improving livestock and crop production, provided that the social constraints
identified in the region are addressed. The extension system should adapt
to these constraints, otherwise there will be no real communication between
farmers and extension agents, with the former losing interest and the latter
becoming discouraged. The system should work through the village or through
groups to aim at increasing the groups' overall production rather than
improving individual performance.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
- The ORD of Bougouriba presently named CRPA of South-West was the principal
executing agency of the SECOND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT OF BOUGOURIBA
(PDAB).
The PDAB was financed by IDA for SDR 12,450,000 for investments and SDR
1,200,000 from the Burkina government for recurrent costs: Credit Agreement
No. 1097 BUR.
- After study and analysis of the report (Parts I and III) by the
different departments of the project executing agency, we approve the main
ideas of the document.
With respect to the pertinence of the constraints mentioned, the lessons
to be drawn, and the conclusions, we do not have any particular comments.
However, we will make the following observations:
I Constraints linked to the non-achievement of objectives:
1.1. Extension
The number of farmers reached was to have increased from 13,000 to
22,000 in Year 5 with a staff maintained at a 100 extension agents (220
farmer per extension agent)
- During the project execution, there was a gradual reduction of
staff ( 94 staff members in A 8)
- The number of farmers anticipated per staff member, though modest,
did not take into consideration the level of expertise of the region's
farmers.
- The provision of services to farmers' associations ( Cooperative
and literacy training) was not initially envisaged under the project.
1.2. Administrative Delays
Project effectiveness expected in June 1981 (the beginning of the
agricultural season) did not occur until December (end of season) which did
not permit field staff to have logistic means for the implementation of year
1 of the project.
1.3. Crop Marketing problems
Excluding cotton, the other crops encountered marketing difficulties
in the course of the project:
cereals: unremunerative official price not taking into consideration
the production cost.
groundnut: The Price Stabilization Fund requirement for groundnuts
to be shelled by the producers was a handicap to the intensification of this
crop.
1.4. Input prices
The production inputs (fertilisers, pesticides) experienced a price
increase in the course of project execution thereby limiting their use
because of farmers' low monetary income.



- 12 -
1.5. Livestock
Besides animal health, the component for promotion of improved
animal production methods did not benefit from investments: breeding stock
buying credits, feed storage warehouses, creation of a livestock research
center...
1.6. Monitoring and Evaluation
The lack of qualified staff reduced this service to the mere
collection of statistical data on crop production.
The inadequate number of survey staff limited the size of the
samples, thereby reducing the data reliability.
1.7. Human Resources
- The executive personnel did not undergo the training or recycling
courses necessary to optimize their capabilities.
The beneficiaries of the training courses or seminars did not always occupy
the appropriate position.
The social dimension was not always well apprehended.
II - Government performance
- The government, which was supposed to maintain the 650 Km of the
existing feeder roads, to create 650 Km of new feeder roads, and to keep in
good condition the 400 Km of national roads, has only partially satisfied
this condition.
- The national roads have been subject to continuous maintenance,
but the feeder roads have deteriorated due to lack of implementation of the
road program.
- The 650 Km of new roads have not been implemented.
- The financial commitments were always honored late, thus
generating tremendous cash shortages to the ORD.

Note:
/a No actuals are available since the project monitoring unit was unable to
identify the four models upon which the appraisal was based. The project
monitoring unit certainly suffered from many imperfections, but the most
plausible explanation is that the appraisal's "models' had little
empirical basis.
