CEMENT INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
Lsoan and Prolect Summary
Borrower:               India, acting by its President
BenefiLiaries:          Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI); the
Industrial Credit and Invastment Corporation of India
Limited (ICICI) and Office of Development Commissioner
for Cement Industry (DCCI).
Loan Amount:            $300 million equivalent.
Terms:                  The loan would be made at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate and would be repaid over 20 years
including 5 years of grace.
Relending Terms:        The Government of India (GOI) would utilize the
proceeds of the loan as follows:
Part A: GOI would relend $298 million equivalent of
the Bank loan in rupees to IDBI and ICICI in equal
proportions to finance part of the Industry Moderniza-
tion and Restructuring component and the Pilot Bulk
Cement Transport component. The relending rate from
GOI to IDBI and ICICI would be 12 percent p.a. The
on-lending rate to subborrowers from IDBI and ICICI
would be development finance institutions' (DFI) term
lending rate, currently 14 percent p.a. GOI would
bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
?axrt : GOI would provide $1.6 million equivalent of
the Bank loan as budgetary allocations through DCCI to
finance part of the Human Resource Development
component.
Zart C: GOI would provide $400,000 equivalent of the
Bank loan as budgetary allocations to DCCI to finance
part of the Technical Assistance component.
Irotect Description:    The proposed project is designed to support cement
industry restructuring following the complete decon-
trol of pricing and elimination of freight equaliza-
tion for cement, implemented 1:, the Government in
March 1989. The project has the following components-
(a) the Industry Modernization and Restructuring
component, which would finance capacity expansion in
cement-deficit regions and modernization and
restructuring of existing cement companies throughout
India, and assist the industry in adjusting to a

competitive environment; (b) the Pilot Bulk Cement
Transort component, which would help establish and
finance a pilot bulk cement transport system including
loading facilities at participating cement plants,
special bulk cement rail wagons, and unloading and
distribution systems at Kalamboli Railway Terminal
near Bombay; (c) the Human Resource Development
component, which would assist and finance a demand-
driven, in-plant training system at selected regional
training centers (RTC) to be established, at respect-
ive lead plants, for groups of cement plants having
geographic proximity; and (d) the Technical Assistance
component, which would assist DCCI in studying policy
options for the mini-cement sector, coal washery and
use of lignite for the cement industry, environmental
protection and pollution control measures for the
industry, and future bulk cement transport and
applications.
Benefits and Risks:    The project would improve the regional production
structure by adding about 5 million tpy production
capacity in the cement-deficit regions, bring
slgnificant savings in cement transport and reduce the
cost of this vital commodity in some of the poorest
regions of the country. The project would support
modernization and restructuring of existing cement
companies, thereby reducing energy and other produc-
tion costs and improving the economic efficiency of
operations. The project would finance installation of
pollution control equipment, ensure better environ-
mental assessments, and encourage productive use of
slag, a waste product from steel plants which must be
disposed of in an ecologically acceptable ma-ner.
Financing the pilot bulk cement transport component
would pave the way for significant efficiency improve-
ment in the cement distribution system and produc-
tivity increase in the construction industry. The
project would also finance training programs for
operating personnel and environmental professionals in
much-needed skill categories for both new plants and
existing plants under modernization. No unusual risks
have been identified in subprojects in the proposed
pipeline under the Modernization and Restructuring
component. Introducing a bulk cement transport system
requires the development of a new marketing and
distribution systems and involves many players with
substantial investment: it is therefore inherently
risky. Measures designed to minimize risk are the
provision of limited bagging facilities at the
unloading terminal, phased implementation of the
project, and the provision of further technical
assistance for market development of bulk cement. Im-
plementation of the Human Resource Development com-
ponent is likely to be slow due to the innovative
nature of the approach and the necessity of having



- iii -
groups of cement plants joining in a common effort.
Memoranda of Understanding signed between DCCI and
each RTC's lead plant company would provide assuran-
ces: (a) that the lead plants will commit financial
and managerial resources for training and (b) that the
RTCs would offer training services to other plants for
appropriate fees. The Danish International
Development Agency (DANIDA) has agreed to finance
consultants to assist in project implementation for
this component.

CEMENT INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
I.  IN!RODUCTION
1.01        Policy reform in the cement sector in the 1980s comprised phased
decontrol of cement pricing and distribution and relaxation in industrial re-
gulatory controls.   These reforms have resulted in impressive growth and
substantial modernization  of the  industry.    Cement production grew  from
18 million tons in 1980 to about 43 million tons in 1988. Cement supply in
severe shortage only ten years ago, has now caught up with demand and created
a competitive cement market.   India now produces cement at a cost below the
landed import price and has begun to export a limited amount of cement to
neighboring countries. The current per capita consumption of cement ir. India
is about 47 kg, low in comparison with other developing countries of similar
income. There is immense scope for cement consumption growth, as the cement-
consuming sectors (irrigation, power and housing) continue to expand.   The
situation presents an excellent opportunity for the development of a modern and
efficient cement industry in India.
1.02        In its 1989 budget, the Government of India (GOI) announced the com-
plete removal of price and distribution controls for cement. This policy deci-
sion has eliminated all subsidies to cement users in the public sector and all
cross-subsidies relating to freight equalization and differences in levy quotas
among cement manufacturers, and it has provided an environment that is conducive
to rational investment and increased efficiency in cement production and
distribution. The sustainability of liberalization and further improvement of
economic efficiency in this sector will depend on the industry's ability to ad-
just, through industrial restructuring, to the new and more competitive
environment. To support the adjustment process in this recently liberalized
subsector, GOI requested the Bank and the Danish International Development Agency
(DANIDA) to prepare the Cement Industry Restructuring Project.
1.03        The proposed project would finance production capacity expansions
in the cement-deficit regions and modernization and restructuring of the existing
cement companies throughout India.  The project would help to establish and
finance demand-driven, in-plant training programs to support human resource
development compatible with the substantial technological and structural
transformation in the industry. The project would also help develop and finance
a pilot scheme for transporting cement in bulk from a number of plants to
Kalamboli Railway Terminal near Bombay. Successful implementation of this pilot
scheme would introduce bulk movement of cement across the country, and potential
productivity improvement for the construction industry. Finally, the project
would assist DCCI in studying policy options for the mini-cement sector, coai
washeries and use of lignite for the cement industry, environmental protection
and pollution control measures for the industry, and future bulk cement transport
and consumption.   Overall, the proposed project is expected to enhance the
industry's economic efficiency and pave the way for sustained growth to meet
increasing demand in the 1990s.

II. ITDIAN CEMENT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY
A. Present Structure of the Industrv
2.01        Production Structure.    The Indian cement industry has achieved
considerable success in establishing adequate production capacity. As of March
1988, this industry consisted of 94 large and medium-size plants, 5 white cement
plants and 135 mini-cement plants (i.e., clinker capacity less than 200 tpd).
The large and medium-size plants produced 37 million tons of cement in 1987,
95 percent of the total cement production in the country.   The mini-cement
plants, although large in number, produced less than 2 million tons (less than
5 percent of total production) in the same year.  About 25 million tons of
energy-efficient, dry-process production capacity was added during the
unprecedented growth which followed partial decontrol in 1982. As a result,
the share of installed capacity based on the dry process increased from
53 percent in FY83 to 72 percent in FY88. With the expected further expansion
in dry-process capacity and completion of a number of major wet-to-dry conversion
projects in 1989 and 1990, about 80 percent of the country's cement production
capacity will be based on the dry process. By 1988, around 26 percent of the
installed production capacity was in plants of one million ton per year, a scale
that is considered optimal based on today's technology. All new plants will be
of this scale in the coming years.  Conversion of the remaining wet-process
plants to dry process, and expansion and modernization of old plants to reach
optimal economies of scale and production technology will continue as the
industry adjusts to the increasingly competitive market created by decontrol of
cement pricing and distribution.
2.02        Regional Distribution  of Capacity.    India's  installed  cement
production capacity is concentrated in the western and southern regions, where
limestone deposits are abundant and adequate supporting infrastructure (such as
rail and road network) is available. In 1988, about 85 percent of cement was
produced in the states of Madhya Pradesh (26.0 percent), Andhra Pradesh
(13.8 percent), Rajasthan (11.3 percent), Tamil Nadu (9.3 percent), Gujarat
(8.7 percent), Karnataka (8.9 percent) and Maharashtra (7.2 percent). Between
1982 and 1988, the share of cement production in the western and southern regions
increased from 68.8 percent to 74.8 percent.   Conversely, not only did the
production share of eastern states decrease from 13.6 percent to 6.9 percent,
but also their production in absolute terms also decreased from 3.1 million tons
per year to 2.8 million tons, due to suspension of production of two plants in
Bihar. The regional cement production-consumption pattern for 1988 is presented
in Table 2.1.   The regi-nal imbalance of production capacity and demand
contribute to high transpurt costs for the distribution of cement, which amount
to an estimate of Rs. 8 billion per year.
2.03        Ownership Structure.  The industry has been developed primarily by
the private sector. Private firms accounted for 84 percent of installed capacity
and 87 percent of total cement production at tL. end of FY88.   The public
sector's entry into the cement industry goes back several decades (the first such
plant was built in 1938), but significant capacity was not added until the late
1960s and 1970s.  At present, the public sector produces about 13 percent of



India's cement output (down from 14 percent in FY85), the Cement Corporation of
India (CCI) accounts for 5.7 percent, and 7 state government-owned companies
produce the remaining 7.3 percent.   Moreover, GOI has moved away from its
previous policy of supporting large capacity expansions in the public sector;
i.e., the Government has abandoned its previous objective of reaching 25 percent
public ownership of total installed capacity by the end of Seventh Plan. The
distribution of capacity and production of cement by type of ownership during
FY88 are summarized in Table 2.2.

B. Past Policy Environment and Its Impact
2.04        The industry grew ralatively slowly during most of the 1970s.
Between FY70 and FY74 (the Fourth Plan), annual growth rates of capacity and
production were 5.7 percent, and 3.7 percent, respectively. During the Fifth
Plan, capacity growth fell to 2.6 percent p.a. As a result, between 1978 and
1983 the country experienced considerable shortage of cement (10-25 percent of
annual consumption) and had to import 1-3 million tons of cement per year. The
slow expansion of capacity and associated chronic shortages of cement experienced
during the 1970s were caused by restrictive sectoral policies including
controlled prices, rigid capacity licensing and freight equalization for
distribution.
2.05        Price Control and Canacitv Licensing.    For 40 years (1942-82),
Indian cement prices had been were controlled by the Government, except for 1966
and 1967. The pricing policy over this period fixed the retention price (the
ex-factory price of bulk cement) and the free on rail (FOR) destination price
of bagged cement. Freight cost, packaging and incidental charges, and excise
duties and sales taxes were then added to arrive at the retail price to the
consumer. These pricing policies had a serious adverse impact on the profitabi-
lity of investment in the cement industry. The decline in the expansion of
cement production capacity during the Fourth and Fifth Plan periods was caused
by the low return on investments because of controlled prices and to some extent
the restrictive capacity licensing policies toward large industrial houses (MRTP
companies). In the 1970s, particularly during 1970-77, retention prices failed
to provide an adequate return on investment in the sector, which resulted in
considerable slowing of expansion capacity during the Fifth Plan p.riod. The
combined impact of all these, together with low capacity utilization attributed
to power and coal shortages, resulted in chronic shortages of cement throughout
the 1970s.
2.06        Freight Egualization and Remional Distribution of Capacities.  The
freight equalization scheme was introduced in 1956 to ensure uniform cement
prices throughout the country. A pooled average freight charge was built into
the free-on-rail (FOR) destination price of cement. Actual freight charges
incurred were notional in that they only helped to define the average freight
charge from all production locations. Under this system, cement transport from
a given plant to the market was subsidized (or taxed) to the extent that actual
freight charges exceeded (or fell short of) the notional average freight charges
per ton of cement transported from all plants. Because of this policy, planning
of cement production capacities gave little importance to location of markets.
The cost of moving large volumes of cement to the eastern and northeastern states
(cement-deficit regions) and coal in the opposite direction were not adequately
taken into account when plant location decisions were made. This situation led
to unwarranted concentration of production of capacities in the western and
southern regions where limestone deposits are abundant and better basic
infrastructure is more readily available (para. 2.02). The consequences of this
regional production pattern are painfully evident today following the decontrol
of cement prices and the elimination of the freight equalization scheme. As



would be expected, cement prices in the deficit regions have risen sharply. On
the other hand, given the sizable excess capacity, cement prices in the surplus
regions are very depressed. This situation constrains the financial performance
of many cement producers in the surplus regions and cement users in the deficit
regions.
C. Policv Reforms a#d ndustry Res2onses
2.07        Recent Reforms. Efforts to reform restrictive cement sector policies
commenced in 1976.  Measures adopted in 1977 attempted to improve return on
investment and stimulate creation of production capacities to meet growing
demand. Towards this objective, a decision was made to change the basis for
fixing cement prices from the 14 percent pre-tax return on total capital employed
to a 12 percent post-tax return on net worth. The higher expected return on
investments associated with this new pricing principle was sufficient to
stimulate investments in the cement secror in the late 1970s. In the meantime,
the Government imported cement to cover the shortage and to keep competition and
price of cement in check. Subsequently, GOI took an important step to open the
sector by allowing new entry and expansion of existing capacities by MRTP
companies in the cement industry.  As a result, by the end of 1981 about
12 million tons of capacity expansion was under implementation for commissioning
during the early and mid-1980s. This major expansion, and the resulting easing
of supply constraints, encouraged the Government to continue to liberalize its
cement pricing and distribution policies leading to complete decontrol in March
1989.
2.08        The timing of these policy reforms for the cement sector coincided
with, and formed an integral part of, the general industrial policy liberaliza-
tion in the country. Of all the measures taken, the most important for the
cement industry were relaxation of investment licensing, permission for entry
of MRTP companies, the gradual reduction and elimination ef the requirements of
levy cement, and elimination of the freight equalization scheme. These reforms
allowed the industry to modernize and expand more easily in response to changing
market conditions. Another important area of policy reform was the relaxation
of foreign technology transfer and collaboration, which helped enhance the
competitiveness of the domestic cement machinery manufacturing industry.
2.09        Industry Response.  The cement industry responded well to these
policy reforms (Table 2.3). Installed capacity and production of cement have
expanded by about 11 percent p.a. since 1982; the share of the energy-efficient,
dry-process units increased from 53 percent to 72 percent, due to both
conversions from wet to dry process and installation of new capacities; a
competitive cement market has emerged, as seen in Table 2.3: the free market
(non-levy) cement price remained practically constant below Rs. 70 per bag during
the last 6 years. The intensity of market competition was reflected in the
declining market share of pozzolana portland cement (PPC) from 57 percent in FY83
to about 25 percent in FY88, as the consumers began to take advantage of the
buyer's market situation to demand higher-quality ordinary portland cement (OPC)
at a price very close to that of PPC.

2.10        The industry fared less well in capacity utilization, partly because
of power shortages caused by drought in 1985-87, initial technical difficulties
with some of the new plants, and market constraints for plants in surplus
regions. An analysis of ICICI-assisted cement companies shows that the combined
impact of low capacity utilization, competitive pressure and the significant
increases in the cost of inputs (Annex 1) have reduced the profitability of the
cement industry.   Many cement producers are experiencing serious financial
distress, and there have been only a few capacity expansion projects since 1986.
Unless investments are undertaken now for commissioning between 1992 and 1995,
India may experience cement shortage as demand expands and exceeds supply
capabilities (para. 2.21).



D. Economic Considerations
2.11        Although cement manufacturing is both capital- and energy-intensive
and India is a net importer of both, it is economic and efficient by interna-
tional standardF    India's comparative advantage  is attributable  to its
relatively abundant limestone and coal resources, established labor force with
technical and managerial experience, and a well-established and competent cement
machinery manufacturing industry with long-standing foreign technology
collaboration.
2.12        Production Cost. A sample financial and economic production cost
structure of both wet-process and dry-process plants is shown in Table 2.4. The
financial costs are estimated on the basis of the average of the FY88 production
costs of six cement plants (three dry and three wet plants). The economic cost
is derived from financial cost data using conversion factors estimated by the
appraisal staff (Annex 2). In economic terms, the average production cost of
the wet-process plants (excluding capital charges) is Rs. 567 per ton of cement
compared to Rs. 427 per ton for new, dry-process units. The full production cost
of new dry-process plants (including provisions for capital charges) is about
Rs. 580 per ton. These cost parameters are below the CIF value of imported
cement estimated to be about Rs. 730 per ton ($50 at exchange rate of in FY88).
This is a broad indication that domestic production of cement is economically
efficient for meeting domestic demand.

2.13        Imoorted Cement.  Cement is imported only by government agencies
(canalized). During the years of 1978-1984, when the cement shortage was most
acute, 001 allowed Imported cement at a low (15 percent) tariff rate to cover
'he expected shortage and stabilize cement prices. Since 1985, the Government
nas not imported cement (except special oil-well cement). Domestic production
is meeting demand, and domestic competition has kept the domestic price below
the landed cost of imports, even in coastal cities like Bombay and Calcutta.
The recent manufacturer's realizations (ex-factory price plus transport excluding
excise tax, sales tax and dealers margin) at Bombay and Calcutta were Rs. 750
and Rs. 900 per ton, respectively.   These prices ar. competitive with the
probable price of imported cement at port of Rs. 900/ton at today's exchange rate
($50 CIF plus at least Rs. 50/ton port handling and distribution). Moreover,
the Indian ports now are congested and lack bulk handling facilities. Therefore,
expansion of domestic cement production capacity is the lowest-cost option for
meeting domestic demand.
2.14        Capital Cost.  Production of cement is an energy- and capital-
intensive proce3s. As shown in Table 2.4, capital charges are the second largest
cost item in the production cost of cement. India has acquired a comparative
advantage in the manufacture of modern cement machinery and therefore has an
advantage in the construction of cement plants at international standards. The
average investment cost per annual ton of cement capacity installed in India is
estimated to be within the range of $100-130, compared to $150-200 in developed
countries.    This  cost  advantage  is attributed  to  the  existence  of  an
internationally competitive cement machinery manufacturing industry with reputed
foreign technology collaborators. Competition among these manufacturers is so
strong that their foreign collaborators continue to transfer their latest
technology to maintain and improve the market position of their local partners.
Due to the combined effects of domestic competition and strong support from
foreign technology collaborators, the Indian cement machinery industry has ample
capability to supply turnkey cement plants with critical equipment imported from
their collaborators.
2.15        Raw Material.   Limestone is the principal raw material in the
manufacture of cement. The relative abundance of cement-grade limestone deposits
in different parts of the country permitted development and rapid expansion of
the Indian cement industry. At present, India's limestone reserves are estimated
at about 60 billion tons, of which 13 billion are proven, 4 billion are indicated
ana 43.2 billion are inferred. India's limestone deposits are, however, highly
concentrated within the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya
Pradesh, which together account for over 80 percent of known reserves. This
concentration of deposits was originally responsible for the concentration of
cement production capacities in the western and southern regions of the country.
But the freight equalization system intensified the regional supply-demand
imbalance to an unwarranted degree (paras. 2.02 and 2.06).
2.16        EnergI Inputs. Energy is the most important input in the manufacture
of cement in India. Although India is a net energy-importing country, it has
ample coal reserves to meet the requirements of the cement industry for the
foreseeable future. Indian coal is, however, low quality and must be transported
long distances to cement plants in the western and southern states. The ash
content of Indian coal is high and is expected to increase in view of the
declining quality of known coal deposits and production methods being used.



- 9 -
Even though the cost of domestic coal per unit of energy contained is close to
that of imported coal, it has a negative impact on the quality of cement produced
and the productivity of the cement industry. To overcome this problem, the
industry and GOI are exploring options to reduce the ash content of coal for the
cement industry (para. 3.15). Power has been a major constraint on the cement
industry for years. However, the magnitude of the problem has been gradually
reduced over the last few years by the installation of captive power plants which
now supply about 15 percent of the industry's total power requirement. While
supply of power still remains a binding constraint for sustained capacity
utilization of many cement plants, it is not expected to be as critical as in
the past.
2.17        Transport Cost.  Given the imbalance in the location of limestone
reserves, coal mines and major cement markets and past sectoral policies,
development of the cement industry has been plagued by high transport cost
(paras. 2.02, 2.06 and 2.15). Cement produced in India has to travel an average
of 650 km to the final user, at an average freight cost of more than Rs. 250/ton.
For the northeastern states, cement has to be transported around 1,000 km from
Madhya Pradesh at an estimated cost of Rs. 400/ton.   Transport cost adds
significantly to the total delivered cost of cement. In fact, freight cost, and
excise and sales taxes make the delivered cost of cement twice the ex-factory
price.   Transport cost is largely responsible for the price differentials
observed in different parts of the country.   In the present free-market
environrment, individual plant viability will largely depend on the distance
between the plant's location and the market it serves.
E. Demand and SUDD1 Proiections
2.18       'Consumtion. Apparent annual cement consumption in India increased
from 14.5 million tons in FY75 to about 42 million tons in FY89, corresponding
to a compound annual growth rate of 7.3 percent. The current 47 kg per capita
annual consumption of cement in India is still low compared to other countries,
as shown in Table 2.5. The long-standing price and distribution controls, the
lack of incentive to market cement in rural areas, the failure to promote
potential markets in areas such as concrete roads, and the lack of financing for
housing development have all contributed to India's low per capita consumption
of cement. As these constraints ease and the GNP grows, there is immense scope
for cement consumption growth.

2.20        To relate historical cement consumption with general economic
variables, the Mangesh study chose GNP and the effect of the Green Revolution
(between FY76 to FY86) and the price index, which might have had an impact on
private consumption of cement. The Tata study chose gross domestic fixed capital
formation, which correlated most closely with the cement consumption. The Tata
study also tried to project the cement demand in major end-user sectors. In both



- 11 -
analyses, the historical elasticity of cement consumption to GNP was estimated
at about 1.5. The difference in the projected demand scenarios is primarily due
to assumptions about the future GNP growth rate. As indicated by the Tata Study,
the major end-users of cement in India are private housing (45 percent),
irrigation and power (19 percent), public works including roads (6 percent) and
public housing (5 percent). These sectors are expected to grow rapidly. The
ICICI and IDBI studies have analyzed cement demand by regions and projected that
cement growth would be faster in the northern and eastern regions. These studies
also analyzed interregional movement of cement and identified the regional
demand/supply pattern.  Both ICICI and IDBI studies have indicated that the
growth of cement in the next five years is likely to remain high, as in the past
six years after partial decontrol, for a number of reasons: (a) with the setting
up of the National Housing Bank and the emphasis on housing by GOI, the housing
sector is expected to grow at a higher rate. The entry of some commercial banks
into housing finance is also expected to give an additional resource for housing
sector growth; (b) concrete roads are now being built for the first time in
India. Such new applications of cement, even on a small scale, would have a
significant impact on growth in cement demand; and (c) the anticipated devolution
of financial power to local governments would spur development activities in the
rural areas. This would likely increase conatruction and cause an increase in
cement demand in rural areas. To indicate a likely range of future demand, the
appraisal staff made its estimates in Table 2.6 based on the following
assumptions:
(a)  GNP growth rate of 5.4 percent for the next 5 years.  This growth
rate is below the official GOI projection six percent and reflects
the Bank assessment in the most recent Country Economic Memorandum;
and
(b) elasticity of cement consumption vs GNP:
Case I: 1.5 representing historical statistics in India;
Case I1: 1.2 representing an average of countries at similar
development stage.
2.21        Projected and Demand/Supply Balance.  First, cement production from
existing capacity and capacity expansions already under implementation is
projected as a baseline case and compared with estimated demand (Table 2.7).
The domestic cement market is likely to be in modest surplus in the next two or
three years because of the enormous capacity commissioned during the last three
years. Investors anticipated this surplus, and investment in this sector has
decreased significantly since 1986, resulting in a small number of expansion
projects which would add less than seven million tons of capacity up to 1992.
Production from existing capacity and capacity presently under construction will
be limited to about 56 million tons, even as the average capacity utilization
rate approaches a somewhat optimistic 84 percent (Annex 3) by 1992/93. Since
construction of a cement plant takes about three years from the time its
financing plan is finalized, and it is also common to take an additional two
years to achieve an acceptable utilization rate, a potential cement deficit of
6.9 - 12.8 million tons is likely by 1994/95.   The detailed assumptions for



- 12 -
projecting cement production are presented in Annex 3. It is also important to
note that the production projection used has not taken into account any possible
closures.   In fact, the competitive market in surplus regions may force a
significant amount of inefficient capacity to suspend production or close.
Implementation of the modernization and expansion projects currently being
prepared is needed to meet the growing demand in the 1990s.

2.22        The investors have anticipated the projected shortage of cement, and
the financial institutions have received project proposals and loan applications
for modernization, expansion and greenfield cement projects.   The list of
proposed projects and assumptions for projecting production from them are also
presented in Annex 3.  These proposed projects, if materialized, would add
approximately 10 million tpy production capacity by FY95.   This capacity
installation, plus the 7 million tpy already under implementation, could increase
total production capacity to about 74 million tpy by FY95, producing about 62
million tons of cement at an estimated average utilization rate of 83 percent.
Total production including new projects is projected and compared with estimated
demand in Table 2.8.
2.23        Most of the proposed capacity expansion would be in or close to
cement-deficit regions, in response to the price differentials already developed
after elimination of freight equalization. If all investments materialize, the
regional demand/supply situation would improve as estimated by the appraisal

III. RESTRUCTURING OF THE CEMENT INDUSTRY AND ROLE OF THE BANR
A. CEMENT INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING STRATEGY
Actions Already Under Implementation
3.01        The competitive domestic cement market created by the decontrol of
cement pricing and the elimination of the freight equalization scheme, and the
current excess capacity and regional demand-supply imbalances, are forcing the
industry to rationalize and balance its operations, reduce waste and allocate
resources more efficiently.   To improve their long-term market position and
ensure financial viability, many companies are considering or have already
implemented measures to modernize and expand their productions facilities, to
introduce product differential and quality, and to explore new markets and
marketing techniques.
3.02        The important changes already under way include (a) Expansion and
Modernization, i.e., conversion of existing wet-process cement production units
to the more efficient dry process, accompanied by significant capacity expansion
and energy and other operating cost savings; (b) Corporate Restructuring and
Plant Closure. A number of companies have consolidated operations by selling
plants, to reduce cash losses and refocus resources on more profitable parts of
the operations, closing financially troubled and uneconomic units with labor
settlements approved by the state governments, the courts and/or the Board of
Industrial and Financial Restructuring (BIFR), or suspending production pending
legal approval; (c) Improvement in Labor Productivity by providing early
retirement and voluntary separation packages; and (d) Aggressive Marketing given
the competitive market pressure and current regional demand-supply imbalances,
Indian cement producers are resorting to increased advertising, quality and brand
differentiation, and improvement of distribution networks.
Planned Restructuring Measures
3.03        The policy environment is conducive for operational and corporate
restructuring, and firms are now more willing to take steps to improve their
long-term position than before decontrol. Moreover, to encourage domestic cement
producers to undertake additional steps to adjust to the competitive environ-
ment, DCCI is developing a modernization and restructuring strategy for the
industry. Implementation of this strategy would provide a mix of incentives and
penalties to induce companies to ensure their financial viability and supply the
Indian cement market more economically. The major elements of this strategy are
discussed below.
3.04        Nodernization Scheme for Wet-Process Plants.  A working group was
established by the Ministry of Industry under the chairmanship of DCCI to develop
a modernization plan for wet-process cement plants. The working group completed
its final report in December 1989 with the following major findings and
recommendations:   (a) as of January 1988, there were 33 wet-process cement
plants.   Seven are already implementing vet-to-dry conversion schemes with
assistance  from  the first World Bank  loan.    Seven cannot be converted
economically because of limitations in technology and limestone reserves. The



- 15 -
remaining plants can be converted to modern dry-process plants; (b) to encourage
modernization of these plants, incentives were recommended for substantial moder-
nization projects at the same level as for greenfield plants (including sales
tax holidays and power supply priority). Consultation and coordination with
state governments would be needed in this regard; (c) to complement positive
incentives, penalties were also recommended. One such proposal was to provide
allocated coal to cement plants according to energy efficiency norms (specific
amount of coal per ton of cement produced). Inefficient plants would have to
purchase their additional coal requirements on the retail market, presumably at
higher prices; (d) to ensure production costs of the modernized plants are com-
petitive with the new plants, labor restructuring with fair compensation, such
as early retirement and/or separation packages, would have to be implemented;
and (e) it was recommended that plants identified with inherent limitations
should be allowed to close.  These measures, if implemented, would form the
basic framework for further modernization of this segment of the industry.
However, most wet-process plants are operating unprofitably, and their financial
position is weak. Modernization of these plants would usually require corporate
restructuring and prudent case-by-case appraisal.
3.05        Regional Production Camacitv.  To minimize the average transport
cost of cement, the industry will need to rationalize the distribution of pro-
duction capacities and their utilization in response to the actual market
demands.   Elimination of the freight-equalization scheme, and the resulting
regional cement price differential, is already inducing the industry to consider
investments to establish new production facilities in the projected deficit
areas.   Capacity expansions currently under consideration in Assam, Bihar,
Himachal Pradesh and northern Madhya Pradesh are consistent with this trend.
To encourage investments to the backward northeastern states, the Government of
India, through the Northeast Development Council (NDC) and the state governments
is planning to provide basic infrastructure (power, rail connections and roads)
and training.
3.06        Human Resource Development.  With the rapid growth of the cement
industry over the last decade, the demand for trained personnel has increased
considerably, and shortages of skilled operators and middle-level technicians
are increasing. Many cement producers are experiencing high turnover at the
operational and technical level due to strong competition among companies for
skilled personnel. Unless steps are taken now to develop a large pool of skilled
operators and managerial cadres capable of handling the growing demand of energy
conservation, pollution control, development of new products and marketing tech-
niques, the growth and efficiency improvement of the industry might fall short
of expectations.
3.07        The cement industry is now revising its human resource development
approach to put more emphasis on sector-specific and plant operational training
while relying on established institutions for training of a more general nature.
The strategy to develop trained manpower for the sector rapidly and efficiently
requires a flexible, demand-driven training system such as the system proposed
by a consultant studyl} financed by the First Cement Project (Ln. 2660-IN). The
study proposed that RTCs be established around modern cement plants to provide
demand-driven, in-plant training for 'clusters" or groups of plants with geogra-
I/ Manpower Development Study by Holdenbank Consultant.



- 16 -
phic proximity and common languages. The proposal has won wide support from
cement manufacturers and its implementation has been made part of this project
(para. 4.12). The proposed sector-specific training would complement and build
on the general technical training provided by the advanced training institutes
(ATI). These institutes are also being supported under the Bank-financed Voca-
tional Training Project (Cr. 2008/Ln. 3045-IN), with a particular focus on
improving linkages with industry.
3.08        DevelopMent of Bulk Cement Transport.  Considering the divergence
between the location of limestone reserves, coal mines and the major cement
markets (paras. 2.14 and 2.17), the Indian cement industry is today charac-
terized by high transport cost and will probably remain so. A study by Rail
India Techno-Economic Service (RITES) concluded that transport of cement over
distances above 220 km is cheapest by rail. Due to lack of rolling stock and
limitations of track capacity, the railways cannot meet the demand for wagons
from the cement industry. During the 1980s, 4)-50 percent of cement was moved
by trucks. Truck transport is high cost, wastes scarce energy resources and
overloads India's road system. Nonavailability of railway wagons has at times
forced cement manufacturers to curtail production. In view of the anticipated
increase in cement consumption in the 1990s, if 70 percent of cement were to be
moved by rail, the railways would need to increase the availability of wagons
dedicated to cement by almost 200 percent.
3.09        With a view to achieving economies of scale during the 1980s, the
Indian cement industry preferred to build large plants with capacities at a
single location of 1-2 million tons per year, an output of 3,000-6,000 tons per
day. Most cement in India is distributed in 50-kg bags, and the output of a
single location can require semi-manual loading and unloading of 60,000 to
120,000 bags per day. The operation is time consuming, ties up scarce railway
rolling stock, and results in seepage and environmental pollution. Rail movement
of bulk cement through the introduction of high-capacity, dedicated, specially
designed wagons will be essential in order to achieve economy in the transport
of cement and to avoid serious bottlenecks.
3.10     Achieving economies in transport costs is not the only driving factor
for introduction of bulk cement in India. Delivery of cement in bulk form is
a prerequisite for improving the productivity of the construction industry. With
the exception of a few very large projects, the Indian construction industry
continues to use manual methods of mixing cement, sand and aggregates at the
project site. The quality of the concrete therefore varies with the skill and
integrity of the workers. This method of construction also has a significant
impact on the time required for completion of the civil works and, consequently,
has a major impact on overall project completion schedules and costs. It is
therefore imperative for the country to adopt modern methods of construction
including rapid delivery of ready-mixed concrete.  The ready-mixed concrete
industry depends on the availability of bulk cement. Experience from indus-
trialized countries shows that 35-90 percent of cement produced is shipped in
bulk, and 60 percent of bulk cement is sold to the ready-mixed concrete industry,
and th'.e balance to buildi-.g product manufacturers and large job-site projects.
The marketing of bulk cement in India would be likely to follow a similar
pattern.  A broad compariscn of cement movement in bulk and bagged form in
selected countries is given in Table 3.1.

Staff estimate.
3.11        Bulk movement of cement in India is economically desirable.  It is
recognized that the present system of movrement of cement in bags would create
severe system constraints and strain both rail and road transport in light of
the anticipated increase in cement production from 42 million tons to about 80
million tons by 2000. A pilot scheme to develop bulk cement transport has been
prepared by GOI with DANIDA assistance and is included in the proposed project
(para. 4.09).
3.12        Pollution Contr,ol. With the tightening of environmental standards
and enforcement by GOI since the early 1980s and the substantial modernization
of the industry during this period, most cement plants have installed environ-
mental protection equipment and have therefore greatly improved their prospects
for meeting Indian environmental standards. According to a task force appointed
by the Central Pollution Control Board in 1988, out of 94 cement plants, 58 had
adequate pollution control equipment for their kilns and were maintaining the
exhaust dust content within the Indian emission standards. A further 25 units
have already submitted time-bound programs to meet pollution control standards.
Of the remaining 11 plants, 5 have already been closed due to uneconomic opera-
tion, and 2 have been closed through legal actions based on environmental viola-
tions. For the remaining four plants that had not submitted time-bound programs
for pollution control, efforts were being made by the respective state pollution
control boards under the direction of the Central Pollution Control Board to
force these units to implement required actions. Since 1984, GOI has also made
environmental clearance a condition of project approval in many industries in-
cluding cement, thereby ensuring that new capacity meets the country's environ-
mental protection standards.
3.13        Despite the impressive progress made by the industry and the commit-
ment of the Government, particulate emission remains a serious problem for many
cement plants.    Installed  pollution  control  equipment may  not  operate
continuously because of power cuts and other technical and operational problems;
the technical design of some old plants and mini-plants makes it impossible to
install adequate pollution control equipment without major alterations of the
plants; technical and financial constraints may also delay the promised pollu-
tlon control programs (para. 3.12); and monitoring systems in most plants are



- 18 -
inadequate. GOI invited a team of Danish environmental specialists financed by
DANIDA to India in September 1989 to identify environmental and occupational
health problems in the cement industry. It was agreed that a comprehensive study
(para. 4.14) would be carried out as part of the proposed project to analyze the
environmental problems in the industry and recommend options for their
resolution.
3.14        Coal Beneficiation.  The low quality (i.e., high ash content) of In-
dian coal raises specific concerns for the cement industry. The high asn con-
tent, frequently 40-45 percent, affects the industry by (a) reducing the economic
life of limestone deposits, since only higher grades of limestone can be used
with high-ash coal; (b) lowering cement quality because of high ash content and
also because of the inherent variations in ash affecting the chemical composition
of the raw mix; and (c) reducing process efficiency and increasing cost. Given
the impact of the increasing ash content of Indian coal on the economics of the
cement industry, the need for coal beneficiation to supply the industry with
better-quality coal of higher calorific value and reduced ash content is becoming
critical. However, the economics would depend on the cost of coal beneficiation
itself and the benefits that can be derived from improvements in the specific
ways cited above.
3.15      Two options are to be explored by the Government and the industry
independently in the next few years:
(a)   Associated Cement .'ompanies Ltd. (ACC) and Birla-Jute and Industries
Ltd. are installing captive coal washeries based on two different
technologies. Both combine the washery with a captive thermal power
plant, which allows optimal thermal efficiency. ACC and Birla-Jute's
experience will provide valuable technical information for the design
of future large-scale applications.
(b)   DCCI proposes to undertake a study to determine the economic viabi-
lity and organizational arrangements for setting up pit-head coal
washeries that can be linked to a number of operating cement plants.
This option has the advantage of scale and lower transport cost and
could potentially benefit a large number of plants. However, in
order for the scheme to be viable, a pithead thermal power plant with
fluidized bed combustion has to be included in the scheme. This
study is proposed as part of the project (para. 4.14)
3.16        The cement industry restructuring strategy being developed by DCCI
(paras. 3.4-3.15) would guide the industry through the next five years of
adjustment following total decontrol. In the long run, provided the current
sectoral policy environment is maintained, competitive market forces are expected
to ensure efficient allocation of resources in the settor, gradually reducing
regional imbalances and eliminating suboptimal operations. One critical issue
that may pose difficulties to the desired adjustment process for the cement
industry concerns plant closure when an operation is proven unsustainable in a
comretitive market. Plant closure in a timely manner is constrained by labor
legislation and the courts' interpretation thereof. However, there is increasing
recognition by Indian policy makers and the public of the economic costs
associated with these constraints. The Government's decision not to take over
more "sick units" and the establishment of BIFR have provided a framework to
begin dealing with closure problems. In the cement industry, where 85 percent



- 19 -
is in the private sector, market forces have, in the absence of direct subsidy
and government bailout, resulted in a number of closures with the approval of
state governments. There are indications that a plant can be closed with less
social difficulty when satisfactory labor settlements are worked out.  Labor
restructuring including early retirement schemes has become a common practice
in many cement companies. The Bank will continue to discuss the plant closure
issue with the Government in the context of implementation of this project and
more general dialogue on industrial policy in India.
B   Bank-Leadin_ to the Industrv
3.17        The Bank has made 23 development finance loans totaling $1.8 billion
through financial intermediaries (mainly ICICI and IDBI) for on-lending to
private and joint-sector firms. Two loans have been specifically for export de-
velopment, and one for technology development, in part through the provision of
venture capital. The Bank's experience with ICICI in implementing past projects
has been discussed in several Project Completion Reports (PRCs). The most recent
PCR, dated April 1989, for the Fourteenth Industrial Credit and Investment
Project (Ln. 2051-IN, signed on October 8, 1981), indicated that, while the 14
loans were successful in supporting ICICI's institutional development, they did
not seriously address the policy environment within which its lending took place.
This is no longer the case. Major policy reform has taken place in the cement
sector, and a satisfactory lending environme.-t has been created in preparation
for this proposal.
3.18        The Bank has also provided $3.4 billion for projects  in the
fertilizer, cement, petrochemicals and electronics sub.sectors where opportunities
existed for the bank to support policy reforms at the subsector level and fin-
ance economic investments using modern technology.   Implementation of these
projects has been generally satisfactory. All projects currently under imple-
mentation are expected to have satisfactory rates of economic return and, des-
pite some initial delays, most are expected to be completed on time.  Loans
through financia'L intermediaries are also being implemented well, and the Bank
is working closely with them to improve their project appraisal capabilities,
foreign asset/liability management and portfolio quality.
3.19        Lessons from the Cement Sector Experience.  In the cement sector,
the Bank's involvement began in 1980 with a cement subsector study (India: Cement
Subsector Study, Report No. 3141-IN), which became the basis for a.n active policy
dialogue between the Bank and GOI. This dialogue contributed to GOI's policy
decision of partial decontrol of cement pricing and distribution in 1982. The
Bank approved $200 million loans (Cement Industry Project - Lns. 2660-IN/2661-
IN), which became effective in November 10, 1986, to support modernization of
the cement industry. This project has been successful in achieving its basic
objectives.   First,  the project-supported policy environment continued to
improve, and the complete decontrol has been implemented. Second, the project
has financed the modernization projects that converted wet-process plants with
1.8 million tpy total capacity to the more energy-efficient dry process. Third,
energy conservation and pollution control objectives are being realized as the
project is significantly reducing coal consumption and improving the pollution
control standards of the supported cement plants. Fourth, the technical assist-
ance has resulted in formulation of a manpower development strategy and a Human
Resource Development component to be included in this proposed project. Fifth,



- 20 -
the project has increased the industry's awareness of deterioration of coal
quality and its impact on energy efficiency and productivity of cement produc-
tion and the economic life of limestone deposits. As a result, two pilot coal
washeries are being set up by private cement companies with Bank financing. DCCI
has also proposed a study for setting up mine-mouth washeries for the cement
industry.
3.20        Implementation of the project is proceeding reasonably well.  As of
April 1990, $160 million of the total loan had already been committed, and
disbursements amounted to about $75 million. The loans are expected to be fully
committed by September 1990 when thie proposed proJect would become effective.
Overall, this operation has enabled the Bank to maintain active policy dialogue
in the cement sector and to finance priority projects that supported the reform
process. Lessons learned from the first cement project have been incorporated
into the design of this proposed project. First, the proposed project would,
as did the first project,  support continued policy reform and resulting
adjustments. Second, as in the first project, the Bank has been working closely
with IDBI and ICICI in subproject identification and preparation. IDBI and ICICI
have demonstrated their appraisal capability during independent appraisals for
all subprojects and would take full responsibility of subproject appraisal for
the proposed project. The Bank would not appraise individual subprojects, as
it did for the first project, but would provide support in special areas such
as environmental assessment.
3.21        Future Lending.  The Bank has had an active industrial sector work
program and has prepared a number of sector reports on such subjects as indu-
strial regulation, technology policy, export promotion, public enterprise
management and credit and capital markets, as well as a number of subsector
reports including cement, electronics, automotive products, steel, capital goods
and fertilizer. The 1987 CEM, India: An Industrializing Economy in Transition
(Report No. 6633-IN, March 23, 1987) focused on the development of the industrial
sector and supplied the broad outlines of a reform program. Many of the issues
in these reports will continue to be discussed with the Government in the context
of future operations.
3.22        The Bank's future lending program for industry is based primarily
on sector work and will be designed to support the Indian Government's policy
reforms of promoting competition and operational efficiency. The Bank's medium-
term industrial lending program includes:
(a) industrial finance projects which will serve as a focal point for
evaluating and discussing with GOI overall progress on industrial and
financial policy reform as well as addressing issues in the financial
institutions;
(b) technology, industrial pollution control and energy conservation
projects which will serve as a focal point for evaluating and dis-
cussing with GOI overall progress and improve the policy, financial
and institutional suipport for activities in these key areas; and
(c) subsector projects which will provide policy, technical and financial
support for economic investments in areas where improved



- 21 -
efficiency will have implications for the growth of the whole
industrial sector and economy (e.g., petrochemicals, cement and
capital goods).
3.23      In all of these areas, loans are linked to policy reforms that are
being undertaken either in designated policy areas such as t chnology, or in the
policies that affect a specific subsector such as in cement. The basic criterion
that determines the decision to go ahead with a loan is whether or not the policy
environment is conducive to efficient investment in the sector or subsector being
supported. That is, the lending strategy involves supporting investments in
areas where policy improvements have already been undertaken, consistent with
the conclusions of the previous sector and subsector work. In the cement sec-
tor, the most important sector-specific issues (rigid capacity licensing scheme
and cement pricing and distribution) that were identified in the 1980 Cement
Subsector Report have now been largely resolved. The rationale for Bank support
for the proposed project, therefore, is to continue support for the moderniza-
tion and adjustment efforts which started with the first project (Ln. 2660-IN)
by further assisting cement companies to undertake needed restructuring measures.
The subsector restructuring strategy is at a formative stage, and the Bank can
provide substantive assistance based on experience in other countries in
industrial restructuring of wet-process plants and the mini-cement sector,
industrial training, and bulk cement transport.

IV. THE PROJECT AND THE PROPOSED LOAN
A.  Erolect Objectives
4.01        The proposed project is designed to support GOI's recent policy
decision for complete elimination of cement pricing and distribution controls
and would assist the industry in adjusting to a more competitive environment in
the following ways. First, the project would finance investment projects which
are important for the modernization and restructuring of the industry. Second,
the project would help establish and finance a pilot bulk cement transport system
to transport bulk cement to the greater Bombay area. Stuccessful implementation
of this pilot scheme would pave the way to introduce bulk cement transport
systems in India. Third, the project would help establish and finance demand-
driven training systems and programs to support human resource development
compatible with the significant technological transformation of the industry.
Fourth, the project would assist DCCI in studying policy and strategic options
for mini-cement sector, coal washing, use of lignite, pollution control and
environmental protection for the cement industry, and further tevelopment of bulk
cement transport and applications.
B. Proiect Descrigtion
4.02        The proposed project comprises  four components:   an Industry
Modernization and Restructuring component, a Pilot Bulk Cement Transport
component, a Human Resource Development component and a Technical Assistance
component.

4.03        This component would finance (a) capacity expansion in the cement-
deficit regions to alleviate regional demand/supply imbalance, reduce excessive
transport of cement and lower the cost of this basic commodity in some of the
poorest regions of the country; and (b) modernization and restructuring projects
with existing cement companies throughout India to reduce energy cost, enhance
utilization and operating efficiency and improve pollution control stancdards.
Included in the component are four large subprojects which constitute about
80 percent of the proposed Bank loan. These four subprojects would not only
reduce regional demand/supply imbalance, but they would also improve market
competition: two of the subprojects represent new entries to the cement sector,
and the market share of Associated Cement Companies (ACC), the largest in India,
would be reduced due to restructuring. Descriptions of these four subprojects
are available in the project files and are summarized below.
4.04        ACC Corporate Restructuring. ACC is privately owned and the largest
cement company in India; many of its plants utilize outdated, wet-process
technology. Because of increasing competition from new plants, ACC's financial
performance has deteriorated over the last few years resulted in a lack of
resources to undertake much-needed modernization. The project would support a
corporate  restructuring plan developed over the last two years.   The plan



- 23 -
includes (a) selling 4 operating plants (Kistna, Khalari, Shahabad and Porbandar
have already been sold) to reduce the company's operating plants from 14 to 10
in order to concentrate the company's limited financial resources; (b) expansion
of Gagal plant, which was responsible for half of the company's profit in FY89,
to support ACC's growth strategy in cement-deficit regions; (c) implementation
of pollution control programs and smaller high-return projects for selected
mining operations, pilot coal beneficiation and energy conservation; (d) major
modernization of potentially viable existing plants of Kymore, Wadi, Jamul and
Mancherial, if resources permit; (e) reorganization of ACC's Technical Service
Department to make it outward looking and profit oriented; and (f) cot'tinuation
of revised trainitig programs and early retirement schemes to restructure the
labor force. The corporate restructuriag plan was discussed and agreed with the
appraisal mission, and its implementation has already begun.
4.05        The restructuring plan includes a major investment in ACC's modern
Gagal plant, which presently has a capacity of 560,000 tpy. The Gagal plant is
favorably located in Himachal Pradesh and serves a fast-growing market region
in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and part of Uttar Pradesh.   The forecasts of the
supply/demand balance in this region indicates a deficit of 3.5 million tons in
1994-95, according to the recent ICICI study. This major market advantage plus
the availability of the existing infrastructure and well-developed limestone
quarry to support the proposed expansion will offset the high delivered cost of
coal and give the Gagal expansion a definite cost advantage.    The project
includes two parts. Part one consists of a new, modern, dry-process production
line with a capacity of 1 million tpy. The estimated cost is $90 million, of
which the Bank would finance $50 million.  Part two comprises upgrading and
modification of the existing plant to increase its capacity to 1 million tpy (an
increase of 440,000 tpy) and substantially improve pollution control. The cost
of the second part is being estimated and will be presented to IDBI and ICICI
shortly. The new production line will be located on an open area immediately
next to the exiting production unit, and construction of this component will be
undertaken first in order to avoid loss of production during construction.
Gagal is located in an environmentally sensitive area, and measures will be taken
to ensure that the environmental impact will be minimal and acceptable according
to both Indian and international standards. The present limestone deposit will
support the resulting 2 million-tpy plant's capacity for more than 20 years, and
no new mining lease will be required in connection with the project.
4.06        Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO0 Slau Cement Project.   With
surplus slag from its present steel operation and a major blast furnace expansion
under way, it is natural, from both economic and environmental poi.ats of view,
for TISCO to build a slag cement plant. The proposed project consists of (a) a
1 million-tpy clinkerization unit along with a 300,000-tpy OPC grinding unit at
Sonadih, Madhya Pradesh; and (b) a 1.4 million-tpy Portland slag cement (PSC)
grinding unit (based on clinker from Sonadih) near the TISCO steel complex at
Jamshepur, Bihar. The bulk of the output of this project is targeted for the
major Bihar-West Bengal cement-deficit regions, including Calcutta. Currently,
cement is being transported to this region at a considerable cost.   In
acccordance with the split-location design of this project, the clinker, which
makes up 50 percent of the slag cement produced, is transported from Madhya
Pradesh to Bihar to be ground with slag and other additives at the more favorable
market location. The project puts blast furnace slag, a waste material and



- 24 -
potential pollutant, to productive use, and produces significant economic and
social benefits. The estimated project cost is about $147 million, of which
about $70 million would be financed by the proposed loan.
4.07        Jaygee Assam Project. The Assam Industrial Development Corporation
(AIDC) and the Jaiprakash Industries Ltd. (JIL) have signed an agreement of
incorporation to establish a joint-sector company, Jaypee Assam Ltd., for
installation and operation of a 1 million-tpy cement plant at Umrangshu, Assam.
Although AIDC plays an important promotion role in this project, it has confirmed
that it would steadily divest its shareltolding (initially 26 percent) once the
production of the plant stabilizes and that the day-to-day managemeDt of the
company would be with the private partner, JIL, a progressive firm with good
record in operating modern cement plants. During negotiations, IDBI/ICICI agreed
to seek formal assurance from AIDC on the above understandings duxing their
approval of this project. The cement produced by this plant will replace cement
shipped from central India.   The resulting savings in transport costs are
anticipated to be Rs. 250 million per year, 12 percent of total project cost.
An estimated reserve of 65 million tons of cement-grade limestone, which would
sustain the plant over 45 years, has been indicated. The nearest coal field,
Bapung, is only 40 km from the plant and produces high calorific value coal
(5,200 Kcal/kg compared to less than 4,000 Kcal/kg as all-India average). Power
supply is also assured, since the region has a power surplus. The government
of Assam has decided to repair 60 km of road from the nearest rail station to
the plant site and the road leading to Meghalaya. The Northeastern Development
Council, a central government agency for regional development, is also reviewing
possible infrastructure support and financing of training of manpower. The total
project cost is estimated at about $115 million, and about $50 million is
proposed for financing by the Bank loan.
4.08        Maihar Cement Plant Modernization and Expansion.   This project
includes the installation of a new, one million-tpy production line at the Maihar
plant, which is part of Century Textile and Industries Ltd. (CTI), in northern
Madhya Pradesh. The plant's present capacity is 800,000 tpy, and an ongoing
project will increase the capacity to 1 million tpy. The plant is well located
to serve the deficit regions of Uttar Pradesh and part of the Bihar market. The
new production line will be located adjacent to the present unit, and the
reserves in the existing limestone quarry are adequate for the future 2 million-
tpy capacity. Included in the project is the installation of a 5 km long-belt
conveyor taking crushed limestone from the quarry to the plant to reduce traffic
in and around the plant. The existing plant has been continuously updated to
maintain environmental compliance. The new production unit will also utilize
the most up-to-date technology including pollution control.   The estimated
project capital cost is about $106 million, which includes about $53 million of
Bank financing.
Pilot Bulk Cement Transport Component (PBCT)
4.09        This component will finance a pilot bulk cement transport system
between a proposed bulk cement rail terminal located at Kalamboli Rail Terminal
outside Bombay and the cement plants at Wadi and Awarpur. Introduction of a bulk
cement transport system in India is an important part of the long-term
development strategy to rationalize and improve cement distribution and the
productivity of construction in India (para. 3.08). The Bombay area was selected



- 25 -
because it has the best potential for large construction projects to utilize
modern construction methods, including bulk cement and ready-mix concrete.
Implementation of this pilot scheme will provide useful experience for potential
follow-up projects in the rest of the country. The proposed system is designed
to handle 1.2 million tons of cement. Phased implementation over 4 years will
allow development of the market for bulk cement consumption. The detailed market
analysis, project description, cost and implementation arrangements of this
component are available in the project file. The principle elements include:
(a)  I&A Ing Eacilit-i  . Bulk train-loading facilities at cement plants
in Wadi and Awarpur to supply cement to Bombay by rail. ACC, Larsen
& Toubro. Rajashree and Cement Corporation of India (CCI) (Tandur)
would be included in this pilot scheme;
(b)   Special Bulk Cement Wagons.  Each rake (train of wagons) comprises
55-60 closed silo wagons with a total loading capacity of ap-
proximately 3,300 tons.   The system would begin with two rakes
operation and reach five rakes design capacity of the system by the
fifth year of operation; and
(c)   Unloadine Facilities. Train unloading facility, intermediate storage
silos and distribution systems at a plot in the Kalamboli Railway
Terminal in the New Bombay area, where 70 percent of cement
consumption in the greater Bombay area is expected.
4.10        The cement plants participating in the PBCT together with DCCI would
form a joint stock company to implement the project. The estimated project cost
is about $50 million and includes estimated Bank financing of $25 million. This
investment includes two sets of financial outlays. The participating cement
companies will accept responsibility for investments In the loading facilities
at their respective cement plants, for the company-designated silos at the
Kalamboli unloading terminal, and the equipment including vehicles involved in
the distribution of bulk cement. These investments will be financed through
internally generated resources and loans that the individual companies would
borrow from IDBI and ICICI. The proposed joint-stock company will invest in the
special bulk cement wagon rakes, the common facilities for unloading of cement
from the wagons, and equipment for weighing and conveying to the point of
delivery to the individual company silos. The company will also own and operate
the common bag-packing facility at the terminal. The company will generate reve-
nues by levying a service charge to each participating cement company per ton
of cement unloaded at the terminal on their behalf. These revenues should be
adequate to bear all operating expenses, including provisions for replacement
of assets, and meet the company's debt-service obligations. The participating
companies will be in a position to pay this service charge from savings in
unloading expenses associated with cement packed in bags and from the railway
freight rebate.
4.11        In order to prepare this component to be ready for IDBI and ICICI
appraisal, the following understandings were reached: (a) DCCI and participating
companies have agreed, to establish a joint stock company to own and operate
special wagons and common facilities of the Kalamboli Terminal. DCCI has



- 26 -
confirmed that subject to formal approval of the Government, financial assistance
would be made available to the company as equity contributions or soft loans;
(b) DCCI would follow up with the participating cement companies which have
agreed to invest in the loading end of their own plants, silos and distribution
systems at the Kalamboli Terminal and share-holding in the new company; (c) The
Indian Railway Board has in principle agreed to support this project. DCCI and
the participating cement companies would submit a formal request to the Indian
Railways with respect to rebate of freight and assurance of point-to-point tur-
naround time for movement of special bulk cement wagons; (d) the Ministry of
Industry has indicated that this component would be exempt from the requirement
of packing in jute bags, normally covering 65 percent of production; and
(e) ICICI and IDBI would assist in further development of this pilot scheme and,
when it is ready, appraise it in accordance with terms and conditions agreed with
the Bank (para. 4.25).
Human Resource Development Component (HRD)
4.12        This component will assist the cement industry to meet demand for
skilled manpower caused by recent unprecedented growth and substantial structural
and technological changes. Four companies, ACC Kymore Engineering Center (for
Madhya Pradesh and Eastern India), J-K Synthetics (for Rajasthan), Gujarat Ambuja
Cement (for Gujarat) and Dalmia Cement (for Tamil Nadu and south India), have
been selected to establish RTCs for carrying out training programs for "clusters"
or groups of cement plants having geographic proximity.   The RTCs would be
established and operated at the respective lead plants of the above-mentioned
companies. The appraisal mission selected these four companies out of seven
candidates based on the following criteria: (a) the lead plants demonstrated
good performance and are equipped with modern technology suitable for the
intended training, (b) a sufficient number of prospective trainees in the cluster
plants,  9) the lead plant's management and financial commitment to the RTC
concept and its operational cost, (d) indication of commitment from other cluster
plants demanding relevant training and willingness to pay a reasonable fee, and
(e) the lead plant's willingness to organize the training programs, including
selection of trainers from experienced operational personnel to ensure high-
quality output in a demand-driven system. The training programs offered will
focus on skill areas such as computer operations, control-room operations,
quality inspection, mechanical and electrical maintenance, electronic instrumen-
tation, pollution control,  and environmental protection.   Programs would
typically be short term, varying from a few weeks to about six months, and
capacity would be 20-30 trainees at each center. Staff would include part-time
instructors drawn from line positions in the plant, and short-term specialized
consultants. To provide professional support to all RTCs, a Program Coordinator
(PC) (para. 5.18) would be appointed to assist in training needs analysis,
program preparation and implementation, instructor training, development of
instruction methods, preparation of training equipment and learning packages,
design of evaluation models in relation to job performance, etc. As part of the
training program, about 40 trainers would be selected from the lead plants to
receive training abroad during the first year of project implementation.
4.13        The lead plants of the selected RTCs have adequate buildings,
including classroom and resident facilities, which need only minor modifications
with their own resources. J-K Synthetic has made a commitment to construct a



- 27 -
new building for training purposes with its own resources. Project financing
would be provided for training equipment, learning packages, instructor training
in India and abroad, technical assistance for preparation of training programs,
courses and syllabi, and additional specialists from qualified domestic and
international sources. The detailed description of this component is presented
in the Project Files. The total cost of this component is estimated at about
$10 million, and its organizational and implementation arrangements are discussed
in Section V (paras. 5.16-5.20).
technical A pistance Component (TA)
4.14       This component includes the following studies and technical assistance
programs: (a) Study of the General Environmental Status and Pollution Control.
Measures for the Cement Industry; (b) Technical Assistance to the Pilot Bulk
Cement Transport Component; (c) Feasibility Study for Bulk Cement Transport by
Coastal Shipping; (d) Study for Mini-Cement Development Strategy; (e) Feasibility
Study for Setting Up Coal Washery for the Cement Industry; and (f) Feasibility
Study for Use of Lignite for the Cement Industry. The specific objectives, scope
and descriptions of the studies and programs are present in Annex 4. Draft TORs
have been discussed with DCCI and are included in the project file. DCCI has
agreed to carry out the studies in accordance with TOR acceptable to the Bank
and will discuss the results and follow-up actions of the studies with the Bank
during project implementation.
C. Environmental Aspects of the Prolect
4.15        Environmental concern has been important in the formulation of the
project. Several components provide significant environmental benefits, such
as (a) the TISCO cement plant project, which will turn large quantities of slag,
a waste product, into slag cement, thereby alleviating a serious solid-waste
disposal problem at the TISCO steel complex. A similar project concept has been
discussed with the Steel Authority of India regarding their Bokaro slag cement
plant project, which is under preparation; (b) the bulk-cement transportation
component, which would   significantly reduce air pollution associated with
bagging at loading sites, seepage of cement, bags broken during handling and
transportation of cement bags, improve working conditions for cement loaders,
and improve traffic conditions in Bombay; (c) a comprehensive Study for General
Environmental Status and Pollution Control Measures for the Cement Industry,
which would provide sectorwide environmental data as inputs for DCCI and other
government authorities in the formulation of the cement industry development
strategy; and (d) training of environmental professionals and operators of
pollution control equipment, as a part of the human resource development programs
under the project-financed RTCs.
4.16        The Indian cement industry was classified as a polluting industry
by the 1985 Environmental Guidelines for Siting of Industry. Standardized review
and clearance procedures have to be followed in accordance with the Environmental
Clearance of Industry License (1984). Progress in the environmental performance
of the industry (para. 3.12) has demonstrated GOI's commitment to environmental
issues.   For cement-plant projects,  environmental clearance by the state
government is required before GOI issues a Letter of Intent for Industrial
License. The state government, while giving environment clearance, stipulates
environmental protection requirements and requires, if necessary, that a



- 28 -
comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA) be completed before project
implementation. Additional safeguards take effect when the Letter of Intent is
converted into an Industrial License. The state's pollution control board must
certify that the installed equipment is appropriate and adequate and that the
cement plant will meet environmental protection requirements.  For projects
involving opening new quarries within forest resserves, approval by appropriate
central government departments is required. The four major subprojects under
the IMR component have already obtained Letters of Intent. No major adverse
environmental impact has been identified, but a comprehensive EIA is being
carried out for each to identify potential negative environmental impact.
4.17        The principal form of pollution from cement plants is nonhazardous
particulates entreined in combwstion and ventilation gases. The source emissions
are kiln-gas discharge, cooling-air discharge from the clinker cooler, gas
discharge from slag driers, and discharge of mill vent air.  This type of
pollution is abated through the use of electrostatic precipitators and filter
baghouses. Another type of particulate emission is fugitive dust, i.e., airborne
dust from material handling, storage, and reclaiming, and from road traffic.
That type of pollution is abated by baghouses at material transfer points, by
enclosing conveyors and storage areas, and by wetting down roads.   Other
emissions are S02 and NO, gases from combustion. Only minor amounts of these
gases are emitted, and all subprojects would comply with internationally
acceptable practices. There are no liquid emissions from a cement plant except
sewage from residential areas. Water runoff from plant and quarry sites will
be contained by proper design. Standard environmental precautions for mining
operations will be applied at the quarry, and extensive tree planting is being
planned by subproject sponsors in connection with reclamation. Cement plants
also emit noise, particularly from grinding mills, compressors, etc. Disse-
mination to the outside of such noise will be prevented by enclosing the noisy
process units, and by mufflers.   The planned tree plantings will provide
additional noise shielding. Operating personnel will be provided with protective
devices. Two of the four major cement plant subprojects include the installation
of an additional production line to existing plants, with existing quarries
meeting projected future demand. There will be no change in use of land adjacent
to the sites. The other two major cement plant subprojects are new plants, but
none of the plants or quarries will be located in sensitive areas such as forests
or valuable agricultural land. One subproject (JP-ASSAI), will be in an area
of dense vegetation, thick scrub, scattered trees and no agriculture (only seven
cottages in the immediate neighborhood). Tne other (TISCO's Sonadi) will be
located in a sparsely populated rural area used for seasonal paddy crops and
grazing. The site for the bulk cement component is in an industrial area, and
the processing equipment will be provided with dust collection equipment meeting
international emission standards. India has environmental protection standards
that are in general less stringent than those of developed countries, but are
in line with or more stringent than those of most of the developing countries.
Since emissions of particulates is the dominant pollutant from cement plants,
applying more stringent standards for particulate source emission to some major
Bank financed subprojects would provie application of advanced technology and
demonstrative benefits. However, subprojects to upgrade existing cement plants
to meet Indian particulate emission standards should also be encouraged. For
other minor emissions pollutants, meeting Indian standards would generally be
consistent with internationally accepted practices in cement industry.

4.18        Major Subproiects.   Four major subprojects, TISCO, ACC, Century
Maihar and JP-Assam, constitute about 80 percent of the proposed loan.  The
appraisal mission met with subproject sponsors and their consultants and
discussed options and measures to minimize potential environmental impacts of
the projects.   The following understandings were reached:   (a) the above
subproject sponsors agreed to design electrostatic precipitators for a source
emission standard of 100 mg/norm cubic meter (nm3) or less for particulates and
for all filter baghouses of 60 mg/nm3 and to include in the design standard
precautions for prevention of fugitive dust. The source emission agreed is In
line with that of the developed countries and more stringent than the current
Indian Emission Standards of 150 mg/J3 for protec.ted areas and 250 mg/nm3 for
other areas where most of the cement plants are locared; (b) the above subproject
sponsors agreed to prepare a comprehensive EIA report in the scope agreed with
the appraisal mission (Annex 5). To facilitate monitoring of the environmental
assessment of each subproject, a preliminary EIA would be submitted to the Bank;
and, (c) all subproject sponsors also agreed to take whatever actions are
required to assure environmental compliance according to the EIA reports.
4.19         Role of IDBI and ICICI.  The proposed Bank financing of the IMR and
PBCT components will be through a line of credit to IDBI and ICICI (para. 4.23),
and IDBI and ICICI will be responsible for appraising all subprojects including
environmental impacts.   The following agreements were reached with IDBI and
ICICI:  IDBI and ICICI (a) would seek formal assurance from the four major
subproject sponsors to implement the environmental protection measures promised
(para. 4.18); (b) would ensure during subproject appraisal that design and
equipment specifications of all subprojects will meet Indian environmental
protection standards; (c) would use external consultants for reviewing
environment impact assessment if expertise is not available in-house, and
(d) stipulate adequate subloan covenants to ensure remedy measures identified
by EIAs.
4.20        Bank Reviev. Since the loan is primarily a line of credit operation,
and subprojects are at different stages of preparation, the following review and
follow-up procedure is set up to ensure adequate EIA for the project:
(a) The appraisal staff have received and reviewed preliminary EIA
reports for the four largest subprojects (which account for
80 percent of the loan). The review confirmed that the preliminary
EIA reports are of good quality and identified no major adverse
impact that had not been remedied with planned actions.   These
preliminary EIA reports and the review by appraisal staff are
available in the project file.
(b) Any subprojects above $20 million will be subject to Bank review
prior to subloan approval (para. 4.25), and the EIA submitted along
with IDBI/ICICI appraisal report must be acceptable to the Bank
before the Bank formally commits its financing to a subproject. The
scope of the ETA has been outlined in Annex 5.
(c) During supervision, the Bank would follow up the agreed understanding
and actions for environmental protection to ensure actual implementa-
tion.

D.    oilcet Cost and Financing Plan
4.21       The total cost of the project is estimated t.o be about $736 million,
of which about $110 million is foreign exchange.  The project cost estimate is
presented in Table 4.1, and the financing plan is presented in Table 4.2.   No
contingencies have been calculated for the IMR and PBCT components because they
form part of the line of credit facility (para. 4.23). In the event of escala-
tion in the average cost of subprojects, the number of additional subprojects
would be reduced.

4.22       The proposed Bank loan of $300 million would finance about 41 percent
of the total project cost. DANID& would be the major source of financing for
the HRD and TA components and would provide a grant of $5.8 million equivalent
to finance about 52 percent of project cost for the HDR and TA components. For
the DNR component, the Bank loan of $273 million would finance about 40 percent
of the cost of subprojects; the balance would be provided by equity and internal
cash generation (35 percent), loans from the DFIs and debenture issues

(25 percent). For the PBCT component, the Bank would finance the special bulk
cement wagons and other equipment, estimated at about $25 million (50 percent),
the participating cement companies would finance $16 million (32 percent), and
GOI would finance $9 million as share capital to the joint stock company or as
soft loans. The HDR component would be financed as follows: $5.0 million from
DANIDA as a bilateral grant; $1.6 million from the proposed Bank loan, $900,000
from the remaining balance of the GOT grant for manpower training financed by
the first Cement Industry Project (Ln. 2660-IN), and $2.5 million by the par-
ticipating lead plants which would also provide all recurrent cos.t of the RTCs.
For the TA component, the Bank loan of $400,000, combined with the DANIDA grant
of $800,000 would finance the entire component cost of $1.2 million.
E. The Pro_osed Loan
4.23        The Bank loan of $300 million would be made to GOI at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate repayable on standard country terms of 20 years
including 5 years of grace. GOI would pass on the proceeds of the loan as
follows:
Part A: GOI would relend $298 million of the loan proceeds as a line of
credit to IDBI and ICICI in equal proportions, to finance part
of the IhR and PBCT components.
Part B: GOI would provide $1.6 million of the loan proceeds as budget
allocations through DCCI to finance part of the IIRD component.
Part C: GOI would provide $400,000 of the loan proceeds as budgetary
allocations to DCCI to finance part of the TA component.
4.24        Part  . The $298 million line of credit from GOI to IDBI and ICICI
would be lent in rupees with an interest rate of 12 percent p.a. and with
repayment over 20 years including a grace period of 5 years. This interest rate
is in line with the cost of alternative sources of rupee funds to the financial
institutions. Since IDBI and ICICI would share financing for major subprojects
in a 1:1 ratio, as they did in the First Cement Industry project, they would
receive the Bank loan proceeds in equal proportions. Based on the experience
of the First Cement Project, a large portion of the contracts under this
component would be won by domestic suppliers following international competitive
bidding (ICB) procedures.  GOI wou'ld bear the foreign exchange and interest
risks. IDBI and ICICI would on-lend the proceeds of the loan to subborrowers at
the DFIs term lending rate, presently 14 percent. This rate is highly positive,
given the present and projected inflation rate of 8-9 percent, and is consistent
with the overall interest rate structure in India. The Government would review
the relending rates of the DFIs from time to time in relation to inflation and
other domestic and international market conditions and adjust the relending rates
as necessary to ensure that the rates on new subloans remain positive in real
terms, reflect market conditions and provide a reasonable spread to the DFIs.
A Bank report on the financial sector was sent to the GOI in March 1990 and will
provide the basis for future discussion of financial-sector issues including



X 32 -
interest rates (para 5.06).  Since the interest rates under this project are
consistent with the DFIs' overall term lending structure, and the Bank loan would
finance only a portion of the DFI's much larger lending to the cement industry,
the proposed Bank loan to this subsector would not create any distortionary
resource flows.   The project would, however, improve the overall subsector
environment within which lending to the cement industry is taking place through
continued improvements in policy and technical support provided to the financial
institutions and the cement companies. Signing of subsidiary loan agreements
acceptable to the Bank between GOI and IDBI and ICICI would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.
4.25        Agreement has been reached with IDBI and ICICI that all subprojects
would satisfy the following criteria: (a) they would be appraised by either IDBI
or ICICI with detailed analysis to demonstrate a minimum economic rate of return
of 12 percent and a minimum financial rate of return of 15 percent, (b) the
sponsoring enterprise should have an acceptable capital structure such that with
the new loan the debt:equity ratio of the enterprise would not normally exceed
2.5:1, and (c) the subproject would be equipped to meet the Indian environmental
protection standards and are acceptable  to the Bank.   Clearance by the
appropriate state pollution control board is a condition of subproject appraisal.
Completion of an environmental impact assessment report by a subborrower is a
condition for the subloan disbursement.   For subprojects appraised at over
$20 million and/or located in forest or other environmentally sensitive areas,
a comprehensive EIA as outlined in Annex 5 would be prepared and completed before
project implementation.   The Bank's prior approval would be required for
subprojects appraised above $20 million. Five subprojects representing more than
90 percent of the loan are expected to exceed this limit. On-lending terms would
not exceed 15 years including a maximum grace period of 5 years.
4.26        Part .  GOI would pass on, ac grants, part of the proceeds of the
Bank loan as budgetary allocations through DCCI to finance part of the training
programs under the HRD component
4.27        Part C.  GOI would pass on part of the proceeds of the Bank loan
as budgetary allocations to DCCI to finance part of the TA component.
F. Procurement
4.28        Table 4.3 shows the estimated amounts by categories to be procured
by different methods.  Procurement from the loan proceeds under Part   of the
loan would follow the following procedures:   any procurement package for
equipment and spares exceeding $8 million equivalent to be financed out of the
proceeds of the loan would follow ICB procedures in accordance with guidelines.
For the purpose of bid comparison under ICB, local suppliers would receive a
15 percent price preference or the level of customs duties, whichever is lower.
For packages less than 68 million financed by the Bank, ICB procedure would be
encouraged, but commercial practices in accordance with the two financial
institutions' procedures which have been used in previous Bank projects are
acceptable to the Bank. The DFIs require their borrowers to solicit at least
three competitive and responsive quotations for all contracts. Based on advanced



- 33 -
procurement action and the experience of the First Cement Project,  about
$270 million (90 percent) of the Bank loan is expected to be procured under ICB
procedures.  ICB packages would be determined at the subproject appraisal stage
by IDBI and ICICI. Prior Bank review will be required for ICB packages above
$8 million.   For other ICB packages,  records will be maintained by the
subborrowers and submitted for review upon Bank request. Random selection of
projects for ex-post review will also be carried out as part of supervision.
For large and complex subprojects, preparation of procurement packages requires
significantlead time. Advanced procurement action has been initiated for three
subprojects ($180 million of the loan). All advanced procurement will follow
ICB procedures. No advanced contracting nor retroactive financing is expected.
For any service to be financed out of the Bank loan, consultant selection
procedures under the Bank's Guidelines for use of Consultant would be followed.
For civil works where Bank financing is not used, commercial practice of the
subproject sponsors would be followed.

for the 'Use of Consultants. (c) Bank Review. Draft bidding documents, master
equipment lists indicating cost estimates, and bid evaluations and awards would
be subject to Bank review for contracts of $200,000 or more. For Part C of the
Loan, the Bank's Gu'delines for Use of Consultants would bB followed.
G. Disbursoment
4.30        For Part A of the loan, upon receiving satisfactory documentation,
the Bank loan would be disbursed for:  (a) 100 percent of the CIF price for
imported equipment and spares, (b) 100 percent of the total cost for consultant
and training, (c) 100 percent of the ex-factory price of domestic equipment and
spares, and (d) 80 percent of other equipment and spares procured locally. For
Part B of the loan, disbursement of funds provided by the Bank would be made
against the following categories of expenditures: (a) 100 percent of the cost
of consultant and other services; (b) 100 percent of the CIF price of imported
equipment, training packages and educational materials; (c) 100 percent of the
ex-factory price of local equipment, training packages and educational materials;
and (d) 80 percent of other equipment, training packages and educational
materials procured locally. For Part C of the project, the Bank loan would be
disbursed for 100 percent of consultant costs.
4.31        For Part A of the loan, disbursement for any contract for goods less
than $3 million and any contract for consultant and training less than $200,000
would use statements of expenditure (SOEs), while disbursement for other
contracts would be fully documented in accordance with the Bank's disbursement
procedures. For Part B and Part C of the loan, disbursement for any contract
below $200,000 would use SOEs, while disbursement for other contracts would be
fully documented.
4.32        The proposed loan is expected to be disbursed over six years.  The
project completion date is December 31, 1995 and the closing date of the loan
is June 30, 1996. The disbursement schedule and disbursement projection are
presented in Annex 6. The disbursement projection is similar to the observed
performance for Bank-financed industrial projects in India.   To facilitate
disbursement, one special account will be established for an authorized
allocation of $16 million, which is the estimated average disbursement over four
months. After effectiveness of the loan, the borrower would request the Bank
to deposit into the Special Account the stated amount as a revolving fund. The
Bank would replenish the Special Account on the basis of requests for reimburse-
ment on a quarterly basis or whenev-er the amount used reached 50 percent of the
initial deposit. Reimbursement for all contracts using the SOE method would be
done through the Special Account.
H. Reporting and Audits
4.33        For Part   of the loan, IDBI and ICICI would submit to the Bank
semiannual progress reports on sanctions, commitments, disbursement, collections,
and arrears under the component, for the institution's cement portfolio and for
the institution as a whole.   IDBI and ICICI would also submit financial



- 35 -
statements in conformity with the Bank's standard reporting requirements,
including the submission of audited financial statements, prepared by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank, within four months of the close of each
financial year. For subprojects above $20 million, IDBI and ICICI would require
the subproject sponsors to prepare semiannual progress reports which would also
be summitted to the Bank.   These progress reports should include project
implementation, schedule (planned vs. actural), procurement (including full
status of ICB), disbursement, updated cost estimates, updated production cost
and ex-factory realizations, and a smmmary of the financial status of the
company. After full disbursement of a subproject above $20 million, the lead
financial institution would prepare a subproject completion report, comparing
actual vs. projected costs and benefits. For Part B of the loan, each selected
RTC would submit semi-annual progress reports to the Bank. Operational audit
reports covering experience and results under the HRD and TA components would
be prepared by GOI within six months of the completion of these components.
4.34        Supporting documentation under statements of expenditure (SOEs)
would be retained by GOI and would be subject to review by the Bank and to
annual audit by auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit would be submitted
within four months after the close of each financial year.

V. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS. PRTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS.
AND PROJECT BENEITS AND RISKS
A. Office of Develoment Commissioner for Cement Industrv (DCCI)
5.01        DCCI will be the coordinating agency for the proposed project.  As
part of the Ministry of Industry (MOI), DCCI was established to replace the
Cement Controller's Office, whose main functioa to administer the price fixing
and freight equalization was eliminated. DCCI's present functions are focused
on the development issues of the cement industry.
5.02        DCCI regards the project as an integral part of the subsector
strategy for restructuring the cement industry.   First, DCCI would, during
project implementation, discuss with the Bank the implementation of the
restructuring strategy for the cement industry, including its consideration for
implementation of the Cement Industry Modernization Plan for the Wet Process
Plants (para.  3.04).   Second,  DCCI would coordinate with various central
government departments, state governments and other agencies to ensure adequate
infrastructure support and input supplies, particularly for coal, power supply
and railway wagons, for the project as well as for the industry as a whole.
Third, DCCI regards human resource development as a high priority for the cement
industry and would help organize and chair a Steering Committee for the HRD
component (para. 5.19). DCCI would be assisted by a Program Coordinator to
coordinate this component (para. 5.18). Fourth, DCCI would continue to provide
support for the development and implementation of the PBCT Component
(para. 4.11). And finally, DCCI would also be responsible for implementation
of the TA component. This implementation would include responsibilities for
inviting, entering into contracts with, and supervising consultants to carry out
various studies in accordance with terms of references acceptable to the Bank,
and discussing the results and follow-up actions of the studies with the Bank
(para. 4.14). DCCI has its own staff specialized in policy analysis and is
capable of implementing the TA component.
B. PartLiciatinj Financial Institutions
The Financial Sector "1
5.03        India has a deep and complex financial system which boasts a large
number and variety of institutions and instruments. It ranks in the top quarter
among developing countries by most measures of financial sector size.   Its
evolution in the past 20 years has been unique. At the end of June 1969, the
Government launched "social banking," an approach that sought to use banks and
other financial institutions to achieve several development objectives.  The
banks increased their branch network dramatically,  and the Government set
11 The World Bank Report, India: Credit and Capital Markets StudX (No. 6661-IN,
February 27, 1987) provides a comprehenslve analysis of the Indian Financial
Sector.



- 37 -
interest rates to attract deposits. Many of the original objectives of social
banking have been achieved. Resource mobilization has been a notable success.
National saving rates were in the 22-24 percent range in the 1980s, with average
households saving at a rate of 15-17 percent. Household savings have been rising
and passing increasingly through the formal financial sector since the 1970s.
In addition to bank deposits, there are substantial post-office savings and a
wide choice of other forms for saving including one of the largest capital
markets in the developing world. Maintenance of reasonable, slightly positive,
real interest rates for deposits, less than double-digit inflation, and the
spread of banking offices (which have grown from about 8,300 in 1969 to over
55,000) have been important factors in resource mobilization. The financial
sector is dominated by the banking svstem, which as of June 1988 had total assets
of over Rs. 1,420 billion, of which 91 percent was accounted for by the 20
public-sector banks and the rest by the 28 private Indian banks and 30 foreign
banki.
5.04        Although Indian interest rates are, for the most part, not linked
to the international market, the distortions are not major. Both deposit and
lending rates are positive in real terms, the dispersion of interest rates is
not excessive, and financial institutions are being given greater flexibility
to adjust their rates. Over the past few years, GOI has depreciated the rupee
rapidly to maintain the competitiveness of exports and restrain import growth.
Most interest rates in India have not yet fully adjusted to this new situation,
in large part because the Indian Government has been very cautious about raising
the already substantially positive lending rates and dampening the growth of the
domestic economy. Over time, it is reasonable to expect greater convergence of
most domestic rates with international market rates as the rate of rupee
depreciation slows and domestic lending rates are gradually raised to reflect
a more outward-looking development strategy.
5.05        The notable achievements of the Indian financial sector have been
accompanied by some striking shortcomings. The system faces two main problems:
the level of directed investments and targeted credit at subsidized interest
rates is becoming unsustainable, and the profitability of commercial banks has
declined.   Banks must place 53 percent of their deposits with RBI or in
government paper to comply with cash reserve and statutory liquidity
requirements. They jumt break even on these investments in spite of the higher
interest rates paid by the Government in recent years. In addition, banks are
also required to lend another 20 percent of their deposits to priority sectors
at subsidized interest rates. All of this targeted credit is cross-subsidized
by the banks' commercial lending, based on their remaining deposits.   The
profitability of the commercial banks has been adversely affected both by
narrowing average spreads and collection problems.   While there is little
competition among these institutions, they face a growing challenge from money
and capital markets.
5.06        The Bank has just completed a financial sector report highlighting
these findings. This report will be discussed with the Government with a view
to establishing an ongoing dialogue.   Continuing policy discussions about
financial policies and financial institutions will be the basis for future Bank
loans to the financial sector.



- 38 -
5.07        The industrial development finance system comprises national and
state development banks and financial institutions. At the national level, the
predominate financial institutions are IDBI, ICICI, and the Industrial Finance
Corporation of India (IFCI). These institutions sell financial assets directly
to the public, raise resources from banks, the domestic capital market, bilateral
and multinational sources, and borrow from abroad. IDBI and ICICI have been
successful in maintaining stable profitability and adequate liquidity and
pioneered innovations in financial products. For the cement industry, DFIs are
the major source of financing for investment projects.  The Bank's subsector
lending to the financial institutions constitutes a small share of the total
resources available to them, and the relending rates for Bank funds are
consistent with overall DFI interest rates. The risk of causing an allocative
distortion through subsector lending is quite small, and it is more than balanced
by the catalytic role the Bank plays in helping improve the efficiency of
specific subsectors through the kinds of restructuring projects and measures
contained in these subsector operations.
Industrial DeveloRment Bank of India (IDBI)
5.08        IDBI was established in 1964 as a wholly owned subsidiary of RBI and
is now fully owned by GOI. As the lead institution for industrial investment
finance, IDBI operates as a direct lender and as an apex refinance institution
for the state financial institutions and commercial banks in their investment
lending operations. Its importance as a direct lender is demonstrated by the
fact that it accounted for about 39 percent of total industrial investment
lending by the all-India and state-level financial institutions in FY88. Its
promotional role covers a wide range of activities at the national level and,
through specialized institutions, at the local level. These activities aim to
develop both sound industrial investments and financial practices and include
industry potential surveys, entrepreneurship development programs, consultancy
and advisory services, and expanded development banking training programs.
5.09        IDBI's financial assistance to the industrial sector, which amounts
to about Rs. 50 billion ($3 billion) p.a., is carried out through three basic
types of operations. First is direct finance in the form of loans, underwriting,
direct capital subscriptions or guarantees, available to projects costing at
least Rs. 50 million. Direct finance accounts for about 44 percent of IDBI's
portfolio. Second is refinanced loans (37 percent of IDBI's portfolio), which
are originated as loans to small- and medium-sized businesses by state-level
institutions and banks which bear the risk on these operations.   Third is
rediscounted bills (19 percent of portfolio) covering sale of machinery, financed
by banks on a deferred payment basis and bearing corresponding bank guarantees.
IDBI's assets have tripled in the last 5 years, from Rs. 64 billion in FY85 to
Rs. 171 billion in FY89.   Net profit over assets has been maintained at a
satisfactory level of 1.5 percent over this period.
5.10        IDBI mobilizes large amounts of resources from equity contributions
from GOI, RBI borrowings, bond issues, internal generation and foreign-exchange
borrowing. The cost of borrowing for rupee bonds, which accounted for 44 percent
of external resources, has risen gradually from 7 percent in the late 1970s to
11.5 percent today. The weighted average cost of domestic funds for IDBI has
consequently increased from 6.8 percent in 1983 to 7.5 percent in 1987 and
8.1 percent in 1989. In spite of the increase in cost of borrowing, the basic



- 39 -
iuterest rate on term lending has remained unchanged at 14 percent, resulting
in a squeeze on the interest spread. The full effect of the squeeze on operating
margins has yet to show up in the profit statements, as the greater portion of
IDBI's portfolio is still supported by earlier bond issues and RBI borrowings.
However, there is a need to give DFIs greater flexibility in setting their
lending rates, and the Government is presently considering this matter. Facing
a more challenging environtment, IDBI has begun to strengthen its collection
efforts and to protect the quality of its portfolio. The collection performance
of refinanced loans and discounted bills has been good, since state financial
institutions and commercial banks have always met their guarantee liability on
these operations. For the direct lending portfolio, where the collection ratio
was traditionally low, IDBI has begun to implement its new strategy to improve
portfolio quality and to increase its collection ratio:  (a) it has provided
adequate provision for doubtful loans; and (b) it initiated its new collection
strategy in 1987 in conjunction with the Industrial Finance and Technical
Assistance project (Ln. 2928-IN) and has already achieved the targeted increase
in its collection ratio. The institution's collect-.on ratio before rescheduling
has increased from 85 percent to 87 percent.   IDBI has become increasingly
commercial in its project selection and appraisal, and has recently strengthened
its restructuring operations, as one of the operating agencies under BIFR, to
restructure sick and potentially sick companies.
5.11        Up to June 1987, IDBI had assisted 231 cement projects, of which 99
were direct financing to the cement industry and the rest were through refinanc-
ing schemes with state-level financial institutions. In spite of the relatively
small number, the direct financing portfolio constitutes more than 80 percent
of IDBI's cement exposure because of the large size of projects. In FY89, IDBI's
annual sanctions to the cement industry were about Rs. 800 million, and cumula-
tive sanctions to the industry at Rs. 15 billion formed about 5 percent of
anctions to all industries. IDBI has qualified and experienced professional
staff under a deputy general manager specialized in cement projects. They are
familiar with the modern technology utilized in cement plants and are capable
of evaluating feasibility studies by project sponsors and/or by their local and
foreign consultants. Their experience in environmental assessment is recent and
will be complemented by the Bank's involvement. IDBI has a market research
department and periodically analyzes cement demand and production. IDBI also
plays an important role in advising the Government on policy for the cement
industry and is represented in the policy meetings at the Ministry of Industry
for the cement industry. IDBI, together with ICICI, has successfully implemented
the First Cement Industry Project (Lns. 2660-IN/2661-IN), and its subproject
appraisals are of good quality.   In receiving Bank loan from the proposed
project, IDBI has agreed to maintain a debt: equity ratio of less than 12:1 and
a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2:1.
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI)
5.12        ICICI, established in 1955 under private ownership to provide long-
term finance to private industry, is now government controlled, with 81 percent
public ownership. ICICI has developed into one of the country's major financial
institutions and is the main provider of foreign-currency term loans to Indian
firms. The corporation offers a wide range of financial services, largely to
the private sector, and in recent years it has diversified into areas such as
merchant banking, leasing, instalment sales, venture capital and credit-rating



- 40 -
services.   In addition to its operational activities, ICICI also plays an
important developmental role. It advises the Government on industrial issues,
carries out sector studies and develops new ideas and methods of improving the
financial markets.   ICICI is well managed and operates effectively under an
experienced 15-member board, with balanced representation from Government,
public, and private industry. Organizationally, ICICI is divided into five
administrative groups: operations, planning, finance, financial services and
administration.    The operations  group,  headed by a General Manager,  is
responsible for lending including appraising new projects, supervising and
monitoring ongoing loans, and making collections. The proposed project will be
implemented by this group.
5.13        ICICI 's assistance to industry, which amounted to about Rs. 20.6 bil-
lion in FY89, is through two broad areas of activity: project financing and
financial services. In FY89, ICICI sanctioned about Rs. 16 billion for project
financing, with the following sectors receiving large portions of the assist-
ance:    fertilizer  (11.2 percent),  basic chemicals  (8.7),  other chemicals
(13 percent), basic metal industry (9.6 percent), cement (7.2 percent) and
textiles (6.7 percent).   Its financial service sanctions of Rs. 4.6 billion
covered deferred credit Rs. 2.7 billion, leasing Rs. 1.5 billion and installment
sales Rs. 0.4 billion. ICICI has had impressive growth during the past 5 years,
and its assets increased from Rs. 17.6 billion in 1984 to Rs. 47.3 billion in
FY89.  Its profits increased from Rs. 300 million to Rs. 789 million, with a
satisfactory return on assets of 1.6 percent.
5.14         Like IDBI, ICICI's future profitability is also likely to be
affected by the increase in the cost of borrowing. The weighted average cost
of ICICI's rupee borrowing is rising steadily, from 8.3 percent in FY86 to
8.6 percent in and FY88 and 8.9 percent in FY89. In spite of the increase in
cost of borrowing, the basic interest rate on term lending has remained unchanged
at 14 percent, resulting in a squeeze on interest spread. The full effect of
the squeeze on operating margings has yet to appear in the profit statements as
the greater portion of ICICI's portfolio is still supported by earlier, lower-
cost borrowings. However, there is a need to give DFIs greater flexibility in
setting its lending rate. Facing a more challenging environment, ICICI has begun
to strengthen its collection efforts and protect the quality of its portfolio.
While its nonproject financing portfolio has an outstanding collection rate, the
collection ratio of the project portfolio has been weak, reflecting the
increasingly competitive environment in the industrial sector in a time of
liberalization. ICICI adopted a collection strategy in 1987 in conjunction with
the Industrial Finance and Technical Assistance Project and has strengthened its
portfolio management: (a) legal actions have been taken more promptly against
companies which have no chance to repay their loans, and adequate provisions were
made for these loans; (b) a rehabilitation program has been established for other
nonperforming companies with necessary rescheduling packages. A substantial
portion of these companies, which suffered losses due to the cyclical nature of
industries has come out of the nonperforming category through the rehabilitation
program; (c) collection efforts have been strengthened, and the collection ratio
of the institution before rescheduling has been brought back from 84 percent to



- 41 -
86 percent for the 12-month period ending September 1989; and (d) measures have
also been taken to tackle the "industrial sickness" as one of the operating
agencies under BIFR.
5.15        By the end of March 1989, ICICI had financed 217 cement projects
with a cumulative sanction of Rs. 6.73 billion, 8.5 percent of ICICI's total
cumulative sanction to all industries.   Its annual sanction to the cement
industry increased from Rs. 648 million in FY85 to Rs. 1.1 billion in FY89.
ICICI's present cement portfolio is Rs. 4.2 billion, which consists of 90 cement
companies. Among the 90 cement companies included in its portfolio, ICICI is
the lead bank for 24. The institution has qualified and experienced professional
staff specializing in cement projects.   They are familiar with the modern
technology utilized in cement plants and are capable of evaluating feasibility
studies by project sponsors and/or by their local and foreign consultants.
Their experience in environmental assessment is recent and will be complemented
by the Bank's  involvement.   ICICI has a market research department and
periodically analyzes cement demand and productions.   ICICI also plays an
impartant role in advising the Gciernment policy for the cement industry. With
IDBI, ICICI successfully implemented the Firnt Cement Industry Project (Lns.
2660/2661-IN), and its subproject appraisals are of good qtuality. In receiving
Bank loan from the proposed project, ICICI has agreed to maintain a debt-equity
ratio of less than 12:1 and a debt service coverage rati3 of at least 1.2:1.
C.  Oreanizational ArranQements for the Human Resoure  DeveloDment Component
5.16          A steering committee (SC) chaired by DCCI should be established
to oversee implementation of this project component. The point of delivery of
training is at the selected RTCs located at and managed by the respective lead
plants.   Although the RTCs assume full responsibility for implementation
including procurement and training programs, a Proglram Coordinator (PC) would
be appointed to assist DCCI in technical support and project coordination.
5.17          Regional Training Centers (RTC).  The selected RTCs (para. 4.12)
would be established and operated according to the following operating guide-
lines:
(a) The management responsibility of a RTC rests with the lead plant. An
executive committee (EC) chaired by a representative of the lead plant
would be established with the participation of major plants in the same
cluster to provide guidance and consultation.
(b) The lead plant company will provide all agreed local capital cost for
establishing RTC and adequate funding to cover all recurrent costs for
agreed training programs. The RTC would charge reasonable fees for
providing these programs to other participating cluster plants.
(c) RTC will guarantee a minimum number of trainees of 30 percent of the
annual enrollment from other participating cluster plants, failing which
the fee structure would be subject to review by the SC.



- 42 -
(d) RTC, assisted by the PC, will prepare requests for financing of
equipment, learning packages, technical assistance and overseas training
to be approved by SC.
(e) The lead plant company intends to continue operations of the RTC based
on cluster demand beyond the project period.
(f) each RTC will submit semiannual progress report to SC, DANIDA and the
Bank.
The operating guidelines have been discussed and agreed in principle with the
selected RTCs and agreed with GOI during negotiations. To receive Bank funds,
the lead plant's company of each RTC would enter a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) acceptable to the Bank, with DCCI giving the assurance that the operating
guidelines will be followed.
5.18          Program Coordinator (PC).  The PC would assist DCCI for coordina-
tion of the component and would be hired by the Steering Committee on a full time
basis. The cost of the PC would be funded by the project. PC will help the RTC
mobilize domestic and international technical resources, advise on training
programs and instructor training, and help with procurement when necessary. The
PC will have an informal international resources group, identified during project
preparation, to provide consultation, training and other project inputs from
international resources. During the negotiations, the terms of reference and
qualifications of PC were agreed, and it was also agreed that the PC would be
appointed by SC before December 31, 1990.
5.19          Steering Committee (SC).  The SC would consist of representatives
from Ministry of Industry, DCCI, CMA, National Vocational Training System,
IDBI/ICICI, DANIDA and a senior executive from each lead plant. The SC would
be chaired by DCCI, and its main functions would be (a) to provide policy
guidance for human resource development in the cement industry, and (b) to
monitor and oversee implementation of the training programs at RTCs. Based on
the SC's recommendation. -DCCI would enter a MOU, acceptable to the Bank, with
the lead plant's company of each RTC to ensure that the RTC receiving the Bank
funds will follow the agreed operating guidelines (para. 5.17).
5.20          The following actions by GOI would be conditions for disbursement
of this component: (a) SC is established; and (b) the Financing Agreement with
DANIDA for the HRD component is effective.
D. Project Benefits and Risks
5.21          Project Benefits.   The project would add about 5 million tpy
production capacity in cement-deficit regions, resulting in an improved regional
production structure that would bring significant savings in cement transport.
Most of the savings would be passed to cement consumers as cement price reduction
in the cement-deficit regions, which are among the poorest in the country. The
project would support modernization and restructuring of existing cement
companies, reduce energy and other production costs, and improve economic



- 43 -
efficiency of operations. The project would support installation of pollution
control equipment, ensure better environmental assessment of subprojects, and
encourage productive use of slag, a waste product from steel plants, which must
be disposed in an ecologically acceptable manner. The project would promote an
appropriate blend of imported and domestic technology through ICB procurement
and support development of an efficient domestic cement machinery manufacturing
industry. Financing the pilot bulk cement transport project would pave the way
for significant efficiency improvement in the cement distribution system and
potential productivity increases in the construction industry resulting in
immense long-term economic benefits to the country.  The project would also
finance training programs for approximately 3,000-4,000 operating personnel in
much-needed skill categories for both new plants and existing plants under
modernization. Finally, the project would allow the Bank to continue to play
a role in policy, technical and institutional issues related to the restructuring
of the industry.
5.22          Priject Risks. No unusual project risks have been identified for
subprojects in the proposed pipeline under the Industry Modernization and Restru-
cturing component. Introducing a bulk cement transport system, which involves
the development of a new marketing and distribution approach and many players
with substantial investment, is inherently risky. Provision of limited bagging
facilities at the unloading terminal, phased implementation of the project, and
the provision of further DANIDA financed-technical assistance for market deve-
lopment of bulk cement are measures that have been designed to minimize the
risk. Implementation of Human Resource Development component is likely to be
slow due to the innovative nature of the approach and the need to have groups
of cement plants join in a common effort. A Memorandum of Understanding signed
between DCCI and the lead plant company of each RTC would provide assurances that
the lead plant companies would commit their financial and managerial resources
for the training activities and that the RTCs would offer training services to
other plants with suitable fees. DANIDA has also indicated that it would fi-
nance consultants to assist implementation of this component.

Sha4aw P.-ices and Conversion Facters
1.     For cement and traded inputs, import or export parity prices are used
as shadow prices; for nontraded goods, best estimates are mada to divide them
into tradeable and nontradeable components. The shadow prices for the non-
tradeables are estimated by multiplying domestic prices with specific
conversion factors or, in some cases, by removing indirect taxes from the
domestic sales price as an approximation. The following table summarizes the
estimated conversion factors:
Table 1: Conversion Factors
Average
Financial  Economic   Conversion
rice =      Price      Factor
Coal (Rs/ton)                800         623         0.78
Power (Rs/kwh)               1.0          1.2        1.20
Packing (Rs/ton of
cement)            100          70        0.70
Raw Material                                         0.70
Investment Cost                                      0.76
Standard Conversion                                  0.80
Labor & Overhead                                     0.80
2.     Cement.  India has been a net importer of cement in most of the 1980s
but it began to export in response to the surplus situation recently. The
current FOR export price to Bangladesh is about $50/ton, which could be used
as a reference price when export option is considered. For discussion of
economic efficiency of domestic production vs. import option in the long run,
the CIF prices of imported cement at Indian ports are still the most relevant
reference value for the shadow price for cement. Based on available data of
the CIF cement prices at Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, our best estimate for the
long-term cement import price would be about $50/ton at India's eastern coast.
Transport will be adjusted to specific market to compare with specific
domestic production alternatives.
3.    Cal.  The average price of domestic coal delivered to the cement
factories is about Rs 800/ton including transport and handling costs of
Rs 300/ton. The estimated ash content of this coal is about 35% and the net
calorific value is about 3,800 kcal/kg. The CIF price of imported coal is



- 48 -
Annex 2
Page 2
about $48/ton for coal with a calorific value of 6,800 kcal/kg. Assuming the
transport cost from a port to a typical cement plant is also about Rs 300/ton,
the delivered cost of the imported coal would be Rs 1,116/ton. After
adjusting the calorific value differences, the conversion factor for coal can
be estimated as 0.78.
4.     Electricity.  The cost of purchased electricity is about Rs 1.0/kwh,
and the long-run marginal cost of electricity from the grid is reportedly
lower. However, the power shortage for the cement industry suggests that the
economic cost of power may be much higher. The higher cost is indicated as
the industry is willing to pay Rs 2.0/kwh to produce electricity from captive
generation facilities. Currently, the industry produces about 15% of its
power requirement from captive power plants. Therefore, a somewhat arbitrary
higher conversion factor of 1.20 is assumed for purchased electricity.
5.     Packaging Materials.  Per the Ministry of Textiles' Order May 29, 1987
and the Jute Packaging Materials Rule 1987, the cement industry is required to
pack 70% of total production in jute packaging material. If compulsory use of
Jute bags is removed, the packaging cost can be reduced, according to
estimates from cement manufacturers, from Rs 100/ton of cement to no more than
Rn 70/ton.
6.     Raw Materials. Limestone is the most important raw material. Based on
available data from four cement plants, the total cost of limestone is about
Rn 40/ton, while royalties and taxes included are about Rs 12/ton. Therefore,
the conversion factor for limestone, which can be roughly estimated as ratio
of delivered cost excluding taxes and royalties over the delivered cost, is
calculated as 0.7. This conversion factor is applied for all raw material as
an approximation.
7.      Standard Conversion Factor. The standard conversion factor of 0.8 is
assumed based on the current assessment of the value of the Indian rupee
against freely exchanged currencies.
8.       Labor and Overheads. The standard conversion factor of 0.8 is
assumed as the conversion factor for labor.
9.       Capital  Cost. Equipment, machinery and structural steel (EMS) costs
account for about 50% of total project costs. Based on experience in the
First Cement Project, imports (including indirect imports) account for about
30% of the EKS. For imported goods, total duties and taxes are about 50% of
the delivered cost under normal conditions. For domestic goods (which are
competitive, as demonstrated in ICB procurement), an estimated conversion
factor of 0.8 is used to eliminate indirect taxes. For civil works and other
costs, the standard conversion factor would be applicable. Therefore, the
conversion factor for capital cost is estimated as 0.76 as a weighted average
of conversion factors of major investment project components. The calculation
for this weighted average is shown in Table 2:

10.        The annualized capital cost can be calculated assuming that the
economic life of a typical cement plant is 20 years and the cost of capital in
India is 12%.

Prosection of Cement Production
1.    Table 1 summarizes projected cement production from existing production
capacities and capacity expansions already under implementation in September
1989. The following assumptions are used in the projections: (a) capacities of
cement units that are closed and permanently suspended production are excluded;
(b) according to DCCI information, capacity will increase 3.5 million tons in
FY90 and 2.9 million tons in FY91; (c) assumption on capacity utilization rates:
(i) non-sick, pre-82 units: 85%; (ii) sick units: 60%; and (iii) post-82 units:
80% in FY90, 85% in FY91 and 90% beyond FY92, after their third year of
production.

2.    Table 2 sumarizes the potential new capacities, based on project proposals
and loan applications received at IDBI and ICICI and other indication of
investment. The productions from these new projects are projected as 70%, 80%
and 90% of the proposed installed capacity for the first, second and third years
of operation, respectively. The incremental capacity increase from the smaller
modernization projects is assumed to be distributed evenly in four regions and
would be commissioned during FY95. Although there are other projects under
preparation such as those in Himachal Predesh by Gajarat Ambuja, and joint-sector
projects in Meghalaya and Bihar, it is unlikely that they will be in production
by 1994/95, considering major uncertainties in limestone survey and environmental
clearance.

CMENT IXNDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
Technical Assistance Component (TA)
1.          This component includes the following studies and technical
assistance programs:
2.          Studs for General Environmental Status and Pollution Control
Neasure for the Cement Industry. As part of project preparation, a Danish
team consisting of six environmental specialists visited 16 cement plants
located in Madhra Predesh and Kanatika to have a preliminary investigation of
environmental and occupational health problems. This visit concluded that a
comprehensive study will be needed and is proposed to be financed under this
project. The study would: (a) carry out in-depth study of four or five
representative plants, new, old and mini, to identify current technical and
operational problems in the cement industry in meeting the current and
possibly increasing stringent environment control requirements and will
recommend options and technical assistance for improvement; (b) identify
training needs of environmental professional and pollution control equipment
operators. Special training programs would be designed and carried out at the
selected RTCs during project implementation period; and (c) recommend options
and inputs to DCCI and other government authorities in their formulation of
the development strategy of the cement industry. The cost of the study is
estimated as US$ 400,000 and would be financed by DANIDA. Draft terms of
reference of the study has been discussed with DCCI.
3.          Technical Assistance to the Pilot Bulk Cement Transport Component.
The technical assistance programs include: (a) exposure visit by project
sponsors to bulk cement installations abroad; and (b) financing international
consultants for bulk cement market development, particularly development of
ready-mix concrete operations. The cost of the program is estimated at about
US$ 200,000 and is proposed for DANIDA financing. Draft terms of reference of
the program has been discussed with DCCI.
4.          IeAsibilitv Study for Bulk Cement ransport Based on Coastal
MBiuL=ng. Shipping of cement in bulk/bags from coastal plants, such as those
in Gajarat, by sea in specially designed vessels could offer an alternative
mode of transporting cement with savings in freight expense and also release
of limited rail rolling stock. The objectives of this study is to explore
feasibility of alternative schemes and identify possible project concepts for
implementation. The estimated cost of the study is about US$ 200,000 and is
proposed for DANIDA financing. Draft terms of reference of the study has been
discussed with DCCI.
5.          Stdfor Mini-Cement Development Strate&X. Growth of the mini
cement sector in India started in the 1970s and today it constitutes a small
portion of the cement industry (5%). Although the advantage of small plant

Annex 4
Page 2
lies primarily in its ability to capture a localized market when limestone
deposits nearby could not justify a larger plant, about 50% of current mini
cement capacity is located in Madhya Predesh and Andhra Predesh when large
plants are producing surplus cement. The mini cements which were exempt from
levy obligations lost that advantage after decontrol, large number of them are
in financial difficulties. Many mini cement plants also run into technical
and managerial problems due to lack of well trained professional staff. There
has never been a comprehensive study on this sector which consists of close to
150 plants all over the country. This proposed study would: (a) survey
current status of this sector; (b) study the technology employed and cement
quality produced; (c) recommend policy and location options for development
and restructuring of this sector; and (d) identify training needs and
recommend specialized training programs to be carried out at the selected RTCs
during project implementation period. The cost of the study is estimated as
US$ 150,000 and would be financed by the Bank loan proceeds. Draft terms of
reference of the study has been discussed with DCCI.
6.          Feasibility St   for Setting Un Coal Vasherv Or the Cement
IndustrZ. The purpose and justification of the study has been discussed in
the report Section III Para. 3.14. The study would: (a) identify and, to the
extend possible quantify, the impacts of coal quality to cement quality,
process efficiency and economic life of limestone deposits; (b) study
technical options and feasibility of the coal washing for cement industry; and
(c) propose organizational arrangements and project proposals for setting coal
washeries for the cement industry. The estimated cost of the study is about
US$150,000 and is proposed to be financed from the Bank loan proceeds. Draft
terms of reference for the study has been discussed with DCCI.
7.          Feasibilitv Study for Use of Lignite for the Cement Industry.  The
Indian cement industry relies on bituminous coal as fuel for its cement kilns.
The Indian coal has high ash content which negatively affects kiln
performance, cement quality and economical life of the limestone deposits.
DCCI desires to commission a study on the use of lignite as kiln fuel in those
areas of India where lignite can be made available on economic basis. The
study would examine factors affecting the use of lignite, including: lignite
deposits, transportation, operational consideration in the cement industry,
and financial and economic analyses. The cost of the study is estimated as
US$ 100,000 and would be financed by the Bank loan. Draft terms of reference
has been discussed with DCCI.

CENENT INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
Guideline for Preparing Environmental Imnact Assessment
for the Malor Cement Sub=roiects
I Prolect Descriition
1.    The concerns here are the elements or features of the project - cement
plant, colony, mine, transportation and other infrastructure which could
reasonably be expected to have an effect on the local environment, either
natural or human. Consideration should be given to possible emissions (air
and noise), solid and liquid waste discharges, land use, land disturbance,
population changes, demands on local utilities, services and infrastructure.
Any secondary effects resulting from the project should also be evaluated:
road improvements/additions, rails, airfields, utility lines, substations,
relocations, etc. Include any reclamation, mitigation, pollution control.
2.    Specific elements to be included:
* Area disturbed -    plant, colony, quarry(s), transport system,
utilities, any ancillary facilities, relocation
developments. (include map and table)
* Production      -     Tons per year, project life
e Materials       -     limestone, fuel, additives, explosives, power,
Required             water.  (table: quantity per annum, sources)
* Equipment       -    mining, transportation, processing, colony
(include tables and specifically identify:
emission control items, and emission producing
items)
* Air emissions  -      from mining, transforation and processing
particulate (primary and secondary point
sources) Sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, carbon
monoxide, etc.
-     quantify levels expected with proposed emission
controls operating and inoperative, estimate
outage frequency and duration.
* Waste water    -      quantity and quality of storm water drainage
discharge           from mine, plant and colony areas; waste water
treatment discharge; any other water discharge

3.    The local environment should be described in sufficient specificity and
detail that the reader can picture the site. This should provide an adequate
basis for impact identification, quantification and evaluation as to
significance. The area to be covered and the detail will vary with the
importance of the resource (and the amount or severity of impact anticipated.
This should be augmented with maps, tables, photos and references.
4.    Items to be included:
Land     -    Topography - local relief, slopes, prominent features
(Naps)         geomorphology.

resources
III Project effects
5.    Based on an analysis of all project activities the environmental effects
on each environmental resource or element should be identified and quantified
to the extent possible to determine type, severity, location and significance.
Some of these will be temporary (duration of project), others will be
permanent (remaining after the project). Some will be cumulative, interactive
or synergistic. Note that both beneficial and negative effects should be
identified. Effects include loss, degradation, conflicts, changes (in use or
type), increases in demands on local infrastructure.
IV. Review and FWAlow-up
6.    Preliminary environmental assessments were submitted by the four major
subproject sponsors at the end of February, 1990. All four followed the scope
and guidelines outlined above and were professionally done. Since the
Preliminary EIA reports were prepared within a very short time span, a member
of measurements and data were not yet available. However, these aspects would
be incorporated in the updated revisions of EIA reports. Based on the present
analysis, none of the subproject seems to have any problems in attaining
environmental compliance. Based on the consultant's review and analysis of
the reports a letter addressed to the financial institutions and the
individual subproject sponsors is being drafted. Apart from addressing
critical areas within the individual subproject the letter also provides
guidance for preparing adequate environmental assessment in areas which in
general appear to be weak, such as: operation and maintenance of pollution
control equipment, enforcement of occupational health and safety procedures,
use of indigenous species on reclaimed land, more sophisticated analysis of

storm water management in order to prevent erosion and greater input of
experienced biologists.
7.   Update EIA reports would be prepared by all major subprojects,
incorprating review comments by the Bank. The update EIA report of each major
subproject would be submitted for Bank revlew along with IDBI/ICICI appraisal
report before the Bank formally commits its financing for the subproject. The
guidelines described and review comments are expected to provide necessary
guidance for the subproject sponsors to prepare adequate update EIA reports.
