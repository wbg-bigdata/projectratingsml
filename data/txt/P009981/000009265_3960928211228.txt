MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO INDIA
FOR A CEMENT INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.    I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to India for the equivalent of $300 million to help finance a cement industry
restructuring project. The loan would be repaid over 20 years, including
5 years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate. Co-financing of
$5.8 million equivalent is expected in the form of a grant from the Danish
International Development Agency (DANIDA).
2.    Backstround.  The policy reform for the cement sector in the 1980s
comprised phased decontrol of cement pricing and distribution and relaxation
of industrial regulatory controls. This deregulation has led to impressive
growth and substantial modernization of the cement industry. Production grew
from 18 million tons in 1980 to about 43 million tons in 1988. Cement supply,
which was in severe shortage only ten years ago, has now caught up with demand
and created a competitive cement market. India now produces cement at a cost
below the landed import price and has begun limited exports to neighboring
countries. Per capita consumption of cement in India ia about 47 kg, very low
in comparison with other developing countries of similar income.  As the major
cement-consuming sectors (irrigation, power and housing) continue to expand,
there is an excellent opportunity to develop a modern and efficient cement
industry in India.
3.    In March 1989, the Government removed completely the price and
distribution controls on cement, thereby eliminating all subsidies to the
cement users in the public sector and all cross-subsidies relating to freight
equalization and differences in levy quotas among cement manufacturers. The
sust.inability of liberalization and further improvement of economic
efficiency in this sector will depend on the industry's ability to adjust,
through industrial restructuring, to the new and mo:e competitive environment.
Restructuring during the coming years will focus on three key elements:
(a) regional production canacity redistribution. Present cement production is
concentrated in the southern and western regions of India. This concentration
was caused by uneven distribution of limestone deposits and industrial
infrastructure, but the imbalance has been exacerbated by the freight-
equalization scheme, which fixed a common price for cement throughout India
irrespective of actual transport cost. Following the elimination of the
freight-equalization system, sharp regional price differentials developed
between the cement-deficit northeast regions and cement-surplus southwest
regions. There is need for additional cement capacity in northern and eastern
regions which include some of the poorest areas of the country; (b) moderni-
zation and restructuring of existing cement companies. The need for
modernization comes from strong competitive pressure and the Government's
commitment to enforcing pollution-control standards. Major modernization
schemes would also involve corporate restructuring programs, including
rationalization and training of the work force and elimination of inefficient
operations; and (c) introduction of bulk cement transRort systems and
establishing manpower training systems that are responsive to the substantial
modernization and expansion taking place in the industry.
4.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank began to work in the Indian
cement sector in 1980 with a subsector study, India--Cement Subsector Report,



- 2 -
No. 3141-IN. This atudy contributed to the policy debate that led to the
partial decontrol of the cement industry in February 1982. To support the
phased implementation of the elimination of the cement pricing and
distribution control, the Bank has provided loans for the Cement Industry
Project (Lns. 2660/2661-IN) of $200 million, which became effective on
November 10, 1986. The loans are 80% committed and are expected to be fully
committed by the time the proposed project would become effective in September
1990.
5.    Suosector restructuring strategy is at a formative stage, and the Bank
is in a position to provide substantive assistance, based on experience in
other countries, in the industrial restructuring of wet-process plants and the
mini-cement sector, industrial training and bulk cement transport. In
addition, support for the cement industry is consistent with the Bank's
lending strategy for the industrial sector. This strategy focuses on policy
reform and lowering costs of basic inputs in the economy. The success of
cement industry restructuring would encourage reform in other industries. As
discussed in detail in the Staff Appraisal Report, lessons from the first
project have been incorporated into the design of the proposed project. Bank
lending through subsector projects to the DFIs constitutes a small share of
the total resources available to them, and the relending rate for the Bank
funds is consistent with the overall DFI interest rates. The risk of causing
an allocative distortion through subsector lending is small and is more than
balanced by the catalytic role of the Bank in helping improve the efficiency
of specific subsectors through restructuring projects and other measures
contained in these subsector operations.
6.    Project Ob1ectives.  The proposed project would support the government's
policy decision of complete elimination of cement price and distribution
controls and would assist the industry in adjusting to an increasingly
coia,)etitive environment. The proposed project is expected to enhance the
industry's economic efficiency and pave the way for sustained growth to meet
increasing demand in the 1990s.
7.    Project Description.  Part A of the proposed loan would help finance,
through a line of credit to IDBI and ICICI, part of the following two
components: (a) an Industry Modernization and Restructuring component which
would finance (i) capacity expansion in the cement-deficit regions to reduce
regional demand/supply imbalances and to reduce excessive transport of cement,
and (ii) modernization and restructuring projects in existing cement companies
throughout India to reduce energy consumption, enhance operational efficiency
and improve environmental protection standards; (b) a Pilot Bulk Cement Trans-
gort component which would help establish a pilot bulk cement transport system
including loading facilities at participating cement plants, special bulk
cement rail wagons, and unloading and distribution systems at Kalamboli
Railway Terminal near Bombay. Part B of the loan would help finance part of a
Human Resource Development component which would establish demand-driven, in-
plant training systems at regional training centers (RTC), attached to
respective lead plants, for groups of cement plants having geographic
proximity. Part C of the loan would help finance part of a Technical
Assistance component which includes the following studies and technical
assistance programs: (i) a study of the general environmental status and
pollution control measures for the cement industry; (ii) technical assistance



- 3 -
for the Pilot Bulk Cement Transport component; (iil) a feasibility study for
bulk cement transport by coastal shipping; (iv) a study for mini-cement
development strategy; (v) a feasibility study for setting up coal washeries
for the cement industry; and (vi) a feasibility study for use of lignite for
the cement industry.
8.    The total cost of the project is estimated to be $736 million, with a
foreign exchange component of $110 million. A breakdown of project costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement, disbursements, and the disbursements schedule are presented in
Schedule B. A timetable of key prcject processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8422-IN, dated April 10, 1990, is being
distributed separately.
9.   Agreed Actions. For Part  of the Loan, GOI has agreed to relend
$298 million of the proceeds of the Bank loan to IDBI and ICICI, in equal
proportions, in rupees at a rate of 12 percent p.a., repayable over 20 years
including 5 years of grace, for on-lending to subproject borrowers at the
DFIs' term lending rate, currently 14 percent p.a. An understanding was also
reached that GOI would review the DFIs' term lending rate from time to time in
relation to inflation and other domestic and international market conditions
and adjust this rate as necessary to ensure that the on-lending rate on new
subloans will remain positive in real terms, reflect market conditions and
provide a reasonable spread to the DFIs. For Part B of the loan, GO has
agreed: (i) to pass on $1.6 million of the proceeds of the Bank loan as
budgetary allocations through DCCI to finance part of the Human Resource
Development component; (ii) through DCCI, to enter into Memoranda of Under-
standing (NOU) acceptable to the Bank with selected cement companies for the
establisbment of RTCs and to ensure that the RTCs operate effectively and
efficiently in accordance with agreed operating guidelines; (iii) to establish
a Steering Committee chaired by DCCI; and (iv) to position a Program
Coordinator by December 31, 1990 to assist implementation of the Human
Resource Development component. For Part C of the loan, GOI has agreed:
(i) to pass on $400,000 of the loan as budgetary allocations to DCCI to
finance part of the Technical Assistance component in accordance with the
terms of references acceptable to the Bank, and (ii) to discuss the results
and follow-up actions of the assisted studies with the Bank during project
implementation.
10.   IDBI and ICICI have agreed to (a) maintain internal debt:equity and
debt-service coverage ratios acceptable to the Bank; (b) adopt subproject and
participating company criteria including that for adequate economic and
financial rates of return; and (c) adopt adequate environmental assessment
requirements and review procedures, and employ environmental consultants
whenever in-house expertise at IDBI and ICICI is not adequate for subproject
appraisal. For subprojects costing over $20 million, the Bank's approval of
the IDBI or ICICI appraisal report and the Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) would be required before a subloan commitment is made. IDBI and ICICI
would seek assurance from subproject borrowers that all subprojects comply
with necessary requirements to protect the environment.
11.  The Government's entering into Subsidiary Loan Agreements with IDBI and
ICICI would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. The effect-



- 4 -
iveness of the Financing Agreement between the Government and DANIDA, and the
establishment of the Steering Committee would be conditions of disbursement of
the Human Resource Development component.
12.  Bjngsft.  The proposed project would add about 5 million tpy production
capacity in cement-deficit regions, bring significant savings in cement
transport costs and reduce the cost of cement in some of the poorest regions
of the country. The project would support modernization and restructuring of
existing cement companies, reduction in energy and other productLon costs, and
improvement in the economic efficiency of operations. The project would also
support installation of pollution control equipment, ensure adequate
environmental assessment of subprojects, finance a study for subsectoral
environmental protection and pollution controls, and support productive use of
slag, a waste product of steel plants, which must be disposed of in an
ecologically acceptable manner. Financing the pilot bulk cement transport
project would pave the way for significant long-term efficiency improvement in
the cement distribution system and promote productivity increases in the
construction industry. The project would also finance training programs for
operating personnel and environmental professionals in much-needed skill
categories.
13.  Rlsks.  No unusual technical risks would in-Ive in construction and
modernization of cement plants under the Industry odervization and Restruc-
turing component. Introducing a bulk cemont transport system requires the
development of a new marketing and distribution approach and involves many
players with substantial investments: it is therefore inherently riskf.
Measures that have been designed to miniw±ze the risk are provision of limited
bagging facilities at the unloading terminal, arrangements for phased
implementation, and provision of further DANDA-financed technical assistance
for market development of bulk cement. Implementation of the Human Rt source
Development component is likely to be slow due to the innovative nats -a of the
approach and the need to have groups of cement plants joining in a .  aon
effort. The Memorandum of Understanding signed between DCCI and tht ead
plant's company of each RTC would provide assurances that the lead plants'
companies would commit their financial and managerial resources to training
activities and that the RTCs would offer training services to other .--ants for
appropriate fees. DANIDA has also agreed to finance consultants for implemen-
tation assistance for this component.
14.  Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
