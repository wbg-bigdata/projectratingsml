PANAMA - HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Republic of Panama.
Amount:                US$12 million equivalent.
Terms:                 15 years, including 3 years of grace, with
interest at 7.5 percent per annum.
Project Description:  The project objective is to strengthen the maintenance
organization, methods and personnel of the Ministry of
Public Works (MOP) through the implementation of a
Four-Year Maintenance Program (1979-82) which will cover
the entire highway network of Panama (9,200 km), from
1979 onward. The project consists of:
(i) acquisition of (a) new maintenance equipment and
spare parts; (b) spare parts to overhaul existing
equipment; (c) maintenance workshop tools and
equipment; and
(ii) consulting services to (a) strengthen the Ministry
of Public Works' capability to plan, implement and
supervise annual road maintenance programs;
(b) upgrade the management of MOP's equipment
fleet and assist in the program to overhaul and
purchase equipment; (c) determine training require-
ments and undertake training for maintenance
personnel; and (d) identify priority road
rehabilitation and strengthening works.
The risks associated with the project are considered
average. Every effort has been made in the preparation
of the Four-Year Maintenance Program to develop a
coherent framework for upgrading highway maintenance
and restoring the fleet to an acceptable level of
effectiveness. Direct responsibility of MOP and
Ministry of Planning officials for project preparation
built up institutional commitments. The adequate
funding of operating expenditures has been thoroughly
reviewed and is the object of specific commitments.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
FOR A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Panama for the equivalent of US$12 million to help
finance a road maintenance project. The loan would have a term of 15 years,
including three years of grace, with interest at 7.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited the country in September/October 1975.
An "Updating Report on the Economy of Panama" (1066a-PAN) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on May 17, 1976. An economic mission now scheduled
for June. 1978 will review the effect of the recently ratified Panama Canal
treaties on Panama's economy as well as the required revisions in the Govern-
ment's policies and expenditures. This report does not contain the usual
economic projections which will be prepared by the forthcoming economic
mission. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        In the 1960's the Panamanian economy expanded rapidly with limited
Government participation and an efficient use of investment. World trade
flourished and Panama was able to benefit from its unique geographic location
owing to liberal trade legislation, free use of the United States dollar as
the domestic currency, and the Colon Free Zone. The domestic market offered
opportunities for small-scale industrialization and there still was much
accessible virgin land that could be brought under production. Beginning in
1969, the Government began to rapidly expand public services to poorer urban
and rural citizens; it undertook significant agrarian reform and began a major
public expenditure program designed to improve the public infrastructure.
These programs had a major effect on the educational and health levels of
Panamanian citizens, as well as improving income distribution. In the last
fifteen years, infant mortality was reduced from 58 to 33 per thousand live
births, life expectancy at birth rose from 60.9 to 66.5 years, and the primary
school enrollment ratio rose by 25 percent.
4.        Economic growth, however, slowed in the 1970's.  Opportunities for
import substitution decreased and further expansion of agriculture required
increasing amounts of capital and specialized manpower, whether to improve
yields and cropping patterns or to extend the frontier to new, less accessible
lands. The recession which affected world trade in 1974-75 lowered the growth
of the export-oriented service sector, and the recovery since then has been
slow. Panama's open economy was also severely hit by the sharp rise in the
cost of imports, particularly fuels. Net of exports of refined petroleum
products, Panama's petroleum import bill rose from 4 percent of merchandise
imports to 12 percent between 1973 and 1977. Finally, these unfavorable
developments were compounded by the end of a private construction boom in high
income housing and office buildings, and by a severe drought in 1976. As a
result, the rate of GDP growth, which had averaged 8 percent per year in



-2-
1959-71, fell steadily to 0.6 percent in 1975, was nil in 1976, and is esti-
mated to have been only 1.6 percent in 1977. This prolonged slowdown is
particularly serious because the working-age population is growing at an
annual rate of over 3 percent. Although the recorded rate of open unemploy-
ment has continued to fluctuate around 7 percent during 1975-77, unofficial
estimates of unemployment, which include workers who abandoned the search
for a job, suggest an increase from 7.5 percent in 1972 to 13-15 percent
in 1977.
5.        The retrenchment of private investment which occurred in 1974-77
has reflected, in addition to a response to the recession, concern that
the implementation of the 1972 Labor Code may have led to increased absenteeism
and reduced productivity. Private investment has also been held back by what
was perceived to be slow progress in the negotiations with the United States
on a new Panama Canal Treaty. On balance, private investment fell from 21.8
percent of GDP in 1971 to 14 percent in 1975, and is estimated to have dropped
further to 11.3 percent in 1977.
6.        The Government has responded to the slackening of economic growth
by formulating a short-term program to reactivate the economy and a longer
term development strategy, embodied in the National Development Plan, 1976-80.
The Government's short-term program includes (a) fiscal incentives equivalent
to 20 percent of value added for non-traditional exports; (b) a scheme to
guarantee commercial bank mortgage loans for low and middle-income housing and
a facility to rediscount these loans after eight years; (c) lowering of commer-
cial banks' capital and reserve requirements; (d) fiscal incentives to promote
investment, including accelerated depreciation, investment credits and income
tax exoneration for reinvested corporate profits; and (e) special income tax
deductions for firms hiring additional low-income workers. Furthermore, the
Government has recently modified the Labor Code, making its provisions more
flexible. Existing collective labor contracts were extended for two years in
1977; during this period there are to be no collective demands for new
benefits and labor conflicts will be resolved through compulsory arbitration.
7.        The Government sought to offset the drop in private investment by
increasing public investment sharply. As a result, aggregate investment
fluctuated around 28 percent of GDP during 1971-76 in spite of the sharp drop
in private investment, as public investment increased from 6 percent of GDP in
1971 to 14 percent in 1975 and peaked at almost 16 percent of GDP in 1976.
Partly due to the completion of several large projects, public investment
dropped to about 13.5 percent of GDP in 1977. However, the volume of public
investment included in the plan for 1976-80 is twice as large in real terms as
in the 1971-75 period. It includes a number of large projects both in infra-
structure and directly productive sectors, aimed at taking advantage of the
country's traditional role in international trade -- including expansion
of the industrial and commercial complex in the Colon Free Zone -- and at
developing more intensively the country's natural resources, including the
hydroelectric potential, large copper deposits, and agriculture. The program
should also open up new opportunities for the private sector and further
improve income distribution through improved infrastructure and social services



- 3 -
for the lower income groups and through credit and technical assistance for
small-scale farmers. The priorities of the public investment program are
sound, although the timing of outlays may have to be stretched out to allow
for administrative, financial and market constraints.
8.        Following the major expansion in social and economic programs in 1968,
total public sector outlays have risen steadily since then. The authorities
have made efforts to raise the level of public sector savings to finance these
programs. Several new taxes were adopted during the past few years, tax
administration improved and the growth of current outlays was restrained.
Nonetheless, public savings have not kept pace with investment outlays, and
the Government has relied increasingly on external borrowing, much of it from
commercial banks. As of December 1977, the disbursed public debt amounted to
US$1.3 billion, more than triple that of five years earlier.
9.        As a result of the high level of external debt, a large proportion
of which is due to commercial private banks (62 percent of total public debt
in 1977), the debt service obligations of the public sector have increased at
a faster rate than public savings. (The conventional ratio of debt service to
export earnings is not a meaningful indicator of creditworthiness in Panama
where the US dollar is accepted as the domestic currency.) The Government has
so far been readily able to refinance its commercial debt, but realizes that
measures to ensure that public savings grow faster than debt service obliga-
tions are required to strengthen the public sector's creditworthiness. Thus,
it has recently taken further important steps to strengthen the Central Govern-
ment revenue structure by making it more responsive to economic growth; this
includes the introduction of a 5 percent value-added sales tax, increased
taxes on beer, cigarettes, liquor, gasoline, hotel services and on dividends.
Tax administration has been tightened and the growth of current outlays has
been further restrained. In 1977 -- a recessionary year -- Central Government
receipts as a ratio to GDP rose over 1.5 percent. Furthermore, electric power
rates were raised starting in January 1977, yielding an 18 percent increase in
revenues during the year. More increases are taking place. Telephone rates
have been doubled and water rates raised by 30 percent. These increases are
ultimately expected to reduce the need for Central Government transfers to
help finance the investments of the utilities entities. Unfortunately, low
sugar prices have led to substantial losses by the Government-owned sugar
enterprise, and although the rest of the public sector was able to raise its
public savings from virtually nil in 1976 to 2 percent of GDP in 1977, total
public savings (including the sugar enterprise) is estimated at less than I
percent of GPD in 1977. The Government intends to carry out its public
investment program with flexibility and to adapt the timing of individual
projects to its financial position, but further measures to raise public
savings will be needed. The scope and size of such measures cannot, however,
be assesed until the fiscal impact of the new Canal Treaty has been
determined. Panama's most recent first tranche stand-by with the IMF
expired in April 1978. The overall goals of the stand-by were met. Another
stand-by is being negotiated.
10.       The Government has also taken measures to minimize the adverse
effects of the recession on the lower income strata of the population with
special emphasis on the extension of health and education services to the



-4-
rural population. In general, as noted earlier, it has stepped up public
investment and has formulated an ambitious investment program. However, the
Government's ability to pursue anticyclical policies is limited by the need
for fiscal prudence. In this respect, it is noteworthy that serious efforts
are being made to raise public sector savings at a time when both recession
and inflation add to the pressures to spend, and make tax and utility rate
increases difficult. On the basis of recent performance, Panama is credit-
worthy for lending on conventional terms, provided that the authorities
continue to take the measures required to ensure that the growth of public
borrowing remains manageable. In particular, in view of the high level and
relatively unfavorable structure of the public sector debt, Panama should make
a special effort to obtain external loans on better than commercial terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
11.       The Bank has to date made fifteen loans to Panama totalling US$211.6
million. Of these, eight loans for US$83.4 million, are fully disbursed (two
for roads totalling US$13 million; one for an airport project for US$20
million; three for agriculture totalling US$4.4 million, and two for power for
US$46 million). Ongoing projects include two livestock credit projects; a
power transmission project and a power generation and transmission project;
a fishing port project; a water supply and sewerage project; and a fisheries
project. Execution of Bank-financed projects has, on the whole, been satis-
factory, although delays and cost overruns occurred particularly with respect
to the Tocumen Airport and the Second and Third Power Projects. The causes of
delay have been overcome and the overruns have been financed with the assistance
of long term loans from the Venezuelan Investment Fund.
12.       IFC has made two investments in Panama.  The first was a commitment
in 1971 to acquire US$0.3 million of equity in the Corporacion de Desarrollo
Hotelero S.A. and to lend to the Corporacion US$1.2 million to build a new
international hotel. This project was satisfactorily completed and the hotel
is open to business. The second is a commitment approved by the Executive
Directors in December 1977 to lend US$2.6 million and acquire US$1.2 million
in equity in Vidrios de Panama, S.A., a glass factory. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of March 31, 1978,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Bank lending to Panama is designed to support the Government's devel-
opment strategy (embodied in the 1976-1980 National Plan) particularly as
regards the further development of Panama's service industries and the diversi-
fication of production and exports. Specifically, the Bank assists those
sectors in which it can make a special contribution in terms of (i) developing
policies and institutions; (ii) removing infrastructure bottlenecks, and
(iii) better utilizing the country's natural resources. The highway mainte-
nance project, now under consideration, meets these criteria and is in line
with the Government's objective of giving priority to maintaining its reason-
ably well-developed highway network. The Bank would directly assist the
Ministry of Public Works (MOP) in strengthening its organization which has



become more oriented towards maintenance activities over the years, as the
highway network expanded. A strengthened maintenance capability would prevent
the deterioration of the road network which is Panama's most important trans-
port mode. We also expect to continue supporting the government's program of
expanding the water supply and sewerage facilities in the fast-growing urban
areas, as well as its electrification program. In the directly productive
sectors, we plan to diversify the scope of our agricultural credit operations
by assisting small producers of some key cash crops. We are also considering
a possible industrial credit operation.
14.       The principal sources of official external financing to Panama in
the past are summarized as follows:

agricultural machinery).
/2   Including a $60 million grant from the U.S. Government for
completion of the Darien Gap portion of the Pan-American Highway.
15.       Both the USAID and the IDB have lent heavily for agriculture and for
social services (including family planning in the case of USAID). Past lending
patterns are likely to persist as the Government prefers to borrow on conces-
sionary terms for those sectors, while utilizing assistance received on
harder terms for projects which are expected to result in more immediate
economic benefits. In addition to agriculture and social services, the IDB
is financing road construction and tourism, and participated with the Bank in
the financing of the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project.



-6-
16.       The Bank's share of Panama's publicly guaranteed external debt out-
standing and disbursed was 7.4 percent at the end of 1977 and the Bank's
share of public external debt service was 5 percent. These percentages are
expected to drop slightly in the 1980's.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
The Transport System
17.       Panama, a long, narrow country, is divided lengthwise by a mountain
range and across by the Panama Canal. As a result, the country has developed
along two main axes: one along the Canal and the other along the lands on the
Pacific Coast, particularly in the western part of the country. To the east
of the Canal lies the relatively unexplored region of the Darien. Except
for the sparsely populated Caribbean coast and the Darien where air travel and
coastal shipping are the only means of transportation, Panama's domestic
traffic is basically moved over highways (95 percent of all freight and 99
percent of passengers). The most important international transport facilities,
in addition to the Panama Canal itself, are the Tocumen International Airport
serving Panama City, the ports on the Canal, and the Pan-American Highway.
18.       The transport system of Panama is broadly adequate for the economic
activity of the more advanced regions. Aside from some expansion of secondary
and feeder roads, which is being carried out under ongoing programs, the main
priority is the maintenance of the existing highway system. Its deterioration,
for lack of adequate maintenance, would create a major bottleneck to trade and
economic growth. The project would address the need to expand and upgrade
maintenance operations.
Transport Planning and Coordination
19.       The Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy (MPPE) is in charge of
sectoral planning through its Department of Projects and Sectoral Planning.
The primary functions of this Department are the preparation of integrated
annual operating and investment budgets for the transport sector. Sectoral
planning began in the mid-seventies when the UNDP-financed National Transport
Survey, for which the Bank served as Executing Agency, was completed. The
National Development Plan for 1976-80 incorporates many of its recommendations.
In preparing sectoral plans, MPPE coordinates with the Directorate of Civil
Aviation (DAC), which is directly responsible for airport planning and con-
struction, the National Port Authority (APN) which is in charge of ports
planning and construction and the Ministry of Public Works (MOP), which is in
charge of highway planning and construction. The division of responsibilities
among agencies has not resulted in costly misallocation of resources since
domestic transport is dominated by the highway mode, for which the
recommendations of the National Transport Survey are an effective planning
tool. Adequate programming of highway maintenance and rehabilitation, a key
task ahead, will be aided by the technical assistance included in the project.



-7-
Ports
20.       About 95 percent of Panama's international dry cargo traffic is
handled by ports. Panama has three main ports (Almirante, Armuelles and Bahia
de las Minas), in addition to the ports of Cristobal and Balboa on the Canal.
The three main ports handle the bulk of the country's exports.  Puerto Armuelles
and Almirante primarily handle bananas (400,000 tons per year each). Bahia de
las Minas, basically a petroleum terminal, also handles the fast-growing
roll-on/roll-off general cargo traffic. The Canal ports of Cristobal and
Balboa have dual functions, i.e., as ports for vessels in transit through the
Canal and as ports of entry to Panama: they handle about 65 percent of the
country's dry cargo imports. At present, port capacity is not a constraint to
the economy. Panama is also developing a fishing port at Vacamonte with finan-
cial support from the Bank (US$24.0 million; Loan 1114-PAN, of April 1975).
This US$42.6 million port will be Panama's first deepwater fishing port.
Air Transport
21.       Over the last few years, air transport growth has been concentrated
in a few major economic and tourist centers where it is competitive. Tocumen,
which serves Panama City, is the only airport equipped to handle international
traffic, now of the order of 720,000 passengers per year. A US$70 million
expansion program for the airport, partly financed by a US$20 million Bank
loan, has now been completed (Loan 783-PAN of July 1971). This expansion will
allow Panama to exploit more fully its strategic location. Twelve foreign
carriers are presently operating combined passenger and cargo services in
Tocumen, and six carriers offer all cargo services. There are two Panamanian
carriers in the international business: Air Panama and Compania Panamena de
Aviacion (COPA), both private corporations. COPA, the only medium-sized
carrier in Panama, operates in the domestic market. The rest of the air
transport industry -- which is very competitive -- is in the hands of light
aircraft operators.
Railways
22.       Unlike air transport, railways, with the exception of the Panama
City-Colon line, were never an alternative to highways in Panama. Two of the
three railway companies operating are specialized systems: one a 300 km
banana plantation railway carrying 750,000 tons of bananas (Chiriqui Land
Company) and the other a complement to the Panama Canal (Panama Canal Railway),
which is the most important railway in the country. It carries over one
million passengers and one-quarter million tons per year on its 76 km, well-
maintained transisthmic run between Panama City and Colon. The third system,
in the western province of Chiriqui (Chiriqui National Railway - FNC), is a
government-owned railway with diminishing traffic and only 30 km of main line
left in operation. Because an adequate highway network exists as an alter-
native to the railway, and in view of its poor operating ratio, the Government
intends to abandon operation of FNC in the future.

Highways and Road Transport
23.       Distances between developed regions are relatively short in Panama:
the longest one, along the Pan American Highway west of Panama City to the
Costa Rican border, is about 480 km. The Pan American Highway, a paved road
connecting directly or through branch routes with most of the developed areas
of the country, constitutes the backbone road of the system. The longest
access road to the Pan American Highway, located in the widest part of the
country, is about 110 km. Given these short distances and the many scattered
low-volume production centers, road transport is, with very few exceptions,
the most adequate mode of transportation.
24.       Panama's highway network totals some 7,800 km of which about 2,500
km are paved, 2,600 km have gravel surfacing and 2,700 km are earth roads.
The whole system grew by 17 percent since 1967. Road development has been
concentrated in the last decade on paving and improving the roads carrying the
heaviest traffic, and in extending the system which now links the most populated
areas of the country. With the main network almost completed, increasing
emphasis is being given to construction of rural roads for which substantial
investments are being made in support of the Government's agrarian programs.
The IDB and the USAID are providing financing in this area. The main network
is basically adequate in coverage and design, but its poor condition, due to
insufficient maintenance, is becoming a bottleneck in the continued expansion
of economic activities. An inventory carried out in 1976 by MOP showed that
some 5,100 km (66 percent) of the network are inadequately maintained. The
proposed road maintenance program is designed to tackle this deficiency, and
to prepare a country-wide highway rehabilitation and strengthening program.
25.       Road transport developed with the improvement and extension of the
highway network. The main traffic flows are found along the Pan-American
Highway. Among the freight carriers, the international traffic between Central
America and Panamanian ports using semitrailers, roll-on/ roll-off services
and containers constitutes the most modern and sophisticated segment of the
industry. The largest single commodities moved by highway are petroleum
products (about 1.2 million tons per year) and construction materials and
cement (about 1.0 million tons per year). These products are usually carried
by trucking companies. Beer and soft drinks also account for important
flows, and are usually carried by single-vehicle operators. Finally, there is
the large flow of agricultural products (grain, cereals, fruits and sugar)
transported mostly by single vehicle operators or farm-owned vehicles. Two
distinct types of passenger service are offered: long distance (including
international) by the well-established companies and local services by owner-
operators. Single-vehicle owners account for about 70 percent of the trucking
fleet but only 30 percent of the capacity. Although single-vehicle owners
generally operate less efficient trucks, they are often ready to operate
with lower profit margins, and in fact, compete actively with one another and
with trucking companies. They contribute to keep the industry competitive and
responsive to demand. Under these conditions, savings in vehicle operating
costs due to improved road conditions would, within a relatively short time,
be passed on to users. Better road conditions would also favor the use of
more modern and efficient trucks.



-9-
26.       Government intervention in the operation of road freight transport
has been minimal. Truckers operate freely over routes that they select, but
under the obligations of annual registration and vehicle inspection. Passenger
road carriers, however, have to request a license to operate a route. Rates
and tariffs for the road transport of freight are not regulated in Panama
except for petroleum products. Rates for passenger traffic are controlled.
The Price Regulation Office, under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, is
responsible for determination of the rates, which are generally enforced
effectively. Vehicle weights and dimensions were adequately regulated by Law
23 of January 1967. However, in 1974, the Government, in the face of the
economic recession which was affecting the truckers, ordered suspension of
enforcement of Law 23. As a result, the regulation is not being enforced and
overloading has become a practice among certain truckers. MOP is adequately
equipped for the implementation of the law: it has four weighing stations and
crews at these stations continue to weigh truckers on a routine basis. In
preparation for the re-introduction of the Law, MOP is developing an educational
campaign for road users, emphasizing the law's advantages. The Government has
confirmed that it will resume enforcement of the vehicle weight regulations by
June 30, 1979, in accordance with a timetable to be agreed with the Bank prior
to effectiveness of the proposed loan (Sections 4.03 and 6.01(a) of the Loan
Agreement).
Highway Organization and Financing
27.       MOP is responsible for practically all the highway work in the
country. MOP now has five directorates: Construction (DNC); Maintenance (DNM),
Pan American Highway (PAH); Equipment (DINE), and the National Geographic
Institute. DINE was established in early 1978 in response to the need for
improved control over equipment. Highway planning is carried out by a Depart-
ment attached to the office of the Minister. Although the present organiza-
tional structure is rational, the functions and responsibilities of the
directorates have not yet been enacted into an appropriate regulation. A law
formalizing the new organizational structure has been drafted, and is now under
consideration for approval by the national legislative body. The proposed law
would define the division of responsibilities within the different units of
the Ministry and between the Ministry and other agencies, and it would be the
basis for future improvements in the organization and management of MOP. The
enactment of legislation formalizing the administrative organization of MOP
would be a condition for loan effectiveness (Section 6.01(b) of the Loan
Agreement).
28.       Highway expenditures are financed through the general government
budget under MOP allocations. During 1970-1977, total highway expenditures,
averaged about US$35 million per year. Estimated contributions from road user
charges have, on the average, covered all maintenance and administration expen-
ditures as well as about 70 percent of other outlays, mostly for construction.
The main sources of external financing were the IDB and the U.S. Government.
It is estimated that, over the next four years, proceeds from road user
charges would be adequate to support planned expenditures for maintenance as
well as future outlays for construction.



- 10 -
Highway Maintenance
29.       Highway maintenance is the responsibility of the National Directorate
of Maintenance (DNM), which operates through eight provincial directorates.
The nature and scope of maintenance operations are interpreted differently
throughout DNM, and the provincial directorates carry out, under maintenance,
a variety of operations, partly because DNM has not established a clear dividing
line between highway improvements, reconstruction and maintenance. Levels of
expenditures, which control maintenance standards, have not been determined on
the basis of standard schedules of operations, with the result that resources
intended for maintenance are often diverted to other activities, mainly road
construction and improvement. The need to improve DNM's organization has been
recognized by MOP, which is taking appropriate measures (paragraph 39).
30.       The existing vehicle and equipment fleet of nearly 1,900 units is aging
and in poor condition. The average age of the fleet is eight years, and a pre-
liminary assessment made by MOP indicates that only 33 percent of the units are
in good working condition, 45 percent are out of order or in need of overhaul,
and the remaining 22 percent are not salvageable. In addition, the composition
of the fleet is inadequate: many of the units inherited from the Directorate
of Construction of the Pan American Highway and the old Department of Roads,
Airports and Ports are heavy equipment suitable only for construction. The
fleet is managed by a committee composed of the five directors of MOP. The
Director of DINE is the Executive Secetary of this committee, and controls
MOP's equipment budget. The lack of routine budgetary allocations for spare
parts and of programmed preventive maintenance, together with the absence of a
systematic replacement program for the fleet explains its present condition.
The project would renew the fleet, adjust its composition and carry out over-
haul of salvageable units and scrapping of obsolete ones.
Past Bank Assistance for Transport
31.       The Bank's first involvement in the transport sector dates back to
the 1950's. The First Highway Project (US$5.9 million, Loan 123-PAN of
July 1955) was for highway rehabilitation, and the Second Highway Project
(US$7.2 million, Loan 264-PAN of August 1960) was for feeder roads. Per-
formance under these two projects was not fully satisfactory, primarily as
a result of' the weakness of the now extinguished Department of Roads, Airports
and Ports, the agency responsible for their execution. Bank involvement
in the transport sector was renewed with the financing of the modernization
of the Tocumen International Airport in 1971. In 1972, the Bank helped to
prepare terms of reference for the UNDP-financed National Transport Survey,
for which the Bank acted as executing agency. The survey was completed in
1975. In 1975, the Bank made a loan for the construction of a fishing port at
Punta Vacamonte. The present project would re-establish the working relation-
ship between MOP and the Bank.

PART IV--THE PROJECT
32.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report Highway Maintenance
Project" (No. 1891a-PAN) is being distributed separately. A Loan and Project
Summary is found at the front of this report, and Supplementary Project
Data is given in Annex III. The project was prepared by MOP with the assis-
tance of MPPE and the Bank during June 1976-October 1977 and was appraised in
October/November 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington from March 27
to 31, 1978. The Government was represented by a delegation led by Messrs.
Orlando Caicedo, Chief Planner, Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy and
Raul Cisneros, Chief, Planning Department, Ministry of Public Works.
Project ObJectives and Scope
33.       The main objective of the proposed project is to enable MOP to
implement an adequate highway maintenance program over the four-year period
1979-1982. To this end, the project would: (a) strengthen MOP's organization
responsible for highway maintenance and improve its methods and procedures to
ensure effective planning, scheduling, directing and control of maintenance
operations; (b) ensure that road maintenance activities are supported by
adequate vehicles and equipment; and (c) upgrade, through training, DNM
manpower at all levels.
34.       DNM has recognized since 1974 the need to develop an efficient
highway maintenance program based on adequate management policies. MOP's
Four-Year Highway Maintenance Program covering the period 1979-1982 was
prepared by MOP's Department of Planning and by DNM. Its adoption was
confirmed by the Government by letter to the Bank of March 15, 1978. The
Program establishes the economically efficient levels of maintenance by road
type and traffic level; resource requirements, and procedures for im-
plementation and control. It covers the entire 9,200 km road network of
Panama. The project would build up within MOP the necessary capacity to carry
out annually the schedules of maintenance activities prescribed under the
agreed Highway Maintenance Program. The Program has not addressed directly
the problem of rehabilitation. A number of roads have deteriorated to a point
where they would need rehabilitation before being amenable to normal main-
tenance. Other roads have pavements with insufficient structural strength to
sustain present traffic volumes and need strengthening. Rehabilitation and
strengthening works involve large expenditures requiring detailed identi-
fication and preparation. MOP through its Department of Planning and DNC
would identify a five-year program for road rehabilitation and strengthening
with technical assistance provided under the project (Section 4.04 of the
Loan Agreement). The schedule for the preparation of the program has been
agreed upon with the Government.



- 12 -
ProJect Description and Requirements
35.       The project consists of:
(i) Equipment
(a) acquisition of new maintenance equipment to meet the
requirements of the Four-Year Highway Maintenance
Program;
(b) acquisition of spare parts for new units to build up an
inventory and introduce preventive maintenance practices;
(c) acquisition of spare parts for overhauls of existing salvage-
able units; and
(d) acquisition of workshop tools and equipment for improvement
of maintenance workshops.
(ii) Technical Assistance
-    consulting services to:  (a) strengthen DNM's technical and
managerial capabilities to plan, implement and supervise annual
road maintenance programs; (b) upgrade the management of MOP's
equipment fleet and assist in the overhaul and procurement
programs; (c) determine MOP's training requirements and undertake
training for maintenance personnel, and (d) identify priority
road rehabilitation and strengthening works.
36.       A major component of the proposed project would be to replace and
overhaul existing equipment and to incorporate new units as necessary to
enable DNM to carry out the proposed maintenance program. It is estimated
that some 420 new equipment units would be added to the fleet and about 400
existing units overhauled. Through the technical assistance component, the
project would introduce systematic practices for preventive maintenance of
equipment. In addition to parts necessary for overhaul of salvageable units,
the project would also provide the necessary spare parts to set up stocks.
The Government has agreed that MOP would (i) develop, and after consultation
with the Bank adopt, no later than the end of 1979, procedures for the
systematic renewal of maintenance equipment and scrapping of obsolete units
and (ii) develop data to monitor and evaluate the availability of its equipment
fleet, starting in 1979 (Section 3.08 of the Loan Agreement).
37.       Before undertaking purchase of spare parts for new equipment, it
is essential to separate spares from other materials, maintain an up-to-date
inventory of all spares held, and dispose of obsolete spares. Under the
project, MOP, with the assistance of consultants, would improve its practices
for purchasing and warehousing of spare parts. The Government has agreed that
MOP would carry out the following corrective measures before disbursements are
made for the spare parts for new equipment: (i) separation of construction
stock of spare parts from materials; and (ii) updating of spare parts inventory
and the appropriate disposition of obsolete stock (Schedule 1, para. 4 of the
Loan Agreement).



- 13 -
Implementation
38.       To improve budgeting practices and in order to establish a more
rigorous definition of maintenance activities, the Government has agreed that
MOP would: (i) adopt, no later than the end of 1978, operational procedures
that will differentiate maintenance activities from improvement and
rehabilitation; (ii) separate, starting in 1979, the highway maintenance
budget from other activities of DNM; and (iii) segregate the MOP highway
maintenance budget into administration and labor, materials, fuel and
lubricants, equipment acquisition and spare parts (Section 3.06 of the Loan
Agreement).
39.       Implementation of the project is expected to take about four years
(1979-1982). Project execution would be the responsibility of MOP, through
DNM and DINE. To strengthen the management of MOP's Maintenance operations,
the Government has agreed to appoint two maintenance engineers and a fleet
manager (Section 3.07 of the Loan Agreement). The two new maintenance engineers
and fleet manager positions would be permanent positions within MOP to be
filled by Panamanian personnel. The two engineers would (i) review and update
the highway maintenance program; and (ii) assist in the organization, super-
vision and control of the program and in the preparation of progress reports
for management purposes and budgetary control. The fleet manager would
coordinate the administration and handling of the equipment fleet. Appointment
of the fleet manager and of one of the maintenance engineers is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan (Section 6.01(c) of the Loan Agreement).
40.       The above-referred maintenance engineers and fleet manager would
be the principal Panamanian counterparts to the technical assistance consult-
ants. The consultants, who would work in Panama for four years, would assist
in the planning and implementation of maintenance and training programs. To
help set the institutional basis for the success of their effort, the Govern-
ment has agreed that MOP will (a) prepare a phased program on personnel
development including training; (b) afford the Bank an opportunity to comment
on the program; and (c) implement it, before the end of 1979 (Section 4.05 of
the Loan Agreement).
Cost Estimates and Financing
41.       The total cost of the project (see Project Summary) is estimated at
US$12.9 million equivalent. The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange
component of the project, amounting to US$12.0 million or 93 percent of capital
expenditures. The Government would finance the balance of the capital expendi-
tures (US$0.9 million). In addition, the Government would finance the recurrent
expenditures necessary to implement the maintenance program which would total
about US$34 million (at 1977 prices) over the project period (1979-1982)
(Section 3.05 of the Loan Agreement). The proposed loan would thus represent
about 21 percent of the total cost of the program.
42.       The costs of the road maintenance and workshop equipment and spare
parts have been estimated on the basis of lists prepared by DNM reflecting
manufacturers' quotations and recent purchases. They include a physical contin-
gency of 10 percent for spare parts and workshop tools and equipment and a



- 14 -
price contingency of 19 percent on all items reflecting recent price projec-
tions for equipment and consulting services. The cost of the technical
assistance has been estimated on the basis of about 200 man-months, and
includes five fellowships abroad for MOP professionals. The estimated total
average cost per man-month of consulting services would range from US$5,500 to
US$8,000, which is considered reasonable for the type of expertise required
when compared with similar consulting services in other countries.
Procurement and Disbursement
43.       Procurement under the project would be in accordance with the
Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement" (March 1977). The procurement program for
equipment and parts would be subject to prior approval by the Bank. Contracts
of over US$50,000 would be awarded according to international competitive
bidding. Lots with estimated costs of less than US$50,000, but not exceeding
in the aggregate US$300,000, would be advertised locally in accordance with
Government regulations which are acceptable to the Bank. Spare parts for
specific makes of equipment would be procured directly from established
dealers in accordance with the same government regulations for individual
orders of less than US$50,000 and within an overall ceiling of US$500,000.
44.       Disbursement of the loan would be made as follows:
(a) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures for direct imports, or
85 percent of the total expenditures for imported but locally
procured goods; and
(b) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures or 83 percent of total
expenditures for technical assistance.
Economic Evaluation
45.       The proposed road maintenance program is well justified with a
benefit/cost ratio of about 5.1 considering only vehicle operating cost
savings and a net present value estimated at US$130 million. Including
passenger time savings, the benefit/cost ratio is estimated at about 7.2.
Benefit/cost ratios on the individual road sections range from a high of over
50 to a low of 1. The economic rate of return (ER) for the project, including
equipment and spare parts, technical assistance and physical contingencies,
all of which account for less than one-fourth of the proposed road maintenance
program cost, is estimated to be about 160 percent. This high ER is due to
the relatively low investment required to preserve the productive capacity
of the large investments made on highway construction. Further benefits,
such as reduced spoilage of agricultural produce and increased comfort and
safety to road users, have not been quantified. To this extent, the benefit/
cost ratios are conservative estimates.
46.       In view of the competitiveness of the road transport industry,
savings in vehicle operating costs would be transferred to users, i.e., pro-
ducers and consumers of goods as well as passengers. In addition to the



- 15 -
benefits to be derived from reduced tariffs, farmers would benefit from
increased availability of transport. At present, vehicle owners are reluc-
tant to travel over poorly or not maintained secondary roads, particularly
during the rainy season. The quality of service, in turn, would also be sub-
stantially improved, bringing additional comfort, safety and punctuality, as
well as important passenger time savings, to a large segment of the rural
population.
Prolect Risk
47.       Every effort has been made in the preparation of the Four-Year
Maintenance Program to develop a coherent framework for upgrading highway
maintenance and restoring the fleet to an acceptable level of effectiveness.
Direct responsibility of MOP and MPPE officials for project preparation built
up institutional commitments. The adequate funding of operating expenditures
has been thoroughly reviewed and would be the object of specific commitments.
There is also full agreement on the need to retain qualified consultants to
assist in project implementation. In view of the above; the risks attached to
the proposed project are considered average.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Panama and the Bank,
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
49.       In addition to the features of the Loan Agreement which are referred
to in the text and listed in Section III of Annex III, the features listed
below are of particular interest.  Additional conditions of effectiveness
include:
(i) agreement on a timetable for resuming enforcement of vehicle
weight regulations (Section 6.01(a) of the Loan Agreement);
(ii) enactment of legislation formalizing the administrative organi-
zation of MOP (Section 6.01(b) of the Loan Agreement);
(iii) appointment of one maintenance engineer and a fleet manager
(Section 6.01(c) of the Loan Agreement).
A special condition of disbursement for spare parts inventory for new equipment
would be that MOP has presented to the Bank satisfactory evidence on the
separation of stocks of spare parts from construction materials, on the
updating of spare parts inventories and on the disposition of obsolete stock
of spare parts.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan 901:       Livestock Development Project; US$4.7 Million Loan of
June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project finances cattle enterprises, including land reform
settlements, involved in dairying, beef breeding and fattening; and technical
services, including an ongoing study of the livestock potential in the Atlantic
Coast Region. As of April 15, 1978, the loan was fully committed and 77 percent
disbursed. The loan should be fully disbursed on schedule even though commit-
ments have lagged behind appraisal estimates, due mainly to initial delays in
organizing the project unit. A farm sample survey has been initiated in order
to be able to evaluate with precision the project impact.
Loan 948:       Third Power Project; US$30 Million Loan of December 4, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
The project is designed to integrate three of the four isolated
major regional electricity systems into a national grid. Main project
items -- the 28 MW diesels, 230 kV lines and substations have been completed.
The only pending items -- some of the subtransmission lines and substations --
are expected to be completed in 1979, about 12 months behind the original
schedule largely because of initial delays in engineering, bidding and procure-
ment. The Closing Date is likely to be extended to at least December 31, 1978.
Project costs are currently estimated at 26 percent above appraisal estimates
in large part due to inflation. The project still yields a satisfactory
economic rate of return.
Loan 1114:       Fishing Port Project; US$24 Million Loan of May 27, 1975;
Closing Date: September 30, 1979.
The project consists of construction of a new fishing port at Punta
Vacamonte on the Pacific. Construction of the marine works, which began in
October 1976, is progressing well. It is expected that small delays which
resulted during bidding of the marine works contract will be recovered in
construction, and the project will be completed on schedule. Project costs
are estimated at 26 percent above appraisal estimates, but the project still
yields an acceptable economic rate of return.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 1280:       Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$12 Million Loan of
June 9, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The project will finance improved water supply and sewerage in the
cities of Panama, Colon, Arraijan, Chorrera and the fishing port of Vacamonte,
and a metering program. Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
Design work for the Colon, Chorrera and Panama subprojects is underway, and
bids for the meters and for materials and equipment for supply of water to
the fishing port of Vacamonte have been awarded. Due to initial delays in
design work, disbursements are slightly behind schedule.
Loan 1397:       Second Livestock Project; US$8 million Loan of April 25. 1977;
Closing Date: August 31, 1982.
The project includes financing for small and medium scale milk
producers; for the Integrated Development Program of Rio Hato, a state farm
which serves as a production and training center for farmers, and technical
assistance. The project started slowly due in part to changes required in
milk legislation. The legislation has now been modified. Loan commitments
have now accelerated.
Loan 1398:       Second Fisheries Project; US$7.5 million Loan of April 25, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project includes the construction of ten new purse seiners, the
replacement of five obsolete shrimp trawlers by five new boats, the rehabilita-
tion of ten wooden shrimp trawlers; the relocation of six shrimp processing
plants to the new fishing port at Punta Vacamonte; the development of fresh
water fish and oyster farms, and technical assistance. Procurement of the
purse seiners has started, and operational agreements required to disburse for
the fresh water fish and oyster farming components have been signed.
Loan 1470:       Fourth Power (Fortuna Hydroelectric Project):  US$42 million
of July 1, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
The project consists of the construction of the 255 MW Fortuna
Hydroelectric Project, and associated transmission as well as technical
assistance for an organizational improvement and training program for the
Borrower. The project is co-financed with the Inter-American Development
Bank. The first contract, for the underground civil works, which is being
financed by the IDB, has already been awarded and work is expected to begin
shortly. The consultants for the organization and training programs, to be
financed by the Bank, have been selected.
