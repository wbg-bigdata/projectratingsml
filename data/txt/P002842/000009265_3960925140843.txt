MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Togo
Second Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas (Credits 1302-TO and 1302-1-TO!
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Togo - Second Rural Development Project
in Cotton Areas (Credits 1302-TO and 1302-1-TO) prepared by the Africa Regional Office, with Part
It contributed by the Implementing Agency.
The objective of the project was to increase the production of both cotton and food
crops. The initial cotton production targets were substantially exceeded. As a result, a
Supplementary Credit was granted in April 1986 to finance the construction of a fourth central
ginnery and the implementation period was extended. However, delays in ongoing construction and
the 1986 collapse of world cotton prices led to a reassessment of the need for this fourth ginnery; the
proposal was abandoned and the supplementary credit cancelled.
The main physical and institutional objectives of the project were implemented and,
overall, the results of the project were satisfactory. While cotton production increased rapidly and
exceeded appraisal projections by over 100 percent, food crop production was below target. Output
has remained high, but declining international cotton prices, combined with inflexibility of the
domestic pricing, has placed the financial viability of the marketing institution in jeopardy.
Sustainability is, therefore, uncertain.
The completion report provides an adequate account of project implementation. No
audit is planned.

SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN COTTON AREAS
(CREDITS 1302-TO AND 1302-1-TO)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Rural
Development Project in Cotton Areas in Togo, for which Credit 1302-TO in the
amount of SDR 21.7 million and Supplementary Credit 1302-1-TO in the amount of
SDR 6.3 million were approved on November 23, 1982 and April 1, 1986
respectively. Both credits were closed on March 31, 1991, two and a half
years later than the original closing date. Cr. 1302-TO was fully disbursed
and the last disbursement was made in October 1989 while the total amount of
Cr. 1302-1-TO was canceled.
The PCR was prepared by the Abidjan-based Agricultural Section of
the Agricultural Operations Division of the Occidental and Central Africa
Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and the Borrower
(Part II). Part I and III were sent to and discussed with the Borrower and
its comments have been incorporated in the report. They were also sent to the
project's co-financiers, the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)
and the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC), but no comment has been
received from them.
Preparation of this PCR was initiated during the supervision
mission of the follow-up third cotton project in May 1991, and is based, inter
alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit and Project Agreements;
supervision reports, correspondence between IDA and the Borrower as well as
the co-financing agencies; and Borrower's and implementing agencies' reports.

SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN COTTON AREAS
(CREDITS 1302-TO AND 1302-1-TO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
I. Obiectives
1.          The overall objective of the Second Rural Development Project in
Cotton Areas (RD II) was to continue the promotion of cotton production while
giving a stronger emphasis on food crops production than under the first
project and to improve the rural infrastructure in the area thus raising the
standard of living of participating farm families. This objective was to be
achieved through:
(a)   strengthening of SOTOCO's technical and institutional capacities
to provide extension services, promote the creation of farmer
groups and animal traction development, and improve its financial
and industrial management;
(b)   granting financial autonomy to the cotton "filiere" and to SOTOCO
through full recovery of the cost of its operation under a
"bareme" system and the introduction of more flexibility and
transparency in the sector's pricing policy and mechanism, through
in particular the gradual elimination of fertilizer subsidies; and
(c)   development of the feeder road network and of the village water
supply facilities.
2.          The unexpectedly strong positive response by farmers to increase
cotton production prompted Government to request and obtain a supplementary
Credit (Cr. 1302-1-TO) of SDR 6.3 million to finance a fourth 20,000 t ginnery
at Notse in 1986, to complement the third ginnery at Atakpame financed by CCCE
and BOAD.
II. Implementation Experience
3.          The project was successfully implemented except for the emergency
investment program to be financed under the supplementary credit (Cr. 1302-1-
TO) and the support to National Seed Multiplication Program to be administered
by the Directorate General of Rural Development (DGDR).
4.          The supplementary credit was approved shortly before the collapse
of international prices of cotton in 1986. This, combined with a weaker
US Dollar, drastically reduced f.o.b. prices in CFAF and made Government
cautious about any new investment in the sector. After some delay, Government
decided to double the ginning capacity of the new factory at Atakpame, and
proposed that the IDA supplementary credit be used for upgrading the two
existing ginneries at Kara and Notse. IDA approved this request, but despite
two extensions of closing dates, by 2.5 years in



- iv -
total, the total supplementary credit was canceled due to the long delay in
implementing the proposed new investments and the uncertain future outlook for
cotton prices.
5.          The National Seed Multiplication Program component was supposed to
finance a seed farm and a seed quality control unit but was never implemented
because: (a) actual farmers' demand for improved food crop seed turned out to
be much more limited than anticipated; and (b) Government decided in its
strategy in 1985 to entrust production of commercial seeds to contract farmers
rather than to a State-owned seed farms.
III. Results
6.          The objective to increase cotton production was achieved.  Since
1984/85, actual total cotton production consistently surpassed appraisal
estimates by a large margin: 54,800 tons versus 35,500 tons estimated by
appraisal in 1984/85 (154% of appraisal estimate), 63,600 tons versus 39,000
tons in 1985/86 (163%) and 78,900 tons versus 40,385 tons in 1986/87 (195%).
This overwhelming increase in cotton production is largely attributed to
steady increases in producer prices from CFAF 65/kg in 1982/83 to 75/kg in
1983/84, 90/kg in 1984/85, and 105/kg in 1985/86. Unfortunately, the surge in
production coincided with the collapse of international prices in 1985/86 and
Government was slow in adjusting producer prices downward, reducing them to
CFAF 95/kg only in 1988/89, which induced large financial support needs for
the "filiere" and difficulties for SOTOCO.
7.          Despite the special emphasis placed on food crop production, the
project's results on food crops were disappointing, although this shortcoming
is difficult to appreciate due to the lack of monitoring of food crops actual
production by the project's Monitoring and Evaluation Unit.
8.          The project's achievement in helping create producer groups is
considered satisfactory despite the fact that functional literacy programs
were not implemented. Primary marketing of cotton provided farmers with
strong enough financial incentives for organizing themselves. Farmers used
these funds to invest in collective infrastructure or distribute credit to
members.
IV. Sustainability
9.          The sustainability of the project's results depends, to a large
extent, on the financial viability and autonomy of the cotton sector as a
whole. Revenues from cotton fiber export should cover costs of production,
extension services, marketing, and processing and still provide enough
revenues to farmers without external budgetary support. The prevailing
"bareme" system which isolates SOTOCO from market forces did not provide
SOTOCO enough incentives to make sustained effort for improving productivity
and reducing costs. However, this shortcoming has been addressed under the
Third Cotton Project (Credit 1929-TO). The project sustainability also
depends on development of farmer groups to eventually take over many functions
currently performed by extension agencies. The participation of
beneficiairies in conception and maintenance of rural infrastructure is also
essential. Sustainability of village water points is assured by the training
of village mechanics for maintenance of pumps.

V.   Findings and Lessons Learned
10.         The main lessons learned can be summarized as follows:
(a)   a spectacular increase in cotton production was made possible by
attractive producer prices, availability of inputs on credit and
guaranteed marketing of product;
(b)   cotton cultivation is a driving force for creating farmer groups
since its primary marketing provides strong financial incentives
to farmers to organize themselves;
(c)   the prevailing "bareme" system under which operators in the cotton
"filiere" are cut off from international market signals give
little incentive to these operators, and to SOTOCO in particular,
for making sustained productivity increases and reducing costs;
(d)   it is politically difficult for Government to lower officially
fixed producer prices, and it is necessary to introduce more
flexible pricing mechanisms under which farmers participate fully
in pricing decisions (with possibly a floor price set sufficiently
low to be activated only in exceptional circumstances);
(e)   the intensification of food crop production is difficult to
promote if market outlets for surplus production are not assured
and if credit to purchase inputs is not available;
(f)   it is necessary to establish a national animal traction
development strategy in order to promote this technology outside
of the Savannah region and to improve its profitability;
(g)   pari-passu joint financing arrangements should be avoided with
donors whose procurement guidelines are not compatible with Bank's
own procedures;
(h)   appraisal should have clearly defined key indicators to be
monitored by the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit; and
(i)   long-term technical assistance should have been limited to key
departments and short-term, well focussed consultant missions
should have been envisaged for lower echelons.

2.    Proiect Background
2.01        Sector DeveloDment Obiectives.  In the 1970s, the Government's
main objective in the agricultural sector was to promote export crops,
principally coffee, cocoa and more recently cotton. This objective was
largely achieved through relatively successful crop specific development
projects. However, very little attention was given to improving the
productivity of food crops. Recognizing the negative economic and social
effects of the relative neglect of food crops in the country's agricultural
development strategy and the importance of the national food security
objective, the Fourth Development Plan (1981-85) aimed at promoting a more
balanced agricultural development.
2.02        First Rural DeveloDment Project in Cotton Areas (RD I).  The main
objectives of this project were to increase national production of cotton and
to a lesser degree, of the food crops grown in rotation with cotton through
the institutional strengthening of the Togolese Cotton Company (SOTOCO),
provision of inputs, improved extension services and other supporting
services, feeder road construction, and the promotion of animal traction. The
total project cost of US$26 million was financed by IDA (US$14 million) and
FAC (US$5.1 million equivalent). IDA credit was fully disbursed in June 1982.
2.03        The First Project, implemented by SOTOCO, achieved its main
objectives for cotton but fell short of expectations for food crops. Its
implementation suffered from certain weaknesses such as (a) general lack of
qualified Togolese senior and middle ranking staff, particularly for financial
management; (b) deficiencies in the management of transportation of cotton and
animal traction; and (c) inadequate financing arrangements (bar6mes) to cover
SOTOCO's cost of operations. The Second Project (RD II) was designed to
correct these shortcomings and implement the balanced agricultural development
strategy promoted by the Fourth Plan.
3.    Proiect Oblectives and DescriDtion
3.01        Oblectives.  The project's overall objective was to continue to
increase cotton production while putting more emphasis than under the first
project on food crops grown by participating farmers, thus raising the
standard of living of farm families in the project area. In addition to its
production objectives, it aimed at strengthening SOTOCO's managerial and field
services capacity and also at laying the ground for a future restructuring of
SOTOCO into a specialized cotton agency and a separate, regionally managed
extension institution.
3.02        ComDonents.  The project was to be implemented over five years
(1983-1988) and consisted of:



(a)   upgrading of key departments within SOTOCO through provision of
technical assistance and vigorous recruitment and training of
Togolese personnel;
(b)   strengthening of SOTOCO's extension service, including
establishment of small farmer groups;
(c)   multiplication and distribution of improved food crop seeds;
(d)   applied research on cotton, food crops and farming systems;
(e)   encouragement of animal traction through training, improved animal
health services and credit for purchase of oxen and equipment;
(f)   promotion of the use of bio-degradable pesticides to reduce losses
of traditionally stored food crops;
(g)   provision by SOTOCO, through credit or cash, of farm inputs and
equipment relative to the above, including streamlining of
distribution and accounting procedures;
(h)   rehabilitation of some 950 km of feeder roads and periodic
maintenance of some 2,100 km of existing feeder roads;
(i)   establishment of 400 village tubewells;
(k)   establishment of additional storage capacity and other minor
infrastructure to increase annual ginning capacity of existing
SOTOCO's factories and provision of trucks for transport of inputs
and cotton products;
(1)   provision of additional buildings for SOTOCO's operations (field
stores, regional offices, workshops, houses for staff, expansion
of the headquarters office);
(m)   support to the Ministry of Rural Development's (MDR) national seed
multiplication program; and
(n)   establishment of a project monitoring and evaluation unit.
3.03        The original cost of the project was estimated at
CFAF 16,567 million (US$48.7 million) including an estimated CFAF 768 million
(US$2.3 million) of taxes. In view of Togo's difficult budgetary situation,
Government's contribution was limited to 5% of project costs net-of-tax. This
contribution amounted to CFAF 806 million net of tax or CFAF 1,574 million
including tax. The balance of project cost was to be financed by an IDA
credit of US$23.5 million (SDR 21.7 million or CFAF 8,000 million), a CCCE
loan of CFAF 5,500 million (US$16.2 million) and a FAC grant of CFAF 1,500
million (US$4.4 million).
3.04        IDA Sumplementarv Credit.  Because of important increases in
producer prices, strengthened extension services and good weather conditions,
the production of seed cotton under the project exceeded projections, reaching
54,800 t in 1985 (against 35,500 t projected). It became apparent that the
existing nominal ginning capacity of 45,000 t (22,500 t for each of the
ginneries at Kara and Notse), would not be sufficient to process the increased
production even with the extended ginning season.
3.05        With the prospect for reaching 80,000 t in 1985/86 and stabilizing
around 90,000 t thereafter, Government obtained financing from CCCE and West
African Development Bank (BOAD) to construct a third 20,000 t ginnery at
Atakpame in 1985, and IDA agreed to finance under a supplementary credit (a) a
fourth 20,000 ton ginnery at Notse; (b) the construction of 1,200 additional
village seed cotton storage facilities; and (c) the purchase of about 10 light



trucks for primary marketing of seed cotton. The supplementary Credit Cr.
1302-1-To for SDR 6.3 million was approved by the Board in April 1986. The
Amending Agreement to the Credit 1302-TO was signed on May 1, 1986.
4.    Prolect Design and Organization
4.01        At the request of Government, the project was identified and
prepared by IDA's Regional Mission in West Africa (RMWA) in 1981 with
assistance from consultants. Appraisal was undertaken in November/December
1981 with participation from CCCE and FAC. The project design remained
essentially the same as for the first project, with SOTOCO being the main
executing agency and several components such as village water supply and
applied research executed by other specialized agencies under contract.
4.02        As a whole, the project concept and design were sound and remained
unchanged throughout project execution. However, it would have strongly
benefitted from a socio-economic study by agro-ecological zones during the
identification/preparation to better identify constraints, needs and
preoccupations of farmers. Such a study would have not only better targeted
extension and applied research programs but also probably recommended a more
active participation of beneficiaries in the definition of these programs.
4.03        The responsibility for food crop development became a major issue
during project preparation. Having noted SOTOCO's limited success in food
crop development, the MDR questioned SOTOCO's competence for and interest in
the promotion of food crop production and considered the option of giving
SOTOCO only the responsibility for the promotion of cotton production, with
extension services for food crop production being provided by MDR's Regional
Directorates of Rural Development (DRDR). It was however concluded that, in
the short term, the most efficient solution was to improve SOTOCO's operations
in favor of food crop development, while reviewing options for better ensuring
this development including making SOTOCO into a specialized cotton agency and
transferring all extension services to DRDR.
4.04        At the time of preparation, inputs (fertilizers, insecticides)
were heavily subsidized by Government. The producer price of seed cotton was
fixed at levels which did not reflect international price movements and which
represented a substantial taxation of primary producers. Output pricing and
input subsidy issues were dealt with under the project through several
covenants, aiming at gradually phasing out fertilizer subsidies by PY5 while
increasing the producer price for seed cotton to better reflect border-parity
prices. Cotton insecticides were 100% subsidized by the Togolose Agricultural
Marketing Agency (OPAT) throughout the execution of this project. Government
respected elimination of cotton fertilizer subsidies but not for food crops.
Cotton producer prices were steadily increased to CFAF 105/kg in 1985/86 when
international prices collapsed and Government failed to reduce it for 3 years,
which underlined the insistence of Government to continue intervening in the
fixation of producer prices and the resulted in the need for a substantial
budgetary support of the cotton account. This heavy burden on public funds
was instrumental in Government's decision to introduce a more flexible pricing
mechanism in the cotton sector under which the floor price is set sufficiently
low with bonuses adjusting for annual variations of international prices.
This reform together with a gradual elimination of insecticide subsidies is
being implemented under the on-going, IDA-financed Cotton Sector Development
Project (RD III, credit 1929-TO), approved by the Board in June 1988.
4.05        The project also aimed at granting financial autonomy to SOTOCO by
increasing its working capital and making OPAT pay full costs of SOTOCO under
a "bareme" system. However, in reality, the financial autonomy could not be
obtained as far as SOTOCO was isolated from international markets under a
"bareme" system which did not give any incentive to SOTOCO to reduce costs and
improve quality of cotton when cotton market prices went down (see para.
7.01).
4.06        The project's original financing plan was based on pari-passu



-4-
joint financing with CCCE, FAC and Government for most of the categories.
However, CCCE and FAC later requested parallel financing for certain
categories mostly because of conflicts in procurement procedures. Confusion
over the financing plan and conflict with respective procurement procedures
not only obliged the project to amend IDA's Credit Agreement many times but,
most importantly, caused substantial delays in procurement. This experience
confirms the need to avoid pari-passu co-financing with other donors with
procurement guidelines which are not compatible with Bank's own procedures.
5.    Project Implementation
5.01        The project was appraised in November/December 1981, negotiated in
August 1982, approved by the Board in November 1982. The credit was signed in
February 1983 and finally became effective in July 29, 1983. Since the first
project was fully disbursed in September 1982, SOTOCO prefinanced activities
during 1982/83 and IDA agreed to a retroactive financing for certain
expenditures made between September 30, 1982 and the date of credit signing up
to SDR 1.85 million. The closing date, initially set on October 1, 1988, was
extended twice by a total of 2.5 years to March 31, 1991, essentially to allow
the project to use the supplementary credit, which was in the end canceled.
The funds under the original credit were totally disbursed on October 12,
1989. The 1988/89 season is therefore considered as the final year of project
execution.
5.02        The project was successfully implemented except for the emergency
investment program to be financed under the supplementary credit (Cr. 1302-1-
TO) and the support to National Seed Multiplication Program.
5.03        Cancellation of Surmlementary Credit.  This credit was supposed to
finance construction of fourth ginnery in Notse to complement the third
factory in Atakpame financed by CCCE and BOAD and bring total national ginning
capacity to about 90,000 tons/year. However, shortly after the credit was
approved, the collapse of international prices of cotton combined with weaker
US dollar drastically reduced cotton f.o.b. prices in CFAF and made Government
cautious about new investments in the sector. In addition, Government
estimated that the choice of Notse as the site for a new factory had been made
too hastily and commissioned a study to propose a new site based on medium-
term projections of cotton production. The study recommended 4 sites
excluding Notse. IDA was not in agreement with the study's conclusion and
long discussions over the site between Government and IDA delayed utilization
of this credit.
5.04        Finally, the Togolese decided to double the ginning capacity of
the existing factory at Atakpame, and proposed to IDA to use the supplementary
credit for upgrading the two existing ginning factories at Kara and Notse,
which IDA agreed. However, the long delay in start-up of the factory at
Atakpame (only in January 1990), and the uncertain prospects for cotton prices
finally led SOTOCO to decide not to make large investments in the Kara and
Notse factories and the total credit was canceled. A much reduced but
essential investment program on the three ginning factories to improve their
productivity is being financed under RD III by IDA.
5.05        National Seed Multiplication Program.  This component, to be
administered by MDR's General Directorate of Rural Development (DGDR), was
supposed to finance a seed farm in the Central Region, a seed quality control
unit attached to this seed farm and operating funds for a committee to
coordinate the national seed multiplication program. This component, however,
was never implemented. Contrary to appraisal expectations, farmers' demand
for improved food crop seeds turned out to be much more limited than expected
due to: (a) uncertain market outlets for food crops; (b) elimination of
individual credit for food crop inputs (since 1984); and (c) lack of suitable
improved varieties, particularly sorghum. Also, Government decided in 1985,
in its "Nouvelle Strat6gie", to entrust production of commercial seed to
contract farmers rather than seed farms.



5.06        Reorganization of Extension Services.  The "Nouvelle Strategie" in
March 1985 states that extension services should be provided only by DRDR.
SOTOCO should be gradually relieved of providing basic extension services and
concentrate on ensuring adequate supply of cotton seed, fertilizers and
insecticides as well as on the efficient cotton processing and marketing.
Since 1986, as a first step, and in order to avoid overlap of activities in a
given geographical area, the DRDRs and SOTOCO were given full responsibility
for general extension in specific zones. In addition, since the start of the
IFAD-financed Notse Rural Development Project (PDRN) late in 1984, extension
services for the area covered by this project had already been transferred
from SOTOCO to the project unit.
5.07        In parallel, Government launched in 1986 a pilot program in
selected areas within the zones covered by SOTOCO and PDRN in order to
introduce and adapt the main principles of the Training and Visit System. The
successful pilot activities led to preparation and appraisal of the
Agricultural Extension Project, financed by IDA, which started its operations
in July 1988. The new extension system, called STER ("systdme Togolais
d'encadrement rural"), was then adopted by all the institutions providing
extension services in Togo, including SOTOCO.
5.07        Other Variations.  The food crop applied research, which was
supposed to be executed by Research Institute on Tropical Agronomy and Food
Crop (IRAT) under contract, was in fact implemented by SOTOCO's Applied
Research Unit after 1984, following SOTOCO's dissatisfaction with IRAT's
performance and high cost. Concerning farmer group development, the project
envisaged to encourage the creation of small farmer groups of up to 30
families, on the basis of the unsuccessful attempt at the development of
cooperatives in the Plateaux region, attributed to an approach based on groups
which were too large and without social cohesiveness. During implementation,
however, this approach was revised and groups at village level were formed.
5.08        It was envisaged that half of project's feeder road rehabilitation
proaram would be implemented by SOTOCO's feeder roads unit, and that the
remaining half would be subcontracted to the National Feeder Road Unit (SNPR,
"Service National des Pistes Rurales") of the then-Ministry of Rural Works.
This arrangement was proposed by IDA not to undermine SNPR, implementing
agency for another IDA-financed Feeder Road Project. This subcontracting,
however, turned out to be unsatisfactory for SOTOCO because of SNPR's slow
administrative procedures and higher costs compared with private contractors.
SOTOCO eventually took over the entire rehabilitation program, subcontracting
part of it to small private enterprises. Implementation through
subcontracting to the private sector was satisfactory.
6.    Proiect Results
6.01        The objective to increase cotton production was achieved.  Since
1984/85, actual total cotton production consistently surpassed appraisal
estimates by a big margin: 54,800 tons versus 35,500 tons in 1984/85 (154% of
appraisal estimate), 63,600 tons versus 39,000 tons in 1985/86 (163%) and
78,900 tons versus 40,385 tons in 1986/87 (195%), 66,900 tons versus
40,385 tons in 1987/88 (166%) and 86,400 tons versus 40,385 tons in 1988/89
(214%). The production increase was essentially achieved by extension of
areas rather than increases in yields through further intensification.
6.02        This overwhelming increase in cotton production is largely
attributed to steady increases in producer prices from CFAF 65/kg in 1982/83
to 75/kg in 1983/84, 90/kg in 1984/85 and 105/kg in 1985/86. This
demonstrates price effects on farmers' willingness to increase cotton
production for which inputs are available on credit and marketing is
guaranteed. Unfortunately, the surge in production coincided with the
collapse of international prices in 1985/86 and Government was slow in
adjusting producer prices downward despite the price covenant. The producer
price was reduced to CFAF 95/kg only in 1988/89. Without price adjustments,
SOTOCO was obliged to provide price support to farmers and incurred



-6-
CFAF 629 million in losses in 1985/86. To reduce these losses, SOTOCO reduced
seed distribution to limit the total area under cotton (to not more than
70,000 ha). These measures slowed down production but helped SOTOCO's ginning
operations until it new factory at Atakpame opened in 1990.
6.03        The lack of monitoring on food crops by the project's Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit (MEU) makes it difficult to appreciate the project's
achievements on food crops. It appears however that, despite the special
emphasis placed on food crop production, the project's results on food crops
were somewhat disappointing. The project's technical recommendations on food
crops were based on monocropping whereas no attention was paid to mixed
cropping, which remained as common cultural practice for food crops by
farmers. Intensification of food crop production was hampered by
discontinuation of individual credit for food crops in 1984 and uncertain
marketing outlets for surpluses.
6.04        The appraisal did not set physical targets for the establishment
of farmer groups. As of 1988/89, the project helped create 182 groups
("Groupement Agricole Villageois" or GAV) and its achievement is considered
satisfactory. Primary marketing of cotton provided farmers with a strong
enough common economic interest for organizing themselves and with funds to
invest or distribute credit among members. This achievement was made despite
the lack of functional literacy programs which are critical to permit the
effective participation of members in management of groups but unfortunately
were not foreseen under the project. GAVs maintain simple accounts with
assistance from SOTOCO's agents. Recognizing the importance of farmer groups
in the efficient management of the sector, SOTOCO is attempting to accelerate
the creation of such groups under the RD III by softening criteria which were
unnecessarily restrictive (from 50 ha of cotton at minimum to 20 tons of seed
cotton), and the transfer to the groups of the commercial activities (cotton
primary marketing, input distribution).
6.05        The animal traction component surpassed its physical target (2,089
against 1,000 projected). However, the introduction of this technology was
confined to the Savannah region and, to a lesser extent, to the Kara region
where the livestock tradition exists and land clearing poses less problems.
Outside of the Savannah region, the cost of land clearing and destumping, the
lack of draft animals and precarious animal health conditions discouraged
farmers to adopt animal traction. Where introduced, there appears to have
been no significant yield gain by animal traction because most of farmers do
not plow ("labour a plat") but only ridge the land, due to time constraints.
In addition, the absence of suitable seeders and weeders limited the
utilization and profitability of this technology. Investments in animal
traction was financed through credit extended by CNCA. The credit recovery
rates for animal traction were less than satisfactory (31% in 1983/84, 87% in
1984/85, 89% in 1985/86, 93% in 1986/87, 88% in 1987/88, and 75% in 1988/89),
which calls for tighter selection criteria for beneficiaries endorsed by
groups and more effective recovery efforts in addition to improved
profitability of animal traction through better utilization of equipment.
6.06        The village water component also met appraisal target
(435 tubewells constructed and equipped compared with 400 foreseen) albeit
with a considerable delay in execution due to the lengthy procurement
procedures. The project also organized sensitization campaigns for
beneficiaries and trained village mechanics for the maintenance of pumps.
6.07        The project's MEU was established after a long delay.  Moreover,
it was not used by the project management to properly supervise project's
multiple components, but focussed almost exclusively on the monitoring of
agricultural production. Even for that purpose, MEU's contribution was
limited; e.g., yields of food crop production by different intensification
stages were not measured for the first 4 years of the project. Appraisal
should have agreed with SOTOCO on MEU's priority objectives and programs, as
well as on key indicators to be monitored.



6.08        The project helped increase the average net revenue per farm in
Savannah and Kara regions from CFAF 193,080 to 205,119 and 253,784
respectively (against CFAF 278,308 projected by appraisal); in Central region
from CFAF 122,555 to 284,539 (against CFAF 174,934); and in Plateaux region
from CFAF 135,920 to 248,386 (against CFAF 326,854). These increases are
largely linked to the development of cotton production, which compensated
disappointing performance of food crop production.
6.09        The project's economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated at 21.3%
at appraisal, on the basis of a pessimistic assumption on the quality discount
of the Togolese cotton (a 20% discount from international reference CIF
prices) and highly optimistic assumptions on incremental production of
sorghum, groundnut, rice and cowpeas. If only incremental cotton and maize
production had been taken into account as benefits, appraisal ERR would have
declined to -4.5%.
6.10        Under the same assumptions used at appraisal (a 20% price discount
and incremental production of all 5 food crops) but using actual costs and
prices, the recalculated ERR is 10%. The lower ERR is explained mainly by
international cotton prices lower than projected at the time of appraisal (44%
lower in PY5) as well as by the poorer performance of food crops. However,
there was a marked improvement of the quality of Togolese cotton fiber which
now sells at a discount of only 5-10%. Also, the cotton production was 95%
higher than projected in PY4. On the other hand, the project's impact on food
crops other than improved maize was minimum (the lack of monitoring does not
permit a meaningful estimation of their incremental production). The more
realistic ERR, calculated on the basis of a 7.5% quality discount and
incremental production of cotton and maize only, is 20%.
7.  Pro-ect Sustainability
7.01        The sustainability of project's main achievements depends, to a
large extent, on the financial viability and autonomy of the cotton sector as
a whole: revenues from cotton export should cover costs of production,
extension services, marketing, and processing and still provide enough
revenues to farmers without external budgetary support. This in turn requires
that continued efforts be made to improve productivity at all levels of the
production/processing chain. However, the prevailing "bar&me" system under
which SOTOCO is isolated from market forces, did not prompt SOTOCO to reduce
costs. To reduce cost and improve productivity at the processing and
marketing level, the Government has introduced under the IDA-financed RD III
project a system under which only 90% of SOTOCO's and OPAT's costs are
guaranteed, - the balance being paid if the cotton sector breaks even
financially at prevailing world and producer prices -, thus providing them
with incentives to reduce costs.
7.02        The project sustainability also depends on development of farmer
groups to eventually take over many functions currently performed by extension
agencies. The fragile state of existing groups will require continued and
strengthened effort to provide an enabling economic environment and also to
improve the groups' management through training and functional literacy
programs.
8.    Borrower Performance
8.01        Generally, performance of the project's main executing agency,
SOTOCO, was satisfactory. Competent project management and the low turn-over
of key staff contributed to the success of the project. Government, however,
failed to respect the key covenants, except for the elimination of subsidies
on cotton fertilizer. Firstly, Government failed to provide sufficient
counterpart funds for project implementation, due to the continuous fiscal
difficulties. The cotton sector, through SOTOCO and cotton "bargme", had to
substitute for Government. Secondly, Government never accepted to eliminate
subsidies on food crop fertilizers, which created the anomaly of selling the
same fertilizer (urea) at different prices for cotton and food crops.



- 8 -
8.02        Thirdly, Government failed to respect the covenants that the
cotton "bareme" should cover the full cost of operations of SOTOCO and that
the producer prices should be adjusted annually to take account of movements
in the international price of cotton. When the international price collapsed
in 1985/86, OPAT slashed SOTOCO's "bareme" for 1985/86 from CFAF 440/kg to
355/kg, causing a substantial deficit for SOTOCO despite the hasty
introduction of cost-cutting measures (CFAF 629 m for 1985/86). The slow
adjustment of producer prices resulted in accumulated deficits of the cotton
sector, insupportable by SOTOCO or the Togolese economy.
8.03        In addition, excessively lengthy and cumbersome administrative
procedures greatly delayed procurement of goods and works and had a negative
impact on the execution of project's activities, notably the village water
component and the construction programs. They also contributed to the
cancellation of the supplementary credit.
8.04        Finally, Government should have developed a comprehensive animal
traction strategy, taking into account regional specificities to improve the
utilization and profitability of the technology, in particular in the regions
where the livestock activities are less important and land clearing and
destumping are difficult. The Animal Traction Promotion Project (PROPTA),
together with the Production Unit for Agricultural Equipment (UPROMA), should
have paid more attention to the development of well adapted ox-drawn
equipment, specially seeders and weeders.
9.    IDA Performance
9.01        constructive dialogue between IDA and the executing agency
throughout project execution was well appreciated and useful in resolving
issues and harmonizing different points of view. IDA was flexible to
accommodate changing needs and resolve financial difficulties of the executing
agency, as evidenced by a number of amendments of the credit agreement to
reallocate IDA funds between the categories and increase IDA's disbursement
percentages as well as a swift processing of the supplementary credit.
9.02        IDA supervision was adequate.  There were 15 supervision missions,
2 of which were before effectiveness and 3 were joint missions for the second
and third projects. Staff continuity was good: only 3 task managers during
the 7.5-year project implementation period. The quality of supervision
missions and aide-memoires regularly sent to Government was recognized as of
great use for project execution.
10.   Proiect Relationship
10.01       The relationship between IDA and Government was good except for
the disagreement over the site of the fourth factory, which contributed to the
cancellation of the supplementary credit. The relationship between SOTOCO and
OPAT should have been improved because information did not circulate from OPAT
to SOTOCO (e.g., OPAT's Agricultural Prices Analysis Unit's studies on prices
and farmer incentives were never distributed to SOTOCO) and SOTOCO was cut off
from the international cotton market.
11.   Consulting Services
11.01       The project was to finance technical assistance for 12 positions
with a total of 42 man-years amounting to 11 % of the total project net-of-tax
cost at appraisal. Funds for studies and fellowships also allowed the
Togolese staff to be trained overseas for long periods. This heavy technical
assistance was justified at the time of appraisal by the general lack of
qualified high and middle-level staff at SOTOCO. However, resident technical
assistance in many line positions tended to take away responsibilities from
the Togolese staff. Long-term resident expatriates should have been limited
to few key director-level posts and short-term consultant missions should have
been envisaged to provide targetted advice and training when necessary.



-9-
12.   Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01       The project documents such as the appraisal report, legal
documents and working papers were comprehensive and could have been useful for
project execution. Unfortunately, they were hardly circulated among the
different partners. SOTOCO was supposed to produce comprehensive annual
reports but each of its department produced activity reports for each project
component separately, often with a considerable delay.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TOGO
SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN COTTON AREAS
(CREDITS 1302-TO AND 1302-1-TO)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE!'
1.          The second Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas (RD II) was
designed to continue the expansion of cotton production and the improvement of
food crops production, building on the achievements and correcting the
shortcomings of the first project (RD I). Strengthening of agricultural
service activities (training of personnel, support of animal traction,
promotion of farmer groups, applied research, etc) was also an important
objective of the project. The project's implementation period, originally set
from October 1982 to September 1987, was extended to July 1989.
2.          Globally, the project's results met or surpassed its targets.
(a)   Agricultural Production.  Cropped areas as well as production
targets largely exceeded appraisal estimates, particularly for
cotton. It should be noted, however, that increases in cotton
production were mainly due to the entry of new cotton producers.
The current cotton crisis and the need to improve the
profitability of the cotton sector call for further
intensification. The animal production component and
environmental protection should have been taken into account.
(b)   Support Services.  Generally, services provided directly or
indirectly to farmers were satisfactory. The project initiated
organization of farmer groups around common economic activities.
The achievement of applied research on cotton and food crops in
such a short time is laudable. However, it became evident towards
the end of project implementation, as farmers had already acquired
basic skills, that extension services became routine. It is
therefore recommended to accelerate a transfer of responsibilities
to farmer groups, to convert extension agents to community
outreach agents ("animateur"), enrich extension messages, and to
develop grassroots savings and loan associations.
(c)   Rural Infrastructure.  Considerable efforts were made to improve
rural equipment. However, more effective participation of
beneficiaries at the time of preparation should have been
envisaged, to assure maintenance after the project.
(d)   Privatization of activities before and after ginning would
contribute to reducing the recurrent cost of the project, notably
transport costs.
3.          The relationship among the partners of the project was
exceptionally good. However, it is desirable that members of supervision
missions do not change every year, in order to follow through recommendations
and ensure consistency.
1' This is a direct translation of the summary and conclusion of the project
completion report prepared by SOTOCO. The full report, in French, entitled
"Rapport d'achevement du deuxieme projet de d6veloppement rural des zones
cotonniAres" dated December 1991, is sent separately to OED.



-12 -
4.          It is necessary to revise the procurement clause (of French aid
agencies) limiting suppliers of goods and services only to those from the
franc zone because approvals of exceptions to this rule were often obtained
late and caused delays in procurement. It is therefore desirable that IDA
finances equipment and inputs while FAC and CCCE finance operating costs.
5.          It is undeniable that the RD II Project had positive socio-
economic impacts on beneficiaries: improvement in food self-sufficiency,
revenue increases, improved marketing of agricultural products, organization
of farmer groups and collective investment for community development, crop
diversification, and acceleration of self-help through the start-up of
functional literacy programs.
6.          It is necessary to simplify administrative procedures in order to
carry out investment programs on time. It is also necessary and possible to
reduce the number of extension agents as a result of a transfer of
responsibilities to farmer groups.
7.          In short, one can conclude that the RD II Project was a success
given the results obtained, despite some shortcomings, and that better results
can be expected under the RD III Project.

Comments:  (Issues raised at each stage of project cycle)
The Project was identified and prepared in March-April 1981 by
RMWA with the assistance from consultants. Key issues were: (1) SOTOCO's
medium and longer term role in Togo's rural sector Development strategy; (2)
financing resources and cofinanciers; (3) interim financing; and
(4) institutional and financial structure: (a) SOTOCO to remain a state
enterprise during the project period; (b) OPAT to continue to handle exports
of cotton and act as a price stabilization agency; (c) the OPAT-SOTOCO bareme
to be revised upwards so as to ensure all cotton-related expenditures are
covered, thereby reducing Government financing requirements for SOTOCO out of
the treasury; (d) SOTOCO to procure fertilizer and pesticides directly rather
than via Government's "Service d'Engais"; and (e) SOTOCO's equity to be
increased.
Appraisal took place from November 21-December 22, 1981 by a
mission consisting of Messrs. K. Oblitas, R. de Cock, Nightingale and
C. Sourang (consultant). The CCCE + FAC also participated in the appraisal.
The decision meeting was held on February 3, 1982. The key issues discussed
were (a) the inter-linkage with the SAC, TA, IFAD Nots6 and other projects,
(b) the proposed modifications to the OPAT-SOTOCO bar6me; (c) SOTOCO's role in
Togo's Rural Sector Development; (d) financing resources and cofinanciers; (e)
retroactive financing; and (f) feeder-road development.
Negotiations of Togo RD II Project took place in Washington D.C.
from Sept 7-10, 1982. The Togolese delegation was led by Mr. Sema (DGDR).
The principal issues were: total project costs taking into account the new
exchange rate and the financing plan; reorganization of SOTOCO; the ginning
capacity; housing for SOTOCO senior personnel; bareme; cotton price;
definition of baseline and incremental costs; SOTOCO's exemption from import
duties; direct procurement of inputs by SOTOCO; and due dates for payment of
commitment and Service charges.
Closing was extended twice from October 1988 to
(i) October 1, 1989 (12 months, approval of October 13, 1988) in order to
provide bridge financing before the start-up of the Cotton Sector Project; and
(ii) to March 1, 1991 (18 months, approval of September 15, 1989) in order to
complete complementary investment programs at three ginneries under the
supplementary credit.

Due to lack of reliable information on actual incremental production of sorgh.um, groundnut, paddy and cowpeas,
appraisal estimates of incremental production of these food crops were used, after being adjusted downward to
take into account the poorer performance of actual improved maize production.
Comments:         Under the same assumptions used at appraisal (a 20% price discount and incremental production of all
5 food crops) but using actual costs and prices, the recalculated ERR is 9.8%, lower than appraisaL
ERR of 21.3% due to international cotton prices Lower than projected at appraisal (44% lower in PYS)
and by the poorer performance of food crops. The more realistic ERR, calculated on the basis of a
7.5% quality discount and of incremental production of cotton and maize only, is 20%, which is very
close to appraisaL ERR. Improved quality of fibre and much higher cotton production (95% higher than
projected in PY4) compensated the lower international cotton prices and the poorer performance of
food crops.
