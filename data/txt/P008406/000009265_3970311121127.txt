MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA
FOR THE HAAPSALU AND MATSALU BAYS ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the: Republic of Estonia for the equivalent of US $2.00 million to help finance a project for the
enviromnent. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of fifteen
years, including five years of grace.
2.         This proposed project would be financed in association with grant financing by the
Govermnents of Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, and EU (PHAPn) for a total amount of US $3.85
million equivalent.
3.         Country/Sector Background. Estonia is a country covering 45,200 kriZ, with a population
of about 1.6 million located on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Ethnic Estonians make up
approximately 62 percent of the population, while ethnic Russians constitute the country's largest minority
with 30 percent of the population. During the period of Soviet rule, Estonia had a strong economy based
on relatively soplhisticated industries and agriculture, and enjoyed the highest standard of living anong
the republics of the former Soviet Union. Since regaining independence in 1991, Estonia has initiated
major political and economic reforms which have brought it from a centrally planned to a transitional
market economy. In this process, it has experienced adjustment shocks common to many economies in
transition, characterized by a significant decline in productivity and high inflation rates, with the gross
domestic product (GDP) declining sharply as a result of the collapse of trading relations with Russia and
other former Soviet Republics.
4.         The Govermment of Estonia (GOE) has been pursuing cconomic reform and stabilization,
including price and trade liberlization. The liberalization of prices begun in December 1989 marked the
first step in the country's formal macroeconomic stabilization program. Since then, Estonia has been
successful in containing monetary and fiscal deficits. Initially, prices increased sharply as the distorted
relative prices inherited from the Soviet system adjusted to world levels. Tight fiscal discipline helped
assure the success of the currency board scheme under which the new currency, the kroon, was
introduced in June 1992. The kroon is fully backed by foreign exchange and has remained pegged at
EEK 8 per DM since its introduction. Net internatioral reserves increased 20 percent from 1993 to 1994.
The annual inflation rate fell from 89 percent in 1993 to 41 percent in 1994 and is projected to decline
further, to 6 percent in 1998. The estimated per capita income level in 1993 was US $3,040. Output
started to recover in the second quarter of 1993, and the Bank projects 5 percent annual real GDP growth
through the end of the decade.
5.         The Bank's overall strategy in Estonia is to support the country's efforts to accelerate
structural reforms leading to a full transition to a market4based economy and, at the same time, to support
efficient investments in high priority sectors to facilitate the return to economic growth. To date the Bank
has provided the GOE with a Rehabilitation Loan of US $30 million in October 1992 (Report No. 3525-
EE), US $12 million in support of a Highway Maintenance Project in May 1994 (Report No. 3731-EE),
US $38.4 million for a District Heating Rehabilitation Project in May 1994 (Report No. 3740-EE), US
$10 million for a Financial Institutions Development Project in October 1994 (Report No. 3803-EE) and



- 2 -
US $18 million for a Health Project in January 1995 (Report No. 3835-EE). Implementation of these
projects is proceeding satisfactorily.
6.         Infrastructure rehabilitation and development is considered one Estonia's priorities for
support. The recently completed Public Expenditure Review, jointly prepared by the GOE and ;he Bank,
highlighted the need to support investments in energy, transport, and environmental services, including
improved water supply and wastewater treatmnent. The priority given to investments for environmnental
services was justified by the need to improve the quality and reliability of drinking water and to address
the water quality problems and health risks created by the discharge of partially treated and untreated
wastewater to water courses and the marine environment. The proposed Project would support the
improvement of water quality and wastewater services in Haapsalu, and demonstrate the application of
a variety of envirornental management methods to support environmentally sound development in the
catchment area of Matsalu Bay.
7.         The Project area includes two scenic bays on the Baltic coast of western Estonia - Haapsalu
Bay to the north which is dominated by the historic town of Haapsalu, and Matsalu Bay to the south,
featuring Matsalu State Nature Reserve, a site of international significance for migratory birds. These
bays are fringed by the islands of Vormsi, Hiiumaa and Saaremaa, which together create a semi-enclosed
area dominated by a variety of terrestrial and marine ecosystems suitable for a range of conservati^n and
recreational uses. In recognition of their regional importance, the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive
Environmental Action Program prepared by the Helsinki Commission identified actions to address the
management of wastewater discharges from the Municipality of Haapsalu and management of the
ecologically critical Matsalu Bay as among the top priority actions to be taken in the context of the Baltic
Sea Environment Program.
8.         The city of Haapsalu is located on the westem coast of Estonia, lying on a long and narrow
peninsula that reaches into the sea and divides the Haapsalu Bay into the open Eestlaht and the shallow
Tagalaht. It occupies an area of approximately 11 lan2 and has a population of about 14,000; non-
Estonians make up about 23 percent of the city's population. It is a scenic city dominated by a castle and
features extensive districts of historic wooden homes. The city has a major forrner Soviet air base, but
most of the Russian military personnel and their families have left and the air field is currently unused.
Haapsalu has no major industries, but has strong potential to reclaim and develop its historical position
as a tourist resort, which was a sumuner spa of the Russian imperial family. In addition, the marine
environment of Haapsalu contains deposits of curative mud which have economic value, both in the
domestic market as well as for export. The mud is used for medical purposes in the treatment of
rheumatism and nerve diseases in arms and legs. The biologically active substances present in the mud
have also been used in veterinary medicine, cosmetics, and fertilizers. At present, mud is taken only from
one of two deposits closest to town. It is this deposit which stands to benefit most from improved
wastewater treatment. Eco-tourism could be developed in both Haapsalu Bay and the adjacen; Matsalu
Bay, both of which have rich and diverse wildlife.
9.         Matsalu Bay lies approximately 20 km to the south of the city of Haapsalu and drains a
catchment of some 3,200 km2 which is mostly agricultural in nature. Only the two small towns of Rapla
and Lihula lie in the catchment, along with approximately 10 smaller settlements and former state farms.
However, due to the extensive area of the drainage basin, the total population is around 40,000. The
shoreline of Matsalu Bay is exuemely intricate and there are over ten islets in the bay itself. The diverse
nature of the flora has resulted in the development of a unique variety of habitats, especially for migrating
and breeding birds. The area is important for international scientific research, and is the center for the



Estonian bird ringing program. The bay is one of the stopping areas on the Baltic portion of the East
African-European-Arctic flyway for migratory birds and is a critical part of a complex system of coastal
wildlife habitats which includes Lake Pape in Latvia and the Nemunas Delta in Lithuania.
10.       The Matsalu State Nature Reserve was created in 1957 and covers an area of approximately
48,000 hectares including part of Matsalu Bay and the Kasari River delta. The Reserve was designated
as a site of international significance to migratory birds under the Ramsar Convention in 1976. Matsalu's
international importance as a stopping point for migratory birds makes it an attractive location for natre-
related tourism. The Matsalu State Nature Reserve, with proper investmnents and management, could
become a major tourist attraction as well as an important source of revenue for the GOE.
11.        The Matsalu wetland is being negatively affected by drainage from the wet meadows of the
Kasari River, pollution from surrounding cattle fanns, accelerating eutrophication from catchment run-off,
and by inadequately controlled sport fishing from motor boats. The main problem is organic enrichment
and eutrophication which results in the expansion of the area of reed beds in the bay (approximately 60
hectares annually). This alters sedimentation and habitat distribution, thereby affecting the use of the area
by migrating birds and other species.
12.       In response to increasing concem for the environment in and around the Baltic Sea, a
regional program, the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Enviromnental Action Programme, was adopted
at a Diplomatic Conference of Ministers of Environment in April 1992. The objective of the Programme
is to restore the ecological balance of the Baltic Sea. In the context of the Helsinki Convention on
Environmental Protection of the Baltic Sea, which Estonia has signed and ratified, the Progranmme has
identified a number of pollution 'hot-spots" around the Baltic Sea, including Haapsalu and Matsalu.
13.        The city of Haapsalu and Matsalu State Nature Reserve were ranked by the Task Force as
a priority 'hot spot" and subsequently by Estonian authorities as a high priority for national and foreign
investment in environmental protection. This position has been taken repeatedly by the GOE in a variety
of international fora, most recently by the MOE at the May 1994 Bank-sponsored "Public Investment
Confenmnce" held in Paris. The Task Force also identified the need to undertake actions for coastal zone
management and the conservation of coastal lagoons and wetlands as key elements of the long-term
program which provides for a synergetic input to investments in wastewater management. Conducting
such activities in the Haapsalu and Matsaitu regions has been strongly supported by the MOE, given its
interest in promoting the high ecological, tourism, and recreational values of the areas.
14.       The proposed Project is intended by the MOE to serve as a "model project" to demonstrate
complementary actions for management of point source pollution from secondary cities, small settlements
and small enterprises, and non-point source pollution from agriculture and rural areas. A principal reason
for the selection of the Haapsaiu and Matsalu Bays as a project area was to have a range of interventions
concentrated in a small geographic region which would also have significant short-term impact on areas
of high ecological and touristic value. The strategy of the MOE is to have the proposed Project provide
a technical and management framework for an effective application of fumds from diverse sources to
maximize environmental benefits which would be reduced if funds were used at a variety of separate
locations.
15.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. This would be the first environmental
project supported by the Bank in the country. The proposed Project would reflect previous Bank water
and wastewater sector experience, in particular: (a) the need to develop managerially and financially



- 4 -
autonomous and decentralized water and wastewater utilities; and (b) the benefits of taking an integrated
approach in addressing improvements in water and wastewater services. Given previous regional
experience with environmental projects in Eastern Europe, project implementation will include the
participation of a procurement specialist to evaluate procurement issues and conduct training activities for
borrower personnel.
16.        Rationale for Bank Involvement. Environment is one of the focal areas of the Bank's
country assistance strategy for Estonia; hence, priority investmnents in the sector together with the
project's intended support to the decentralization process in the country, makes it rank highly in the
Bank's program of assistance to Estonia. The support of the Bank for the proposed project would provide
an opportunity to assist the Estonian Government in its efforts to improve national environmental quality,
protect the Baltic Sea and demonstrate enviromnental management techniques. In the absence of Bank
involvement, it is unlikely that the country would be able to mobilize the technical assistance and financial
resources required to implement an environmental management project for this environmentally and
economically important area of the country. The proposed Project would provide a mechanism for the
Bank to test the feasibility of rapid preparation and implementation of small projects for priority
environmental investment activities in the FSU. It would build capacity in the national government to
prepare and implement environmental projects. The Project would also expand the range of Bank
experience in supporting the planning and implementation of eco-tourism related activities and investments
in protected areas, which is a rapidly growing type of activity, given the emphasis on "environmentally
sustainable development". This Project is corasistent with the Country Assistance Strategy as discussed
by the Board of Directors during the presentation of the Estonia Financial Institutions Development
Project (Report No. 3803-EE) on October 18, 1994.
17.        Project Objectives. The proposed Project would: (a) strengthen the MOE's capacity to
coordinate and inplement environmental project; (b) reduce discharge of partially treated or untreated
wastewater to the Baltic Sea; (c) restore and enhance the water quality in Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays;
(d) improve water supply and sanitation services in Haapsalu; (e) improve the operational efficiency and
management systems of the Haapsalu Water Works (HWW); (f) promote managemnent of point and non-
point source pollution from the catchment area of Matsalu Bay; and (g) promote environmentally
sustainable management and development of the Matsalu Bay and its catchment area.
18.        Program Objective Categories. The proposed Project could contribute to achievement ot the
Govrnnment's environmental objectives through reduction of point source poilution in Haapsalu bay,
reduction of point and non-point source pollution in the Matsalu Bay catchment area by supporting the
decentralization of enviromnental management responsibilities to county and municipal govermnents. The
proposed Project would also assist the Govermnent's public policy reform by supporting "municipalized"
public services, the creation of autonomous utilities, and development of sound financing of these
services.
19.        Proiect Description. The proposed Project would be implemented over four years as an
enviromnental management project for the coastal area of western Estonia. It would consist of a Water
and Wastewater Improvement Component (WWIC) and an Environmental Management Component
(EMC). The WWIC would consist of: (a) rehabilitation and expansion of the Haapsalu water and
wastewater system, including equipment and works along with engineering services; and (b) institutional
strengthening and training to assist in establishing an autonomous and financially independent water and
wastewater utility in Haapsalu. This would include assistance for tariff restructuring/tariff planning and
financial operations. The EMC would consist of: (a) technical and financial support through the MOE



for the implementation of selected elements of the Management Plan for Matalu State Nature Reserve
by coordinating and providing funding for identified investments such as access roads, observation
towers, information boards etc.; (b) design and implementation of a program of cost-effective activities
to reduce point and non-point source pollution of Matsalu Bry from small settlements and agriculture;
and (c) support for planning and management of eco-tourism.
20.        Project Implementation. The Project would be implemented under the general supervision
of the Ministry of Environment (MOE). A Project Steering Committee (PSC) iras been established to
provide overall guidance for the proposed project, chaired by a representative of Uane County, consistent
with Estonian decentralization policies. The implementation of the WWIC has been delegated to the
HWW. To implement this component, a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been established within
the HWW. The EMC would be coordinated and managed by the MOE with assistance of the Area Task
Team (ATT) for the Matsalu Bay Area consisting of representatives of the cooperating county
govermnents, Matsalu State Nature Reserve, Tallinn Technical University, Estonian Fund for Nature, and
the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Inplementation of the EMC would be carried out by the
MOE, local authorities and WWF.
21.        Project Financing. The project cost is estimated at US $8.37 million equivalent (including
taxes), with a foreign exchange component of US $4.48 equivalent (or 54 percent). The Bank would
finance US $2.0 million equivalent (45 percent of the foreign exchange costs and 24 percent of the total).
Parallel grant cofinancing by the Governnents of Denmark (US $600,000 equivalent), Finland (US $1.02
million equivalent), and Sweden (US $1.93 million equivalent), and the EU (PHARE) (US $300,000
equivalent), compriues about 46 percent of the costs. As it is desirable that the PIU becomes operation
as soon as possible, up to US $100,000 (or 5 percent of the loan amount) of eligible expenditures
incurred for PIU acti, dties starting from March 1, 1995 could be submitted for retroactive financing. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Estonia are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map (No. 26164) is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
(Report No. 13907 EE), dated March 15, 1995, is being distributed separately.
22.        Agreed Actions. Prior to negotiations, the following conditions were fulfilled: (a) HWW
had prepared an Action Plan which stated the utility's institutional development plan for the near and
medium future; and (b) a Director had been appointed for the PIU. During negotiations it was agreed
that: (a) HWW would enter into a twinning arrangement with a reputable foreign water supply and
sewerage utility; (b) HWW would not contract management functions of the utility to third parties, unless
appropriate competitive procedures agreed with the Bank had been followed; (c) HWW would increase
its tariffs by 19 percent in real terms duiring calendar year 1995; and (d) HWW would maintain an
operating ratio below 85 percent. Conditions for effectiveness of the proposed loan are that: (a) all
conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the BITS and Govemment of Finland grants have been
fulfilled; (b) a subsidiary loan agreement be executed between the GOE and HWW; and (c) HWW have
appointed a manager, accountant and bilingual secretary for the PIU.
23.        Environental Aspects. hIplervientation of the proposed Project would have positive
environmental benefits through: (a) reductioxi of untreated wastewater discharges to the Baltic Sea;
(b) amelioration of water quality in the town of Haapsalu; (c) pollution reduction in the Haapsalu and
Matsalu Bays; and (d) protection of Matsalu State Nature Reserve thrugh effective enviromnental
management. The proposed Project has been placed in environmental screening category "B". An



- 6 -
environmental review consistent with the provisions of the requirements of the Estonian "Order on
Carrying Out Environmental Impact Assessment" and the provisions of World Bank Operational Directive
4.01 "Environmental Assessment" has been prepared for the WWIC. Supplemental environmental
reviews would be prepared as part of the detailed planning process for activities supported under the
EMC. The proposed Project would not involve involuntary resettlement and is not anticipated to havc
an impact on known archaeological or historical sites in Haapsalu or the Matsalu Reserve.
24.        Participatory Anproach. The preparation of the water and wastewater component of the
proposed Project has been carried out in close cooperation with the MOE, MOH and HWW, thus
strengthening their capacity for project implementation in the future. The work of the consultants was
supervised by a steering group that included representatives of the MOE, MOH, HWW, the Swedish and
Finnish Ministries of Environment, and the Bank. This process included regular consultation with
representatives of the locally elected City Council. The EMC was developed with the participation of the
ATT and the management plan for the Matsalu State Nature Reserve was prepared by a joint Estonian-
WWF team. The management !lan includes specific provisions for the participation of local residents in
its inplementation, including vgetation maintenance and reed harvesting programs.
25.        Project Benefits. The benefits of the WWIC would include: (a) improvements in water
quality through reduction of leakages of wastewater into the groundwater and reduction in discharges of
untreated and partially treated wastewater, thereby improving water quality in Haapsalu Bay, providing
protection for the curative mud deposits and allowing for recreational use of the waters; (b) reductions
in operating costs and maintenance requirements in the water and wastewater systems; and
(c) improvement in the quality and reliability of the services through establishment of an autonomous
water and wastewater utility. The benefits of the EMC would include: (a) strengthened overall project
coordination and implementation capacity in the MOE; (b) support for the MOE's efforts to decentralize
project management and implementation to local authorities; (c) expanded recreational use of beaches and
waters around Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays through reducing pollution; (d) upgrading of environmental
management of the Matsalu State Nature Reserve; (e) provision of a basis for a long-term program to
control non-point sources of pollution affecting Matsalu Bay; and (f) expanding the opportunities for
environmentally sound tourism in western Estonia.
26.        Pro=ect Sustainability. Important elements in assuring sustainability for the WWIC include:
(a) timely implementation by HWW of the agreed implementation plan, which would promote the
establishment of an autonomous and efficient utility; and (b) development and maintenance of a realistic
tariff structure for municipal and industrial users of the water and wastewater systern. The sustainability
of the EMC would be determined by: (a) strengthening of the MOE; (b) the level of coordination between
the MOE, cooperating county and local govermnents, and cooperating non-governmental organizations;
(c) the level of local participation in design and implementation of activities; and (d) the development of
a solid implementation structure for the long-tenn management of Matsalu State Nature Reserve; and
(e) the development of a management structure for point and non-point source pollution in the Matsalu
Bay catchment area.
27.        Risks. The main risks are: (a) the commitment and ability of the Haapsalu City Council to
support an independently managed water and wastewater utility which may interfere, interalia, with the
commnitment of the Municipality of Haapsalu to adjust tariffs; and (b) possible resistance from local
governments and private landowners to reconunended actions to manage point and non-point source
pollution in the Matsalu Bay catchment. These risks would reduced by: (a) carefully monitoring the
requirements for tariff incrases and providing significant institutional devclopment support to the utility



-7 -
to improve its financial management practices; (b) ensuring appropriate project managemnent arrangements
are in place in a timely manner; and (c) incorporation of an active local participation process in
development and implementation of the proposed management activities for Matsalu State Nature Reserve
and the Matsalu Bay catchmnent.
28.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
