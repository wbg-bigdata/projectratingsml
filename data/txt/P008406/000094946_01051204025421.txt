3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The original objectives of the Project were:
1. To strengthen the MOE's capacity to coordinate and implement environmental projects;
2. Reduce discharge of partially treated and untreated sewage in to the Baltic Sea;
3. Restore and enhance the surface and groundwater quality in Haapsalu area;
4. Improve quality, reliability and cost-efficiency of water supply and sanitation services ..n
Haapsalu;
5. Improve operational efficiency and management in Haapsalu Veevark (HV);
6. Promote management of point and non-point source pollution from catchment area of Matsalu
Bay; and
7. Promote environmentally sustainable management and development of ecologically uni que and
sensitive areas around Matsalu Bay and adjacent coastal areas.
Project objectives were clear and realistic. They were in line with both national priorities and the
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), and was based on extensive field visits jointly
conducted by Estonian and Bank specialists. Although its title indicates that this was an
environment project, the real developmental impact was much broader: improvement in
environmental quality, better water and sewerage services, improved water company
management, development of utility staff skills. Project Component B, Environmental
Management, eventually became a participatory community development project through
involvement of local communities and relevant stakeholders in the management of protected area.
The project was co-financed by the Government of Estonia (GoE), Haapsalu Municipality,
Governments of Sweden, Finland and Denmark, and the World Bank. The Worldwide Fu ad for
Nature (WWF) also served as a partner in the design and implementation process. Althou 3,h the
number of financiers was relatively high, the Beneficiary proved its ability to manage multiple
sources of financing and to follow the respective procurement guidelines. As a result of highly
efficient procurement, substantial savings were achieved.
3.2 Revised Objective:
N/A
3.3 Original Components:
The project consisted of two complementary components:
1.    Component A. Water and Wastewater Improvement:
(a)   Support to Project Implementation Unit
(b)   Water Supply and Distribution
(c)   Sewerage Networks
(d)   Wastewater Treatment Plant
-2-



e)   Technical Assistance and Training (twinning)
2.    Component B. Environmental Management:
(a)   Matsalu State Nature Reserve
(b)   Matsalu catchment area (excl. Lihula),
(c)   Lihula
(d)   Eco-tourism.
The components were reasonably related to the objectives achieved. This was the Bank's first
operation of this kind in Estonia since the country joined the Bank after regaining independence
in 1991. Both components contained adequate actions to build the Borrower's administrative and
financial management capacity. Under Component A, this included a grant financed twinning
arrangement with a Swedish water utility, TA support to the Project Implementation Unit, and
courses on procurement and disbursement conducted by Bank Staff at the beginning of Project
implementation. Under Component B, the capacity of the Matsalu State Nature Reserve to
promote local community development sound environmental management techniques was built
through implementation of management plan for Matsalu Bay, which was prepared in close
cooperation with WWF-Sweden.
3.4 Revised Components:
There were only a few revisions of the project components. The development of the eco-tourism
plan was dropped, and became a part of the Management Plan for the Matsalu State nature
Reserve. It should be noted that technical assistance (TA) to Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
was reduced to a minimum, which shows that the staff hired for the PIU was fully capable to leam
the procurement and disbursement procedures before the project became effective.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality at entry was satisfactory. QAG did not review this project. The project was developed
to address Estonian national environmental priorities, and was consistent with the country
economic memorandum (CEM). The project was prepared by an interdisciplinary team that
included the participation of representatives of the Governments of Estonia, Finland and Sweden;
World Bank and WWF. The Public Expenditure Review (PER), supported by the World Bank
chaired donor conference held in Paris, endorsed implementation of a limited number of priority
environmental investments, provided that such investments were complemented by institutional
strengthening activities. The project was consistent with the objectives and recommendations of
the Environmental Action Plan for Central and Eastern Europe (Environment for Europe), and
with the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Program (JCP) of the Helsinki
Commission.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
4.1.1 The overall outcome of the project is satisfactory. It achieved all its objectives, except for
that of attaining full cost recovery by Haapsalu Veevark by the closing date. Projected
contributed to improvement of the state of the Baltic Sea by reducing direct discharge of
untreated wastewater, and improved treatment efficiency at the rehabilitated wastewater treatment
- 3 -



lant so that the effluent meets all HELCOM recommendations. Environmental management
component, which was implemented in cooperation with WWF contributed to introduction of
sustainable coastal zone management techniques in the Matsalu State nature Reserve. The Water
and Wastewater Improvement Component accomplished even more in physical and management
improvements than originally planned, and the activities under the Environmental Management
Component provided a major opportunity for the empowerment of local communities. S4inificant
skills were developed by the Haapsalu Veevark in project planning and management, incl. ding
procurement and disbursement.
4.1.2 The project established a framework for:
Long-term sustainable operation of the Haapsalu Veevark, which is providing the
inhabitants of Haapsalu with quality water and wastewater services.
Gradual improvement of water quality in the Matsalu and Haapsalu Bays.
Improved environmental management practices at municipal and local levels withi. E the
project area.
Small scale farm level activities to reduce non-point pollution from cattle breeding farms
4.1.3 Throughout the project, the Bank maintained its strategic positions to support:
Preventive measures to avoid any project induced negative environmental impacts through
the use of policy and regulatory measures and environmental assessments.
Application of environmental management methods and economic instruments to utility
management and coastal zone management.
Development of cost effective measures to mitigate water pollution, land use and
protected area management issues.
4.1.4 At the time of project preparation, the water consumption volumes were expected tc, remain
at 1995 levels up until 2010, whereas actual consumption dramatically decreased, from 15 3 to 79
liters per capita/day, corresponding to the sales drop from 961,000 thousand m3 in 1995 to
542,000 m3 in 1999 (Figure 1). Sales stabilized at this level only in 2000. This is consistent with
the trends in similar water and wastewater projects in Liepaja and Daugavapils in Latvia, and
Klaipeda and Siauliai in Lithuania. There is a need to evaluate the factors that cause such a
dramatic consumption responses to changes in water prices, their impacts on water utilitie;> and on
various water users.

4.1.5 The project was placed in Environmental Screening Category B, since it focused on
improving the environinental conditions on Estonia's Baltic Sea coast through both preventive and
curative measures. Activities proposed under the project were recognized by the cooperating
parties of having only an insignificant negative environmental impacts. Potential environmental
impacts were reviewed for each civil works contract, and adequate mitigation measures were
subsequently implemented. The project was subject to regular field based review by qualified
Bank and donor environmental staff. The implementation of the project was in compliance with
the provisions of OD 4.01 (as of March 1999 - OP4.01). It should be noted that no involuntary
resettlement or land acquisition was required.
4.2 Outputs bkv conmponents:
The outputs are the following:
4.2.1. Component A - Water and Wastewater Management Improvements
4.2.1.1. After completion of the Project, more than 90% of Haapsalu citizens are now connected
to water and sewerage network. This is a 23% increase compared to the pre-project situation,
when only two thirds of population were connected to water and wastewater networks. As a
result of the Project:
The wastewater treatment plant was upgraded to meet the prescribed treatmnent
recommendations;
24 pumping stations were successfully rehabilitated;
- 5 -



6 pumping stations were newly built;
1250 m of sewers were rehabilitated,
12120 meters of sewers were laid;.
*   4990 meters of water supply pipes were laid.
4.2.1.2. The project design included several sub-components within the Water and Wastewvater
Improvement component, and these included a total of eleven rather loosely defined contract
items ranging from the technical assistance to equipment supply and to rehabilitation and
construction contracts. The loose definition proved to be beneficial, as it soon turned out that
more resources should be addressed to rehabilitating pumping stations and extending the service
networks than originally planned. The other factor contributing to substantial cost savings was
that Estonian contractors, rather than Western, were able to win the ICB contracts, which were
denominated in EEK. What started as wastewater treatment improvement and emergency
rehabilitation activities to ensure minimum service reliability, soon developed to encompass also a
program to modernize the pumping systems yielding significant energy cost savings, See Annex 2
for full list of accomplished activities.
4.2.1.3. Displaying initiative and ownership Haapsalu Veevark was able to achieve savings in a
number of sub-components, which were then utilized in the pumping modernization and sewerage
network extension components. The resulting energy savings (which are in range of 30-50%
compared to pre-project situation) are significant when looked at in the individual pumping
stations. However, the energy consumption of the wastewater treatment plant is so overwhelming
that the Haapsalu Veevirk overall energy consumption has increased as a consequence of the
project. The present indicators are 0.8 kWh/m3 for the potable water service and about 2.0
kWh/m3 for the wastewater service.
4.2.1.4 The main activities under the water and wastewater improvement component, the
completion of the wastewater treatment plant, was implemented as planned, and the recorded
discharges fully meet the planned targets.
4.2.1.5. The dimensioning flow of the plant had been designed as 7240 m3/d, while the average
incoming flow presently is about 3000 m3/d. This is the result of the unforeseen water denmand
collapse. During the project preparation the collapse was not yet evident, although industrial
consumption had fallen a little. There was indication obtained from the comparison to the Western
demand figures that a larger correction would come, but the balancing was thought to take 20
years or more. The swiftness of how the water demand collapsed was unprecedented.
The treatment results and the effluent loads are presented below.

4.2.2. Component B. Environmental Management:
In general, implementation of the component has been satisfactory, and most of the envisaged
activities were implemented.
4.2.2.1.    Implementation of the Management Plan in Matsalu State Nature Reserve is a
continuous and cyclic process, which is oriented on sustainable management of semi-natural
coastal meadows. The most significant expenditure within the general project framework was
the purchase and subsequent leasing of machinery to individual farmers through a tendering
procedure. The selected farmers were then contracted to manage certain plots of semi-natural
grasslands (depending on each holding) with the new machinery. The farmers were responsible
for covering all operating and maintenance costs associated with the use of this machinery.
Altogether, 6 tractors and 5 mowers were procured using grant financing provided by EU Phare,
Sida and Ramsar Convention Bureau. Also, at least 4 bird watch towers were built, and
information material is being distributed to visitors of the Reserve.
4.2.2.2.    As a result of project, the overgrowing of coastal grasslands was halted. This was
achieved through a grassland management scheme covering approximately 2000 hectares, and
which included Government support to local farmers for keeping adequate numbers of animals (I
cow or horse and two sheep per hectare). Additionally, similar area was covered by the mowing
scheme, when farmers are compensated for each hectare mowed. Implementation of this scheme
is a substantial achievement in preserving the coastal meadows. The current level of support to
farmers corresponds to the possibilities of the Government, and is enhanced through extemal
support. In future, the grazing and mowing areas need to be increased.
4.2.2.3.    Using the grant financing from Denmark and Finland, 7 small wastewater
treatment plants have been built in settlements of Roude, Martna, Koluvere, Kullamaa,
Tuudi-Liivi, Lihula, and Kirbla. In Martna and Tuudi-Liivi the plants operate without any major
problems, while in Kirbla it has been shut down because due to poor conditions of the sewer
network the infiltration was intolerably high. As a result of that the plant was not able to treat the
high volume of incoming water. Ministry of Environment is seeking funds for to assist the Kirbla
municipality in fixing the problem. In other settlements the plants are operational, though require
close supervision by assigned technicians, as the treatment process due to minor design
deficiencies has to be closely monitored. The experience gained with construction and operation
of the small wastewater treatment plants confirms the conclusions obtained in Haapsalu, i.e.
- 7 -



nvestments shall be commensurate with the affordability levels of the population being served. It
should be noted that the application of ecological engineering approaches in wastewater treatment
was envisaged for Martna. Unfortunately, this did not materialize, and a conventional treatment
plant has been built.
4.2.2.4.    The next step in reducing the point source pollution would be improvemen. of the
pipeline networks in all townships which benefited from the Project, and to address the slhdge
disposal problem.
4.2.2.5.     Within franework of the Component B, the Swedish Agricultural University in
cooperation with Estonian Ministry of Environment launched a program aimed at reducing run-off on
nutrients from live stock farms in Matsalu catchment area. The project contains training, investment and
monitoring modules. It is anticipated that the project will be continued within the framework of the GEF
supported Baltic Sea Regional Project, which currently is under preparation.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
4.3.1. The end-of-the-project Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for baseline case is 4.3 percent
which is below the conventional threshold of 12 percent. The main reason for the low rate of
return was significant reduction in water sales and the resulting decrease in operating revenues
during the project period. Total water sales in Haapsalu were 15% lower than SAR projections
during 1995-99 (3.4 million mr vs. 3.9 million m in SAR), while per capita domestic watex
consumption declined from 153 Ipcd to 79 Ipcd during the same period - a 49 percent decrease.
Total water production of the HW declined 32% during the period of 1995 to 1999.
Unaccounted for water increased from 20 percent to 28 percent, which can be contributed to
increasing network pipeline, while water losses per one meter of network pipeline have decreased
during the project period (see Table 1).

4.3.2. More aggressive than planned tariff adjustment (in real terms) was not able to compensate
for large decline in water sales. Total operating revenues were only 80 percent of the appraisal

stimate over the life of the project (EEK 39 million versus EEK 49 million estimated at
appraisal). Total operating costs on the other hand were about 20 percent higher than SAR
estimates (EEK 28 million versus EEK 23 million of appraisal estimate), although the cost
estimates merged by 1999 (Figure 2). The operating costs per m of water sold have however
increased more than two-fold (from 4.5 EEKm 3in 1995 to 12.5 EEK/m3in 1999), mainly as a
result of declining water consumption. The rnain reasons for higher operating costs were rapid
escalation of input prices (in real terms), especially materials and supplies, heating costs and
electricity. The latter reflects the commissioning of the new wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)
and the adjacent office building. Labor costs have increased in spite of the gradually decreasing
staff.

4.3.3. As a result of above, the operating margin for the project period was some 40 percent of
the SAR projections during the project (EEK 11 million compared to appraisal estimate of EEK
26 million).
4.3.4. The company has not been able to reach satisfactory financial performance in spite of rapid
tariff escalation. Operating margin, a major indicator for capital cost recovery, changed little over
the course of the project and was below the target level of 50 percent, which is required for full
cost recovery. Other financial indicators (working ratio) showed also only a modest improvement
at the best (Figure 3).

4.3.5. The audited net profits were positive from 1995 to 1998. However, net profits are
somewhat overestimated, since they did not include depreciation of grant financed assets. Net
profit for 1999 was negative due to rapidly increasing interest cost, comprising not only the base
interest but also the loss from exchange rate depreciation. For example, the interest payment at
SAR exchange rate was 2.1 million EEK in 1999 leaving 2.9 million EEK for the currency loss.
4.3.6. The company has fulfilled the expectations of SAR regarding tariff escalation in real terms
(Table 2). However, tariff adjustment was not sufficient enough to compensate for declining
water sales. Tariff escalation in Haapsalu since 1995 has been rapid, and has exceeded the SAR
expectations. Current tariff level has reached EEK 24 mi, (around 3 German marks) which is the
highest in Estonia and Baltic countries, which is comparable to tariffs in Western and Nortnern
Europe. In relation to the present level the nominal rise has been more than four-fold since the
beginning of the project.

4.3.6. In spite of aggressive tariff increases, the share of expenditures on water-sewerage
services, however, has been declining during the project period, as nominal incomes per
household members have been increasing at average rate of 13 percent per year (Table 3).

4.3.8. The baseline economic analysis, described above, is based on conservative approach which
treats all project investments as costs by ignoring the way how they are financed (i.e. equity,
grant, loan, cash flow). Moreover, the ERR substantially understates the total economic benefits
-11-



enerated by the project since it does not take into account the various environmental ar d health
benefits and increased property values associated with the improved water quality in Haapsalu and
the coastal waters of Haapsalu Bay.
The project team did not attempt to evaluate the health benefits arising from improved water
quality due to the lack of knowledge of the dose-response function. Nor it was able to estimate
economic benefits associated with increased property values. However, the economic a aialysis
was expanded by taking into account the portion of environmental benefits that correspc nd to the
improved water quality in the Haapsalu Bay due to the reduced discharges of nutrients as a result
of the project.
The project team assumed that economic benefits of environmental improvement of Haapsalu Bay
are not related to a reduction in nutrient load or nutrient concentration per se, but to the reduction
of eutrophication effects that in one way or another affect people's well being. For examlple,
reduced eutrophication of coastal waters in the bay area would likely generate significan. direct
use benefits, which are related to people's recreation activities, since increased algal bloo Hns and a
changed composition of the algae flora may affect peoples' utility from swimming, angling,
birdwaching, etc. Using the total economic value (TEV) framework, one can thus measuire how
much individuals are willing to pay (WTP) for improvement in environmental quality in t?ie bay
what individuals really care about, i.e. increased water visibility, aesthetic beauty, improv'ed fish
catch, etc. Aggregating WTP across individuals who would directly benefit from this
environmental improvement gives a measure of the total environmental benefits, which will be a
part of the project economic analysis.
Because competitive markets for environmental goods and services do not exist, non-market
valuation techniques have been developed to estimate the environmental benefits. HoweN;er, only
the contingent valuation method (CVM) is able to capture the total economic value of
environmental services. A CVM application requires first a description of a change of th
provision of the environmental good. This description is then communicated to a sample of
individuals by the use of survey instruments. Questions are usually posed about subject's
willingness to pay (WTP) for a realization of a change in the environmental quality. Actual
transactions including monetary payments do not take place.
Several applications of CVM have been carried out in Baltic Sea countries, although no studies
have been carried out in Estonia yet. The cost benefit analysis carried out in Sweden to e valuate
policies that would reduce eutrophication of the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea used the average
annual estimate of SEK 3,000 (5,400 EEK) per person as a mean estimate of WTP to recuce the
eutrophication in the Baltic Sea over the 20 year period (I-M Gren, T. Soderqvist, F. Wulff, S.
Langaas, M. Sandstr6m, and C. Folke. 1996. Reduced Nutrient Loads to the Baltic Sea
Ecological Consequences, Costs and Benefits. Beijer International Institute of Ecological
Economics, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm, Sweden.) A number of C'VM
studies have been carried out in Poland, and one survey was also implemented in Lithuan.a (See
Markowska, A. and T. Zylicz. 1996. Costing an International Public Good: The Case of the Baltic
Sea. Mimeo, Warsaw Ecological Economics Center, Warsaw University.) These studies found
that the mean annual WTP estimate to reduce the eutrophication in the Baltic Sea in those
- 12 -



ountries was about SEK 300 (540 EEK) per person. This should be also comparable to the
WTP in Estonia given the equal level of incomes in those countries. Finally, a recent study carried
out in Sweden estimated the economic benefits from improved water visibility in the Stockholm
archipelago (T. Soderqvist and H. Scharin. 2000 The regional willingness to pay for a reduced
eutrophication in the Stockholm archipelago. Beijer International Institute of Ecological
Economics, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm, Sweden). The mean annual WTP
for increased recreational amenities through improved water visibility over the 10 year period was
SEK 725 (EEK 1,300) per year, which is about 0.5 percent from mean annual personal net
income. The conservative estimate of the annual WTP was SEK 436 EEK 785 per person (or 0.3
percent from mean annual personal net income), assuming that non-respondents are zero bidders.
It should be noted that in Swedish study water quality was already relatively good for swimming
and fishing purposes (i.e. recreation amenities people value the most). In Haapsalu, under the
baseline case the water quality was so poor that it led to closure of beaches for bathing. Since the
beginning of the project the water quality has improved significantly and meets now all key
HELCOM targets. Hence, individual's (relative) WTP is higher. Therefore, the WTP of 0.5
percent, as it was assumed in Swedish study, is a conservative estimate for Haapsalu, where such
a significant improvement in water quality was achieved.
Since implementation of CVM study is costly and time consuming undertaking, the project team
used benefit transfer method to derive people's WTP estimates for the improvement of water
quality in Haapsalu Bay as a result of reduced discharges of nutrients from city's sewerage system.
For example, assuming that the people's WTP in Haapsalu for improvement in water quality in
Haapsalu Bay is 0.5 percent from their annual net income, the annual WTP for the improvement
of water quality would be thus 110 EEK per person (the net annual income per household
member in Haapsalu in 1999 was 22,260 EEK). For comparison, the cost of water and
wastewater tariffs in Haapsalu is currently about 4 percent from net income. The total WTP (or
economic benefits) for improved water quality in Haapsalu Bay in 1999 amounts thus some 1.5
mill. EEK.
The total WTP for the whole period of 1995 to 2010 was calculated based on two scenarios - (a)
annual total WTP is calculated as 0.5 percent of net annual income or EEK 70 -190 per person;
and (b) WTP is 540 EEK per person for adult population only. The results of the economic
analysis under these two scenarios are presented in Table 5. Under scenario (a) the ERR
increases almost two-fold compared to baseline case (no environmental benefits included), i.e.
from 4.3% to 7.8%. The ERR increases to 15 percent under scenario (b) where annual peoples'
WTP estimates is assumed to be EEK 540 per person for adult population of Haapsalu, which is
about 2.5 percent from net income. It should be noted that total WTP increases with the net per
capita income and population size.

Figure 4 presents the results of sensitivity analysis of ERR under different assumptions of WTP as
a share of net income of beneficiary population (direct users). The target ERR of 12 percent can be
achieved with the    annual WTP of EEK 150 - 410 per person, which is about 1. I percent from net
income. Total WTP, and thus economic benefits, increase also with the number of users of
environmental amenity, which may include  not only the population of Haapsalu, but visitors from other
parts of Estonia and from abroad (i.e. mostly from Finland and Sweden). The WTP of the latter may be
even higher, since demand for environmental quality increases with income.

It should be noted, though, that economic valuation of environmental benefits as carried out
above is not able to capture the full value of environmental services, which generate also
significant non-use benefits (i.e. existence, bequest, and option values). Therefore, the WTP
estimates for the direct use of environmental amenity (i.e. recreation in this case), should be
considered as a conservative lower bound estimate of the TEV of environmental improvement of
Haapsalu Bay, given the complexity of the environmental ecosystem functions and benefits they
generate.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial rate of return (FRR) was not calculated for the Project. Ex-post analysis shows that
end-of the-Project Financial Rate of Return would be 4.8 %, and the details are described in
section 4.3.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project had a significant institutional development impact at a number of complementary
levels that will carry beyond the objectives of the completed project. The most important impacts
were having the cooperating organizations: (a) move from a "reactive" to a "proactive" approach
in undertaking their work; (b) recognize the need for a diversity of parties to undertake, plan and
manage tasks; and (c) open themselves to new ways of doing things. The most pervasive
comment from project participants was that "it changed the way we think."
4.5. 1. Ministry of Environment.

The Ministry developed skills in planning and management of large internationally funded
projects that include both investment and institutional development activities. This
experience has already been successfully applied to a number of additional projects
supported by the Bank, European Union and bilateral donors.
The Ministry gained operational experience in the use of decentralized approaches to
project planning and management of projects that allow the regional offices of the
Ministry, municipal governments, water and wastewater utilities and local communities to
take an active role in these activities.
The Ministry significantly improved its skills in preparation of Terms of Reference anti
Technical Specifications, in evaluation and selection of consultants and in negotiation of
contracts for goods and services. It also gained experience in the management of financial
resources from multiple sources and the application of a diversity of procurement
procedures.
The Ministry gained experience in transforming various government owned services i Ito
companies that can improve their management and increase the cost effectiveness of
operations. It also carefully observed the activities undertaken under the project and has
advised the Bank that it would like to have other water utilities in Estonia prepare
strategic plans given the positive experience from the Haapsalu Veevark.
4.5.2. Municipality of Haapsalu
The Municipality of Haapsalu, during the course of the project, developed skills in
planning, management, negotiation and implementation of internationally funded
investment and institutional development projects.
The Municipal Government learned about complex issues related to sound utility
management, including the process of tariff adjustment, loan repayments and properly
funding operation and maintenance of investments under market economy conditions, It
leamed about measures that can be used to protect parties on low and/or fixed incomes
from adverse impacts associated with changes in the rates for services, including water and
wastewater.
4.5.3. Haapsalu Veevark
As a result of the project, the Haapsalu Veevark became an independent enterprise under
Estonian law and now operates on commercial principles. It is independent of the
Municipality of Haapsalu, has its own Board of Directors and is able to obtain funding on
its own. Although tariffs are still set with approval of the City Council, it is moving toward
financial autonomy.
Although the management structure in Haapsalu Veevark is modern, the owners,
- 16 -



anagement and staff are still in the process of learning how to obtain the maximum
benefits from these arrangements. Ministries of Environment and Finance shall be ready to
extend support and advise to Haapsalu Veevark as required, especially during the loan
repayment period.
The Haapsalu Veevark has prepared and is in the process of implementing a strategic plan
that provides a framework for improvement of the legal basis of the Company,
management of operations, upgrading of physical facilities and development of human
resources. The Company found that the strategic planning process was very important in
assisting it to identify priorities and develop its vision for the future in a structured
manner. The strategic plan has also made it easier for the management of the Company to
deal with the Municipal Government and its Board of Directors.
4.5.4. Matsalu State Nature Reserve
Implementation of the Management Plan in Matsalu State nature reserve has developed
into a continuous and cyclic process. The biggest accomplishment of this particular
project is that the management of the reserve is now skilled enough to manage both
natural and economic processes. It is well positioned to raise and manage funds in a
sustainable way, and to cooperate with international partners thus contributing to
conservation of globally important biodiversity.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
As Estonian Kroon is pegged to German Mark at rate 1:8, the Haapsalu Veevark faces substantial
financial problems due to sharp appreciation of dollar against Euro (EU). At appraisal the
USD/EEK exchange rate was 1:12.66, and it was anticipated that it will remain unchanged
throughout project implementation. Unfortunately, dollar started to appreciate against Kroon in
1996, and at the time of finalizing this report the exchange rate has reached about 17 EEK for one
dollar.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
In general, government through Ministries of Environment and Finance carefully monitored the
progress of project implementation. An important factor in project success was the stability of
senior management in the Ministry of Environment throughout the preparation and
implementation period. This allowed to solve the working level problems as soon as they
appeared. Ministry of Finance, at some periods had difficulty in providing the counterpart funds in
a timely manner. However, by end of the project, all the commitments were fully met. Ministry of
Finance is ready to provide the necessary support to Haapsalu Veevark in overcoming the
difficulties in repaying the loan, which are associated with devaluation of EEK against USD.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
5.3. 1. Component A. Water and Wastewater Improvement. The Project Implementation
through skillful application of Bank's Procurement Guidelines was able to save substantial
amounts of loan funds, which later were reallocated to other components, mainly network
extension on Vonnu and Endla streets. However, the bid evaluation reports were not always
- 17-



lear and exhaustive. That's why in some cases award of bids took longer than normally would
have been expected. Municipality, the owner of the Haapsalu Veevark, was supportive to the new
ideas and suggestions made by the Bank and co-financiers during the supervision missions.
Implementation of these ideas was left for the staff of Haapsalu Veevark and the twinning
partners, and results were not often immediate.
5.3.2. Component B. Environmental Management. The component benefited from the
sustained commitment of the Ministry of Environment to undertake this activity in a decentnilized
manner and to effectively engage a wide range of stakeholders. The willingness of Estonian
counterparts, at all levels, to combine physical and environment planning concepts and innova tive
community based participatory approaches for protected areas management have made a major
difference in the quality of this activity.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Project did not experience major cost overruns. However, some reallocations took place among
the sub-components, as described in Sections 3.4 and Annex 2. This allowed adjustment of
project implementation to match the changing real time situation, and maximize utilization of the
available funding - both grants and loans. Cooperating donors provided their funds in a timely
manner and closely coordinated with the Bank and Estonian authorities on financial matters
through regular contacts with the Task Manager and their participation in the supervision
missions.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating.
Sustainability of the project, under both components, is "likely" due to the following
considerations:
Component A - Water and Wastewater Improvement
The Haapsalu Veevark has a stable management structure and is committed to improving
services to its clients with due respect for existing affordability limits.
As a result of the project, particularly the twinning agreement, the staff of the Haapsalu
Veevark has considerably improved its skills and is open to adopt new innovative
management approaches and operational techniques. The company has developed a
strategic plan which it intends to follow in their management planning.
The Haapsalu Veevark is committed to achieve environmental standards and has a good
knowledge of the requirements of the European Union, Helsinki Commission and
Government of Estonia.
The Haapsalu Municipality, as an owner, consistently supports the Haapsalu Veevark
through timely tariff adjustments, and avoids passing decisions that would damage the
operations and financial conditions of the Company.
- 18 -



The Government of Estonia is committed to change the legal environment for operations
of water companies has been consistently improving.
From loan repayment point of view, the period of 2001-2003 will be critical for Haapsalu
Veevark, as the debt service cost will be the highest. During this period the Haapsalu
Veevark may not able to finance the replacement investment needs from its own cash
flow. The company will, however, be able to fully finance all operation and maintenance
costs, including investments financed by the project. It should be noted that the company
should be able to service its loan payments despite of exchange rate appreciation if it cuts
its replacement investments to minimum during this time period. Ministry of Finance is
aware of the problem and is on "stand-by" position, ready to step in if Haapsalu Veevark
would face difficulties in repaying the loan.
The Government of Estonia is committed to help, as appropriate, the Haapsalu Veevfrk to
overcome the difficulties in repaying the loan, which are caused by sharp appreciation of US
dollar against Estonian Kroon.
Component B - Environmental Management
The Ministry of Environment has adopted a decentralized approach to environmental
planning and management that has been reinforced by the experience gained under the
Environmental Management Component of the Project.
A large number of parties at the various levels of governance now have experience with
the use of participatory community based planning and management approaches for
protected areas management that were demonstrated under the Component and these have
already been applied in other activities.
*    The Baltic Sea Regional Project will support expansion of community based approaches to
implementation of coastal zone management on the basis of the successful experience
under the Haapsalu Matsalu Bays Environment Project, with additional interventions in
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and the Russian Federation.
The proposed Baltic Sea Regional Project, financed by the GEF, the donor contributions
and NEFCO loan, will build on the activities carried out to date in Matsalu catchment area
by Swedish Agricultural University (SLU) on reducing the non-point pollution from cattle
breeding farms
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations.
Component A - Water and Wastewater Improvement. The Haapsalu Veevark has already
moved into regular operation process, as overall project implementation approach was oriented to
achieve this goal. Indicators for monitoring future operations of the Haapsalu Veevark are in
place:
- 19 -



Performance indicators include, but are not limited to:
Financial and operational:
(i)    Operating margin.
(ii)   Level of bill collection.
(iii)   Percentage of unaccounted water.
(iv)   Number of Employees per I km of network.
Environmental:
(i)    BOD.
(ii)   Suspended solids.
(iii)   N,.
(iv)   P
For more details see Annex 1. Key Performance Indicators.
The Project team is confident that the Haapsalu Veevark has matured enough during the proje zt
implementation period, and is fully capable of continuing its independent operations. Although,
the PIU was closed after completion of the project related procurement activities, the instituticnal
knowledge and history have remained in the company.
Component B - Environmental Management. This component focused on the introduction of a
series of environmental management approaches into Estonia at a variety of levels. The Matsalu
State nature reserve is already in operating "regularly" and its staff is fully equipped to continue
implementation and updating of the management plan.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.] Lending:
The Bank's performance during identification, preparation, and appraisal was satisfactory.
Identification:
-     The project was prepared as a response to a request of the Government of Estonia,
- 20 -



hich under its obligation as a Contracting Party to the Helsinki Convention and
as a national environmental priority, had committed itself to clean up of the Baltic
Sea. The project was identified, prepared and appraised in close cooperation with
the Government, as well as with the Helsinki Commission, potential donors and
the WWF.
The Bank's team represented a good mix of environmental, technical, economic
and procurement specialists with extensive knowledge of the sector and Bank
operations. The team was comprised of Headquarters and Field office based staff
who all possessed good knowledge of local conditions.
The Bank provided its assistance to the Government of Estonia in designing the
two-component project concept, which introduced market based approaches in the
water and wastewater management sector, institutional strengthening of the water
utility. and also provided for demonstration of new environmental management
approaches in the adjacent area.
Appraisal:
During appraisal, the Government of Estonia and the ultimate beneficiaries of the
project remained highly committed to the project.
In terms of components, the project design was straightforward. It was, however,
quite complex in terms of procurement and financing arrangements, as the PIU had
to follow multiple procurement and disbursement guidelines imposed by various
co-financiers and donors.
A number of risks were identified during appraisal. These included:
o     Slippage from the original schedule due to limited experience of the
Government of Estonia, Haapsalu Veevark and PIU in management and
implementation of a project of this scale and complexity. This was a
legitimate risk, but adequate measures were taken to train the respective
staff.
o     A risk that the Government of Estonia and Municipality of Haapsalu would
face difficulties in providing the counterpart funding in a timely manner. At
certain points the Government of Estonia and Municipality of Haapsalu had
difficulties in meeting their commitments, however eventually all the funds
were provided, thus avoiding any negative impact on physical
implementation of the project.
o     Lack of political commitment at the national and/or local level to transform
the Haapsalu Veevark into an independently managed water and
wastewater utility. During project implementation the Haapsalu Veevark
-21 -



as reorganized into a shareholding company.
o     Political economy factors that could interfere with commitment to adjulst
the tariffs in a timely manner. During implementation a great deal of effort
was required to make sure that tariffs were adjusted to the extent needed to
cover the operations of the Haapsalu Veevark. The tariff adjustment lhas
been formalized through introduction of a strategic planning process. In
reality, tariff increases were substantially higher than anticipated in SA R,
and currently are arnong the highest in the Baltic States.
o     Continued problems with bill collection. Bill collection rate eventual] y was
not a problem, and throughout the project implementation has remained
around 100%.
o     There were no risks anticipated in introducing the technology, and this
proved correct during project implementation as Estonian personnel v} ere
fully capable of operating and maintaining the equipment provided under
the project.
o     The major risk anticipated for the environmental management comporent
was the great number of actors involved in its implementation, and the
inability of local governments to coordinate their activities effectively.
However, these concerns did not materialize, as the Government of Estonia
and the consultants involved in implementation worked very closely tc:
achieve the project objectives, and problems if any were reported
immediately to respective authorities.
At appraisal the project cost was estimated at USD 8.37 million, of which USD 2
million came from the World Bank loan. It is the project team's opinion that the
amount of financing was adequate, as all the original project components wer2
fully implemented with only minor modifications to reflect the actual situatior. Due
to efficient procurement practices the PIU achieved savings and was able to
rehabilitate a further 1500 m of pipes and install additional energy efficient pumps (
see Annex 2).
During appraisal the Bank maintained very close relationships with prospecti\ e
co-financiers from European Union (Phare) Program; the Governments of
Finland and Sweden; and the WWF. The donor representatives were invited to
participate in the appraisal mission and to comment on project design and
implementation arrangements.
The Project Implementation Plan was adequate and provided an effective
framework for project implementation. In some cases, changes or flexibility wvere
required to address the changing realities in the field. These included realloca ion
of funds between the sub-components, or modification of the scope of contracts.
- 22 -



11 these changes were processed smoothly.
The lending instrument - currency pool loan with standard variable interest rate -
was a suitable one, though at the time of negotiations the Borrower had no other
choice as a part of the Bank's lending policy.
The project was fully consistent with the Bank safeguard policies valid at the time
of project appraisal. It was placed in environmental screening category "B" and did
not involve any involuntary resettlement or land acquisition.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank's performance during supervision was satisfactory.
Supervision missions visited Estonia regularly at 6-month intervals. In between missions,
continuous implementation support to the Borrower was extended from the Bank's Riga
and Vilnius Offices. In order to maximize the efficiency of supervision, the missions
included representatives of both the Bank and co-financiers.
The project also adopted a unified reporting process for all cooperating parties, including
the Bank, which allowed for greater efficiency in the preparation, distribution and review
of the reports by Estonian and external parties.
PSR/Form 590 consistently rated project implementation as Satisfactory. These were
realistic evaluations, and the outcome of the project, as viewed by all cooperating parties,
substantiates this view.
The Haapsalu Veevark adhered to all loan covenants, except the financial covenant.
However it should be noted that the Haapsalu Veevark until 1999 has been maintaining
reasonable cash flow, though it has not been able to reach a pre-defined level of operating
margin, which was set at 50%. For more details see Section 4.3.
During supervision the Bank and the donors exercised flexibility in adjusting the
procurement packages and their sources of financing to serve the project goals in an
effective way. It should be noted that the project benefited from using cost savings for an
expansion of project activities.
There was continuity in supervising the project. The core of the supervision team
remained constant. While task managers changed twice, the new one was selected from
the project team. Two years before project completion, task management responsibility
was transferred to the field office staff that had been part of the team since inception of the
project. Both of the previous task managers remained involved in the implementation of
the Project on an advisory basis which provided additional continuity in the Bank team.
- 23 -



Supervision was substantially supported by the short-term Finnish consultants paid
through the Consultant Trust Fund; they were instrumental in advising the Haapsalu
Veevark on financial and institutional development issues.
The project team always felt supported from Bank management, although the project cid
not require any management intervention to resolve problems. Division Chiefs, and Sector
and Country Department Directors paid several visits to Haapsalu to follow-up on the
progress of project implementation.
During Project implementation there were no deviations from Bank policies and
procedures.
7.3 Overall Bank perlormance:
The Bank's overall performance was satisfactory. Both the project team and management were.
flexible in responding to the Borrower's requests for modifications in project design, while
remaining strictly within the framework of the Bank's Operational Guidelines, Policies and
Procedures. Supervision was very closely coordinated with the co-financiers, which increased -he
quality and imnpact of the project and allowed for sharing of knowledge gained from the projec: by
all parties. The willingness of Finland to fund a resident regional environmental engineer in the
Field Office in Riga and part-time specialist consultants to support implementation contributec to
the success of the project.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's overall performance at all levels was satisfactory during the preparation phase of
the Project:
In 1995, the Government of Estonia had only very limited experience in preparing
large-scale investment and development projects and no experience with internationally
funded projects. However, there was recognition of the problems the country was facirng,
and a strong determination to resolve them in a sustainable way. Estonian counterparts
were open to new ideas, and constructive in discussing them with the Bank and other
co-financiers.
The Ministry of Environment appointed a highly qualified professional to serve as the
counterpart for the project preparation process, who was supported by a team of local
experts from Haapsalu and the Matsalu Nature Reserve area. The Estonian staff actively
participated in all meetings and field visits. They also raised issues that required
clarification concerning project planning and management, technical issues, procuremen1t
and disbursement and financial management. Personnel from the regional office of the
Ministry in Haapsalu also took an active role in these activities.
- 24 -



The Municipality of Haapsalu, acting through the mayor and city council, took an active
role in the project preparation process and assigned senior personnel from the Haapsalu
Veevark to work with the Bank and the international consultants. These parties also
worked closely with the Bank and consultants to review proposed changes in the utility's
management structure, prepare affordability studies and participate in extensive
discussions concerning proposed adjustments to tariffs for water and wastewater services.
The Haapsalu Veevark provided extensive support for project preparation and worked
closely with Bank, co-financiers and international and local consultants in the development
of detailed studies that were used to define the scope of activities included under the
Water and Wastewater Improvement Component. This support included the active
participation of Company staff in a wide range of studies, extensive site visits and field
surveys, and a large number of meetings in Haapsalu and in Tallinn.
Representatives of the Ministry, planning bodies and local governments and
non-governmental organizations participated in preparation of the Environmental
Management Component. The approach to be used for development of the coastal zone
management plan was discussed with planning and environmental bodies at the national and
local level.
7.5 Government implementation perfornmance:
The Borrower's overall performance at all levels continued to be satisfactory throughout the
implementation phase of the Project:
The Ministry of Environment closely monitored project implementation on behalf of the
Government of Estonia. While avoiding micro-management, the Ministry staff, stayed on
top of developments in Haapsalu, and was extremely helpful in those few cases when
interventions from Government were needed.
The counterpart funding from the national budget was provided on a regular basis,
although several disruptions occurred in 1998-99. By end of the project, all the
indebtedness was covered in full.
Haapsalu Municipality, as an owner of the Haapsalu Veevark had a decisive role in
implementing the project. As one of the project's co-financiers, the Municipality provided
its contributions on time. Its major responsibility, timely tariff adjustments, was associated
with certain political sensitivities, however, the tariff increases were adopted in timely
manner, and by end of the project exceeded the SAR projections considerably.
The Municipality realized the need to corporatize the Haapsalu Veevark, and actively
participated in finding the legally correct manner in which to accomplish this objective
within the changing structure of Estonian law.
- 25 -



It should be noted that Ministry of Agriculture also contributed to success of the project by
allocating EEK 500,000.00 from its budget to augment Swedish contribution on reducing the
non-point pollution activities in Matsalu catchrment area.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
As the primary implementing agency, the Haapsalu Veevark, together with its PIU had good
achievements during Project implementation that include:
The Haapsalu Veevark, including its Board of Directors, management and staff all aclively
participated in the twinning arrangement with the Haninge Water Company from Sweden
with funding from Sida. This relationship provided the Company with advisory support,
formal training and informal access to Swedish counterparts for ideas and advice on a
range of issues. This cooperation also included activities for improvement of wastewater
treatment plants and water quality laboratories. Cooperation was mutually beneficial in
developing managerial and technical skills, and will continue even after the Project is
formally completed.
The Haapsalu Veevark also took an active role in working on strategic planning and
financial management issues with the assistance of Swedish consultants. This process
resulted in preparation of a strategic plan that is being used to support further growth and
development of the Company.
The Haapsalu Veevark provided high quality construction supervision, especially for :he
installation of new pipes, which will reduce operation and maintenance costs over the long
term.
The PIU benefited initially from the procurement and disbursement training offered by, the
Bank. A t-chnical consultant to the PIU was hired to provide assistance in preparing ihe
bidding documents and evaluating the proposals, and to provide "hands-on" training to
PIU. These arrangements were very successful and resulted in significant cost savings.
The PIU maintained all the records of financial transactions in good order, which was
regularly reconfirmed by supervision missions. Annual audits were performed by aud, tors
acceptable to Bank in accordance with International Auditing Standards.
Component B - Environmental Management
International and local members of the project management team in Matsalu State Nature
Reserve co-ordinated the project very successfully. The local project leader has very good
contacts to local farmers and other important institutional stakeholders
The information meetings on project objectives, land management and the support
available to farmers living in the territory of the Reserve were clearly appreciated by tiae
- 26 -



armers.
through project implementation, a lot of good will has been build up among the local
population for the present conservation activities on Matsalu State Nature Reserve. The
local project leader and with them WWF are accepted as positive partners. This should
provide a good foundation for development and implementation future community based
participatory natural resources management projects. All interviewed respondents wanted
the WWF engagement in the area to continue.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall performance of the Borrower was satisfactory in all phases of project preparation and
implementation. The Government of Estonia and Estonian counterparts showed a consistent
commitment to achievement of the objectives of the Project and a willingness to adopt new
approaches to undertaking their work.
8. Lessons Learned
General: This section considers the most significant lessons leamed from the project which have general
applicability to the identification, preparation and implementation of other development projects.
Lessons Learned:
"Changing the Way We Think." The most important lesson is that cooperatively
planned and implemented projects that are based on mutual trust between the Bank
and Borrower can "change the way" the cooperating parties "think" about
environment and development issues. This change in thinking, as repeatedly
identified by all the participants, allowed the project to transfer new ideas and
approaches to planning and management as well as provide support for physical
investments.
- Shifting from a "Reactive" to a "Proactive" Approach. Through the use of
cooperative approaches to planning, in the development of the Strategic Plan for
the Haapsalu Veevark and the Management Plan for the Matsalu State nature
Reserve, the project allowed the cooperating parties to shift from a "reactive" to a
"proactive" approach.
Integration of targeted infrastructure investments with broader environmental
goals. The project illustrates how activities that focus on supporting infrastructure
improvements in urban areas can effectively support complementary actions in
adjacent coastal areas. While the primary focus of the project was on improvement
of water and wastewater services in Haapsalu, it included carefully selected
environmental management activities in adjacent coastal areas. This approach
allowed the investment in improved wastewater collection, treatment and disposal
to be linked with improved management of the coastal zone, and strengthening of
- 27 -



he management of protected areas.
Use of Participatory Approaches. The use of participatory approaches in th-
development and initial implementation of activities supported by the
Environmental Management Component would increase the ownership among
local communities and stakeholders in the management of protected area. This
approach was especially suitable for the preparation of management plan for the
Matsalu State Nature Reserve. The skills gained through participation in these
activities can be applied to a wide range of environmental management and
planning programs and to municipal and community development measures
Use of Project to Address International Environmental Agreements. The p -oject
demonstrated the benefits of being able to adjust objectives to meet those of
international environmental agreements, namely the Helsinki Convention on
Protection of Baltic Marine Environment, and the Ramsar Convention for
protection of wetlands. In addition, the Government of Estonia used the project
to further its compliance with the environmental and water resources directives of
the European Union as part of the accession process that was initiated after the
project was approved.
Bank's Performance:
Continuity in Team Leaders and Team Membership. Project success was alded by
continuity in task management: each Task Manager/Task Team Leader was a part
of the Project team before assuming these responsibilities and the previous Task
Managers/Task Team Leaders continued as active advisors to the project. .n
addition, throughout preparation and implementation, the team remained
composed of an interdisciplinary range of specialists from both Headquarters and
the Riga and Vilnius Field Offices who worked together on a sustained basis.
Benefits from Use of Field Based Bank Staff. The strong involvement of fie,ld
based staff from the Bank Offices in Riga and Vilnius in project preparation and
implementation allowed the Borrower to have continuous implementation
support. This facilitated the early identification of issues and their rapid
resolution, It also provided an opportunity for continuous fine tuning of the
project as implementation proceeded. It proved to be very cost effective to have a
mix of more generalist field staff work with specialized headquarters staff in all
phases of the project.
Use of Consultant Trust Funds to Support Supervision. The willingness of lFinland
to allow the use of Consultant Trust Funds to support advisory services during
project implementation made a qualitative difference in the performance of the
Haapsalu Veevark This support facilitated the development of the strategic plan
which now guides the utility and. assisted in strengthening its financial plann:ng and
management skills.
- 28 -



Unanticipated Decline in Water Demand. As in the case with other Bank supported
water and wastewater projects in Latvia and Lithuania the project was subject to
unanticipated sharp decline in water demand that adversely affected the finances of
the Haapsalu Veevark. This demonstrated that even with careful planning and
analysis unanticipated outcomes can occur, and reinforces the need to approach
projects in a conservative manner and evaluate the experience of others when
making future municipal investments.
Component A - Water and Wastewater Improvement
Haapsalu Veevark
Management Change is an Incremental Process. Transformation of an existing
water and wastewater utility developed in a centrally planned economy into an
efficiently managed self sustaining entity, and introduction of modem corporate
management ideas are much more challenging tasks than the physical
implementation of the project. In similar projects special emphasis should be
placed on institutional capacity building.
Strategic Plans are Highly Useful. Development of a strategic plan, in the later
stages of a project, can provide the utility with a framework for improvement of its
legal basis and management of operations, upgrading of physical facilities and
development of human resources. The Company found that the strategic planning
process was very important in assisting it to identify its priorities and formulate its
ideas for the future in a structured manner. The strategic plan has also made it
easier for the management of the Company to deal with the Municipal Government
and the Board of Directors.
Knowledge of Procurement and Disbursement Procedures is Critical. Good
knowledge of the Bank's procurement and disbursement procedures by counterpart
staff was critical for the success of the project. In Haapsalu this was achieved
through timely training which was provided by Bank staff, and through the work
together with a consultant who was hired using the loan proceeds. It should be
noted that on the basis of experience with previous projects in the ECA region, the
development of these skills by counterparts was given a high priority and
procurement specialists played a central role in Bank project preparation and
implementation efforts.
Benefits of Close Supervision by Implementing Agency. Consultants, contractors
and suppliers should be closely supervised by PIU staff, and any deviations from
the terms of contracts and or specifications should not be allowed unless they are
beneficial to the project. Such an approach enabled the Haapsalu Veevark to
implement the project with extremely high quality and substantial cost savings. It
- 29 -



Iso showed the staff the benefits of "building in" quality and how these efforts
would lower operation and maintenance costs in the future.
Effective Use of Twinning Agreements with Other Utilities. When private sector
participation in a water and wastewater utility is not possible, a well planned and
closely supervised "twinning arrangement" with another utility can be an effective
means for transferring experience and providing access to informal advisory
support. This arrangement should have a contract format that specifies key actions
and participants should include the Board of Directors, management and technical
staff. The project demonstrated that the most effective results of the twinning
agreement were technical aspects of cooperation because of similarities between
the two utilities. Success with management issues was more limited due to
significant differences in the political and economic aspects of the two countries,
and should be kept in mind in developing new twinning arrangements.
While drafting financial and economic projections, the project teams should be
conservative in their assumptions regarding the projections of critical variables,
which have the highest impact on revenues and costs. These tend to be too
optimistic, and in long run the projects are likely to experience lower than
expected economic and financial rates of return. Project appraisal should ensure
that the assumptions are realistic and that contingency plans are drawn for coping
with deviations from the most likely outcomes. The range of possible outcomes
with their respective probabilities, although subjective, should be listed in the
appraisal document.
The financial sustainability will be impaired as company will start to repay the
World Bank loan. Weakening of Euro against USD, has increased the Haapsalu
Veevirk's debt service cost about 35 percent at the current exchange rate. The
latter may lead to serious difficulties in company's debt service commitments (see
Table 6). The Haapsalu Veevark and municipality were not too active in hedging
themselves against currency fluctuations despite of repeated wamings by the WB
missions and auditors.
Balancing the Loan and Grant Financing. Share of the loan and grant financed
components should be carefully defined, as disproportional share of grant financed
investments may result in overcapacity, which would later increase operation and
maintenance, and amortization costs of the companies.
Component B - Environmental Management
Environmental and Physical Planning. The project provided an opportunity for the
Ministry of Environment to have its environment and physical planning staff
- 30 -



evelop new linkages between themselves and counterparts at the regional and
local level. In course of preparation and implementation of the Plan, the
cooperating parties had to overcome certain difficulties. These were caused by
intersectoral nature of coastal zone, while planning processes at various
Governmental levels are predominantly sectoral. Otherwise, the planning processes
used in Matsalu has influenced the way the protected areas and coastal zones are managed
throughout Estonia. The involvement of the local authorities and all other key stakeholders
has been recognized as crucial factor for achieving success.
Potential for Community Driven Development. The experience from activities in
the Matsalu State Nature Reserve indicated the high potential for involvement of
local communities in the protected area management and conservation of global
biodiversity in general. These communities felt that they became "empowered" by
the project to take a proactive role in the identification and management of
environment and development issues.
Management Plans Provide a Mechanism for a Shared Vision. With the support of
Estonian authorities and the WWF, the preparation of the Management Plan for
the Reserve demonstrated the success of a local participatory based planning
process. The plan the allowed local community an opportunity to benefit from
conservation through eco-tourism, local employment generation and self-help
measures.
Non-governmental Organizations Can Provide Catalytic Support. The experience
from the project shows how non-governmental organizations can provide catalytic
support to local communities in environmental management. The advisory support,
planning measures and training activities undertaken by the WWF of Sweden
resulted in the activities undertaken in the Matsalu area counties becoming
community based development activities that are owned and implemented by local
beneficiaries.
Implementation of International and Regional Environmental Conventions. The
project demonstrated how the Ramsar Convention and the Helsinki Convention
could be implemented through incremental actions undertaken at the national level.
It also showed how projects could be designed to provide local benefits, as well as
meet the larger environmental objectives of the conventions. In addition, placing
the project in the context of implementation of the Helsinki Convention and its
Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Program gave it both
regional and national significance, which helped mobilize donor commitment and
resources.
Well Targeted Grant Funds Can Accelerate Environmental Improvements. The use
of well targeted grant funds from the cooperating bilateral donors accelerated the
rate at which the physical improvements could be made by the Haapsalu Veevark
and allowed for achievement of regional, national and local environmental benefits.

Evaluation of the Matsalu Haapsalu Bays Environmental Project
The Haapsalu Matsalu Bays Environment Project was one of the first internationally funded
environmental investment projects in Estonia. It was undertaken by the World Bank and other
co-financiers in response to the request of Estonian Government to help in meeting its
international obligations in improving the state of the Baltic Sea, and to provide better water a:id
wastewater services to inhabitants of Haapsalu city, and in selected small towns in the catchm-.nt
area of Matsalu Bay.
The main objectives of the project were as follows:
:  Strengthen the MOE's capacity to coordinate and implement environmental projects;
*  Reduce discharge of partially treated and untreated wastewater into Baltic Sea;
*  Restore and enhance the surface and groundwater quality in Haapsalu;
*  Improve quality, reliability and cost-efficiency of water supply and sanitation services in
Haapsalu;
*  Improve operational efficiency and management system in Haapsalu Water;
*  Promote management of point and non-point source pollution from the catchment area of
Matsalu Bay; and
*  Promote environmentally sustainable management and development of ecologically unique
and sensitive areas around Matsalu Bay and adjacent coastal areas.
*  In order to achieve these objectives the following project activities were identified:
*  Rehabilitation and expansion of the Haapsalu waster and wastewater system, including
equipment and works, engineering services, and measures to control industrial discharges;
*  Training to support institutional strengthening to assist in establishing an autonomous and
financially independent water and wastewater utility in Haapsalu.
*  Support for the development, implementation, and monitoring of a series of actions to reduce
point and non-point sources of discharge to the Matsalu Bay catchment area. This includec
- 32 -



pgrade of the wastewater services at Lihula and other small settlements, and measures to
reduce surface and groundwater pollution from agricultural run-off.
* Technical and financial support for implementation of a management plan for the Matsalu
State Nature Reserve prepared by a joint Estonian-WWF team, and
* Support for planning and management of eco-tourism.
To implement the project, the Government of Estonia signed a number if agreements with
financiers in order to implement the project. These included the World Bank, SIDA - Swedish
International Development Agency (at the time of signing - BITS), Finnish Ministry of
Environment, Danish Environmental Agency, and EU Phare program.
Estonian Government and Haapsalu Municipality contributed to implementation of Project with
EEK 23.3 million.
As a result of implementing the project the following main outcomes were achieved:
Component A - Water and Wastewater Improvement:
*  The Haapsalu Water company was reorganized into a joint stock company operating under
commercial law;
*  The wastewater treatment plant was upgraded to exceed the prescribed treatment
recommendations for BOD7 and Phosphorus. Additional effort is needed to achieve
recommended Nitrogen treatment levels.
24 pumping stations were successfully rehabilitated;
6 pumping stations were newly built;
1250 m of sewers were rehabilitated;
12120 meters of sewers were laid;
*  4990 meters of water supply pipes were laid.
Component B - Environmental Management
*  In Matsalu State Nature Reserve, implementation of the Management Plan has become a
continuous and cyclic process, which is oriented on sustainable management of semi-natural
coastal meadows. By now, the Management of the Reserve is skilled to prepare and
implement projects based on ecosystem approaches, and it has been able to involve local
population into conservation activities.
*   Using the grant financing from Denmark and Finland, 7 small wastewater treatment plants
have been built in settlements of Roude, Martna, Koluvere, Kullamaa, Tuudi-Liivi, Lihula, and
Kirbla. This was a good start, however, additional effort is needed to keep some of these
treatments plant fully operational, and services affordable to customers. Sludge management
in these localities remains to be addressed.
*  Swedish Agricultural University in cooperation with Estonian Ministry of Environment
launched a program aimed at reducing run-off on nutrients from live stock farms in Matsalu
catchment area through construction of manure pads. Project contained the training,
investment and monitoring modules. It is anticipated that the project will be continued within
framework of the GEF supported Baltic Sea Regional Project, which currently is under
preparation.
- 33 -



*    ain outcomes and lessons learned are the following:
* As a result of close interaction with the financiers - the World Bank and the donors the
Ministry of Environment, Haapsalu Municipality and the Haapsalu Water company gained
knowledge and experience about introducing the market economy based approaches in
developing and implementing environmental projects;
* The twinning arrangement between the Haapsalu Water and Haninge Tekniska Kontoret
(Sweden) was particularly useful in transferring the technical knowledge. At the same time it
was less successful in drafting the Strategic Plan for Haapsalu Water. In future, the twinning
partner selection procedures shall be revised to enable better match between the partners w ith
due respect to existing strengths and weaknesses of the twinning partners;
* In situation when Estonian Kroon was pegged to German, choosing the USD as a loan
currency was a mistake. Right now this fact causes major financial difficulties to Haapsalu
Water;
* At project preparation stage it was not foreseen that the water consumption in Haapsalu
would decrease so dramatically;
* Partly due to sharply declined water demand, the capacity of the wastewater treatment plar t is
higher than it would be currently needed;
* Although the bill collection rate is remains high, the further tariff increases may result in
decreasing collection rates, as the present day tariffs are among the highest in Estonia and are
close to affordability limits;
* In rural areas, the development of wastewater collection treatment services shall be based on
step-by step approach with due respect to the income levels of local population;
* Estonian environmental management skills and practices proved to be compatible with the
intemationally recognized ones;
* World Bank procurement procedures are quite elaborated, and it takes time to learn them
properly. Despite the training received, the preparation of the first procurement packages wuas
somewhat slow.
* Reducing of non-point pollution from agriculture is a time consuming process, and we
appreciate readiness of the World Bank and the donor corrmunity to continue supporting
Estonia's effort in this endeavor through the proposed GEF Baltic Sea Regional Project.
Estonian Ministry of Environment looks forward for continued cooperation with the World Bank
in future.
Sincerely,
Allan Gromov

roject Evaluation by Haapsalu Veevark
Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project
(WWIC component)
FINAL REPORT
1.    SUMMARY
We consider that WWIC component of Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays
Environment Project as a "model project" was successfully implemented. During
1995-2000 we have invested ca 100 MEEK into Haapsalu water and wastewater
networks and all project objectives have been achieved.
Still there is no ground to consider, that Haapsalu water and wastewater
infrastructure is fully finalized in the frames of this project. According to our assessment
we need to invest ca 150-180 MEEK during coming 12 years into this part of the
town's infrastructure.
We would like to express our appreciation to all World bank employees, who have
contributed their share into the implementation of the project, especially to the task
managers Mr. Stephen F.Lintner, Ms. Sari S6derstrom, Mr. Inesis Kiskis and Mr. Kari
Homanen.
2.    BACKGROUND INFORMATION.
From 1976 the Government of Estonia has paid attention to preserve unique curative mud
resources in Haapsalu Tagalaht bay, including the construction of modern wastewater
treatment plant to Haapsalu. In 1981 mechanical treatment for wastewater were constructed.
In 1988 II phase of the treatment facilities (biological treatment) were designed. The state
construction expert committee did not approve the presented design - it was based on Soviet
equipment and technologies.
From 1988, connected with the independence process in Estonia, the local decision makers
started to have contacts with Swedish and Finnish grant and financing organizations.
"Haapsalu Sewage Treatment Plant", Pre-feasibility Study (June 1991) and "Outline
Pre-Investment Study for Haapsalu Sewage Treatment Plant" (March 1992), financed by
BITS of Sweden formed the basis for negotiations of the loan conditions of EBRD and NIB,
also to get grant financing from responsive Swedish and Finnish organizations.
Despite the great support from the Government of independent Estonia the negotiations
with EBRD and NIB regarding the loan for the construction of Haapsalu Wastewater
Treatment Plant, were not successful.
In summer 1993, Laane County Government had an informal contact with the
representatives of the World Bank, as a result of which the World Bank drafted "Initial
Executive Project Summary for Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment
- 35 -



roject" , dated June 14,1993.
In this document, for the first time the issue of Haapsalu Wastewater Treatment Plant was
dealt together with the problems of the whole area - Moonsund Archipelago, including the
catchment area of Kasari river and Matsalu Nature Protection area in the field of
environrment protection.
In the Initial Executive Project Summary, the project task, financing resources,
action plan, risks and implementation schedule, were also defined.
After making necessary, preliminary investigations and Consultancy Study (November 1994,
Sweco AB and Eesti Projekt AS), pre-contract negotiations (February 1995), the Loan
Agreement No. 3870 SEE was signed on September 19,1995. The Loan Agreement became
valid on April 12,1996.
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION.
3.1. Haapsalu Water Works AS
As a result of giving the state enterprise Eesti Vesi into municipal ownership, on the
basis of assets of structural units of the previous state enterprise, the municipal enterprise
Haapsalu Water Works was formed on February 13,1995.
Municipal enterprise Haapsalu Water Works was reformed into a joint stock company
on December 06,1996 and was registered in the State Business Register on February
12,1997.
Haapsalu Water Works AS is conducted by the 5-member Council, named by Haapsalu
Town Government as 100% stock-owner. The Council has employed the management of the
utility.
All water and wastewater assets belonging to Haapsalu Town are accounted in the
balance of Haapsalu Water Works AS.
To implement Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project WWIC
component) a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was formed within Haapsalu Water Works
AS.
All assets acquired during the implementation of the project are accounted in the
balance of Haapsalu Water Works AS.
3.2 Project components
During the implementation of the project we agreed on new project components
(compared to the Staff Appraisal Report) with the World Bank.
According to the shortlists the biddings were carried out regarding design-works,
auditing ,tariff study and two training programs in the frames of the Twinning Arrangement.
International competitive biddings were carried out for six project construction
components, in addition also two international shoppings for procuring equipment.
The co-ordination of TOR-s and results of the bidding with financiers was
time-consuming. According to our calculations we lost ca I year in implementation time
because of time-consuming co-orientation procedures.
Due to the significant economy in International Consultants component (instead of
444 th. USD only 30,6 th.USD) and a high currency rate of USD to EEK we had the
opportunity to do more work as compared with SAR in the component Water Supply and
- 36 -



ewer System (instead of 1470 th.USD 1970 th.USD).
3.3. Twinning co-operation
Our Twinning Arrangement with Haninge Tekniska Kontoret fulfilled its target. The staff
of Haninge Wastewater Treatment Plant (in the beginning took their job very seriously.
The weaknesses in Twinning Arrangement should be mentioned as follows:
-     the obvious low motivation of Haninge Tekniska Kontoret;
-     it was impossible to compare Haninge Tekniska Kontoret and Haapsalu Water Works
AS as business companies.
3.4. Design-works
There is no claims or complaints about the construction designs, bidding documents and
supervision carried out by Sweco AB and Eesti Projekt AS.
One task of the Swedish Grant Agreement - to transfer the knowledge and experience of
Swedish consulting firms to Estonian conditions - is fulfilled.
Haapsalu Wastewater Treatment Plant works without problems, quality requirements set
in the design have been achieved. There are no problems also with other designed
constructions.
3.5. Construction works.
All 6 ICB-s were won by Estonian main - contractors. Swedish and Finnish sub -
contractors worked on the construction of the WWTP, the supervision of the construction of
the WWTP was also carried out by the Finnish contractor.
All deadlines on the constructions have been followed by all Main Contractors. All
accepted works are secured with two-year guarantee period. Up till now there has been no
quality problems during the guarantee periods.
3.6. Project Implementation Unit.
For implementation of the project and carrying the function of the Client Haapsalu Water
Works AS formed a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) consisting of 3 employees.
The staff of PIU was trained on seminars organized by the World Bank and SIDA, they
also participated in study programs organized by Estonian governmental organizations.
All implemented intemational biddings were carried out according to the World Bank or
FIDIC standards, also according to the procurement procedures of Estonia.
We must admit, that starting the first object , definitely the one with the most
complicated financing scheme - reconstruction of Haapsalu WWTP - was a big challenge for
the staff of PIU.
Working meetings with contractors were smooth-without bigger problems.
According to my assessment, the physical ability to fulfill the role of a Client in such a
complex package of small-scale sub-projects (i.e. ICB 5), maximum 25 MEEK (ca 1,5
MUSD) in a year. In case of a compact and more voluminous project (i.e. WWTP), with the
same staff, it could have been twice more.
3.7. Supervision of the project implementation.
The World Bank team has supervised the project semiannually, including also the
- 37 -



epresentatives of donors and MoE of Estonia.
By the regulation no.95 from 07.04.1997 of the Minister of Environment of Estonia,
Project Steering Committee was formed, but representatives of Haapsalu Water Works AS
did not participate in its meetings.
The representative of the MoE of Estonia participated in all working meetings and
acceptance committees, also in Evaluation Committees of the competitive biddings.
The State Control has also expressed interest towards the project.
4.    REMARKS ON THE PROJECT.
4.1.  Approval procedures with the World Bank took more time than planned. In
several cases the documents were lost or a person who had to make an evaluation or
confirmation, was on a long-term mission.
4.2.  In SAR there was component Support for PIU-Consulting services with the
prelimninary cost of 0,44 MUSD i.e. 22% of the total loan amount. Later it was changed
to 30,6 th.USD i.e. 1,5% of the total loan amount that we consider enough.
4.3.  The preliminary frequency of reporting - once a month - was overcharged. Did
anybody read them?
4.4.  Most of necessary decisions connected to project implementation were made in
the World Bank headquarters in Washington. Taking into consideration the time and
smooth procedures, the decisions could have been made on regional (Riga and Vilnius
branch) level or local (Tallinn branch) level.
4.5.  The World Bank started a very progressive Water Industry Benchmarking. We
would regret if this activity will not continue after the project closes. Benchmarking
should be drafted as more acceptable for the water utilities connected with the
project, i.e. decrease the number of indicators and to make utilities comparable.
4.6.  In the frames of Twinning we did not implement a digital map of working
drawings of water and wastewater networks due to the state and local level passiveness (
the town does not have GIS - based digital plan, despite the fact the aerophotos were
made already in surnmer 1998).
5.    RE-PAYMENT OF THE LOAN
Repayment of the World Bank loan no 3870 SEE will cause problems for Haapsalu
Water Works AS and Haapsalu Town Government from 2001 and due to the following
reasons:
-     decrease in consumption of residential water;
Hereby we present a review of different prognosis regarding the water consumption of
inhabitants

As it can bee seen, no prognosis has been right. The water consumption per capita per
day has fallen from 1994 by 2 times. In the same proportion the sales consumption in
water and wastewater services have decreased, despite the fact that number of clients has
increased.
-     A sudden increase of USD exchange rate:
freezing the increase of tariffs:
It is not possible to increase the tariffs for water and wastewater services any
further, as affordability levels are nearly reached. During last five years the tariffs of
Haapsalu Water Works AS are the highest in Estonia.
From May 2000 Haapsalu Town Government negotiates with the Ministry of Finance
regarding changes to the conditions of Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The satisfactory
result for us could be reached to probably in the II quarter of 2001.

Completion of Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays
Environment Projects
The Swedish Parliament decided in October 1992 to support investments
in wastewater treatment in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Baltic Sea
Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme, by Helsinki
Commission (HELCOM), formed the basis for this decision. Investment
support was to be targeted to places where polluting discharges were
particularly severe, i.e. "hot-spots" as defined in the HELCOM action
programme. The Swedish Board for Investment and Technical Support,
BITS (now a part of Swedish International Development Cooperation
Agency, Sida) was assigned to manage the Swedish grants. Three main
projects were established, i.e. the Environmental Projects in Estonian
town of Haapsalu, in Liepaja, Latvia, and in Klaipeda, Lithuania.
Haapsalu Environmental Project consists of several components including
- 40 -



nvestments in water supply and distribution, wastewater treatment,
environmental management and coastal zone protection, institutional
support and other assistance. The project is financed with Swedish and
Finnish grants, local funding and by way of loans from the World Bank.
The Swedish grant amounts to 12 MSEK. Total project costs are 47
MSEK.
The Swedish contribution to the project consists of design and supervision
of constructions, financing of investments for wastewater collection and
treatment, and institutional strengthening support. Institutional
development is supported through a programme of twinning cooperation
between Haapsalu Waterworks and a Swedish water and wastewater
utility. Equipment and services financed by Sida are supplied exclusively
by Swedish companies.
The Haapsalu wastewater treatment plant was inaugurated in December
1997.
The long term goals of the Haapsalu Environment Project was to:
a   decrease the amounts of pollutants and adherent negative
environmental effects in the Baltic Sea
*   support an environmentally sustainable transition in the water and
wastewater sector in the region
In a development perspective, the Haapsalu Environment Project has
been important, and is considered to be a success from a Swedish point
of view. As a first-generation project it has been acting as a model for
projects to come.
The cooperation with the WB levered Sida's support and made the
bilateral funding more efficient than it would have been if acting alone.
The leading role of WB and requirements for creditworthiness created an
incentive to upgrade skills and generate financially viable water services.
The Swedish grant support, without the cooperation with WB, would not
have involved such a strong mechanism for ensuring the institutional
changes.
Through the Haapsalu project, and the other environment projects
co-financed with the WB, an important learning process was established
in the Baltic region. In addition, Sida's in-house knowledge of investment
projects in the water sector has considerably increased.

PROJECT EVALUATION BY WWF-SWEDEN
WWF:
The Matsalu project.
Short overview and evaluation
Lennart Gladh, WWF Sweden
November 2000
Introduction
Preparation of the management plan for the Matsalu State Nature Reserve was a part of the World
Bank initiative "The Haapsalu-Matsalu Bays Environment Project". The Plan was developed under
guidance of the of the Working Group on Management of Lagoons and Wetlands of the HELCOM
Project Implementation Task Force (PITF-MLW)
The overall objective was to identify the main problems and conflicts and the most urgent
environmental needs, and to make proposals on how to improve co-ordination of various
ongoing activities to promote sustainable development in the Baltic Sea. It was also recognized
that the future of coastal areas and wetlands in the region will ultimately not depend on
HELCOM and national governments, but on local stakeholders and authorities. Furthermore,
the rapid process of decentralization of administrative processes has created a need to
strengthen institutional capacities on a regional and local level.
As the establishment of the market economy continues, the pressure on coastal areas in the Baltic area
-42 -



s increasing. Traditional, sustainable use of grasslands has been carried out for hundreds of years in
Estonia. Most of the west-Estonian coastal area has been affected by human activities since the land
first appeared from the sea as the result of post-glacial land-lift. The influences include grazing,
mowing, forest clearance and reed harvest. As a result, the area has developed a highly diverse
semi-natural system of meadows. The last 50 years have, however, seen many changes in agricultural
practice. This trend is continuing and is related to more general rural trends such as reduced
profitability of traditional agriculture, high unemployment levels, and migration from the countryside
towards towns and cities and problems with rural infrastructure.
Eutrophication (accelerated plant growth, in particular algae, this forms dense mats and reduces access
to sunlight which results in algae below the surface dying; the decomposition of the algae deoxygenates
the water) caused by nitrate fertilizers and intensive livestock production is causing serious pollution.
The disappearance of traditional grazing regimes is causing dramatic reductions in many wild plant and
animal species. These problems were intensified when the old Soviet-based agricultural system
collapsed and a new system started to be put in place. There is a fear that some of the dominant
elements of the EU Common Agricultural Policy - i.e. high fertilizer and pesticide use - will destroy
those unique semi-natural habitats that still remain in Estonia and will also add to the pollution levels in
the Baltic Sea. In this case, marine problems have to be addressed by changing management
approaches in the surrounding land.
The project in Matsalu was set up to help to addresses the challenges of sustainable development in
the Baltic. The Project Area in the Matsalu Catchment covers 3,710 square kilometers, a large part of
central Estonia. The Matsalu Bay, which forms an important part of the 40,000ha Matsalu Nature
Reserve, is included in the area. The bay was the only Ramsar site in the former Soviet Union; i.e. is a
wetland site identified as being of global importance. It suffers from eutrophication and changes in
grazing pattems, as well as over-fishing and land-use changes in general.
The Task Area plans are aimed at finding find new sustainable ways to use the natural coastal and
alluvial meadows of the region. It was recognized that this would only be possible with the co-operation
and participation of the local authorities and local people. A major aim of the project is to protect and
enhance biodiversity and local development by, for instance, improving conditions for endangered
species and opportunities for local employment and trade.
Objectives for five years
Since the goals are interconnected the objectives usually refer to more than one goal and are sometimes
also interconnected
1.    Restoration and maintaining of optimal grazing intensity (average: one cattle or horse and
two sheep per hectare) on coastal pastures, alvars etc. Indicator ofsuccess - grazing intensity
restored to target levels
2.     Harvest of hay on 3000 ha of alluvial and other wet meadows and 100 ha of wooded
meadows Indicator of success - hay mown and harvested
3.     Clear valuable meadow sites from bush or reed Indicator of success - area cleared
4.     Harvest ca 20000 tons of reed per year (about 2/3 of total production). Indicator of success
- reed harvested
5.    Improve water quality and fish spawning conditions, restore diversity of the lagoons,
reedbeds and flowing waters Indicators of success - successful spawning of pike and perch, further
decline on heavy metal content in these fishes, further decline on chlorinated organic content in seals,
further increase in water transparency, fiuther moderate decrease in BOD and nutrient content in the
water.

Indicators of success - municipal heating converted from fossil fuels to renewable, pilot scale
renewable-based electricity production, improved marketing of local handicraft, increased tourism
incomes without increase in disturbance to nature.
8.    Improve environmental education Indicators of success - active public participation in
sustainable development initiatives and decrease in problems related to low environmental awareness
9.    Develop administrative capacity Indicators of success - co-operation between different
institutions, flexible and swift reacting to situation, decrease in illegal activities (including violations of
environmental legislation), increase in efficiency of law enforcement
10.   Make information available and improve communication between different institutions
and interest groups. Indicator of success - availability of information referred to in the previous
points.
Project activities
The first step in producing the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan (ICZM) was to ensure that
there was a comprehensive and democratic planning process in place. To this end a Task Area Teamn
was established for Matsalu area, consisting of local and central government officials (including the
local mayor), scientists and representatives of non-governmental organizations. The involvement of the
local authorities in the towns and municipalities was seen as being particularly important as they
provided the "key" to reach local farmers, fishermen and other stakeholders. The teams have regular
meetings at least twice a year.
1997 ,based on an Estonian proposal, it was agreed to join the Matsalu Project with a similar activity in
Kiina, and to add the island of Voormsi. The project was renamed as a Vainameri Project, as the
shallow, productive waters connect the three sites.
A project to support traditional land use in the area was initiated, and the support of the local
authorities, villages and farmers is increasing. The project aims to compensate local farmers for the
non-market values that they are producing or protecting, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and
landscape. Both of these values are also important for the tourism sector and for maintaining local
history and cultural identities. Farmers are given the opportunity to take up grazing or mowing
contracts and are then subsidized for their activities according to these contracts. Grazing subsidies, for
example, are 2 EEK per cow or horse day and 1 EEK per sheep day. Mowing subsidies are 120 EEK
per hectare in the case of open meadows and 1000 EEK in the case of wooded meadows. The
government funds the subsidies, with foreign aid being obtained by the project to renew the machinery
used for meadow management.
The Vainameri project 2002-2002 is funded by SIDA, WWF Sweden and Estonian national and local
funds. The total budget is in range of USD520.000.
The experiences gained while preparing and implementing the Management Plan for the Matsalu State
Nature Reserve (the Vainameri Project) will be applied in other similar projects Estonia's Westem
Coast and other Baltic riparian countries.

n Matsalu, contracts for grazing of coastal meadows were made and the decline in grazing was halted.
The grazing intensity was however generally insufficient. Contracts for mowing and grazing alluvial
meadows have been made and in 1996, the first year of the project, 1500 ha were mowed, three times
more than in 1995. Contracts for wooded meadow management were made, which halted the decline of
the meadows. In subsequent years the contracts have continued to be funded and agreed.
A feasibility study on the use of the bio- mass ( reed, hay, bushes) has been elaborated which indicates
that this would be profitable for local heating.
Although the overall project imnplementation was a success, the effort to balance the nature
conservation activities with wise and selective use of natural resources shall be continued.
Co-operation with local authorities, farmers and other local stakeholders should also be strengthened.
A number of new activities are envisaged for near future. These include acquiring of new breeds of
beef cattle and wool sheep, as currently there are not enough grazing animals. The project also plans to
help conserving traditional Estonian horse and cattle breeds which are accustomed to the coastal
conditions. There are plans to identify new and sustainable uses of 'traditional' products such as meat,
wool, hay and reeds. Traditional niche markets such as tourism (based on nature and culture);
eco-meats (high quality meat from natural pastures) and bioenergy from hay, reeds and willows will all
be tested.
Training of local entrepreneurs in the agricultural, handicraft and tourism sector has started and will
continue.
This training has so far led to establishment of many initiatives such as local NGOs, joint marketing,
initiatives and different local investment initiatives.
Lessons learned
At the beginning of the process, the participation of local stakeholders was quite weak. Although the
local mayors and other stakeholders attended the meetings and discussions, their participation was
fairly passive. However as investments on the ground were started (albeit on a small scale) the ideas
and proposals from the local authorities and individuals increased. One important lesson learnt from
this process is that if local involvement is to be really active, concrete investments (including action on
the ground) are needed at the very beginning of the process.
The planning processes used in Matsalu has influenced the way the protected areas and coastal zones
are managed throughout Estonia. The involvement of the local authorities and all other key stakeholders
has been recognized as crucial factor for achieving success.
From 2001 on, the Estonian government has decided to allocate 20 million EEK for management of
valuable important semi-natural habitats.
The project has also thrown up the problems of fitting sustainable development into existing legislative
frameworks. The coastal zone can be defined looking from different perspectives - natural, economic,
physical etc. - but in all cases it will include a political element. It is clear that sustainable planning
does not fit in well with existing legislative systems. Planning is sectoral, and not focused on
implementation and management. ICZM planning is process-orientated and as such is not easily
adaptable to existing legislative planning systems.
As transition from central governing to local levels is very rapid in most Central and Eastern European

crucial.
