MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE HEBEI AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.     The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit for
SDR 116.1 million (US$150 million equivalent) to the People's Republic of China
is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 35 years maturity and would help finance agricultural development in Hebei
Province.
2.      Background.   Agriculture in China, including crops, livestock, forestry
and fisheries, provides sustenance for over one billion people; it is an
important source of income for some 190 million farm families and accounts for
about 30% of the country's GDP. Only about 137 million ha of China's land area
of 960 million ha are arable. Farming systems are intensive with heavy inputs of
labor, chemical and organic fertilizers and small machinery. Nearly half of the
cropped area is irrigated. Foodgrains occupy about 70% of total cropland and
account for about one-third of the agricultural output. Intensive farming has
allowed China to meet the basic food requirements of its population, about 22% of
the world's total, and to produce an increasingly sophisticated mix of cash and
commercial crops from less than 11% of the world's arable land. China's decade-
long rural reform program has revitalized the agricultural sector, provided an
impressive growth and structural changes through the introduction of the
production responsibility system, increased producer prices and enlarged the role
of the market. The gross value of agricultural output (GVAO) 'ncreased by 83% in
real terms during 1978-88 at an average annual rate of 5%, substantially more
than that of the previous 25-year period (3.2%). While significant growth has
been achieved, the Government's central concern in recent years has been stagnat-
ing grain production, which peaked at 407 million tons in 1984. Production,
thereafter ranged between 391-402 million tons.   Major eff3rts have been made to
bring the production back to the 1984 level and grain production rebounded in
1989 to reach 407.9 million tons, an historical record.
3.        Recent government strategies to increase grain production include
diverse measures such as increasing state investment in agriculture, mainly in
irrigation expansion and rehabilitation, and introducing partial reforms in grain
procurement, distribution, prices and subsidies. Local governments in particular
have placed high priority on investments in uplands, natural pastures, and water
surfaces for expanding production and productivity of nonstaple food and commer-
cial crops to meet growing demand for these commodities, increase local entity
profits and farmer incomes, and help alleviate the pressure on the demand for
grains. Unlike in the past, government policy increasingly emphasizes that
cropping must be commercially oriented and match local agro-ecological
conditions. This has enabled China to achieve significant increases in the sown
area, productivity and output of major industrial crops and fruits.
4.        The Government's long-term objectives for the agricultural sector are
to increase the production of food, feed, industrial crops and animal products to
meet the requirements created by population and income growth, and to increase
income and employment opportunities in rural areas. Given China's shortage of
arable land (0.1 ha per capita), development planners have focused on the need to
increase the productivity of presently cropped areas and to efficiently develop
the few remaining areas of unutilized lands. Steps are also being taken to



-2-
stabilize grain outputs and to raise the the value-added in the farm sector by
increasing the production and quality of food crops, animal feed, livestock,
fruits, fish and industrial crops, and by improving and expanding agro-processing
activities.
5.        The Bank Group's strategy for lending to China's agricultural sector
has been to support the Government's objectives outlined above. Lending to date
has included 23 operations involving a total assistance of about US$2.1 billion
for land development, irrigation and drainage, support services, (including
agricu;' ural education, training, and research), credit, seed production,
development of specialized product sutisectors (including rubber, forestry and
fisheries), and area development (combining crop and livestock production, agro-
processing and support services). Implementation of most ongoing Bank Group
financed projects in the agriculture sector is on schedule. Future Bank Group
lending will continue to support projects in large and diverse subsectors, e.g.,
water resources development, agro-processing, rural credit and forestry.
6.        Three Bank-financed agricultural projects and one IFAD-funded project
in China have recently been completed (North China Plain Project (Cr. 1261-CHA),
Heilongjiang Land Reclamation Project (Cr. 1347-CHA), Rural Credit Project (Cr.
1462 CHA), and Hebei Agricultural Development Project (IFAD Ln. 107-CHA)). The
project completion reports for all four projects indicate that project
implementation was successful, that economic rates of return were excellent, and
that the technology used for land development and drainage (in the North China
Plain and Heilongjiang projeczs) was sound and appropriate for wider application.
The IFAD project is most similar to the present project, since it was sited in
two counties in Hebei Province, and the lessons learned during the implementation
of the IFAD project have been incorporated into the design of the present
project. These lessons were (a) effective salinity control has to carefully
balance surface and ground water resources, (b) alfalfa is proven as a suitable
erop to reduce soil salinity and (c) the nutritional value for livestock of crop
residues can be markedly increased by ammonification.
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The integrated agricultural development
approech under the proposed project is designed to address most of the major
constraints limiting agricultural productivity in Hebei: the shortage and poor
quality of irrigation water, inadequate crop diversification, the poor quality of
final products, the limited extension network, and the weak linkages between
production, processing and marketing activities. Bank-Group involvement in tne
project has resulted in significant design changes in the water conservancy and
aquaculture components as well as in the introduction of greater emphasis on
environmental aspects. The project was designed to (a) reflect recent
developments in the export markets for shrimp; (b) promote efficient use of
inputs; (c) strengthen the integration of production and marketing activities;
(d) increase farmers' income from livestock activities and the use of crop
residues; (e) increase awareness of efficient management of water resources; (f)
expand the area under irrigation by increased conjunctive use of sutrface and
shallow water aquifer sources, and (g) limit water use from deep aquifers to
municipal and industrial purposes.
8.        Project Objectives.  The project objectives would be to increase
production, productivity and marketability of agriculture, livestock and aquatic
products in the Northeast and Heilonggang areas. The project would: (a)
strengthen the province's ability to effectivelv manage its available water
rtesomirces, (b) increase and intensify productivity of existing low-yielding crops



and diversify the cropping pattern, (c) promote market analysis as a criterion
for increasing production and improving processing of major commodities, (d)
expand agroprocessIng activities to rationalize fertilizer production and make
use of agricultural by-products, (e) promote an effective use of crop residues in
expanding livestock production and (f) strengthen research and extension programs
for crops, livestock and aquaculture.
9.        Project Description.  The project would (i) optimize conjunctive use of
surface and well water by rehabilitating irrigation structures, sinking of about
9,950 new shallow wells; (ii) set up a water monitoring and evaluation system and
develop a water resources plan for the province; (iii) provide needed inputs,
improve seed production facilities, strengthen agricultural research and
extension; (iv) increase efficiency in sheep and cattle production through
ammonification of wheat and corn straws and planting alfalfa; (v) produce
fertilizers (urea and monoammonium phosphate) and promote use of cotton stalk in
particle board and fluting paper manufacturing; (vi) strengthen agromachinery
service stations; (vii) improve efficiency of aquaculture investments by
rehabilitating 3,467 ha of shrimp ponds, constructing 533 ha of new ponds,
modernization of processing facilities and construction of fishponds and scallops
chains and (viii) provide equipment and technical assistance, particularly in
agroindustries and overseas training programs. The project, to be carried out
over 5 years, provides funds for works; vehicles, machinery and equipment;
fertilizer, pesticides and materials; and training and technical assistance. The
total cost of the project is estimated at US$309.6 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$149.2 million (48%). Retroactive financing of
up to US$12 million is being recommended for expenditures made after December 10,
1989. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively and a map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8495-CHA
dated May 14, 1990, is also attached.
10.       Actions Agreed:  The main assurances obtained from the national and
local governments are as follows: (a) no new wells other than those under the
project would be drilled until the final assessment of the groundwater resources
has been made and discussed with IDA; (b) four separate revolving funds would be
established and maintained at ABC for wells and water saving pipes, farm inputs,
farm machinery and livestock activities. These funds would be managed by PMOs
and would be onlent to farmers at interest rates no less than ABC's prevailing
rates at similar terms and for similar purposes; (c) enterprises ur er the
project would be managed by competent staff and would at all times maintain a
debt equity ratio no greater than 5:1; (d) project funds onlent to enterprises
would be at interest rates no less than ABC charges on subloans for similar
purposes and with similar maturities and such rates would be reviewed from time
to time with IDA; (e) SMCs would be PMO's agents in distribution of imported
inputs and would charge farmers a price reflecting the cost of import plus
distribution margin and that this price would be reviewed each year and
communicated to IDA; and (f) imported agrochemicals would be approved by IDA
prior to their procurement, and all effluents from agroprocessing plants would be
treated and the Provincial Environmental Bureau would clear the final designs of
the treatment plants and set up and maintain a system to monitor effluent quality
throughout the life of the project. An ut.derstanding has also been reached at
negotiations that a review of cotton prices would be undertaken each year and the
results and recommendations would be communicated to the National Price Bureau
and IDA.



-4-
11.       Benefits and Justification.   The project would contribute
significantly to poverty alleviation particularly in Heilonggang area by
increasing farmers' incomes through crop diversification, higher yields, and
livestock and agroprocessing activities. At full development the project would
produce 793,000 tons of crops valued at US$175 million, and 114,000 tons of
fruits valued at US$35 million annually. Incremental production of aquaculture
and livestock would be US$12 million. Agroindustries value added would be US$8
million annually. The economic rate of return for the project as a whole is 32%.
The project would assist the province to focus on developing a comprehensive
water-resources investment plan. Agroindustries, in addition to supplying needed
fertilizer, seeds and providing a market for crop straw and other by-products,
would generate additional employment and income to farmers. Per capita income
would increase by an average of 125% for the 540,000 poor farm families.
Significant employment would be created in all components and employment for
women would be notable in the Heilonggang area.
12.       Risks.    The project faces no uajor orgar.izational or technical risks.
The Provincial Government is highly committed to the proiect. The risks that do
exist are either small initially or have been effectively minimized. The risk
that the WCB would manage its water resources poorly and not provide adequate
amounts of water for both irrigation and agroprocessing has been minimized by
investirng in the training of staff and by estal 'shing a monitoring and
evaluation unit in the WCB. The possible risk uf aquifer depletion is minimized
by limiting the number of new wells un,er the project until 1993, after the WCB
completes the analysis of how to balance water demand and supply without aquifer
depletion and recommends future investment in water resource develc.pment. The
risk of greater-than-anticipated shrimp export market weakness is minimized as a
project concern, since the shrimp subcomponent is very small and there is a large
unsatisfied domestic market. The risk of inadequate price incentives for cotton
is lessened by recent major procurement orice increases and by the establishment
of an annual cotton price review and a channel for provincial input Lnto National
Price Bureau policy-making.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credi, tould comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
