PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
i.         This 3s the Project Completion Report for the River Transport Project in The Congo, for
which Credit 1179-COB in the amount of SDR 14.6 M was approved on October 6, 1981. The Credit
was closed on December 31, 1988, three and a half years behind schedule.  An amount of
SDR 299,881.48 (approximately US$385,000) was canceled from the Credit account on July 20, 1989.
An additional amount of SDR 45,430 was subsequently canceled on November 21, 1990.
ii.        The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the Occidental and
Central Africa Department on the basis of the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement and
Amending Agreements, the Project Agreement and IDA correspondence files. Despite repeated requests,
we have been unable to obtain Part II.

RIVER TRANSPORT PROJECT
CREDIT 1179-COB
PROJECT COMPETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Qbjectives
i.         The proposed project had a twofold primary purpose: (a) to ensure that, as far as possible,
ATC transport facilities met the existing transport demand on the river system of northern Congo,
southern Cameroon and CAR effectively and economically; and (b) to further ensure that the ATC
system-encompassing the Port of Pointe Noire, the CFCO railway and river transport and port services-
would have adequate capacity to meet anticipated medium-term growth in the economy (para. 6).
Implementation Experience
ii.        The implementation of the physical components of the Project went smoothly, thanks
particularly to the advanced procurement of the floating equipment which compensated for later delays
in credit effectiveness. Civil works were, however, executed 18 months behind schedule, and the
majority of the studies financed under the Project were substandally delayed. Implementation of the
management information system including cost accoundng-a key element of the institudonal strengthening
of ATC and a prerequisite to carrying out detailed tariff studies-actually started after the completion of
the Project (paras. 13-14).
iii.       The traffic forecasts for timber transported by barges-the major equipment procured under
the Project-were met during the first three years of execution. A sharp decline was observed afterwards
(para. 24). VNP'TF, the river transport branch of ATC and the only one to operate in a competitive
environment, steadily increased its market share on the Congo and Sangha Rivers, but the railway proved
to be unable to efficiently move the timber traffic from Brazzaville to the sea. Therefore, the timber
companies that were in a position to choose between alternative routes increasingly favored the more
expensive but much faster Cameroonian route (para. 30).
iv.        None of the covenants covering all facets of the financial situation of ATC was met.
Although the Government consistently postponed tariff increases, it alleviated the financial burden of ATC
by taking over the debt service generated by the realignment of the railway. The resulting improvement
of ATC's finances was short-lived as ATC's management was unable to control costs and to adjust
operating expenditures in a prolonged period of declining activity (para. 27).
v.         The estimated project cost at appraisal was US$28.1 M, while the final cost at completion
is only US$23.3 M. This 17 percent underrun is attributable to the strong appreciation of the US dollar
relative to European currencies and the CFA Franc (para. 17). However, due to the traffic shortfall, the
overall ERR of the Project is only c percent, well below the appraisal estimate of 17 percent. Two of
the four main project components, namely the rehabilitation of the workshops and the experimental river
training works, generated negative ERRs as their respective benefits failed to materialize (para. 31).

SustainabMIit
vi.        In view of the low ERR, of the disappointing operating and financial performance of ATC
and of the inadequate maintenance of equipments procured under the Project, the Project is hardly
sustainable (para. 32).
Findings and Lessons Learned
vii.       The establishment of a cost accounting system in a s.omplex organization requires the full
commitment of the management which must be prepared to delegate and decentralize. The existence of
such a system is ar. absolute prerequisite for carrying out tariff studies and formulating pricing policies
(paras. 14 and 27).
viii.      Advance procurement led to cost underruns and timely implementation. The provision of
options to procure additional equipment was a practical requirement (paras. 15 and 34).
ix.        The foremost lesson drawn is that the integration of various transport modes within a single
parastatal does not warrant the global efficiency of the transport system nor adequate inter-modal
coordination. Transport operations stretching over more than 1,500 km in a demanding environment
c nnot be managed from one single decision center (paras. "0 and 29).
x.         One may wonder whether the Bank's insistence on increasing tariffs as the ultimate way to
restore the financial position of ailing parastatals is not eventually self-defeating. The reluctance of
Governments to approve tariff increases is well entrenched and invariably based on so-called social
arguments. In turn, the absence of tariff revisions provide parastatals' management with ample
opportunities to justify unsatisfactory performances. ATC's experience provides a convincing case where
Bank's efforts could have preferably been directed towards promoting cost-consciousness and cost savings
throughout the enterprise rather than pursuing tariff increases which were rendered obsolete by the steady
reduction of activity levels (para. 37).
xi.        Bank supervision was intensive and closely coordinated with the follow-up of related
transport and forestry projects. Whereas the skills mix of Bank missions was tailored to the needs of the
various stages of project implementation, the involvement of a training specialist could have allowed
earlier identification and resolution of the weaknesses of the training programs (para. 38).
xii.       The Project demonstrated that the combined procurement of computer equipment, software
and technical assistance was not conducive to least-cost solutions (para. 45).

1.        The Project had a long history of preparation. In 1971, the Agence Transcongolaise des
Communications (ATC) submitted a first stage project to the Bank Group for river transport consisting
of tugs and barges. The ATC owned and operated an integrated transport system comprising the ocean
port of Pointe Noire, the Congolese Railway (CFCO) from Pointe Noire to Brazzaville, and river ports
and services on the Congo and tributary rivers. The project was pre-appraised in 1972, at which time
ADB expressed interest in participating in its financing. The Bank did not proceed with appraisal for
reasons of staffing constraints, and concern that the project was "not as straightforward as it appears."
This was because of issues relating to the railway realignment project then under preparation, the
precarious financial situation of ATC, and the need to expand forestry production to ensure sufficient
traffic to support expansion of ATC's river/rail/port system.
2.         The close linkage between ATC's three main transport operations and the forestry industry
which provided ATC with its single largest revenue producer, was a major concern of the Bank from
1972 to the present. Log and sawn timber traffic was essential to ensuring ATC's financial viability, and
the Bank devoted considerable efforts to persuading the Government to expand its forestry industry in
an endeavor to provide the traffic needed for ATC's survival. This situation became all the more acute
in view of the tremendous cost overrun which ATC incurred in 1976-86 during execution of the Second
Railway Project. During that period, ATC teetered on the edge of financial collapse. These matters have
already been covered in detail in the PCR (Report No. 8117) and the PPAR for the Second Railway
Project. They will not be repeated here, other than to note the Bank's justifiably keen interest in
upgrading all aspects of ATC's operations, and to ensure its viability by encouraging the development
of its principal freight commodity.
3.         For the reasons noted above, and the early involvement of the African Development Bank
(ADB) in river transport, the 1972 river transport project was turned over to ADB which made financing
available in 1973 for river equipment. This addition to the ATC fleet was considered adequate until about
1980.
4.        In 1918, the Bank showed renewed interest in a river transport project. As the Bank was
already familiar with ATC's operations through its appraisal of the Second Railway Project
(Loan 1228-COB), project identification proceeded quickly. However, preparation was slowed by the
need to persuade the Government to develop its forestry potential more aggressively to ensure that traffic
would develop to justify the Project, as well as the real,gnment of the railway on which costs were rising
rapidly. As a first step, the Bank assisted the Government in reviewing the forestry sector and preparing



-2-
a feasibility study on exploiting northern Congo's forestry potential. By mid-1981, tne Bank concluded
that it was now dealing with a more responsive group of officials in the Government who were keen to
rationalize the operation of the forestry sector and were actively promoting forestry investments.
5.         As a result of the forestry study, a Wood Processing Project (Loan 2298-COB) was prepared
and approved on May 31, 1983. According to a recent sector note, this project was mainly designed 'to
diversify exports, promote regional development, and ensure that the projected timber traffic for the rail
and river transport system materialized as anticipated." The forestry study also identified the needs of
ATC's river transport operations. Thereafter, two studies were prepared: one by German technical
assistance and the other by Bank-financed consultants to ATC as part of the review of all aspects of
ATC's operations. The River Transport Project focussed on ATC's river transport investment plan
through 1984, and took account of the financing to be provided by Kreditanstalt fuir Wiederaufbau (KfW).
The Project was to continue the rehabilitation and expansion of ATC's transport network by strengthening
what was then its weakest link. Its success depended on many of the same factors upon which the Second
Railway Project was founded, i.e., "effective development of northern Congo's forestry, improvement
of ATC's organizational and financial structure, and reestablishment of that organization as an aggressive,
efficient transporter."   Key conditions relating to the forestry sector were also set under
Credit 1047-COB, which provided additional financing to meet the high cost overrun on the Second
Railway Project.
C. Project Obiectives and Description
6.         Project Objectives. The Project had a twofold primary purpose- first, to ensure that, as
far as possible, ATC transport facilities met the existing transport demand on the river systems of
northern Congr southern Cameroon and CAR effectively and economically, with the main emphasis on
the needs of the timber industry on which the economy of the region depends. The second purpose was
to further ensure that ATC would have adequate capacity to meet anticipated medium-f -, growth in the
economy, again focussed on timber cutting and processing. Two ancillary, though important, goals were
to assist the Government to establish a transport planning mechanism, aimed primarily at improving the
selection and evaluation of investment projects and proposing policies oriented towards optimizing
resource allocation, and to assist the Congolese Timber Marketing Office (OCB) in improving its
management, and timber marketing organization and operations with a view to rendering it capable of
playing a vital role in the future development of the forestry sector,
7.         Project Description. The Project provided for new floating equipment and training facilities
ard financing for repairing and uipgrading port facilities, for river training works, and for technical
assistance in a number of areas. The Project items are outlined below.



-3 -
1.   ATC Project Components
A.   E-quipment:
1.   Floating equipment and spare parts, including 14 log and timber barges;
2 mixed fuel/timber barges; 1 self-propelled pontoon; 2 high-speed launches;
2 400-HP line pushers; 1 400-HP tug boat; I passenger pushboat; and
miscellaneous equipment; and
2.   Main frame computer and peripheral equipment.
B.   Civil and Mechanical Works:
1.   Repair, rehabilitation and upgrading of port facilities at Brazzaville, Ouesso
and Mossaka;
2.   Training building at Brazzaville; and
3.   Construction of dams and groins for river training.
C.   Technical assistance for supervision, training, management and technical studies.
H.   Government Project Components
Technical assistance to the Ministry of Transport for transport planning and to OCB for
improvement of management and operations.
D. Project Design and Organization
8.         ATC was divided into three operational sections: (a) the port of Pointe Noire; (b) the CFCO
railway; and (c) the river ports, river transport and maintenance of navigable channels - Voies
Navigables, Ports et Transports Fluviaux (VNPTF). Under the tight and cumbersome control of ATC's
General Manager, each section had a separate manager assisted by expatriate technical directors provided
by FAC. Attached to VNPTF was the bi-national (Congo-CAR) Service Commun d'Entretien des Voies
Navigables (SCEVN) which maintained the navigability of the Sangha and Oubangui Rivers.
9.         VNPTF's headquarters are in Brazzaville from which it operates the river ports of
Brazzaville, Mossaka, Ouesso and river transport services on 5,000 km of waterway. VNPTF was
operationally independent of ATC's general headquarters, located in Pointe Noire. Its three main
operating divisions are (a) river ports; (b) river transport service; and (c) river maintenance. A fourth
division provided training to mechanics and navigators. Brazzaville was by far the most important river
port, serving as the terminal point for both the railway and the river transport system. It included a
marine workshop which maintained the ATC fleet; passenger, fuel, timber and cargo quays; and a log
port. Ouesso was an important upstream port that handled timber traffic coming downriver.
10.        River transport services were controlled from Brazzaville headquarters. Fleet dispatching
was handled here but was not efficient because of insufficient skilled staff. The marine workshop
functioned satisfactorily. River maintenance and navigation works by SCEVN were good and included
hydrography, beaconage, dredging and rock excavation. Maintenance of the Congo River was performed
by Zaire.



-4 -
11.        VNPTF was the only branch of ATC operating in a competitive environment. While CAR
and Cameroon traffic was apportioned by inter-Government agreement with ACCF/SOCATRAF, several
private medium-sized companies and transport subsidiaries of timber companies were active on the Congo
and Sangha Rivers. ATC's river operations consisted essentially of moving general cargo and fuel
upstream, and sawn timber and logs downstream. General cargo, sawn timber and high quality logs were
transported by barge, while logs were floated downstream on rafts pushed by micro-pushers. Passenger
service was poor because it was tied in with cargo movements. River transport operations were not
systematically organized; arrivals and departures were random; and there was poor coordination between
boat scheduling and customer loading demands. The situation was complicated by long distances,
uncertain eommunications and lack of control over individual fleet units on a day-to-day basis.
12.        More generally, VNPTF was "plagued by staffing and management problems, stemming
from lack of clear lines of authority, unwillingness to accept responsibility and general over staffing."
Under the ongoing railway project, ATC and the Government had agreed to take a number of important
steps to improve overall personnel management, re-instill staff discipline and reestablish managerial lines
of authority. Satisfactory performances on these commitments were maintained as covenants under the
River Transport Project as well. Therefore, under the Project, ATC had agreed to engage consultants
to review VNPTF's manpower plan, recommend specific changes in its organization and provide a
detailed job description. In addition, the review was to focus on VNPTF's future role in river transport
and the role of private transporters. The Project also provided for consultants to recommend a system
to improve scheduling and control of fleet units.
E. Project Implementation
13.        Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-up.  Although the Credit was approved in
November 1981, it was not signed until March 1982 and did not become effective until October 1982,
pending action on a long list of requirements and conditions as agreed upon at negotiations. These dealt
primarily with Bank efforts to strengthen the operation and management of VNPTF, and to make
headway against the serious constraints to long-term forestry development and to potential investor
interest.
14.        Implementation Schedule. The Project was originally scheduled to be completed by
December 31, 1984. The delivery of floating equipment and the reports on VNPTF's organization and
manpower plan were completed in 1985. Physical works and training were completed by the end of
1987; however, the implementation of ATC's cost accounting system did not take place before the
completion of the Project. Main issues arising during project implementation were as follows:
(a)  slow action on the part of the Government in raising ATC's tariff and in correcting
distortions in river transport tariffs;
(b)  the start of the cost-based tariff study had to be postponed due to delayed installation of
ATC's main computer facilities and to delayed implementation of the cost accounting
system;
(c)  the study to improve the entrance to the Brazzaville log port was held up because a solution
could not be found to the siltation problem, and a study of ATC was added later; and
(d)  the addition to the Project in 1987 of a road maintenance component (para. 19).
15.        P1ocurement.  Despite the delays in signing and effectiveness, procurement was not
significantly delayed because ATC proceeded with procurement from suppliers and contractors on the



basis of letters of intent, followed by contract signatures after Board approval. Also, by mid-1982,
consultants had been selected for the Transport Planning Unit, (CB studies, and VNPTF's administrative
organizational study, including a preliminary review of timber tariffs for river transport.
16.       Except for certain replacement motors and spare parts where standardization was desirable,
all floating craft and equipment and civil works were procured under ICB. Some floating equipment was
procured under option, subject to firm orders, if a review of needs based on actual traffic in 1982 and
in 1983 concluded the equipment was needed. Traffic developed satisfactorily at that time, and the
options were exercised. In 1984, some additional equipment was procured. Procurement went smoothly
and no unusual problems developed.
17.       Project Costs. The Project was completed well within the cost estimate because (a) prices
for equipment were somewhat lower than originally estimated; and (b) the US dollar strongly appreciated-
-by around 40 percent-againist the CFAF and the European currencies which were the currencies of
payment of the contracts. The total cost of the Project was US$23.3 M, to be compared to US$28.1 M
estimated at appraisal. Detailed project costs are given in Table S (A) of Part I.
18.       Disbursements. Disbuiiements were somewhat slower than forecasted at appraisal because
lower prices were obtained over those anticipated at appraisal, and because of delays in project execution,
particularly of the techaical assistance component. Estimated and actual disbursements are given in
Table 3 (A) of Part III. The Credit was closed on July 20, 1989 when SDR 299;881 was canceled from
the Credit account.
19.       Credit Allocation. The original and revised allocations and actual disbursements are shown
in Table 3 (B) of Part III. In late 1987, approximately US$0.5 M of Credit funds was reallocated for
the continuation of the program of rehabilitation and maintenance of roads in the Pool and Cuvette
regions which were started under the Third Highway Project (Loan 2227-COB).

20.        Project Objectives. The Project reached one of its two main objectives by allowing VNPTF
to meet the river transport demand. It failed, however, to ensure that ATC as a whole would provide
adequate transport services. When the demand for transport of timber developed as anticipated in 1985,
the CFCO became unable to move the log traffic from Brazzaville leading to large backlogs. With the
completion of the railway realignment and additional locomotives provid4d for under the supplementary
railway credit, the CFCO finally cleared the excessive buildup at the Log Port. Traffic steadily declined
afterwards, due to the decrease of the European demand for African woods and also because the forestry
companies became more and more doubtful of ATC's capacities. Although the direct transport costs of
timber on the Cameroonian route were about 20 percent higher than the costs of the Congolese route
(CFAF 46,000/m3 and CFAF 39,600/m3, respectively), the difference in transportation time occasionally
exceeded 12 months and largely offset the cost savings of the Congolese route. In 1989-1990 the demand
for timber increased again and the log buildup in Brazzaville reached new records of some 200,000 ne.
It is now feared that, unless tremendous efforts are made to restore the operating performance of the
railway, the natural comparative advantage of the Congolese corridor has totally disappeared.
21.        The Project was unable to solve the specific problems related to (a) the siltation of the
Brazzaville Log Port; and (b) the limitation of the period of navigation on the Sangha River and the
N'Goko River. The Log Port Study, as noted in para. 14, failed to provide an economic solution to the
siltation problem. The reason was that the Congo River at that point appeared to be changing its course.
It was agreed to continue hydraulic studies in an attempt to identify new channels which might form in
the future, and could be suitably widened to gain access to the Log Port. The change in course of the



-6 -
river also threatened the closing of the General Cargo Port downstream. Steps were taken to dredge the
channel input of the Cargo Port, to remove silt in front of the quays, and to provide access between the
Cargo Port and the Log Port by rail.
22.        Two seasons of experimental river training works-executed by SCEVN under the
supervision of consultants--provided only one-week extensions of the period of navigation. These limited
results-combined with annual costs 70 percent higher than expected--led to the end of the experimental
works before the opening of the 1985 season.
23.        The two ancillary objectives of the Project were only partially met. The development of
the planning capacities of MTAC encountered implementation problems, stemming from delays in
nominating counterpart staff of the Ministry. The Planning Unit, however, actively participated in the
National Transport Plan Study after the completion of the Project.  On the other hand, the
recommendations of the OCB-related studies were not implemented. The poor performance of OCB,
which was unable to fulfill its marketing role, eventually led to its abolition in 1990.
24.        Physical Results. The evolution of ATC's traffic is reviewed in detail in section A of
Annex 1. On the whole, actual traffic has been lower than expected at appraisal. At best the overall
traffic of each of the three branches at the completion of the Project was equal to the one of 1981. Two
notable exceptions are (a) the transport of manganese on the CFCO; and (b) the transport of high quality
logs and sawn timber by VNPTF's barges. This latter result is directly attributable to the floating craft
procured under the Project (barges and line pushers), although the actual traffic observed in 1986, the
expected completion date, was still 20 percent below appraisal estimates. Another positive development
is the increasing market share of ATC (from 33 percent in 1982 to 53 percent in 1988 for the barge
traffic) in the total traffic of the Congo and Sangha Rivers calling at Brazzaville. The evolution of the
tonnage of floated timber is, however, unsatisfactory as actual figures were 60 percent below the appraisal
estimate for 1986.  CAR and Cameroon timber traffic declined dramatically over the project
implementation period to a meager 6,000 tons in 1988.
25.        Operating Performance. Substantial efforts were deployed under the Project to improve
the operating performance of VNPTF by procuring equipment, rehabilitating workshops and establishing
sound dispatching procedures for the river fleet. However, the various operating targets set in the SAR
were not met. Table 4 of Part III provides the main monitoring indicators. Basically, the actual figures
concerning the availability of floating equipment, rotation times of the fleet and the average load
transported are 30 percent below the appraisal estimates. They do not reveal any improvement over the
situation prevailing before the Project. Although the deterioration of the navigability of the rivers indeed
played a role, inadequate maintenance and the low productivity of the central workshop and the shipyard
were the major factors behind this disappointing performance. The Project File contains numerous
negative appreciations of the operations of the shipyard and concludes that the impact of the Project on
human resources development was negligible, with the important exception of the training program of
the fleet's deckhands.
26.        Financial Performance. The PCR of the Second Railway Project provided ample details
on the financial performance of ATC over the 1976-1986 period and shows the negative impact of the
cost of the realignment on ATC's  iances. The SAR of the River Transport Project also focussed on
(a) the capacity of ATC to cover the debt service of the realignme: L; (b) ATC's working capital
requirements; and (c) the need for annual tariff increases. The financial covenants of the Credit
Agreement were designed accordingly.
27.        The National Budget took over the debt service corresponding to the infrastructure
components of the realignment in 1983. One might have expected a substantial improvement of ATC's



financial position. This improvement was in fact short-lived, as ATC continued to accumulate losses in
its river transport and railway operations which could hardly be offset by the profits of the Port of Pointe
Noire. It appears in retrospect that (a) the favorable appreciation provided in the SAR on the adequacy
of ATC's cost control and budgeting procedures was unfounded; (b) ATC's management was unable to
confront the unions and to adjust operating expenditures in a prolonged period of decreasing activity; and
(c) the centralized financial and accounting department played a major role in delaying the implementation
of cost accounting, of the decentralized management information system and eventually of the tariff study.
28.        Summary financial indicators are given below (in CFAF billion, unless otherwise indicated).
More detailed accounts are given in section B of Annex 1 and in Table 7 of Part HI, which reviews inter
alia the compliance with financial covenants. None of them was complied with.

29.       Impact of the Project. The Project eliminated one bottleneck of the transport link between
northern Congo and the sea. This accomplishment was self-defeating. A new bottleneck was suddenly
created by the railway and the deciine of the timber traffic eventually allowed to overcome ATC's
operational troubles. Similar results could have been obtained merely through the financing of additional
equipment as the strengthening of the transport sector did not take place as expected.
30.        The impact of the Project on the forestry sector is mixed. As noted in para. 24, VNPTF
met the increasing demand of transport by barges and increased its market share. The timber companies
that were in a position to choose between alternative routes increasingly favored the road/railway link to
the port of Douala. Other companies had to yield to the uncertainties of the CFCO. The PCR of the
Ouesso Wood Processing Project mentioned high transport costs and long delays which were not,
however, a major reason behind the failure of this project, otherwise plagued by cost overruns and the
limited experience of its promoter/operator. Conversely, the timber companies-compelled to finance
inventories of timber in transit-accumulated huge payment arrears towards ATC, which compounded the
handling problems. Finally, the strong commitment manifested by the Government towards the
development of the logging industry in northern Congo somewhat decreased as the economic potential
of timber was eclipsed by the perspectives offered by the oil sector.
31.        Economic Performance. The recalculation of the economic rate of return (ERR) at the time
of completion provide results much lower than expected at appraisal. The overall ERR of the Project is



- 8 -
only 5 percent, against an appraisal estimate of 17 percent. Two components have a positive ERR: (a)
the passenger pushboat (10 percent at completion against an appraisal estimate of 22 percent); and (b) the
equipment for transport of timber (3 percent at completion against an appraisal estimate of 12 percent).
The other two components (rehabilitation of mechanical workshops and river training works), the benefits
of which failed to materialize, generate negative ERRs. The sensitivity analysis carried out in the SAR
had not anticipated a stationary traffic nor the decrease of the availability of the river fleet which led to
the above results.
G. Ptect Sustainability
32.        In view of the low ERR, of the disappointing operating and financial performances anu of
the inadequate maintenance of equipment procured under the Project, the Project is hardly sustainable.
H. Bank Pifrmance
33.        The Bank rightly linked performance on the railway, river port, and forestry projects to the
overall objectives of ensuring that ATC had sufficient capacity throughout its system to meet anticipated
growth in traffic, and that ATC's management, finances, and operations were adequate for the task. In
ensuring the close coordination of these projects, even to the extent of supervising them, in part, with
the same staff, the Bank deployed major efforts for strengthening the transportation and the forestry
sectors of the Congo.
34.        The design of the Project was sound as it aimed at avoiding the execution pitfalls
encountered during the Second Railway Project. Advance procurement led to cost underruns and the
provision of options to procure additional equipment only when justified by traffic, was a practical
requirement.
35.        The Bank, however, overestimated ATC's capacities to overcome its difficulties and to
promote adjustment, productivity progress and cost-consciousness in a macroeconomic environment
successively marked by an oil windfall and then by a severe crisis of public finances.
36.        As the Project neared completion, it became more and more evident to the Bank supervision
missions that ATC required a major restructuring. A comprehensive set of management/reorganization
studies was initiated and financed under the Project and under the Pilot Public Enterprise Institutional
Development Project (Loan 2868-COB), prepared in parallel with SAL I. After extensive discussions
and pressure applied by the Bank and other donors, the Government decided to embrace an in-depth
reform of ATC, including the establishment of a holding company, the privatization of river transport
services and the elimination of ancillary activities of ATC unrelated to its primary mission. Actual
implementation of this reform has been, however, put in abeyance, pending the formulation of a workable
financial restructuring plan.
37.        One may wonder whether the Bank's insistence on increasing tariffs as the ultimate way to
restoring the financial position of ailing parastatals is not eventually self-defeating. The reluctance of
Governments to approve tariff increases is well entrenched and invariably based on so-called social
arguments. In turn, the absence of tariff revisions provides parastatals' management with ample
opportunities to justify unsatisfactory performances. ATC's experience provides a convincing case where
Bank's efforts could have preferably been directed towards promoting cost-consciousness and cost savings
throughout the enterprise rather than pursuing tariff increases which were rendered obsolete by the steady
reduction of activity levels.



-9 -
38.        The Bank provided adequate supervision throughout the implementation period as shown In
Table 8 of Part III, and the supervision reports were detailed and comprehensive. Whereas the skills mix
of the supervision missions was tailored to the needs of the various stages of implementation, it appears
in retrospect that the involvement of a training specialist could have allowed ealier identification and
resolution of the weaknesses of the training programs of the shipyard and of the central workshop.
1. Borrower Performance
39.        Table 7, Part 111, indicates the performance in complying with the Credit and Project
Agreements. As noted in para. 28, none of the financial covenants was complied with. Other covenants,
particularly in the Credit Agreement, were often met with substantial delays.
40.        VNPTF's performance was mixed. The River Transport Division clearly benefitted from
the new floating craft and improved its technical operations notably through the training program. The
workshops, and, above all, the Brazzaville shipyard participated in the assembling of the barges, with the
support of German technical assistance. Repairs and maintenance activities remained one of the weakest
points.
41.        ATC's global performance was unsatisfactory.  The opposition of the financial and
accounting headquarters .o any attempt at decentralization and the delays in providing critical information
greatly impaired the execution of the institutional strengthening component. Internal efforts of adjustment
were unassertive and resulted in cosmetic measures.
42.        The essential contribution of the Government consisted in taking over about CFAF 50 billion
of ATC's debt and building additional arrears. Daily interference in ATC's management decisions and
investment decisions decreased after 1985. The Goverment, however, has not been quite forthcoming
in selecting an alternative for the restructuring of ATC and VNPTF.
J. Project Relationship
43.        IDA's relationship with ATC and its agencies was good. Major technical decisions, e.g.,
the discontinuation of river training works or the transfer of log handling from the Log Port to the Public
Port were taken by ATC after seeking advice from Bank missions. Relations with the Goverment were
somewhat strained at times because of the latter's failure to meet its financial commitments to ATC and
the Project or to approve tariff increases-leading to a short suspension of disbursements of
Credit 1047-COB (Second Railway Project) in 1984.
K. Consulting Services
44.        Under the Project, ATC and Ministries of Transport and Forestry engaged consultants for
the following assigmments: (a) design and supervision of the floating craft; (b) data processing; (c) design
and supervision of the lower Sangha River experimental training works; (d) Brazzaville Log Port access
studies and supervision of dredging; (e) study of VNPTF's organization, administration and dispatching
operations; (f) training of ATC mechanics; (g) assistance to ATC in improving their accounting systems;
(h) tariff and cost studies; (i) setting up of a transport planning unit under the Ministry of Transport and
Civil Aviation; and (j) improvements in OCB's operations. Design and supervision of the civil works,
other than items (c) and (d) above, were carried out by ATC.
45.        The performance of the consultants was generally satisfactory, although delays were
encountered. The study to identify a practical solution to the access problem to the Log Port at
Brazzaville at low water levels concluded that maintaining the newly dredged channel would be very



. 10 -
costly and therefore, uneconomical. The multitude of consulting firms engaged in the preparation and
design of the cost accounting system and of the management information system did not lead to a smooth
implementation. In addition, the joint procurement of computer equipment, technical assistance and
software in this specific environment was not conducive to least-cost solutions.
46.        The Planning Unit of the MTAC was established as called for by 1984, and the OCB study
was completed in 1982. The latter study thoroughly reviewed OCB's financial and accounting problems,
but its review of organizational and marketing issues was inadequate because of OCB's reluctance to
provide sensitive data. The study contributed to the preparation of the Wood Processing Project (para. 5
and para. 30).
L.   Project Documentation and Data
47.        The appraisal report and Credit Agreement were adequate in spelling out the objectives of
the Project, and how they were to be successfully met. The supervision reports were well prepared and
project data adequately documented.

1. The costs of the river fleet and of the training center wore slightly lower than expected at appraisal in CFA
Frna. Tho appreciation of the USS against the CFA Franc during execution thus led to a 25 percent underrun
for these components.
2. Civil works in the Brazzaville Port encountered unexpected difficulties. The latter led to substantial delays and
to a 30 percent cost overrun in CFA Francs which was absorbed by the appreciation of the US$. The CFAF
costs of tho experimental river training works (beaver dams and groins) were 70 percent higher than expected.
3. The comnputer equipment actually procured under the project was substmtially different from the one envisaged
at appraisal. ATC modified its requirements, and additional equipment were installed at the headquarters in
Pointe Noire.

UnderlvinQ Assumptions:
1. ERR recalculations are based on (a) actual investment costs incurred during the execution of the project; (b) the
actual traffic observed; and (c) operating costs data provided in the BCEOM tariff study carried out in 1989.
2. The actual traffic carried by the pushboat is on average equivalent to 4,700 round-trip passengers, i.e., 85
percent of the traffic expected at appraisal. Timber traffic revenues have not been taken into account in the
recalculation of the ERR of the pushboat.
3. The average actual load annually transported by each convoy is equivalent to 11,200 tons of Umber. This is
to be compared to the SAR's estimates of 18,200 tons of timber and 2,100 tons of petroleum. Petroleum trasport
has been close to zero since the completion of the works of the Epena-Impfondo road in 1986. CAR's petroleum
imports are now entirely transported by SOCATRAF from Zaire.
4. Benefits cannot be traced to this component as the availability of the river fleet (micropushers awl line pushers)
has actually declined since 1982. The expected savings in avoided investment expenditures did not materialize.
5. This component was dropped in 1985 after two seasons of experimental works.

2.           Total traffic handled by the River Ports was expected to increase by 55 % over the project period from
530,000 tons in 1981 to 836,000 tons in 1986. It grew by 13 % over 1981-84, driven by cement imports from Zaire
required for executing various construction projects. PF's traffic fell steadily afterwards to 436,000 tons in 1986
and 475,000 tons in 1988. Timber traffic which was anticipated to grow by 70% over 1981-86 from 370,000 tons
to 631,000 tons actually decreased from 394,000 tons in 1981 to 303,000 tons in 1986 and 353,000 tons in 1988.
Handling of floated logs was substantially lower than expected, while high quality logs and sawn timber tansported
by barges grew in line with forecasts until 1985 and declined from 1986 onwards.

3.          Timber traffic handled by companies other than ATC evolved erratically, decreasing from 211,000
tons in 1981 to 151,000 tons in 1983, jumping to 221,000 tons in 1984 to fall sharply to 110,000 tons in 198S, then
reaching 14S,000 tons, 127,000 tons and 173,000 tons in 1986, 1987 and 1988 respectively. This traffic
development is the result of a combination of factors as different as (a) timber demand and production in CAR and
Cumeroon; (b) the pace of implementation of the forestry/sawmills projects in northerm Congo, which was much
slower than expected; (c) rainfall conditions affecting the navigability of barges on the Sangha and Congo Rivers;
(d) the efficiency of the CAR River transport fleet; and (e) the efficiency of operations at the port of Brazzville.
4.          TF's total traffic which had hit a record 277,000 tons in 1981 (including 63,000 tons from Kinshasa)
deteriorated to attain 78% of the latter in 1987 instead of the 87% projected increase. Timber traffic was expected
to practically double to reach 312,000 tons in 1986. Instead, timber traffic decreased to 142,000 tons in 1984 and
regained the 1981 level in 1987 and 1988. Again, the performance was much better for timber transported by
barges (the primary concem of the Project) than for the floated logs. The options for additional equipment were
exercised ir view of the conformnity of the actual barge traffic with the SAR forecasts until 1985. Over the project
period TF increased its market share from 39 percent in 1982 to 53 percent in 1988. The corresponding percentages
for barge traffic are 33 percent and 55 percent, respectively.
5.          The CFCO traffic was anticipated at appraisal to rise from 3,860,000 tons in 1981 to 5,020,000 tons
in 1986-timber from 570,000 tons to 800,000 tons; manganese ore steady at 2,600,000 tons. Actual traffic varied
as follows: total increasing from 2,885,000 tons in 1981 to 3,562,000 tons (71 percent of projections) in 1986;
timber falling from 634,000 tons in 1981 to 497,000 tons in 1987 and regaining the 1982 level in 1988 (549,000
tons); manganese increasing steadily from 1,496,000 tons in 1981 to 2,350,000 tons in 1986 and 2,280,000 tons
in 1987 and 1988.
6.          The total traffic as well as the timber traffic of the Port of Pointe Noire (PPN) was expected to
increase respectively from 4,090,000 and 500,000 tons in 1981 to 5,470,000 and 7S0,000 tons in 1986. Actual
variations were from 3,187,000 tons and 501,000 tons respectively in 1981 to 4,093,000 and 474,000 tons in 1986
and 3,878,000 and 450,000 tons in 1987.
7.          ATC's actual traffic was thus substantially below forecasts, with the exception of timber transported
by barges, at least until 1985. Reasons for this disappointing traffic performance are partly external, since timber
production was far from growing at the rate anticipated at appraisal. However part of the traffic shortfill was due
to ATC's inability to meet the demand for rail transport. The CFCO was unable to handle the northern Congo and
CAR forestry production within reasonable delays. Proof of this inability has been the existence of stocks
periodically exceeding 100,000 tons at the Brazzaville pre-railway stacking area (Pointe Maluku). Even if the
deterioration of the navigability conditions led to reduction of the annual time span of the arrival of rafts to less than
seven months, CFCO operated on average at 50 percent of its capacity. The forestry industry was therefore obliged
to ship part of its production via the more expensive but faster Cameroonian route and was consequently reluctant
to increase its production even when it had the capacity to do so.
B. FINANCES
8.          The Project's financial objectives for ATC and the degree of achievement thereof are listed in Table
7 of Part III (Compliance with Covenants). Main financial covenants were as follows:
(a)   to achieve consolidated working ratios not exceeding 65 % for each FY starting in FY 1982;
(b)   to generate annual consolidated rates of return of at least 6% starting in 1982;



- 27 -
ANNEX I

(c)   to maintain a positive working capital and to achieve specific cash, accounts receivable and payable
and inventory ratios; and
(d)   not to incur any additional long term debt unless ATC's cash generation from operations for the FY
preceding the incurrence of such debt be not less than 1.25 times the maximum debt service for any
succeeding FY.
9.          ATC approached or even met some of these objectives in the first year of Project implementation
(1982) but was not able to sustain this performance in later years, as shown in the table below:

10.         The working ratios (WR) and the operating ratios (OR) as anticipated at appraisal and as achieved
by each of ATC's branches over 1983-1988 are given below. Only the Port of Pointe Noire (PPN) operated at a
profit while the other branches barely generated enough sales revenue to cover working costs and a very small or
even no contribution towards depreciation. They were consequently unable to honor interest charge commitments
leading to delays in debt service payments and obliging the Government to substitute for defaulting ATC.

11.         VNPTF's fnancial results were practically in line with appraisal projections over 1981-1983 but
deteriorated afterwards. Although the lack of consistency and reliability of ATC's statistics and accounting data
does not allow for final conclusions, the major reasons for this deterioration can be traced to: (a) lower than
anticipated traffic, mainly timber; (b) insufficient tariff increases; (c) higher than projected uDit working and
operating costs especially over 1985-88; and (d) higher than planned interest charges.
12.         As noted above the traffic shortfall is partly due to the inefficiency of ATC's operations. The
Government has traditionally been reluctant to increase transport rates of basic commodities because of their
presumed impact on the cost of living of the poorest strata of the population. This reluctance also applied to timber
because of the potential adverse effect of high transport tariffs on export prices. However, timber exporter would
have been ready to pay higher transport prices if ATC's operating efficiency had permitted the increase of exports
via the Congolese route.
13.         Overall working and operating costs were, starting in 1984, substantially higher than anticipated at
appraisal although traffic was lower, leading to much higher unit costs. Due to (a) frequent changes in accounting
entries' practices; (b) the unreliability of the cost accounting system; and (c) the lack of traffic costing data, it is
not possible to identify with precision the operating cost component(s) which caused this situation. However, the
share of staff cost in overall working cost which was expected to decrease from 35% in 1981 to 27% in 1986
remained steady at about 40% (except in 1985 when the accounts show a drop to 22%, most likely because of
erroneous accounting entries). In addition, the share of headquarters costs in overall working costs was also steadily
higher than anticipated at appraisal. ATC's management was not able to take action towards reducing operting
costs and particularly overhead costs in line with the decreasing traffic.
14.         The following table provides average revenues, operating costs and interes charges per ton over
1984-1988 that illustrate the preceding comments.

ATC's consolidated financial situation
16.         Project implementation was expected to restore ATC's financial performance to a level sufficient for
covering operating costs, renewals, current investments and serving its long term debt without further Govemment
funding by 1986, the expected project completion date. Project implementation was also expected to restore ATC's
short and long-term financial position by achieving the set of ratios mentioned in pan. 6. These expectations did
not materialize particularly with respect to the short term. Accounts receivable doubled appraisal estimates in 1986
and trebled them in 1988. Payable accounts trebled appraisal estimated in 1986 and quadrupled them in 1988. Bank
overdrafts reached CFAF 3.3 billion in 1986 and increased to CFAF 4.6 billion in 1988. Finally, the worling
capital was negative by CFAF 15.7 billion at the end of 1988. Referring to the long term (a) the long term debt
did not decrease, although the Government had taken over the infiastructure related debt of the CFCO rlipment;
(b) the fixed assets increased as a result of charging the accounts with the value of the realignment and of Project
assets and of the 1983 revaluation of fixed assets; and (c) equity increased with the related increase in the
revaluation reserve.

17.         As project implementation proceeded, it became increasingly evident to Bank supervision missions
that the deterioration of ATC's fnances was mainly due to inefficient operations and managerial procedures and
controls, which were to be blamed on ATC's overcentralized structure and organization. Action aimed at remedying
this situation is described in the following section of this annex devoted to institution building.
C. INSTITUTION BUILDING
18.         Originally the Project was conceived as an implicit follow up to the Second Railway Project, the main
objective of which had been to enable ATC to meet demand for transport of timber originating from northern
Congo, landlocked CAR and to a lesser extent the South-East of Cameroon. At appraisal of Credit 1047-COB this
demand was expected to grow from 137,000 tons on the river transport link, 233,000 tons at river ports, and
500,000 tons on the CFCO railway and at the port of Pointe Noire in 1976 to 360,000 tons, 548,000 tons and
858,000 tons respectively in 1985. While the Second Railway Projeat focussed mainly on capacity increases of the



- 31 -
ANEX I
Page 7 of 8
CFCO and PPN, the new project was to concentrate on boosting timber production and on strengthening the
operational and organizational capacity of VNPTF.
19.         Accordingly, the institutional strengthening component of the Project comprised consultants' services
and technical assistance for (a) implementing the recommendations of TF's and PF's (merged administratively as
'Voies Navigables et Transports Fluviaux, VNTPF) organization and management studies, manpower plan and
review of river transport operations; (b) optimal use of data processing equipment financed under the Project; and
(c) the management study of the Office Congolais du Bois (OCB), a parastatal in charge of the organization and
sales of timber exports. In addition the Project provided (i) technical assistance to help establish a planning and
coordination unit in the Ministry of Transport; (ii) a mainframe computer and peripheral equipment for ATC's
Pointe Noire headquarters and a smaller computer to be installed in the CFCO workshops; and (iii) training of
ATC's data processing staff.
20.         Implementation of the VNTPF related measures was slow and did not bring about the anticipated
institutional, organizational and operational results. Bank Project supervision missions, in conjunction with teams
in charge of preparing the Structural Adjustment Program (Loan 2866-COB) and the Pilot Public Enterprise
Institutional Development Project (DIEP, Loan 2886-COB) came progressively to the conclusion that drastic
structural and organizational action covering the whole of ATC was necessary. Because of its impact on the
country's economy, the restructuring of ATC has become a component of the SAL. To prepare for this action the
Government, ATC and the Bank started in 1986 to implement a plan comprising (a) a reorganization study of ATC,
covering (i) a review of relations between the Government and ATC, (ii) a possible decentralization of ATC's
managerial and financial management responsibilities, and (iii) measures for reducing staff costs; (b) a technical
assistance and training program for improving financial management, accounting and data processing; and (c) a tariff
study. The reorganization study was supplemented by a Complementary Study carried out in mid 1988.
21.         The two organizational studies were carried out by consultants Price Waterhouse and concluded that:
(a)   ATC became unmanageable and needed to be restructured along one of the three following
alternatives: split into three autonomous enterprises, transformation into a holding company or
keeping ATC as is under a widely decentralized organization within which the three branches would
be granted large managerial and financial autonomy under scaled down headquarters. Under each
of these alternatives relations between the Government and ATC or the new enterprises would be
codified under a Contrat-Plan.
(b)   ATC's activities needed to be redeployed towards its primary transport fimction and all ancillary
activities must be transferred to qualified public or private operators.
(c)   River transport services should be restructured under one of the four following alternatives:
(i) conservation of the existing status with an extensive managerial, operational, commercial and
financial reorganization; (ii) establishment of a "Mixed Economy Company", with operations
contracted to a private operator; (iii) subcontracting of specific activities (like stevedoring) or certain
routes to private operators; or (iv) full privatization.
22.         The Govemment was expected to select one of the proposed alternatives for ATC and VNTPF in late
1988 in order to have the consultant propose legal action and transitional measures, and organizational and financial
frameworks for establishing the selected alternative. Meanwhile ATC's management, conscious of the need to take
steps to improve ATC's operational and financial efficiency decided to implement preliminary measures, comprising:

(a)   implementation, w'th the technical assistance of consultants CEGOS, of the reorganization and
decentndization of financial planning and management and of the accounting plan and procedures
recommended by them in their related study carried out in late 1987; and
(b)   implementation, with the technical assistance of consultants BCEOM and in coordination with
consultants CECOS, of the cost accounting and tariff recommendations of the related study carried
out in mid 1989.
23.         In May 1990, COC and the Bank agreed upon an action plan to restructure ATC as a holding
company and to prepare the privatization of river transport operations. This action plan was contingent on the
presentation of a workable financial restructuring scheme which is still to be formulated. The recent wage increses
led to the decision to put in abeyance ATC's restructuring, pending the resolution of the political unrest.
