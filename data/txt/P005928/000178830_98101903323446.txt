APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
I.        The resumption of economic growth after a prolonged recession in
the decade following the Second World War, together with the establishment
of a large domestic motor vehicle manufacturing industry, led to the rapid
growth of highway traffic in Argentina over the past ten years.   The coun-
try's road network, which was more than adequate for a fleet of 500,000 ve-
hicles in the mid-1940's, now has to carry over 2 million vehicles. For the
last decade, Argentina has been adapting its system to meet these demands and,
particularly between 1968 and 1970, an intensive building program has re-
sulted in the reconstruction and paving of many kilometers of highway and in
a number of modern expressways. The investment problem is to insure wise
timing of improvements complemented by systematic choice of appropriate stan-
dards.
ii.       The Bank has been involved in financing Argentine highways since
1961. The first Bank highway project (288-AR) took over seven years to
complete even after the scope had been substantially reduced. The Bank has
been closely associated with recent efforts of the Government to improve
transportation planning and to restore viability to the railroads whose
service had deteriorated badly. A Bank mission reviewed Argentine road
and rail transport in September lq68, and its findings were conveyed to
the Government in early 1969. After agreeing on steps to be taken to im-
prove transport coordination and planning, the Bank in 1969 made a second
highway loan (619-AR) of US$25 million equivalent to help finance the im-
provement of about 800 kIn of highways and the execution of studies to
identify and prepare future highway programs. Construction work has started
satisfactorily on all the highways in the improvement project. The Govern-
ment has prepared a detailed plan for rehabilitation of the railways, for
which Bank lending of US$84 million equivalent is proposed.
iii.      This report appraises a project in Argentina for upgrading 18 road
sections totaling 1,128 km. The project has been based on a highway recon-
naissance survey, and on feasibility studies and detailed engineering includ-
ed in the Second Highway Project (619-AR). It includes widely varying types
of road improvement -- upgrading low standard earth and gravel roads, improving
and repaving existing paved roads, and constructing two- and four-lane sec-
tions of freeway. The roads are located in 10 provinces; thus, together with
the first two highway loans, the Bank will have participated in highway works
in 17 out of Argentina's 22 provinces. The project also provides for consult-
ing services for construction supervision and the preparation of future proj-
ects.



- il -
iv.       The cost of the proposed third highway project is estimated at
US$150 million equivalent. The proposed loan of US$67.5 million, of which
about US$9 million is for contingencies, would finance 45% of the cost of
the civil works (US$54 million, including about US$18 million for local
currency costs) and also 45% of the cost of consulting services for proj-
ect supervision, and for further detailed engineering and feasibility studies
(US$4.5 million, including about US$1.5 million for local currency costs).
v.        Detailed engineering for the project roads is now being completed.
The cost estimates are considered reliable and adequate contingencies have
been included. Consultants will assist the Government in analyzing bids and
supervising construction.
vi.       Execution of the project will be the responsibility of the
National Highway Department (Vialidad). Contracts for the project works
will be let on the basis of international competitive bidding procedures
satisfactory to the Bank.
vii.      The internal economic return of the road sections in the project
varies between 14% and 39%. The average yield is 24%.
viii.     The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$67.5 million equival-
ent. An appropriate term would be 25 years, including a four-year period
of grace.



ARGENTINA
APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Argentina has asked the Bank to help finance
a project costing about US$150 million equivalent, comprising (a) the up-
grading of about 1,128 km of 16 sections of national highway and two sec-
tions of provincial highway, including consulting services for construction
supervision, and (b) additional consulting services for the identification
and preparation of a future highway investment program, including feasibi-
lity and detailed engineering studies.
1.02      This would be the third Bank highway project in Argentina.
The first was a loan (288-AR) of US$48.5 million equivalent, signed in
June 1961, to finance the foreign exchange cost of improving 2,600 km
of national highways, advisory services by consultants and provision of
road maintenance equipment. At the time of the loan, a study of Argentina's
transport svstem was underway with United Nations Special Fund (UNSF)
financing (US$520,000 equivalent), with the Bank acting as Executing Agency;
the study was completed in early 1962 and the results published as the Long
Range Transportation Plan (LRTP).
1.03      A number of problems developed during the first project, such as
lack of local funds, ineffective use of consultants, inadequate manage-
ment of the project and poor quality of work. After unsuccessful efforts
by the Bank to improve the situation, the amount of the loan was reduced
to USA32 mlllion in 1965 to correspond with a reduced scope of work. Sub-
sequent efforts of a new Vialidad management led to the satisfactory com-
pletion of the project by its extended Closing Date of December 31, 1968.
1.04      A Bank mission to Argentina in May 1968 explored the Government's
approach to the transportation sector and concluded that the Bank could play
a useful role in its development. This led, in September-October 1968, to a
transport mission which made a detailed review of rail and road transport;
the mission's findings and recommendations were presented to the Government
at the end of January 1969. Following this work, Argentina has taken steps
to improve transport coordination and planning. The Bank made a second high-
way loan (619-AR) of US$25 million equivalent in June 1969 to upgrade about
800 km of three national highways, plus consulting services for construction
supervision and for carrying out a reconnaissance study for highway invest-
ment priorities and for feasibilitv studies. The loan was only made effect-
ive in January 1970 because of a delay by the Government in ratifying the
Loan Agreement. This caused some months' delay in contracting, but all
contracts have now been awarded at favorable prices. Initial progress is
good, and it is expected that most of the work will be completed near the
end of 1972, about one year behind the original schedule.



-2-
1.05      The 1968 transport mission's findings and recommendations on
railways contributed to the development of a detailed plan to rehabili-
tate and redimension the railways. A US$84 million Bank loar to assist
in financing this plan is proposed.
1.06      The proposed third highway project is largely based on the recon-
naissance survey of investment priorities for national and provincial prim-
ary highways and on subsequent feasibility studies and detailed engineering
included in the Second Highway Prolect. The loan would be in the amount of
US$67.5 million.
1.07      This report was prepared by Messrs. A. van Dijck (engineer) and
B. Shields (economist), members of the Bank appraisal missions in May and
September 1970, and Miss R. Mayes (editor).
2. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2
2.01      Argentina, with an area of 2.8 million km , is the eighth largest
country in the world. The country has a 1970 population estimated at 23.3
million and an overall density of only 8.7 persons per km2. However, two-
thirds of the population is concentrated within 600 km of Buenos Aires, 2
and the population density in the rest of the country is only 2.4 per km
Population growth has been slow with an annual average of 1.5% between 1961
and 1970. Average per capita GDP is about US$820, the second highest in Latin
America, and higher than several European countries. The average annual growth
of real GDP between 1961 and 1970 was 3.7%. Until 1967, economic growth was
uneven, and depressed conditions were accompanied by inflation. In the last
three years, growth has averaged 6% per annum.
B.   Transport Sector
2.02      General:  The terrain is generally very flat, and no major geo-
physical factors influence transport except the Andes to the west and the
Plata River system flowing in a southeasterly direction into the Atlantic
Ocean. The main factor shaping the transport system has been the high
concentration of population and economic activity - industrial and agricul-
tural - near Buenos Aires. With its population of more than eight million,
a port handling over one-third of total port traffic, and its role as the
industrial, financial and commercial center of the country, metropolitan
Buenos Aires is the focal point for transport in Argentina.
2.03      About 78 billion ton km of freight (of which highways accounted
for 36%, coastal shipping 29%, pipeline 10%, rail 18% and river transport
7%) were transported in 1969. A historical series, with projections from
1970 to 1974, is given in Table 1.



- 3 -
2.04      Highways:  Between 1934 and 1944, 24,000 km of national trunk roads
and 30,000 km of provincial primary roads were constructed; and by the mid-
1940's Argentina had one of the finest highway networks in the world. A pe-
riod of reduced road construction followed, initially because the system was
adequate but subsequently because the economy was depressed. The pace in-
creased again in the 1960's, and Argentina now has a network of national and
provincial primary roads totalling some 137,000 km (Table 2). Further details
are given in Chapter 3 and on Map 1.
2.05      Railways:  Argentina has an extensive railway system radiating from
Buenos Aires and largelv concentrated in the surrounding provinces (Map 2).
There are now some 40,000 km of lines in operation under the Ferrocarriles
Argentinos (FA). Since the 1930's, the railway system has been losing traf-
fic to highwavs and pipelines, both in terms of its share of national traffic
and of tonnage carried. The railway deficits are large; until 1970 revenues
had not even covered labor costs. The FA is overstaffed, much of its equip-
ment is obsolete, maintenance is hampered by lack of spare parts, and many
lines are uneconomical. However, during the past four years, management has
improved, and the working ratio dropped from 214 in 1966 to 124 in 1970.
Working losses were US$160 million in 1966 and had dropped to US$59 million
(in 1966 prices) by 1969. Some uneconomical lines have been closed and staff
has been reduced by attrition. Studies by FA and its consultants on feasible
action in regard to other uneconomical lines and excess personnel are underway.
A railway recovery program has been prepared for the period 1971-75. The
Bank, which has for the last two years maintained close contact with PA and
has actively encouraged the recovery measures which have been taken, has re-
cently negotiated a loan to help finance important elements of the first two
years of this program. The FA hopes to break even, except for depreciation
charges, by 1975. The aim is eventually to cover all costs of the redimen-
sioned system.
2.06      Inland Waterways:  The waterway system formed by the Plata river
and its tributaries, the Parana, Uruguay, Paraguay and Alto Parana, includes
more than 3,000 km of navigable routes and carries about 7% of total freight
by all modes. Between 1960 and 1969, ton kilometrage increased at an average
rate of 3.1% p.a., from 4.1 to 5.4 million ton km. A UNDP-financed study to
ascertain whether there are economical means of improving navigation for deep-
er draft vessels on the River Parana between Asuncion, Paraguay and Corrientes
is nearing completion.
2.07      Ports:  There are 77 ports under the control of the General Port
Administration. There are also some private ports for specific products.
Total public port traffic in 1968 was almost 74 million tons, of which Bue-
nos Aires handled over one-third. The ports were notorious in the 1950's
and 1960's for their congestion and inefficiency, but between 1966 and 1968
port turnaround time greatly improved, the average time in port dropping
from 10.0 to 5.5 days. The port of Buenos Aires improved less markedly
than the national average, from 8.7 to 6.4 days. A USAID-financed study of
the need for additional deepwater port capacity in Argentina is currently in
progress.



- 4 -
2.08      Pipelines:  Argentina has an extensive petroleum product pipeline
network of some 10,500 km and is currently extending both its crude and re-
fined products' lines. In 1969 petroleum products' traffic totaled 7.8 bil-
lion ton km, or almost 10% of total freight carried by the domestic trans-
port system. Pipelines are the fastest growing transport mode in Argentina,
and it has been estimated that by 1973 they will carry more freight than the
railways.
2.09      Air Transport:  There are about 100 airports in the country, of
which five can handle international traffic. Domestic passenger traffic
increased from 670 million passenger km in 1965 to 1,087 million passenger
km in 1969, or by almost 13% p.a.
C.   Transport Coordination
2.10      There have been major weaknesses in transportation planning and
coordination and there was, until recently, no transport coordination agency,
and little attempt on the part of the Government to ensure that each mode
of transport performed the functions for which it was best suited. Many of
the problems of the railways referred to above (para. 2.05) stemmed from a
Government policy of keeping rates at artificially low levels to subsidize
the cost of living, and later to maintain traffic which otherwise would have
been lost to other modes. As a result of this policy, the railways were
starved of funds for maintenance and renewals, and service deteriorated so
much that, even with low rates, the railways could not retain their traffic
in a period (1947-1966) when total freight km of traffic in Argentina more
than doubled. Tariffs were substantially increased in 1967, 1969 and in early
1971, the service was improved and traffic has been increasing and is expected
to grow further in spite of periodic rate increases scheduled through 1975.
2.11      The Government has not adopted a consistent well-planned approach
to highway investment in the past twenty years. Periods of high investment
were followed by periods of inactivity (Annex 1). Nevertheless, the highway
system was good enough to permit the rapid growth of trucking services, un-
hampered by any strict regulation. As a result of the good service which
truckers offer, much freight, especially long haul, bulk traffic, moves by
road which an efficient railway system should be able to handle more econo-
mically. The present modal distribution of traffic is more the result of
inferior railway service than of pricing policies, and any practicable in-
crease in highway user charges is unlikely to alter it. The planned reha-
bilitation of the railway is intended to correct the inferior service and
to induce more economic allocation of traffic.
2.12      In 1968, Sectoral Development Offices were established in all the
Secretariats as links with the Consejo Nacional de Desarrollo (CONADE),
which had delegated many of its sectoral planning functions to the spending
ministries. Specifically, the Sectoral Development Office in the Secretariat
of Transport was charged with improving transport coordination and developing



- 5 -
transport investment review procedures. As a further step, the Ministry Re-
organization Law (No. 18416) was passed in October 1969 to remedy organiza-
tional deficiencies in the existing government structure. As a result, the
Secretariat of Public Works and Transport, together with the Secretariats of
Energy, Communications and Water Resources are now in the Ministry of Public
Works and Services. There is only one major public transport responsibility
outside the purview of the Ministry of Public Works and Services - air
transport. The Air Force retains responsibility for planning, constructing
and operating airports and regulating air services.
2.13      The planning and investment review procedures of the Secretariat
of Public Works and Transport should be centralized in the Sectoral Develop-
ment Office. However, some types of transportation studies are still being
sponsored by separate agencies. For example, Vialidad recently sponsored
the first regional intermodal transport study, which resulted in a 1971-75
plan for transport infrastructure in Mesopotamia which is separated from
the rest of the country by the Parana and Uruguay rivers. The Sectoral De-
velopment Office has been involved, together with the rail and port author-
ities, in considering the results of this study. Vialidad wishes to sponsor
similar studies in other regions of the country. Such studies should over-
come the deficiencies of single-mode, single-project studies, and are there-
fore to be encouraged. They would, inter alia, play an important role in
the preparation of subsequent Bank highway projects, but they would be more
effective if mounted by the Sectoral Development Office, and the Government
has accordingly agreed that all planning and investment studies which have
implications for more than one mode of transport will be supervised and co-
ordinated by that Office.
2.14      The Sectoral Development Office was initially handicapped by lack
of staff. The Government during negotiations for the second Bank highway
loan indicated that it intended to engage two foreign transport experts to
advise the Sectoral Development Office on matters of transport coordination
and to train personnel who would later replace the experts. The experts
have not been engaged, but with the increase in professional staff, from
five in 1968 to 10 in 1970, the Office might now appear to be less in need
of outside technical assistance than it was in 1968 when the Second Highway
Prolect was appraised. However, there is still a need to train some of the
staff in the techniques of transport planning and project evaluation. The
Government indicated in discussions with the 1970 Bank economic mission that
it would prefer to send those of its staff requiring further training to
overseas courses, such as the Bank EDI project evaluation and transportation
planning courses, rather than engage foreigners to undertake the work locally.
During negotiations the Government confirmed that qualified personnel would
be appointed in sufficient numbers to permanent positions in this office.

3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A.  The Highway Network
3.01      The primary network of 136,500 km is divided into a national
network of 45,500 km (Map 1) and a provincial primary network of 91,000
km. About 30,000 km of primary road are paved. As can be seen from
Table 2, 90%, or 800,000 km, of the provincial road system consists of
earth roads of varying standards. In general, the present road network
serves traffic adequately, but parts of the system need more capacity to
cater for high traffic volumes and others require pavement strengthening
or upgrading. The investment problem is to ensure wise timing of improve-
ments complemented by systematic choice of appropriate standards. There
is growing acknowledgement on the part of Government of the need for
careful study to precede investment decisions.
B.   Characteristics and Growth of the Vehicle Fleet
3.02      The heavily protected domestic vehicle industry is currently pro-
ducing about 220,000 vehicles per annum. The national fleet has over two
million vehicles, and there is an average of one vehicle for every 11 peo-
ple, close to the European average. The composition and growth pattern of
the fleet are shown in Table 3. Most freight vehicles up to two tons capa-
city are still gasoline fueled, but between 1959 and 1969 twice as many
diesel trucks of over four tons capacity were produced as gasoline trucks
in the same category, and production of gasoline trucks is declining while
diesel truck production is increasing rapidly. As Table 4 indicates, the
rate of growth of consumption of gasoline was far lower (7.6%) than that of
diesel (12.9%) between 1960 and 1969. The distribution of the vehicle fleet
matches the concentration of economic activity, with 60% in Buenos Aires
province and 25% in four other provinces, Santa Fe, Cordoba, Corrientes and
Mendoza. Between 1960 and 1968 average annual growth of private vehicles was
12%, and truck registration increased at the rate of 7% p.a. Recent studies
by Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy and Stratton (TAMS, consultants, US) have led
to growth predictions of 12% and 6% p.a. in automobiles and trucks respective-
ly until 1975, and 8% and 5% p.a. respectively for the subsequent five years.
The probable rates of increase in the different provinces were investigated,
and the growth rates used in the economic evaluation of the project roads
ranged from as low as 1% per annum in Tucuman to 7% per annum in Santa Fe
(see Table 5). These are reasonable estimates.
3.03      Commercial traffic on different roads ranges from 13% to 65% of
total traffic, with 30-40% being most usual. Truck transport is used for
all commodity types transported in the country, on both long and short
distance hauls. Freight rates are low because of the generally flat ter-
rain and good roads, which permit the use of heavy truck trailers with a
low power-to-weight ratio.



-7-
C.   Highway Administration
3.04      Vialidad (see Chart 1), under the Secretariat of Public Works
and Transport, is responsible for planning, constructing and maintaining
the national highway network (Map 1). Provincial Highway Departments are
similarly responsible for the provincial highway networks. Planning and
engineering the national network are done in Headquarters (Buenos Aires);
some field investigations and construction supervision are also handled
from Headquarters. Road maintenance and supervision of construction are
carried out by Vialidad personnel in 24 District Offices. For a country
the size of Argentina with so extensive a road network, many of Vialidad's
activities are too centralized. Furthermore, there is unnecessary duplica-
tion between the national and provincial authorities, especially in the more
developed and populated provinces which have fairly good organizations,
although many of the more remote provinces are almost entirely dependent on
the technical expertise of the Vialidad District Offices.
3.05      Vialidad intends to transfer its detailed planning, construction
and maintenance functions to the provincial authorities, thus allowing it to
concentrate on overall planning and coordination of the highway network.
This institutional reorganization is essential for more efficient management
of highways, but will take many years to carry out. During negotiations for
Loan 619-AR, the broad principles and timing of such reorganization were
discussed and agreed. A recent step has been the transfer of authority for
maintaining national roads to the provincial department of Santa Cruz, and
similar arrangements are in preparation in two other provinces. Furthermore,
agreements are in force for the carrying out of 32 engineering studies and
the supervision of 18 construction works by the provinces. The Government
has expressed its general intention to proceed with decentralization. Viali-
dad is still studying and seeking advice on the detailed scope and timing of
subsequent steps to be taken. A tentative ten-year transition period has
been envisaged. The Bank should follow developments in this field.
3.06      Provision was made in the Second Highway Project for consulting
services and the acquisition of equipment needed to provide the highway manage-
ment with improved traffic and road inventory data for planning and administra-
tion purposes. U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHA) engineers are now
assisting Vialidad in this field. The procurement of the equipment is in
progress. The FHA advisors have proposed a comprehensive rural traffic counting
program designed to obtain and maintain up-to-date estimates of traffic volumes
on each section of the 45,000 km national primary highway system, together
with 8,00n km of major provincial highways including those with paved or con-
solidated surfaces. To achieve this task, the advisors propose continuous
traffic counts at 56 permanent counting stations, together with periodic
counts at over 2,000 stations. The Government has confirmed that it will
continue to collect data needed for highway operations and planning.



-8-
3.07      Another obstacle to efficient highway administration has been
chronic understaffing of Vialidad due to unattractive salaries, although
Vialidad is now permitted to grant merit increases in salaries to staff
members and to contract individual experts for periods up to two years.
Although Vialidad is still at some disadvantage vis-a-vis the private sec-
tor, salary scales were increased in January 1971 which will place Vialidad
in a better position to compete for staff.
3.08      The vehicle weight and dimension regulations are satisfactory,
although penalties are too light to ensure satisfactory compliance and the
enforcement of weight regulations requires improvement. The FHA experts are
now advising Vialidad on a vehicle weighing program which will determine
the actual extent and frequency of overloading. The Government has accord-
ingly agreed to take measures as indicated by the results of the weighing
program, to strengthen the enforcement of the vehicle regulations. A number
of fixed and portable weighing scales were procured under the first highway
loan, and there are now 16 fixed and 24 portable units.
D.   Financing and Planning
3.09      A major problem during the execution of the first Bank highway
project was lack of funds to meet the local costs. The new administration
of Vialidad which was appointed in 1968 has remedied this situation and
during the execution of the 1968-70 Three Year Plan (para 3.17) financed
almost entirely from local funds, there was no such problem, nor is one ex-
pected during the execution of the second and third Bank projects.
3.10      Historically, total receipts from taxes on vehicle ownership and
use have exceeded total expenditures on the highway system. The costs of
investing in, administering and maintaining the highway system are met from
a combination of earmarked fuel, tire and vehicle taxes and general re-
venues of both the provincial and national governments. The amount alloca-
ted from general revenues for highway expenditures has been less than the
yield of the non-earmarked portion of taxes on vehicle ownership and use
which goes into general revenues. In 1969, out of an estimated yield of
1500 million 1970 pesos, 39% (585 million) went either to general revenues
or to the national energy fund. Road user taxes were increased in 1968,
and more substantially in 1969, to finance the increase in highway construc-
tion expenditures required by the 1968-1970 Three-Year Highway Plan. In
Table 6 there is a comparison of the annual total yield of taxes on vehicle
ownership and use in the years 1966-69 with expenditures on the country's
roads in the same years. Because specific taxes on diesel fuel were negli-
gible, it was in the past argued that owners of diesel trucks were not paying
their fair share for the use of the road system. There may, however, have
been elements of hidden taxation in the price of diesel, which was controlled
by the Government. In any case, in January 1971 a tax of $a 0.1 per litre
(about USg10 per gallon) was lmposed on diesel, resulting in a price increase
of 62.5%. Additional taxes equivalent to USJ5 and 6 per gallon respectively
were imposed on regular and special grade gasoline. Vehicle registration



- 9 -
fees were reduced by about 40%. The net increase in revenues from highway
users resulting from the changes will be about US$190 million equivalent p.a.
Vialidad has recently commissioned a study to examine the incidence, equity
and economic efficiency of existing taxes on vehicle ownership and use, the
results of which are expected shortly. The conclusions of the study will
be discussed with the Government when available. The Government also intends
to carry out a study of road user charges with special emphasis on urban
areas; the Bank will be afforded an opportunity to comment on the terms of
reference.
3.11      The revenues from taxes earmarked for highway purposes are allo-
cated on the basis of fixed formulae to funds for national highways, for
provincial primary highways and for provincial secondary and tertiary roads.
The allocation is shown graphically on Chart 2. (The distribution of reve-
nues from the recent tax increases between highway funds and general revenues
is not yet known.) The distribution of the funds for provincial primary roads
among the 22 provinces is based on population distribution, fuel consumption
and the amount of matching revenue collected by the provinces. These formu-
lae do not necessarily result in an optimum allocation of highway funds and
are complicated. A simpler means of making budgetary allocations to implement
national and provincial highway plans seems quite feasible. A proposal for
a change, in accordance with recommendations made by consultants (SAE (Argen-
tina)/Berger (U.S.)), was considered by the National Highway Council, which
is composed of representatives of the national and provincial highway
authorities. This Council concluded in November 1970 that better definition
of the provincial primary road systems was necessary before any change in
the distribution of funds could be introduced. Vialidad will carry out the
necessary studies.
E.   Highway Engineering
3.12      Up to 1967 highway geometric design standards were low, but now
(Table 7) tend to be somewhat high, particularly in respect to roads in
hilly and mountainous terrain. As regards pavements, there has been a
tendency to provide heavier structures than initially are necessary. How-
ever, this tendency has now been checked. In the prenaration of the project,
due consideration has been given to optimizing investments by carefully se-
lecting design standards and by applying stage construction principles
(Annex 2).
3.13      Except where external lenders have insisted on the use of consul-
tants, Vialidad had until recently performed all engineering work and
construction supervision with its own limited forces. Vialidad now makes
extensive use of local consultants to compensate for its shortage of staff.
A list of Argentine consulting firms engaged under Loan 619-AR in the pre-
paration of the proposed project is given in Table 11. TAMS has been co-
ordinating and supervising the work of these consultants.



- 10 -
F.   Highway Construction
3.14      In the past the quality of construction was uneven and construc-
tion periods were often twice as long as initially estimated, mainly due to
lack of funds. Since 1967 sufficient funds and better management in Viali-
dad resulted in timely completion, more rigorous enforcement of contract
conditions and modernization of specifications.
3.15      The local construction industry is well developed.  There are
over 20 large highway construction firms able to handle road contracts of
up to US$15 million per year; a few of these are locally operated subsi-
diaries of large international firms. In the bidding which took place
in 1970 for the road sections financed tnder Loan 619-AR, a small number of
foreign firms bid, although none was able to outbid local firms, which
because of a lull in construction tempo were pricing bids very keenly.
These unusually low bid prices are not likely to be encountered in the
Third Highway Project (para. 4.08).
3.16      Highway construction is carried out under unit price contracts
let after competitive bidding. Post-bidding qualification of contractors
is practiced in Argentina. Since experience with the contracts under
Loan 619-AR has been satisfactory, it is proposed to continue with this
method under the proposed project.
3.17      The Three-Year Plan 1968-70 provided for major reconstruction of
4,320 km of highways. Its total cost was estimated at about US$480 million
in 1968. By early 1970, work on 71 sections, over 2,260 km, costing about
US$270 million had been completed, and work on 61 sections, covering 2,060
km and costing US$120 million was in execution or was expected to start.
Some of the remaining projects are partly financed by IDB and the second Bank
highway loan or are included in the proposed project.
G.   Highway Maintenance
3.18      Quality of maintenance on national roads is good and is expected
to remain so. The average annual expenditure of maintaining one km of the
national network is about US$600 equivalent, which is adequate. Consulting
services to improve the system of maintenance accounting have been provided
by JICEFA (Argentine Management Consultants) as part of the Second hlighway
Project, and a new accounting system will be introduced in 1971. The Govern-
ment has confirmed that it intends to continue maintaining the national high-
way system adequately.
3.19      Maintenance of the primary provincial roads in the more developed
provinces such as Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Santa Fe and Mendoza is satisfac-
tory, as well as in Tucuman province where there are two road sections to
be included in the proposed project. It is less satisfactory in some of
the other provinces. However, decentralization of Vialidad's responsibili-
ties for national roads (para 3.05) should provide a basis for improving
maintenance in these provinces.

4. THE PROJECT
A.   General Description
4.01      The proposed project consists of:
(1)  the improvement and paving of ten gravel and earth road
sections totalling about 761 km;
(2)  the improvement and repaving of two sections of paved
roads totalling about 136 km;
(3)  the construction of two two-lane sections of a four-lane
divided highway totalling about 91 km;
(4)  the construction of four sections of a four-lane divided
highway totalling about 140 km;
(5)  consulting services for construction supervision for
the above highways; and
(6)  additional consulting services to:
(a) coordinate and carry out detailed engineering for
about 1,500 km and feasibility studies for about
2,000 km of road sections to be selected with the
concurrence of the Bank; and
(b) update the primary highway network reconnaissance
survey.
B.   Highways to be Constructed, Improved and Paved
4.02      The roads proposed for construction are listed, with their
essential characteristics, in Table 8 and shown on Map 1.  More detailed
descriptions of the roads, including discussions of the design standards,
are given in Annex 2.  The roads are located in 10 provinces.  Sixteen
road sections form part of the national highway system, and two sections
are part of the provincial highway system of Tucuman.  In the first two
highway loans, sections in Patagonia and in the most northern provinces
were included so that the Bank will be participating in highway construction
in all but five of the 22 provinces in Argentina.
C.   Consulting Services for Construction Supervision
4.03      Advisory services for the construction supervision of the proj-
ect roads would be required to augment Vialidad's limited staff. Similar
services provided by TAMS (US) and Organtec (Argentina) under the first and
second highway projects were satisfactory. Vialidad will divide the much



- 12 -
bigger proposed project into three groups for each of which a firm of engineer-
ing consultants acceptable to the Bank will be employed to assist Vialidad in
analyzing bids, to establish and maintain appropriate supervising procedures
and to ensure coordination between the various works in each group. The
overall coordination of the three groups will be maintained by Vialidad;
these arrangements would be satisfactory.
D.   Additional Consulting Services
4.04      With a view to preparing further highway projects which mav be
suitable for Bank financing, detailed engineering studies for about 1,500
km and feasibility studies for an additional 2,000 km of highways are in-
cluded in the project. The selection, subject to Bank concurrence, will
be based on the reconnaissance survey (para. 1.04) and a five-year invest-
ment plan for 1971-75, prepared by Vialidad, which is now being considered
by CONADE.  These studies, to be carried out by consulting firms satisfac-
tory to the Bank, together with the intermodal studies referred to in para
2.13, should result in two groups of construction projects with a total
cost of about US$120 million each: they should be ready for financing in
1972 and 1973.
4.05      To coordinate feasibility and detailed engineering work, Viali-
dad proposes to continue to employ a firm of engineering consultants, who
will also assist Vialidad in updating the reconnaissance survey carried out
under the Second Highway Project.  These arrangenents were confirmed during
negotiations and are satisfactory.
E.   Cost Estimates and Financing
4.06      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$150 million
equivalent, including contingency allowances. This amount excludes, how-
ever, an estimated US$3 million for right-of-way which is a local cost
item. A summary of the project cost and the Bank's participation follows
and is also given in detail in Table 9.

4.07      The estimates of construction costs are based on November 1970
quantities, derived from substantially completed detailed engineering after
review by the coordinating consultants, TAMS. Unit prices are based on
estimates of Vialidad, the consulting engineers and the coordinating con-
sultants, and are reasonable (para 3.15).
4.08      TAMS' estimate of the foreign exchange component of construction
costs, as adjusted by Bank staff, is about 29% for work carried out by lo-
cal contractors and about 45% for work carried out by foreign contractors.
Assuming that one-fifth of all work would go to foreign contractors, the
foreign exchange component would be 32%. In the bidding that took place
for the road sections financed under Loan 619-AR (where one-third foreign
participation had been anticipated), a small number of bids from foreign
firms were received, but none was sufficiently competitive. However, the
extent of the proposed program and the size of the individual construction
contracts may encourage a modest participation, perhaps up to 20% (para 3.15).
The loan would finance this foreign component and a portion of the local
currency cost representing 13% of total construction costs; thus, the
Bank would finance 45% of such total costs.
4.09      The total costs of consulting services have been based on recent
contracts with local and foreign firms. It is estimated that the foreign
exchange component of the consulting services would be about 30%, reflecting
the proportion of local firms expected to participate. The loan would
finance 45% of the total cost of consulting services, thus including a por-
tion of local currency costs representing 15% of the total cost of such ser-
vices.



- 14 -
4.10      A 10% contingency allowance has been added to the construction
cost for quantity increases. About 5% has been allowed for global (dollar
equivalent) price increases at an estimated 3% p.a. from November 1970
until the end of the construction period, expected to be near the end of
1973. Local cost increases will be accommodated by an acceptable escala-
tion formula which is already in use; it is assumed that adjustments in the
foreign exchange rate of the peso will reflect changes in the relative pur-
chasing power of domestic and foreign currencies.
F.   Disbursements
4.11      Construction is expected to commence in the second quarter of
1971 and be completed near the end of 1973. On this basis, the annual
breakdown of expenditures between the Government and the Bank would be as
follows (for details see Annex 3):

4.12      Any surplus funds remaining in the Loan Account on completion of
the project should be cancelled.
G.   Execution of the Project
4.13      The loan will be to the Government of Argentina and the execut-
ing agency would be Vialidad assisted by qualified consultants under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Two road sections of the provin-
cial primary system in Tucuman are included in the project. Vialidad Nacional
will be responsible financially and administratively for execution of these
works, but future maintenance will be carried out by the provincial highway
authority. It has been agreed with the Government that Vialidad and the Pro-
vince of Tucuman will, before July 1, 1971, conclude an agreement, acceptable
to the Bank, to provide for adequate maintenance and during loan negotiations
the form of this agreement was decided.



- 15 -
4.14      Construction contracts will be let on the basis of unit prices
after international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
established procedures. The value of individual bid items would range
from US$0.3 million equivalent to US$6.0 million. In order to attract
foreign bidders but at the same time enable local contractors to bid for
works of a size appropriate to their capabilities, the Government has
agreed, where feasible, to group the smaller individual works into packages
of two or three items. The contracts in each package will be bid simulta-
neously, and bids allowed for anv or all contracts in the group. The packages
would range in value from US$1.1 million (projects 5 and 6 together) to
US$18.5 million (project 15), and are detailed in Table 9.
4.15      A law has been passed recently in Argentina requiring the national
government, its branches and agencies to use Argentine contracting firms and
engineering consultants to the maximum extent possible. However, the Govern-
ment has agreed during loan negotiations to approve the loan agreement by law,
thus enabling Vialidad to procure goods and services under the proposed loan
in compliance with the Bank's requirements for international competitive bid-
ding. The enactment of this legislation is a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed loan.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The project is economically well justified.  The combined economic
rate of return on investment in all road sections contained in the project
is 24% and ranges from 14% to 39%.
5.02      The initial selection of road sections for the present project
was made after a reconnaissance survev of the national and provincial pri-
mary highway networks conducted by consultants (TAMS) for Vialidad. The
reconnaissance survey (para 1.04) involved the screening of the entire non-
urban primary highway network in order to identify those sections whose
improvement would be most likely to yield the greatest benefit relative to
the cost of the suggested improvement. After initial break-even analysis
using averaRe values had been applied to the entire network, in order to
isolate the most promising sections and reduce the study to manageable pro-
portions, each road section in the selected network was further studied and
ranked in order of priority of its improvement. Subsequent detailed studies
of each section were made by various local consultants with TAMS coordinat-
ing. These studies involved traffic origin and destination enquiries, com-
parative rotute alignment studies and selection of economically warranted
standards.
5.03      The projected investments range from the upgrading of earth and
gravel roads to the construction of two- and four-lane sections of freeway.
Each project and its economic benefits is described in Table 8 and Annex 2.



- 16 -
5.04      Only direct user benefits involving driver and passenger time
and vehicle operating costs were evaluated.  Other benefits which have not
been included are reduced breakage and spoilage, accident reduction, tiile
costs to goods in transit, and savings due to elimination of road closures
in bad weather; to the extent that an improvement will produce stuch beiie-
fits, net benefits have been understated, but for most roads in the proi''ect
they are not likely to be significant.  In addition to user benefits, cih- Kes
which were expected to occur in maintenance costs as a result of a proposed
highway improvement were included in the analysis. As a basis for com-
puting benefits, TAMS developed estimates of vehicle qperating costs for
different conditions in Argentina based on de Weille_L and using current
Argentine input prices. These estimates, which are satisfactorv, are
shown in Table 10.
5.05      Construction costs used in the economic analyses are net of taxes
but include costs of land acquisition which are assumed to reflect the al-
ternative use value of the land.
5.06      The construction costs for the 10 earth or gravel roads (Nos. 1 to
10 in Table 8) to be paved in the proposed project are not considered likely
to vary by more than 10% from the present estimates. Traffic on these roads
is expected to grow between 1970 and 1980 at rates ranging from 1% p.a. to
6% p.a. The consultants' forecasts were carefully developed and, if anything,
are on the conservative side, but even so the First Year Benefit (FYB) in
1973, the first year of opening for all sections, in all cases is at least
11% and in most cases is between 15% and 20%. Sensitivity analysis shows
that, even if costs exceeded the estimates by 10%.. the probable maximum,
and traffic grew at half the forecast rate, which is improbable, all road
sections in this category would have an FYB of 10% or higher. The Internal
Economic Return (IER) in all cases will exceed the FYB and all these roads
are therefore well worth including in the proposed project.
5.07      Two roads (Nos. 11 and 12 in Table 8) are being considered for
improvement and repaving. These are roads which when first paved were
capable of carrying the limited traffic foreseen. An increasing number of
heavy trucks is contributing to their rapid deterioration and both road
maintenance costs and vehicle operating costs are increasing. It is known
that sooner or later, within the next three or four years, without radical
rehabilitation these roads would break up so badly that vehicle operating
conditions would be inferior to those on unpaved roads. When the actual
critical failure will occur is, however, not known. The economic analysis
has been conducted by comparing the very heavy maintenance costs (including
initial deferred maintenance) which would be required over a 20 year period
1/ Quantification of Road User Savings, World Bank Occasional Paper
Number Two, 1966.



- 17 -
to maintain an acceptable level of service on the road with the capital costs
of reconstruction. At the same time, alignment and drainage improvements
will be made which would be warranted were the roads being built from scratch
for the volumes of traffic they currently carry. The IER of these projects
is 16% and 20%.
5.08      The third category of improvements included in the project involves
roads where congestion warrants an increase in capacity. Six sections of
road (Nos. 13 to 18 in Table 8) fall into this category. The lowest FYB
for these projects is 11% and the lowest IER is 19%.
5.09      As shown in Table 8, the lowest IER for the road improvements in
the project was 14%. The lowest FYB was 11%. No "opportunity cost of
capital" has been adopted specifically for planning purposes in Argentina.
However, Argentine consultants, Fundacion de Investigaciones Economicas
Latino Americanas (FIEL) have recently (November 1970) made a study of this
and found the cost of capital for the public sector to have a lower limit
of 8%.
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government on the following principal points:
(a) All planning and investment studies which have implications
for more than one mode of transport will be the primary
responsibility of the Sectoral Development Office (para.
2.13);
(b) Vialidad will take measures, as appropriate, to strengthen
the enforcement of the vehicle regulations (para. 3.08);
(c) Vialidad will contract three acceptable consulting firms to
assist in supervising construction (para. 4.03);
(d) Vialidad will contract acceptable consulting firms for
feasibility studies and detailed engineering for further
highway projects and will also continue to employ coordi-
nating consultants (para. 4.05); and
(e) Satisfactory arrangements will be concluded between Vialidad
and the Province of Tucuman before July 1, 1971 with respect
to the execution and future maintenance of two provincial
road sections (para. 4.13).



- 18 -
6.02      The Governmuent has written to the Bank stating its intentions in
regard to:
(a) strengthening the Sectoral Development Office (para. 2.14);
(b) the scope and timing of subsequent steps in decentralizing
some of Vialidad's functions (para. 3.n5): and
(c) measures to strengthen Vialidad's staff (para. 3.07).
6.03      The enactment of legislation to enable Vialidad to procure goods
and services in compliance with the Bank's requirements for international
competitive bidding will be a condition of effectiveness of the loan (para.
4.15).
6.04      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$67.5 million equivalent; on the basis of the economic life of the
project highways, an appropriate term would be 25 years, including a four-year
grace period.

standards DIN-1075II as modified and set forth in the Vialidad standard design
manual (in use]9OD) entitled "Bases para el Calculo de Puentes de Hormigon Armado."
Pavement design is based on a 12,000 lb. wheel load equivalent.
2/    For structures lOm long or less, total width generally equals pavement width plus
shoulders.

Argentina, Third Highway Project
Previous Bank Highway Projects and Other External Assistance for Highways
1.        The first Bank highway loan (288-AR, US$ 48.5 million equivalent)
was made in June 1961 to finance the foreign exchange cost of improving
2,600 km of national highways (see Map 1) including advisory services by
consultants and road maintenance equipment. At the time of the loan, a
study of Argentina's transport system was underway with United Nations
Special Fund (UNSF) financing (US$ 520,000 equivalent), the Bank acting as
Executing Agency; the study was completed in early 1962 and the results
published as the Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP).
2.        A major highway investment program had been undertaken in 1959
after a decade of limited activity in the highway sector. Although Vialidad's
capacity to undertake this program was limited when the Bank's first loan
was made, there was good reason to believe that the deficiencies could be
overcome with the strong leadership prevailing in Vialidad at that time and
with the help of consultants. However, with a series of changes in Government
and Vialidad management beginning in 1962, the construction schedule was
not met and consultants were not used properly. Road works scheduled for
completion in two or three years took twice as long to complete with higher
costs than previously estimated.
3.        The first Bank highway project was also severely affected by lack
of local counterpart funds, and in 1963 USAID made a loan of US$ 30.5 million
to cover the project's local currency costs. After unsuccessful efforts by
the Bank to improve execution of the work, the Bank loan was reduced in 1965
from us: 48.5 million to US$ 32.0 million and the scope of road construction
was curtailed. The Closing Date of the Loan was conditionally extended by
two years to the end of December 1967 with the proviso that certain per-
formance requirements should be met at the end of the first year of the
extension .
4.        The Government which came to office in 1966 took steps which
improved the execution of the Bank project, such as providing Vialidad with
adequate fuiids, strengthening the office in Vialidad which was responsible
for coordinating activities related to the project, assigning more staff
for the supervision of construction, and making more effective use of
consultants. These improvements warranted the Bank's extension of the Closing
Date of the two-year period already mentioned. A new Vialidad management
was installed in mid-1967 in order to overhaul the organization and prepare
new investment programs. The first program, a Three-Year Plan (1968-1970),



Annex 1
Page 2
was hurriedly put together in 1967. A highway planning department was also
established in Vialidad.  As a result, the execution of the first highway
project became satisfactory and led to the eventual extension of the Closing
Date of the Bank loan to December 31, 1968, in order to permit full dis-
bursement against the construction works which were successfully completedu
in April 1968, and to use up an estimated US$ 1.7 million balance in the
loan to procure additional maintenance equipment. A further US$ 1 million
was not required, and at the request of the Government was cancelled f-orm
the loan account in August 1968. Procurement under the loan was satisfac-
torily completed.
5.       Other external assistance to the highway sector during the period
was provided by the US Government through AID and the Export-Import Bank,
with loans between 1961 and 1968 totaling US$ 21 million for improving a
main trunk road and for assisting the construction industry to import
equipment and about US$ 3 million for highway feasibility studies in the
northeastern part of the country. The Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) made two loans in December 1967 totaling US$ 72 million to help improve
the Argentine section (100 km) of an international road linking the city of
Mendoza with the Chilean port of Valparaiso and to finance the construction
of a bridge over the River Parana at Corrientes in the northeast. During
the current fiscal year the IDB proposes to lend  US$33.5 million in a
US$80 million program consisting of 825 km of national and provincial road
in the provinces of Entre Rios, Missiones, Corrientes and Formosa. The
project also includes an international bridge over the Uruguay River at
Fray Bentos, part of which will be paid for by Uruguay.
6.       The second Bank highway loan (619-AR) of US$ 25 million equivalent
was made in June 1969 to finance the upgrading of 800 km of road, the identi-
fication and preparation of a Five-Year Highway Investment Program, including
the carrying out of a reconnaissance priority ranking study of the national
and provincial primary road networks, the carrying out of feasibility studies
and detailed engineering for the highest priority sections of the system and,
finally, for the improvement of planning and administration of the road net-
work and the Government's transport coordinating machinery.  Provision was
also made for the acquisition of equipment necessary for improved planning
and preparation of highway projects. The construction of all roads in the
project is now under way. The reconnaissance survey has been carried out.
United States Federal Highway Administration personnel are now assisting
Vialidad in the improvement of the nationwide road inventory and traffic
counting system.

THE PROJECT ROADS
Data on the existing roads and proposed technical characteristics
of the project roads, together with the results of the economic analysis,
are summarized in Table 8. A general description of the project roads
follows:
A.   The Improvement and Paving of Route 14
The project includes the 422 km section Gualeguaychu to Paso
de los Libres of Route 14. The road forms the spine of the Mesopotamia
area which consists of the provinces of 3ntre Rios, Corrientes and Miasiones.
The road leads from Buenos Aires to Posadas in the north. IDB intends to
finance the southern section Zarate to Gualeguaychu. The province of
Corrientes is improving the sections north of Paso de los Libres. The
Government intends to build the bridges over the La Plata branches at
Zarate near Buenos Aires.  The viability of the project road does not
depend on construction of the bridge.
Improvement and paving of the road is long overdue. The sections
south of Concordia will have traffic of about 1,000 vehicles per day upon
completion of the paving and have internal economic returns which average
22%. The design has been based on Class III Standards (Table 5). The
extent of improvements of the sections north of Concordia where traffic
upon completion of the road will be between 400 and 600 vehicles per day
was studied extensively. The sections near Concordia were based on Class
III, the remainder on Class IV Standards. The internal economic returns
on these sections are 15%.
B.   The Improvement and Paving of Nine Other Earth
or Gravel Road Sections
The proposed project includes, apart from Route 14, nine bther
earth or gravel roads to be realigned and paveds

The main characteristic of these earth and gravel roads is that paving is overdue;
all projects (except Nos. 5 and 6) are in main corridors. Roads Nos. 5 and 6 in
Tucuman are earth roads near the provincial capital with sufficient traffic to
warrant paving. Average traffic in the year after completion is estimated to be
over 500 vehicles per day. The existing roads are in relatively flat terrain
(except No. 7). The roads are dusty and erosion often has depressed the running
surface below ground level, making drainage difficult. Driving conditions often
are poor, resulting in generally low vehicle operating speeds. Increasing traffic
would lead to further deterioration of the roads and further decline of service-
ability and operating speeds. Road No. 7 in Missiones leading to the Iguazu
Waterfalls in hilly terrain will provide a shorter and better aligned variant to
the earth track now in use. The average internal economic return of the nine pro-
ject roads is 20%, varying between 14% and 37%.

These road sections are representative of another important type of road
improvement. Many roads in Argentina were given light pavements to meet limited
traffic, but with an increasing number of heavy trucks the pavements are breaking
up; maintenance costs, vehicle operating costs and journey times are increasing.
The alignment and drainage of the roads will be improved before the new pavement
is constructed. The two project roads have traffic of about 2,500 vehicles per
day. The internal economic returns are about 17%.

TOTAL       230.9 km
With increasing traffic, two-lane roads become congested and average travel
speeds begin to decrease; the process can be retarded by improvements on the existing
two-lane roads. However, thereafter the solution is to increase capacity by adding
an additional carriageway (project 13). Often the old alignment is not suitable, and
a new alignment must be sought. If traffic requires, a full four-lane road will be
constructed (as is the case for projects 14, 15, 16 and 17) or initially a two-lane
road may be sufficient (as in project 18). The average traffic on the existing roads
is about 6,000 vehicles per day. The internal economic returns range from 19% to
39%.
