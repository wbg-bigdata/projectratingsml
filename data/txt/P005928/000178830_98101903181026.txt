IN ERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A THIRD ROAD PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to
US$6765 million to the Argentine Republic for a third road
project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        On June 30, 1961, the Bank made a loan of US$48-5
million for the construction and improvement of about 2,600 km
of roads and the purchase of road maintenance equipment. At
that time the Bank was also the Executing Agency for a UN
Special Fund long range study of transport in Argentina. The
1961 road project was not completed until 1968 and not until
its scope had been reduced considerably and US$17.5 million
of the original loan amount cancelled.
3.        In 1968, the Government asked the Bank to review the
problems and requirements of the Argentine transport sector
and also to consider financing another road project. A mission
studied the transport sector in September 1968 and reported
that (i) existing institutional arrangements did not promote
effective planning or execution of a coordinated transport
policy; a central body was needed to collect the necessary
data, formulate common criteria for selecting investments,
assist in making decisions on the pricing of transport services,
and introduce a coordinated approach to the whole transport
sector; (ii) despite considerable improvements in the
operations of the railways since 1966, a comprehensive
rehabilitation and investment effort was required to bring
about substantial improvements in the service and to restore
financial equilibrium; (iii) while the road system was
extensive it needed to be adapted to the changing traffic
requirements by selective investments; improvement was also
needed in road administration, and in planning and coordinating
investments. The mission's findings were discussed with the
Government and were generally accepted; on that basis, the Bank
prepared to support the development of the transport sector.
4.        A second road loan of US$25 million was signed on
June 24, 1969, to help finance the construction and improvement
of 800 km of roads, consultants' services and purchase of equip-
ment. The consulting services were intended not only to assist
the government to ensure proper supervision of the project but
also to assist in organizing systematic highway planning
for the future. The loan did not become effective until
January 1970 due to delays in completing the legal formalities.






-2-
This caused delays in the execution of the project, but
construction is now satisfactorily undenray on all road
sections and substantial disbursements are expected in the
near future. The project is expected to be completed near the
end of 1972.
5.        There has been considerable progress in the transport
sector since 1968. The national highway organization (Vialidad
Nacional) has been reorganized and strengthened. There has
been effective use of consultants in planning, engineering and
supervision of roads and the competence of local consulting
firms is developing. A reconnaissance survey of the primary
highway network to identify high priority roads has been
completed. The Secretariat of Public Works and Transport has
created an agency for coordinated planning of transport invest-
ment. As part of the development of the transport system a
comprehensive five-year rehabilitation plan has been drawn up
for the railways, designed to improve efficiency, reduce costs
and eliminate the heavy financial deficit. The Bank has
closely followed the formulation of the rehabilitation program
and a proposed US$84 million loan to help finance the first
two years of this plan is presented to the Executive Directors
simultaneo'isly.
6.        The proposed third highway loan responds further
to the Goverrnment1s progressive transport policies. The project
has developed from feasibility and engineering studies on
priority roads identified by the reconnaissance survey.
7.        The negotiation of the proposed loan took place in
Washington initially at the end of November 1970 and was
continued in December 1970 and completed early in February
1971. The Argentine government was initially represented by
Ing. Robert M. Aguero (Administrator General of the highway
organization), and later by Dr. Juan Llamazares (Undersecretary
in the Ministry of Public W4orks and Services).
S.        The proposed loan would be the eighth to Argentina.
The following is a summary statement of the previous Bank
loans to Argentina, as of January 31, 1971.

commitments to companies in Argentina for a total of US$23.7
million. IFC presently holds US$7.2 million for its own account;
this has been totally disbursed.
10.      The 1967 livestock loan was designed to help finance a credit
program in the Balcarce area. Utilization of the credit by
ranchers was slow at first, due to delays in setting up the
project organization and to unfavorable relative prices for
livestock.  However, commitments began to accelerate in the
middle of 1970, probably due in large measure to the great
improvement in relative cattle prices that occurred in 1970,






r.k'Lviding ranchers with much stronger incentives to invest.
The project was reviewed by a reappraisal mission in June 1970
vllich proposed modifications in organization and relending
pMcc6durcoo; some of these have already been implemented and
cthers ar,3 under discussion with the Government. Larger
disbuirsemants are expected in the near future as a result of
the iricre6sed rate of commitment since mid-1970.
11;      Progress on the El Chocon hydroelectric project,
being finaaced by the 1968 loan to Hidronor, is satisfactory and the
first two -mits are expected to be commissioned in 1973. The 1968
loan to SE3LA has been fully utilized and no problems have arisen
in the exBcution of the project being financed by the 1969 loan.
PMRT II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
12.      Borrower:                The Argentine Republic
Amount:                  In various currencies
equivalent to US$67,5 million
Purpose:                 To help finance impro'vement
of 1,128 km of roads and
consulting services
Amortization:            In 25 years, including a 4-year
period of grace, through
semi-annual installments beginning
May 1975 and ending November
1995.
Interest Rate:           7-1/l percent per annum
Commitment Charge:       3/4 of one percent per annum
PART III - THE PROJECT
13.      A report entitled "Appraisal of a Third Highway Project,
Argentina" (PTR - 65a) is attached.
l4.      The Argentine economy's transport needs are being
increasingly met by the highways. The national and provincial
primary road network consists of 137,000 km and carries about 36
percent of the total freight traffic. Investment in primary roads
during the last decade has been substantial but the more
systematic planning introduced for the transport sector during the
last two years is expected to assist in ensuring a more rational
use of resources. Highway users at present amply pay for the
cost of the inter-urban highway system. In order to improve
transport coordination and planning further, the Argentine
authorities propcse to strengthen Vialidad Nacional and the Sectoral
Development Office in the Secretariat of Public Works and Transport.
They also propose to review the present system of allocating
resources among the national and various provincial road
organi zations.






15.      The prrject is estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$150 million, of ishich the proposed loan of US$67.5 million
would finance 45 percent. The project entails paving and
upgrading 18 sectinns of highway, amounting to 1,128 km in
length. Included are important sections of Route 14, which is
the major road artery of the Mescpotamia region; after completion
of the IDB-financed Fray Bentos bridge over the River Paraguay
and the links to it and to the proposed Zarate-Brazo Largo bridge
over the River Parana, this road will improve access from
Buenos Aires tr, Brazil and Uruguay. The loan would also help
finance improvements to Route 9, which serves the densely
populated industrial belt between Buenos Aires and Cordoba.
The internal economic return on the roads included in the
project is computed to be 24 percent. Another part of the
project is the retention of consulting services to assist
Vialidad in carrying out feasibility studies on 2,000 km of road
and engineering studies on about 1,500 km of road for future
projects, in ceeordinating the studies and in up-dating the
reconnaissance survey of the primary highway network carried
out in the second road project. The project is expected to be
completed by 197h.
16.      The foreign exchange component of the project, computed
at 32 percent of construction costs and 30 percent of consulting
service costs, is estimated to be about US$48 million. The
proposed loan of US$67.5 million would, therefore, cover about
US$19.5 million of local expenditures. The analysis in the
attached memorandum on the economy concludes that international
financial institutions should finance some local expenditures
to help Argentina sustain a public investment program of an
appropriate size.
17.      Contracts for construction will be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding. A recently passed law
governing procurement by public agencies will not affect the
award of the contracts in accordance with the Bank's normal
requirements for bidding. The government will take all measures
necessary to enable the procurement of goods and services
under the project according to the procedure set forth in the
draft loan agreement. The government intends to do so by
passing a law approving the proposed loan documents; this will
be a condition of effectiveness.
18.      Tle project includes two road sections of the Tucuman
provincial system. The government will arrange for construction
of these roads by Vialidad Nacional and for their satisfactory
maintenance thereafter.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Argentine Republic
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and






-6-
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed lnan are being
distribited to the Executive Directors separately. The
Agreeme;it follows closely the form currently used for loans for
road projects.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.      A report (No.WH-19la) on the Economy of Argentina was
circulated to the Executive Directors on June 3, 1969. A report
based on the work of the mission which was in Argentina from
April to June 1970 and on discussions early this year with members
of the new Government will be circulated to Executive Directors
in due course. A summary memorandum attached outlines the
principal recent economic developments. It concludes in part
that Argentina has good prospects for continuing the satisfactory
rate of growth achieved in the past few years, provided policies
are followed that enable the country to continue its high rate
of investment. Important to the achievement of these objectives
will be fiscal policies and state enterprise pricing policies
designed to increase public sector savings, and the introduction
of price and other incentives that will secure an expanding
volume of exports. The Government is committed to accelerating
the rate of growth of the economy, and is prepared to pursue
appropriate policies.
21.      In the context of expanding national income and exports
Argentinals large public external debt service payments in
prospect (17-21 percent of foreign exchange earnings in the next
six years) should prove manageable.  Argentina should therefore
be creditworthy for the twzo loans proposed today (US$67.5 million
for roads and US$84 million for railways). In fact these loans
will assist Argentina to improve the average maturity of her
external debt.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICIES OF AGREEMENT
22.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATIONS
23.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.

MEVORANDUM ON TIE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN ARGENTINA
1.         This memorandum is based on the findings of a mission
which visited Argentina in April-June 1970 to review the overall
economic situation and on discussions that took place in January
1971 with the new government that recently took office.   A full
economic report will be circulated to the Executive Directors in
due course.
Recent Economic Trends
2.         Flrom 1967 through 1970 the Argentine Government carried
out a highly successful stabilization program. Through skillful
fiscal and monetary management an environment favoring economic
expansion was created and the gross national product increased
steadily. Accelerating through 1969, when output increased by
about 6.5 percent, the rate of growth of GDP in 1970 slackened to
around 5 percent. With population growing at only 1.5 percent
annually, income per capita increased considerably. Employment also
increased and some progress was made in eliminating unemployment.
Although agricultural production has followed an erratic course
in recent years, crop production levels were very favorable in
1969 and 1970, both as a result of increased acreage and favorable
weather conditions. Improved export prices have stimulated output,
especially of feedgrains and oilseeds. Industrial output has risen
at a rate of 7 percent per annum since 1967, thereby reducing excess
capacity and allowing firms to spread high overhead costs over a
larger volume of sales.
3.         The growth of the past few years is largely the result
of a major change in the direction of economic policy which took
place in 1967. An aggressive stabilization policy was inaugurated
whose main features included a large devaluation of the peso; a
substantial reduction in the fiscal deficit; the provision of
adequate credit to the private sector; a considerable increase in
public investment; and a substantial lowering of industrial
protection.
4.         The stabilization effort had considerable success through
mid-1970. The combination of wage, monetary, credit and fiscal
policies succeeded in reducing the rate of inflation from around 30
percent in 1966 to less than 10 percent in 1969. Moreover,
disinflation was not accompanied by recession as in previous
stabilization efforte. One of the main elements in the stabilization
program was the Government's firm incomes policy aimed at avoiding a
cost-push inflation. The devaluation of 40 percent in March 1967
soughtto restore confidence in the external value of the currency
and thereby encourage both the repatriation of Argentine capital and
an inflow of new capital from abroad. The task of reducing
inflation while promoting growth was greatly facilitated by a number of
factors, including a favorable balance of payments position in
1965-66 and excellent harvests in 1969 and 1970.

5.         In addition to the highly offective growth-stimulating
policies followed by the Government, the principal factors responsible
for expanding output were a rapidly increasing investment level and
a substantial increase in export earnings. Under the impetus of
price, wage, credit and exchange rate policies aimed at stimulating
the private sector, private investment expanded rapidly beginning in
1967. The increase made possible by Elgher savings was supplemented
by a modest inflow of foreign private investment. Public capital
formation expanded even more rapidly as all levels of Government --
national, state enterprises and the provinces and municipalities --
increased investment across a broad front, theroby beginning to fill
some of the most pressing gaps in an economic infrastructure which
had progressively deteriorated over a prolonged period marked by
neglect of transport, fuel, power, communications and other sectors.
The rapid expansion of public investment was facilitoted by a large
increase in public saving.
6.         Even though exports in 1970 exceeded their high 1969 level
by 10 percent in value, the fairly vigorous and continuous recovery
which the Argentine economy experienced since 1967 was partially
interrupted in mid-1970 by two events. One was the resumption of
inflation which had its roots chiefly in a shortage of beef, the
country's principal basic article of consumption and export earner.
The cost of living increased by 22 percent in 1970, as compared
with 7 percent in 1969. Additional factors exacerbating the price
inflation were substantial wage increases and a moderately greater
resort to bank financing of the Treasury deficit. A second factor
which contributed to a decline in the rate of growth was a change in
government followed by a period of public uncertainty as to the
future direction of economic policy. President Ongania was
removed from office in June by the ruling military junta consisting
of the chiefs of the three armed forces; he was succeeded by
President Levingston. The latter's first economic team, in office
from June through October, emphasized continuation of the
stabilization policies of the previous government. The Minister of
Economy who took office in October 1970, while endorsing the goal of
reducing the rate of inflation, has placed great stress on
accelerating economic growth and achieving rising real wages. The
first measures of the new economic team were apparently designed to
meet the economic demands of the various social groups. They
included moderate increases in wages, as well as a return in early
1971 to the collective bargaining which was suspended in 1967; tax
and credit incentives to the agricultural sector; liberalized credit
for domestically owned enterprises; a temporary increase in import
duties to protect national industry; and tax and credit incentives
aimed at promoting exports.






-3-
7.         To deal with the current economic problems the intention of
the Government is to reinvigorate the economy by launching a
substantial public investment program and to restore the confidence of
the private business sector by offering credit, tax and export
incentives. The Government hopes to achieve a 6 percent rate of
growth in real GNP in 1971 while confining the rate of price
incroase to around 10 percent. Use is to be made of wage and price
guidelines in an effort to check the development of cost-induced
inflation. The authorities plan to follow fiscal, monetary and
credit policies consistent with their stated growth and stabilization
objectives.
8.         In the medium-term, the declared intention of the
Government is to seek a high rate of economic growth -- 8 percent
per year in GNP by 1975 -- while reducing the pace of inflation;
to bring about an increase in real wages; to increase public
investment by mobilizing a high level of public savings as well as
by drawing on external resources, and to promote a rapid acceleration
of exports. The Government has already taken steps to encourage
investment in the key agricultural sector and to provide new
incentives for the expansion of exports. It recognizes the need to
improve farmers' confidence in the adequacy and continuity of
public policies toward the sector. Considerable emphasis is also
being placed on the expansion of exports of manufactures and a
program of incentives to this end has been prepared.   As is described
below, a number of measures to augment public saving have recently
been introduced.
Public Finance Performance
9.         The stabilization period was notable for a substantial
improvement in Treasury financial operations, in respect of both the
size of the fiscal deficit and its means of financing. By increasing
revenue and checking the growth of expenditure, the Government
succeeded in reducing the deficit from 33 percent of total expenditure
in 1966 to about 12 percent in 1970; the devaluation made possible the
introduction of substantial export taxes which contributed greatly to
the improved fiscal performance. In current pesos, the size of the
deficit was smaller in 1969 and 1970 than in 1966, and a considerable
part of it -- more than half in 1969 -- was financed from non-Bank
sources.  In both 1969 and 1970, Argentina succeeded in raising
significant amounts of finance by selling bonds both abroad and at
home.
10.        A key element in the Government's stabilization policy
inaugurated in 1967 was the strengthening of public sector finances
through tax reform, improved tax administration and containment of
current expenditures. As a result of these efforts and the improved
performance of state economic enterprises, public sector savings rose
from 2 percent of GNP in 1966 to over 7 percent in 1970. The Treasury
deficit declined from 3.7 percent of GNP in 1966 to 1.2 percent in
1970, and recourse to central bank financing dropped from around
$al,000 million to about $a500 million between 1966 and 1970, in
current prices. Nevertheless, as a result of a large increase in






-4-
public investment, public savings, which had covered virtually all
investment in 1968, financed only about three-quarters of capital
expenditure in 1969 and 1970.
11.        In the past many factors contributed to the fiscal problem,
including weakness of tax organization and administration; excessive
reliance on. foreign trade taxes, especially taxes on exports of
agricultural commodities which have had to be continually adjusted
downward with domestic inflation; and inflexibility in the pricing
of goods and services provided by state economic enterprises in
an invironment of inflation. The 1971 budget incorporates serious
efforts to improve both tax organization and administration.
Progress has been made in reducing the reliance on taxes from
exports on agricultural commodities by eliminating meat export taxes
and in substituting other sources of revenue while closing loopholes in
existing taxes.  While considerable improvements have taken place in
public finances, further strengthening will be necessary to support
expanded levels of public investment in the future.
12.        The very considerable accomplishments in improving the
performance of the state economic enterprises have been continued in
1971 with substantial increases in a number of public utility rates.
In 1966 the state economic enterprises experienced a combined current
deficit, while in 1970 their savings financed an estimated one-third
of investment, which in real terms was more than 60 percent above
the 1966 level. This improvement was largely due to gains in
revenue, which primarily reflected more realistic rates, although
gains in productivity and efficiency as a result of increased
utilization of capacity were also contributing factors. Control
of the growth of current expenditures was facilitated by the
Government's policy of reducing excess staff; employment in the state
enterprises fell by over 35,000 employees or 11 percent between
1966 and 1969. The reductions in the excessive labor force in the
railways and the state petroleum corporation were especially marked.
These improvements are expected to continue and considerable reliance
is therefore placed on future growth of savings in the state
economic enterprises.
Balance of Payments and Creditworthiness
13.        Argentina's growth in the past three years has been
associated with large current account deficits in its balance of
payments. These deficits represented a reversal of the experience
during 1963-67 when substantial surpluses were recorded. The
deteriorating current account deficits during the past three years
resulted in part from the very substantial increases in imports
associated with economic expansion and some steps in the direction
of import liberalization, but alsb in part from the rapid growth in
interest payments as well as in profit remittances beginning in
1966. To cover these current account deficits and make amortization
payments on external debt, substantial inflows of external capital
were required during 1968-70, averaging some US$600 million annually.
Amortization payments on external debt, the bulk of which was public
debt, amounted to some US$4h5 million annually.






-5-
14.        Imports in Argentina have shown strong cyclical fluct-
uatio'is, -eflecting on the one hand attempts to increase domestic
output anl1 on the other the implc-mentation of policies to overcome
tha pe2iodic balance of payments crisss.    Following the 1967
dev.luation, imports increased by almost 7 percent in 1968, 35 percent
in 1969 and 9 percent in 1970. Most of the increase was due to
Capittil and intermediate g;oods and was the result of the resurgence
in econouic activity; the impact of the reduction of tariffs; exchange
ra-te speculation after mid-1969; removal of some import controls
and probably some rebuilding of stocks.
15.        Between the mid-and late 1960's there was little increase
in the overall value of exports, as increases in earnings from meat
and livestock.products, industrial products and feed grains offset
declines from wheat, vegetable oils and wool. In 1969 and 1970 the
growth in merchandise exports was quite marked, with livestock and
especially feed grains exports experiencing a considerable increase.
The increase in value of feed grains sales reflected the confluence of
several important developments: strong world prices, large
increases in acreage and very favorable harvest conditions.
16.        From the standpoint of fostering development it is
desirable to continue the recent rapid rate of import growth as an
integral part of exposing domestic industry to foreign competition,
correcting presently distorted price relationships and consumption
pattern, improving the terms of trade of agriculture, and supporting
a high rate of investment. The attainment of the required increase
in imports will hinge principally on two factors, the ability of the
economy to expand its export earnings, and to secure a large volume
of external capital on reasonable terms. Past Argentine experience
has demonstrated that a stable domestic economy and effective and
consistent Government policies to encourage the agricultural and
foreign trade sectors are essential to vigorous growth in exports
and a hoalthy balance of payments. Achieving a significant rate of
export growth will require the maintenace of adequate export
incentives, including a realistic exchange rate.
17.        Even if efforts to increase export earnings are successful,
the financing of the level of imports necessary to achieve an adequate
rate of growth will necessitate a large capital inflow. In the 1960's
there has not been an adequate inflow of long-term credits. Most
external credit came from suppliers, private financial institutions
and bond issues in the international capital market, although in
recent years a substantial improvement has been made by Argentina in
obtaining long-term loans. In December 1969 about 13 percent of
the outstanding debt was in the form of long-term project loans
from international lending institutions; this compares with 9 percent
in 1967 and about 7 percent in 1964.
18.        Comparison of the reasonable external capital requirements
of the public sector in the next few years with the foreign exchange
content of that portion of public sector investment which seems suit-
able -for foreign project loans reveals that some local expenditure






-0-
financing will be necessary. After taking into account projected
foreign bond issues, suppliers credits and the estimated foreign
exchango component of projects suitable for international agency
financing, an unfilled gap of roughly 10 percent of project loans
would remain. If this gap is to be filled loans will have to
cover part of the local expenditure as well as the foreign
expenditure on the projects they finance.
19.        One of the objectives of Argentine policy over the near and
medium-term should be an improvement in its debt profile. Some
improvement has already taken place in the last few years, the public
debt service ratio declining from 27 percent of exports of goods and
services in 1968 to an estimated 21 percent in 1970. However, the
debt structure continues to be unfavorable; at the end of 1969 nearly
half of the public debt was scheduled for repayment within three years.
To improve the structure of the debt, Argentina is seeking to obtain
less of its public sector borrowing from suppliers' credits and
commercial bank loans and more from institutions proving long-term
credits.
20.        Argentina's debt management problem has at times in the
past been aggravated by the difficulties brought about by chronic
inflation, stagnation of export earnings and balance of payments
crises. In the mid-1960's the debt service burden proved unmanageable
and external obligations were renegotiated. Given the still heavy
external debt obligations and the likely need of substantial foreign
capital inflows in the future, external debt service is likely to
remain a problem for some time to come.   If Argentina takes the
necessary measures to ensure a satisfactory rate of economic growth,
increases public sector savings and provides continuing incentives for
exports, including a realistic exchango rate, the external debt service
burden should not be unmanageable.   The Government appears to be
willing to pursue appropriate policies in these fields.
