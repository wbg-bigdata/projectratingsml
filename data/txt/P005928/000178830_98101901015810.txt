PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Third Highway
Project in Argentina, for which Loan 734-AR, in the amount of US$67.5 million,
was approved by the Executive Directors on March 30, 1971. The loan was
closed on December 31, 1979, when funds were fully disbursed.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America
and the Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from
the LAC Information Center, Appraisal Report No. PTR 65a, staff supervision
reports, project progress reports, a consultant's final report and informa-
tion gathered by a completion mission to Argentina in September 1980.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower; however, no comments were received.

HIGHLIGHTS
The Third Highway Project successfully met its objective of up-
grading key sections of Argentina's highway network despite cost overruns
(para. 4.02) and long delays in completing certain of the road sections
(paras. 3.02 and 3.03) mainly due to the country's difficult political
and economic circumstances experienced during project implementation
(para. 3.02). The overall estimated ERR is less than that expected at
appraisal (17% versus 24%). The difference is explained by the extended
construction period with consequent inflation, and the so far disappoint-
ing traffic growth on some of the project roads (para. 5.01). Although
construction of the Campana-Rio Tala expressway could be considered
premature because of high cost overruns (para. 5.08), construction of the
remaining road sections proved to be justified.
The Third Highway Project's biggest impact has been through
the construction of Route 14, the spine road of Mesopotamia, which has
effectively contributed to the development of this important region
(para. 5.04). The paving of nine other earth and gravel roads helped to
integrate various regions with the major traffic corridors (para. 5.05).
Although traffic development on the expressways was below appraisal
expectations in the initial year following construction (para. 5.07), the
PCR recognizes that these modern facilities should markedly facilitate
the growth of the major industrial and commercial centers (para. 8.02).
Furthermore, the project contributed significantly toward the development
of local consultant capabilities (para. 6.02).
The PCR concludes that, under difficult circumstances, Argentina
completed this major construction program successfully and that Vialidad's
capability to administer and supervise large highway programs has now reached
maturity, having overcome, and emerged stronger from, the great difficulties
encountered in the mid-seventies (para. 8.03).






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Argentina has developed a h ghly diverse and extensive transport
network to integrate its 2,800,000 km of territory and to serve the needs of
its population of 26 million (Map IBRD 3157). The network includes 100,800 km
of national and primary provincial roads, 34,400 km of railways, 17,000 km of
pipelines for crude oil, refined petroleum products and natural gas, over 100
ports and 90 commercial airports. The importance to the nation's economy of
the efficient operation of the transport network is illustrated by its contribu-
tion of 5.7% to Gross Domestic Product, ranking fifth among the ten sectors
comprising the economy, and by its high proportion (18%) of public sector invest-
ment. Furthermore, public transport enterprises, mainly the railways, account
for 37% of all employment in the public sector. Within the transport sector,
highways increasingly represent the dominant mode. From 1965 to 1978, road
transport's share of cargo traffic increased from 48% of total interurban
ton-kilometers to 65% while rail's share declined from 19% to 11%. Similarly,
in terms of passenger service, roads' share rose from 76% of inter-urban
passenger-kilometers to 86% while rail declined from 22% to 8%, with air
transport increasing its share from 2% to 6%. The development of the highway
network has generally kept pace with demand, and, with the basic network in
place, investment is now being directed at reconstruction and at capacity
additions in corridors connecting major cities.
1.02      The Bank has been closely associated with the transport sector
in Argentina since 1961. Highway development has been promoted by four loans
totaling US$228.5 million (Loan 288-AR, June 1961, US$31.0 million after
cancellation; Loan 619-AR, June 1969, US$25.0 million; Loan 734-AR, May 1971,
US$67.5 million; and Loan 1384-AR, May 1977, US$105 million). These loans
have supported the construction and improvement of over 5,400 km of the
primary network, 4,500 km of feasibility studies, and 3,500 km of detailed
engineering designs as well as providing for numerous studies and programs
that have increased efficiency in the highway subsector. Two loans, totaling
US$152.5 million, have been made to help improve the railway system (Loan
733-AR, May 1971, US$56.5 million after cancellation; and Loan 1677-AR, March
1979, US$96.0 million).,
1.03      This completion report is based on information obtained from the LAC
Information Center, Appraisal Report No. PTR 65a, staff supervision reports,
project progress reports, a consultant's final report and information gathered
by a completion mission to Argentina in September 1980.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      The project was identified and prepared under the Second Highway
Project.  A US consulting firm, associated with two local firms, was retained
to conduct a reconnaissance survey of the entire non-urban national road
network and to identify those sections likely to yield the greatest benefits
from improvement. More detailed feasibility studies and preliminary engineer-
ing for selected sections were carried out by the same consultants.
2.02      The project was appraised in March 1970 and included 18 high-priority
road sections totaling about 1,128 km for upgrading or construction. Several
local consultants, with coordination by the US firm and their associates, were
retained to prepare detailed engineering for the selected roads, with comple-
tion targeted for October 1970, the scheduled date for loan negotiations.
The design work was done on schedule with the exception of one road section
(para 3.01). Also included in the project were consulting services for
updating the national road reconnaissance survey and for feasibility and
engineering studies which subsequently identified and prepared the Fourth
Highway Project.
2.03      Loan negotiations began in November 1970 but were adjourned after
three days, mainly because the Government's representative felt that certain
clauses in the proposed loan document restricted Argentina's sovereignty and
that the Bank's proposed participation of 40% of the estimated US$150 million
project cost was too low. The Bank subsequently agreed to increase its
participation to 45%, and acceptable rewording was worked out for clauses in
the loan agreement.
2.04      Negotiations were concluded in February 1971 and the loan, amounting
to US$67.5 million, was approved by the Executive Directors on March 30, 1971.
The loan agreement was signed on May 5, 1971 and became effective on September 3,
1971.
2.05      The agreed project consisted of the following:
Civil Works (Table 1)
(a) improvement and paving of ten gravel and earth road sections
totaling about 761 km;
(b) improvement and repaving of two sections of paved roads
totaling about 136 km; and
(c) construction of six sections of four-lane divided highways
totaling 231 km.
Consulting Services
(a) supervision of the civil works construction;
(b) detailed engineering studies for approximately 1,500 km
of roads;

(c) feasibility studies for about 2,000 km of roads;
(d) coordination and review of the studies under (b) and (c)
above; and
(e) updating of the national highway network reconnaissance
survey.
Vialidad Nacional was the executing agency and the project was expected to be
completed in 27 months, by December 31, 1973; the Closing Date of the loan was
December 31, 1974.

III. PROJECT EXECUTION
Civil Works
3.01      Work on the 18 road sections was originally subdivided into
29 contracts for international competitive bidding by prequalified contractors.
For all but the 80.5 km Campana-Rio Tala section on National Route 9, the
tender and award process was executed efficiently, although behind the original
schedule; there were 28 bid openings between April 1971 and February 1972 and
all 28 contracts were signed between April 1971 and May 1972. All work was
awarded to Argentine firms. International contractors showed no interest in
the bidding because of extensive local competition. The tendering of the
Campana-Rio Tala section was deferred until early 1975 as completion of
detailed engineering was delayed by unexpectedly bad soil conditions and
bidding was postponed because of the political and economic crisis in 1974
(para 3.02).
3.02      Actual progress of the works is shown graphically in Table 2.
Despite some initial delays, construction proceeded relatively well from 1971
through most of 1974, when political and economic events made it extremely
difficult for Argentine contractors to continue work. President Peron's death
triggered political instability. The absence of economic management deepened
the impact of a recession prompted by the abrupt end of an export boom. The
rate of annual inflation soared from 20% to 250%, creating a financial climate
that made it impossible for contractors to obtain financing. Import restric-
tions were placed on equipment and spare parts needed for construction, making
these items virtually unobtainable. Payments to contractors by Vialidad
became six months to a year in arrears following the diversion of road user
revenues to general Government expenditures. Labor trouble and strikes and a
cost escalation formula for contractors that used an unfavorable exchange rate
also impeded the execution of project works. From the end of 1974 through
most of 1976, these problems persisted. Only 14 of the original 28 contracts
were completed by August 1976, although all were originally scheduled to be
finished before the end of 1974, the original Closing Date. Of the remaining
contracts, work on half was stopped, while the rest were progressing very
slowly.
3.03      Conditions improved after a new Government came to power in 1976.
Project work resumed at a normal pace around November of that year when
counterpart funds were made available and customs restrictions were lifted on
equipment and spare parts for construction. Because of inflation, work
stoppages, and payment delays, however, all contracts were either renegotiated
(at higher real terms) or rescinded and retendered. Work was further subdi-
vided for some road sections to accelerate progress. Project civil works were
thus separated into a total of 38 contracts. By December 1977 some 80% of the
roadwork was satisfactorily completed but the financial climate in the country
was still causing delays with inflation continuing at a rate of well over 100%
annually. As an anti-inflationary move, the Treasury restricted budget
expenditures by Vialidad in late 1977 and early 1978, which again resulted in
delayed payments to contractors and further slowed the work. Payment timing
subsequently improved, and the project was finally completed in 1980. The
quality of all construction was satisfactory.



3.04      In addition to financial problems, technical difficulties also
delayed work and increased costs on the 80.5 km expressway (Route 9) between
Campana and Rio Tala. Although considerable soils and foundation investiga-
tions were carried out during design, actual conditions encountered during
construction were far worse than expected. The most serious problems occurred
in a 6-km stretch near the river where poor foundation soils made it extremely
difficult to construct stable embankments. In fact, an 800 meter viaduct was
eventually required to replace a failed embankment section.
Consulting Services
3.05      Argentine firms were retained for all consulting work financed
under the project and their overall performance was quite satisfactory.
The two local consultant firms which had been associated with the US firm
carrying out the initial national road reconnaissance survey (para 2.01) were
retained to update the survey as well as to coordinate and review the feasi-
bility studies and detailed engineering work done by several other Argentine
firms. Three local consultants provided adequate supervision of the road
construction. The detailed engineering financed under the Second Highway
Project (para 2.02) was performed in a timely and satisfactory manner by local
firms except for the soils and materials investigations for one road section
as previously discussed in paragraph 3.01.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison of appraisal estimates and final costs is shown in
Table 3. The comparison has been made using constant 1970 US dollars, the
year of project appraisal. The methodology outlined in Annex 1 has been used
to convert the certified cost of works to constant dollars, using the civil
works cost index as a basis. Because the annual average exchange rate masks
monthly fluctuations in the $a/US$ parity and the civil works cost index
itself is an annual average, the resulting economic costs represent mid-year
values regardless of when works were completed in any given year. It has not
been possible to shadow-price the cost of civil works, which would have been
preferable had the necessary information been available. In spite of this
imprecision, however, the comparison is considered to be a reasonable indica-
tion of cost differentials between actual expenditures and appraisal estimates
4.02      The total cost of road works was about US$197 million in 1970 values
an increase of 41% over the US$140 million appraisal estimate (including
contingencies). This increase came almost entirely from overruns on the
Campana-Rio Tala section of Route 9 (paras 3.04 and 4.06). Principal factors
affecting costs for the various types of road improvements are discussed in
the following paragraphs.



- 6 -
Improvement and Paving of Earth and Gravel Roads
4.03      Work on the 422 km of National Route 14 was delayed considerably
during 1972 and 1973 by unusually heavy rains. This pushed construction
into the crisis years, resulting in further delays with increased costs. An
additional complication was the construction of the Salto Grande dam in the
Uruguay river, which necessitated revised location and design in the area
affected. Actual costs in 1970 dollars were US$95,000/km (US$240,000 in 1980
dollars), about 13% over appraisal estimates.
4.04      The nine other earth and gravel road sections improved and paved
under the loan showed an overall cost reduction of 5% below the appraisal
estimate of US$60,000/km in 1970 dollars (US$150,000 in 1980 dollars). This
reflects the more favorable location of the works in a drier part of the
country and the lack of extensive execution delays. Four contracts, nonethe-
less, were renegotiated as a result of the economic crisis.
Improvement and Repaving of Paved Roads
4.05      The two roads in this category, totaling 135 km, were completed
with limited delays. Final costs in 1970 dollars were US$65,000/km (US$160,000
in 1980 dollars); about 31% below appraisal estimates, which results mainly
from completion of the work well before the financial crisis in 1974.
Construction of Four-Lane Divided Highways
4.06      Three road sections totaling about 89 km (National Route 20 Cordoba-
Carlos Paz, and National Routes 7 and 40 near Mendoza) were completed at costs
approximately equal to the appraisal estimate of US$360,000/km in 1970 dollars
(US$900,000 in 1980 dollars). However, large cost increases over appraisal
estimates did occur on the expressway works for National Route 9 (142 km).
This road is situated in the region along the Parana river, an area with
extraordinarily bad soil conditions that not only delayed detailed engineering
(para 3.01), but required major and expensive design changes during construc-
tion (para 3.04). In addition, the work was tendered in 1975-77, a period
of economic and financial instability during which contractors allowed for
considerable risk in their bid prices. The final cost of the 61-km San
Nicolas-Rosario section was US$580,000/km in 1970 dollars (US$1,450,000
in 1980 dollars) about 65% over the appraisal estimate, with the cost of the
81-km Campana-Rio Tala section reaching almost US$750,000/km in 1970 dollars
(US$1,900,000 in 1980 dollars), nearly 300% over appraisal estimates.
Consulting Services
4.07      The cost of consulting services for feasibility studies, detailed
engineering, and updating the national highway reconnaissance survey was
slightly less than the appraisal estimate. Consulting services for supervision,
however, did cost considerably more than anticipated because of the extended
construction periods. Exact figures are unavailable (once the US$2.0 million
allocated for construction supervision was disbursed by the Bank, further
disbursement requests were no longer received), but Vialidad estimates the



- 7 -
amount to be about 6% of the works cost. This corresponds to a cost increase
of around 125% over the appraisal forecast which, under the circumstances,
is considered reasonable.
Disbursements
4.08      Table 4 shows estimated and actual disbursements by year and amount.
In retrospect, the appraisal estimate for the rate of disbursement was far too
optimistic. By the original Closing Date of December 31, 1974, only 41% of the
loan, or US$27.5 million, had been disbursed. Disbursements proceeded slowly
throughout the rest of the project, although they did pick up slightly as
economic conditions improved after 1976. The loan was fully disbursed in
June 1979, eight years after the signing of the loan, rather than the three
and a half years originally envisaged.
4.09      Loan funds were reallocated only once (at final disbursement) as
shown below:

V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      The Third Highway Project was justified at appraisal on the basis of
quantifiable benefits accruing to road users mainly from reduced vehicle
operating costs and travel time which would result from improvements in road
design and surface characteristics. Benefits were assessed also for savings
in road maintenance costs, when applicable, resulting from the difference
between the costs of maintaining the existing roads and-the lower costs of
maintaining the newly paved or improved roads. The appraisal estimate of the
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for civil works was 24%, with an average rate of
traffic growth of 5% per year from 1970 to 1980 (Tables 5 and 6). Reevaluation,
based on the consultants' final report in July 1980, resulted in a weighted
average ERR of 17%, with an average traffic growth of 3% per year from 1970
to 1980 and assuming a 5% rate thereafter.    While this rate of return is
significantly less than projected, it is nonetheless still satisfactory,
especially taking into consideration the turbulent conditions experienced
in the country during project execution. With the high proportion of heavy
vehicles on project roads, averaging 93% (Table 5), and the extreme competi-
tiveness of the trucking industry, it appears that project benefits related to



- 8 -
freight movements are being reasonably distributed among truckers and shippers
by limiting freight tariff increases. The paving of earth and gravel roads
has helped to integrate various regions with the national economy, especially
with regard to the Mesopotamia region, and the construction of expressways has
facilitated the continued development of the main industrial and commercial
centers of Argentina.
5.02      Traffic estimates were based on counts conducted in 1979 and 1980
by Vialidad. The wide variation between traffic forecasts and actual results
illustrates the level of uncertainty in road traffic projections, especially
during the period of economic and political instability. While it is
difficult to determine what specific factors altered traffic development on
individual subprojects, the results in Table 5 do show that, in the case of
paving earth and gravel roads, traffic growth was generally higher than
expected as accelerated development in the areas of influence occurred despite
the economic crisis. On existing paved routes, however, traffic in these
first years is below expectations as normal traffic increases were not main-
tained and generated traffic did not materialize, underscoring the difficulty
in estimating the elasticity of demand for such projects.
5.03      The economic reevaluation of the project was done by Vialidad's
consultants, utilizing the vehicle operating costs on which the feasibility
studies were based. Since gas and oil prices increased more than other
relevant prices, these calculations underestimate actual user savings.
However, such fine tuning of benefit calculations was not considered necessary
for this exercise. The economic costs used by the consultants were derived
from the certified financial costs of works (para 4.01). In order to provide
a reasonable correlation between appraisal and reevaluation ERRs under the
circumstances of extreme inflation and exchange rate fluctuation, costs and
benefits are expressed in constant base year (1970) dollars. The following
discussion addresses economic performance on this basis for each type of
civil works category.
Improvement and Paving of Earth and Gravel Roads
5.04      Improvement of National Route 14 in Mesopotamia was expected to
trigger a high annual traffic growth rate of 6%. In fact, this area developed
even more than expected, with an average annual traffic growth rate of 10% over
the period. This resulted in an ERR of 21%, 3% higher than anticipated,
despite actual costs 13% higher than estimated.
5.05      The nine other paving projects registered a recalculated average ERR
of 26%, 4% higher than appraisal estimates. With the exception of Routes 151
and 157, traffic growth was generally higher than expected, reaching 8-10%
annually in the case of Route 178 and Route 12. While average costs for this
group of projects were 5% less than projected, there were significant cost
increases for those projects completed after 1976.



- 9-
Improvement and Repaving of Paved Roads
5.06      The two road sections repaved under the loan show an ERR comparable
to that estimated at appraisal (16% vs. 17%). Lower traffic growth (2% vs.
4%) was offset by lower costs (31%).
Construction of Four-Lane Divided Highways
5.07      The ERR for expressway road sections as a group was 15%, substan-
tially below appraisal estimates of 28%, but still reasonable. Lower than
expected traffic (Table 5) and delayed construction resulting in higher costs
(Table 3) were the main reasons for the reduced ERRs. The most notable was
the San Nicolas-Rosario section of Route 9, where a 10% annual increase was
projected but actual growth has been zero. Apparently, only through traffic
on Route 9 (about 5,600 vehicles per day) is making use of the new expressway,
and, since these vehicles no longer pass through the industrial area, traffic
conditions there have greatly improved so that local traffic need not use the
new road. With increasing traffic in the future and other related road
improvements, it is expected that more vehicles will gradually divert, espe-
cially because the expressway gives better access to the beltway around
Rosario now under construction.
5.08      In the case of Route 9, Campana-Rio Tala, the soil difficulties
encountered during design and construction led to significantly higher costs
(para 4.06). Notwithstanding a 1980 traffic of 7,680 vehicles/day and traffic
growth of 3% annually, the resulting poor economic performance (a reevaluation
estimated ERR of 10%) make this the only marginal road section in the project.
With a first year benefit/cost ratio of less than 10%, the execution of the
section appears to have been premature; had its high cost been known from the
outset, construction should have been postponed.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
6.01      After the substantial progress made under the First and Second
Highway Projects in improving the administrative, planning and design capabil-
ities of Vialidad and local consultants, no further direct assistance for
institutional development was included in the Third Highway Project. The
economic turbulence between 1973 and 1976, however, resulted in a setback to
Vialidad's institutional development. Shortage of funds allocated by
Government and staff losses during this period led to a serious decline and,
in some respects, a halt in Vialidad activities. Construction, maintenance
and planning efforts suffered, and it took almost four years to complete
stalled projects and rebuild the institution. It was only during the past
year that Vialidad has been able to consider a balanced program, and substantial
assistance for this effort is included in the proposed Fifth Highway Project.
6.02      The project did provide a means for the improvement of local donsul-
tant capabilities through the preparation of feasibility studies, designs and
the national road reconnaissance survey. Such improved capabilities are



-10 -
exemplified by the extensive Highway Needs Study which has been carried out by
local consultants under the direction of Vialidad and with financial assistance
under the Fourth Highway Project.
6.03      While no direct assistance was provided under the project, a covenant
in the Loan Agreement required adequate staffing of the Sectoral Planning
Office in the Secretariat for Transport and Public Works. Although no action
was taken during the crisis period, the Bank's persistence on the need for
improved national transport planning led the new Government in 1976 to reorga-
nize the Sectoral Planning Office and establish the Directorate for National
Transport Planning. This office is now properly staffed and has prepared
a National Transport Plan with assistance provided under the ongoing Fourth
Highway Project.
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank contributed significantly to project identification and
preparation via the preceding Second Highway Project and, during execution
of this project, provided some essential continuity during the changes in
Government and the disruption of Vialidad's operations caused by severe
financial and staffing problems. The number and timing of supervision missions
were appropriate for the circumstances and a very good relationship between
the Government and the Bank was maintained throughout the long and difficult
project period.
7.02      During the economic crisis in the mid-seventies, severe budget
constraints dictated changes in road investment priorities. But, because
the project was for improvement of specific road sections, it was difficult
for the Bank to quickly shift financing to other investments considered to be
of higher priority under the circumstances. The need, however, for such
flexibility could not have been foreseen at appraisal; the proposed Highway
Sector Project will provide such flexibility.
7.03      The preparation and implementation of the Fourth Highway Project,
and currently the preparation of the Highway Sector Project, have been and are
based on the experiences of the earlier three projects and illustrate the
Bank's role in the progressive development of Vialidad and the highway
subsector despite intermittent national crises.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The Third Highway Project was successful despite cost overruns
and long delays in completing certain of the road sections. The project
met its principal objective of upgrading key sections of the national highway
network and reducing transport costs on these routes. The overall ERR is
less than expected at appraisal (17% versus 24%), mainly due to the extended



- 11 -
construction time with consequent inflation, and the so far disappointing
traffic growth. Although the Campana-Rio Tala expressway could be considered
premature because of high cost overruns, the remainder of the road sections
stand up well in the economic reevaluation.
8.02      The Third Highway Project's biggest impact has been through the
construction of Route 14, the spine road of Mesopotamia, which has effectively
contributed to the development of this important region. The paving of nine
other earth and gravel roads helped integrate various regions with the major
traffic corridors. Although traffic development on the expressways has been
disappointing in the initial year following construction, these modern facil-
ities should markedly facilitate the growth of the major industrial and
commercial centers. Furthermore, the studies included in the Project have led
to the Fourth Highway Project and contributed significantly toward development
of local consultant capabilities.
8.03      Under difficult circumstances, Argentina completed this major construc-
tion program successfully. Vialidad's capability to administer and supervise
large highway programs has now reached maturity, having overcome, and emerged
stronger from, the great difficulties encountered in the mid-seventies.
Vialidad is now ready and fully prepared to engage in the remaining institution
building contemplated under the proposed Highway Sector Project (Fifth Highway
Project).

Conversion of Current $a into Constant US$
High inflation in Argentina, especially since 1973, makes a comparison
of the appraisal estimates and the actual final costs difficult. To minimize
the problem, the construction cost index has been used to convert the actual
final costs to costs in 1970 when the appraisal estimates were made. The
following procedure, utilizing the first two columns below, was used for this
purpose:
i)   Divide the construction cost index for the base year by the
index for the year in which construction costs were incurred.
ii)   Multiply the construction costs by the fraction obtained
from (i) above.
iii)   Divide the results of (ii) by the exchange rate ($a:US$) in the
base year.
iv)   Add the results of steps (i) through (iii) for all years in which
construction costs incurred.
