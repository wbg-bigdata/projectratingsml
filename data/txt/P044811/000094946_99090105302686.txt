A: Project Development Objective (refer to Annex 1 for the Project Design Summary)
The objective of the project is to promote the development of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), in
particular, and investment financing, in general, on a sustainable basis contributing to improvements in
the quality of intermediation, and the speed and efficiency of industrial growth in Bangladesh.
The proposed project forms part of a number of Government initiatives to strengthen the financial sector:
(i) a proposed Central Banking Technical Assistance from IDA (section D2); and (ii) a recently approved
capital development program loan from ADB for the expansion and deepening of equity markets (section
D2).
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 17453-BD.     Date of latest CAS discussion: July 20, 1999
IDA supports the Government's poverty reduction strategies of: (i) promoting rapid, job-creating
economic growth; and (ii) interventions that directly assist the poor.
The assistance strategy for FY98-00 onwards considers the need to improve financial intermediation in
banks, nonbank institutions, and capital markets. Concerning commercial banks, IDA's strategy is to
help the government rebuild the three institutional pillars of sound banking -- corporate governance,
strong regulatory systems, and an effective court system. In this regard, an IDA-led initiative is helping to
define the needed banking reforms and considering adjustment lending support for bank restructuring and
privatization together with technical assistance for strengthening supervision and legal reforms. While a
program for restructuring the banking sector is agreed upon with the Government, our strategy in the
near- to mid-term is to support expansion of NBFIs which represent the sounder and more efficient part
of the financial sector. As such, the project will promote the development of NBFIs in order to: (i)
provide alternative opportunities for savers; and (ii) increase on a sustainable basis the supply of term
funds for competitive projects which generate growth and employment. These two outcomes contribute
directly with the CAS poverty reduction strategy.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
(a) Unsatisfactory Intermediation by Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs) and Development
Financing Institutions (DFIs): In the past NCBs accounted for 50-60 percent of term loan
disbursements. However, the NCBs have largely failed in investment financing and a potentially difficult
situation has arisen for the following reasons: (i) Maturity mismatch. Average maturity of deposit funds
of NCBs stands at 9.5 months while maturity of the loan portfolio is about 20.4 months, (ii) Non-
performing loans. 40-50 percent of their term loans are non-performing, though the performance of
recent loans is improving, and (iii) Inefficiency. Interest rates charged by NCBs for term lending
average 13.5 percent, do not cover the cost of funds (7 percent), administrative costs (3 percent) and the
cost of bad debts. Performance of the two public industrial DFIs is also highly unsatisfactory given that:
(i) about 80 percent of the loan portfolio of BSB and 60 percent of the loan portfolio of BSRS are non-
performing, (ii) collection ratios are very low, and (iii) both institutions depend fully on government
funds for financing new projects as most donors have ceased to provide any credit lines and these DFIs
have failed to mobilize alternative resources, domestically and overseas.
2



In order to stem the flow problem, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) is encouraging NCBs to restrict
their term lending activities. As a result NCBs' disbursements fell in FY96-97 to only 40 percent of those
in the previous FY. This GOB initiative is a positive step and constitutes a reversal from past policies in
which NCBs were encouraged to provide excessive term lending. However, due to its concern for
increasing funds for term lending, the GOB announced in April, 1999 the issuing of Industrial
Development Bonds through two NCBs (Sonali and Agrani) both in the international and domestic
markets. Although these NCBs are the bond issuers they will onlend a large part of these proceeds to
other financial institutions for project financing. The GOB has indicated to IDA that these funds will not
lead to an increase in the NCBs' term lending portfolio, but principally a restructuring of balance sheets
through improved maturity matching of assets and liabilities, thereby abiding with their Statement of
Reform Policy for the Non-Bank Financial Sector (para D.4 and Annex 8).
(b) Weak Regulatory System for NBFIs: NBFIs are regulated by the Financial Institutions Act of
1993 and the rules of 1994. The existing regulatory framework is inadequate since it does not distinguish
between deposit and non-deposit takers. IDA has proposed to the Government that the basic principle for
NBFI regulations should be the classification into deposit and non-deposit takers, according to which: (i)
NBFIs that are deposit takers should be regulated as banking institutions, but with lower minimum capital
and liquidity requirements since these are allowed to take only term deposits, do not participate in foreign
exchange operations, and do not have access to BB discount facility, (ii) NBFIs' functions of obtaining
funds through public offerings of securities should be under the regulatory jurisdiction of the SEC, and
(iii) NBFIs not perfoming any of the above functions, i.e. not affecting the public interest, should be
regulated as corporations including the requirement that these follow adequate accounting and auditing
procedures.
BB has agreed to review NBFI regulations and operating standards in accordance with IDA mission's
recommendations of November 26, 1997 and to undertake an institution building program for its NBFI
Department in the context of the Central Banking TA project. With IFC participation, IDA is
coordinating with SEC the development of procedures for the issuance of market traded instruments.
Strengthening of the SEC is being carried out under the ADB's Capital Market Development Adjustment
Loan.
(c) Inadequate Legal Framework for NBFIs: The inadequate legal framework, leading inter-alia to
long drawn out foreclosure procedures, constitutes a major constraint in term finance and imposes
additional costs to lenders and borrowers. As a result leasing companies lend against liquid collateral
(cash, CDs, shares) rather than the assets being financed.
The Government is taking steps to strengthen the legal framework under an IDF Grant. Further IDA
support is being considered under the proposed Judicial and Legal Reform Project, which would include
streamlining court procedures for loan recoveries and establishing alternative dispute resolution
mechanisms for NBFIs. However, the additional costs to lenders and borrowers are expected to continue
for sometime until capacity building through such a project will have an effect. This is a common
problem to projects involving the private sector since such projects are vulnerable in an environment
where the legal and regulatory frameworks are still nascent.

(d) Underdeveloped Funding Mechanisms for Term Lending: Term loans provided by the financial
system in Bangladesh amount to only about US$250-300 million per year, equivalent to about 1.5 percent
of GDP, while private and public investment amounts to about 16 percent of GDP. A major constraint to
the provision of term loans is the lack of a well developed long-term savings market. NCBs fund their
term loans mainly with their deposits creating a maturity mismatch (see 2 (a) above). Also, public
development finance institutions - Bangladesh Shilpa Bank (BSB) and Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha
(BSRS) -- which have reduced their lending to insignificant levels since the 1990s depend fully on
Government and Multilateral Funds for their operations, which the latter are no longer providing. NBFIs,
which have shown to be the most dynamic and efficient sources for project financing in Bangladesh,
have until now secured funds mainly through multilateral lenders and commercial banks. Experience
from Pakistan and other countries suggests that a major source for NBFI funding are debentures sold to
both institutions and individuals. However, during project preparation a number of constraints were
identified that prevented the development of the bond markets in Bangladesh, including: (i) restrictions to
institutional investors - life insurance companies and provident funds were not allowed to purchase
private bonds, (ii) issuance costs for corporate bonds are significantly higher than in Pakistan and other
countries ( e.g. issuance cost in Bangladesh is about 5 percent -- including a 2 percent stamp duty on
bond issues --compared to only 3 percent in Pakistan) due mainly to taxes, (iii) there are no benchmark
interest rates, (iv) government saving rates -- the National Saving Schemes (NSS) -- are not market
determined, (v) there is a lack of a comprehensive set of guidelines by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) for issuing bonds and debentures, an.d (vi) there is no secondary bond market.
The Government has already taken important steps to address the above issues both under the proposed
and other projects. On June 7, 1999, the Cabinet approved the amendment to the Trust Act to allow
pension and insurance funds to invest up to 25 percent in the capital market. The Government has also
agreed to reduce the stamp duties and other taxes affecting the issuance cost of bonds. Since end 1998,
the BB started issuing Treasury Bonds of up to two years maturity (previous maturities were up to 180
days), which will provide a benchmark for interest rates. Furthermore, the Government has recently
imposed a 10 percent tax on interest income arising from NSS saving certificates (interest income below
US$500 equivalent is exempted from this tax in order to protect small savers) in order to create a level
playing field with bonds and other debt instruments. Although, a secondary market for TBs has not yet
been created, IMF assistance has been secured by the Government aiming at the development of this
market.
(e) Potential Risk of Contagion of NBFIs: A potential problem is the risk of contagion of NBFIs by
the non-performing loans in the financial sector. Main measures to avoid this risk will be: (i) rigorous
project analysis by FIs participating in the proposed project will ensure that borrowers have ensured
adequate working capital financing; (ii) to the extent possible NBFIs will finance permanent working
capital as part of project financing; (iii) cofinancing of investment projects will be limited to performing
FIs; and (iv) clients of weak banks (defined as banks with CAMEL rating of 4 as rated by BB) will not be
eligible for CBSF financing through eligible FIs. More broadly, through investments in NBFIs
bonds/CLOs by NCBs, the proposed project will support the flow of funds from inefficient NCBs to the
efficient FIs.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
As part of the proposed project, the Government has prepared a statement of Reform Policy for the Non-
Bank Financial Sector (Annex 8). The project components described below will assist the Government in
4



implementing such policies. In particular, the project will address the following sector issues: (a) it will
strengthen the high performing part of the FIs by funding only those that meet stringent eligibility criteria;
and (b) it will assist eligible FIs to develop their own funding mechanisms for term financing through: (i)
supporting FIs efforts through the bridge and standby component of the project, (ii) ensuring that the
Government takes the adequate steps to eliminate constraints to the development of markets for bonds
and other debt instruments (i.e. reducing advantages of GOB saving certificates, reducing issuance cost
for bonds), and (iii) strengthening the institutional framework for issuing bonds and debentures (i.e.
improving regulations, creating appropriate benchmarks) with IFC participating in the development of the
regulatory and legal framework for bond issues, promotion of credit rating firms and development of
underwriting and structuring capabilities of its investee companies. A strategic choice has been made to
leave the recommended improvements of the regulatory framework for NBFIs - provided under project
preparation -- to the proposed Central Bank Technical Assistance Loan given the commonality of
regulations required for banks and non-banks. Similarly, streamlining of court procedures for loan
recoveries and establishing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms would be considered under the
Judicial and Legal Reform project which is under preparation. These choices would allow a sharper
focus for the proposed NBFIDP while assigning two important related activities to those projects under
which they constitute the main focus of their operation.
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2for a detailed description and Annex 3for a detailed cost
breakdown).
The project comprises two main components: The Resource Mobilization component will address the
external factors that delay or constrain resource mobilization from the market. It will aim at
simplifying/streamlining regulations for market traded instruments to facilitate bond and security issues,
creating an even playing field for individual investors between market traded instruments and
government saving schemes, and developing market oriented mechanisms for raising funds by the
government through strengthening government treasury bond markets (which will also create a
benchmark for bonds issuance). The component to Strengthen Financial Institutions cons;sts on creating
a Credit, Bridge and Standby Facility (CBSF) that would encourage the development of term financing
by the more efficient and healthy part of the financial system. The CBSF will provide funding from IDA
to FIs through a variety of mechanisms that would increase their funding while enabling and encouraging
them to mobilize medium to long term resources from the local market. One subcomponent of the CBSF
will provide term financing as a regular credit line up to a predeternined amount. The Bridge and
Standby component will encourage FIs to raise their own funds by facilitating their issuance of
bonds/debentures and the securitization and sale of their loan/lease portfolios. This will be accomplished
through the provision of temporary bridge financing to allow FIs to accumulate assets, and of standby
support as commitments to purchase the unsold balances of bonds/debentures and CLOs that underwriters
are unable to place in the market. A liquidity fund (not financed by IDA) will provide temporary
financing to institutional investors who want to liquefy temporarily their holdings of bonds/CLOs under a
repurchase agreement (REPO) mechanism. Funding of the CBSF for US$49 million (including GOB's
and FIs' contributions) is justified based on an analysis of FI requirements (Annex 2a). Three FIs --
United Leasing Company (ULC), Industrial Promotion and Development Company (IPDC) and Industrial
Development Leasing Company (IDLC), - already qualify according to the eligibility criteria (Annex 9),
with their final eligibility subject to the presentation of their audited 1998 financial statements. Another
5



four FIs are being considered for eligibility under the proposed project. It is expected that between four
and seven FIs would ultimately qualify.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project.:
The project focuses on providing support to the private sector and addressing only those policy reforms
necessary to strengthen financial intermediation for investment projects. For that reason the project will
support the following policy measures: (a) aligning Government NSS to market conditions; (b) allowing
pension and insurance funds to invest in private bonds and debentures; and (c) issuing TBs of maturities
of up to five years and allowing a secondary market for these instruments thus creating a benchmark for
medium term private securities. Concerning institutional development, the project will focus mainly on
the strengthening of FIs in the private sector through the activities performed under the CBSF and
technical assistance under the project. IFC will collaborate with IDA in strengthening the market for
Success fee will be paid by FIs.
7



bonds and debentures through providing advice to SEC and participating in the establishment of credit
rating agencies and underwriters.
3. Benefits and target population:
The proposed project is expected to generate the following benefits:
(a) For the financial sector. It will support expansion of the sounder and more efficient part of the
financial sector while the rest is being restructured. It will support the availability of term financing
on a sustainable basis through strengthened FIs, increased availability of funds for term lending, and
development of the bond and securities markets.
(b) For the overall economy. It will promote increased efficient private investment in competitive
projects that would generate economic growth and employment and provide the population with
additional saving opportunities.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
(a) Organization Responsible for the Project. The Bangladesh Bank (BB) will be responsible for
implementation of the project. Management of the Project would be as follows:
(I) Policy and Overall Coordination A project steering committee headed by the Secretary of Finance
and representatives of ERD, IRD, SEC and the Finance Division will meet periodically to decide on
policy and major implementation aspects of the project. The Deputy Governor of BB in charge of the
Financial Institutions (FI) Department will act as Secretary of the Committee.
(II) Implementation The Deputy Governor BB in charge of the Fl Department will be the Project
Director. He will monitor implementation of the project components and will draw upon the assistance of
the following when required: Joint Secretary Banking, Joint Secretary ERD, Director General for the
Directorate of National Savings (DNS), and Member SEC. The Chairman SEC and the Director General
DNS will be responsible for day to day implementation of the project in their areas of concern. The
Deputy Governor of BB will be responsible for establishing and implementing the Credit, Bridge and
Standby Facility (CBSF).
(b) Role of IDA During Project Implementation. IDA's participation in project implementation will be
substantial. First, it will assist the Government in organizing workshops and seminars during project
preparation and implementation. Second, it will assist the Government, when required, on policy design
and implementation. Third, the innovative approach under the CBSF will require that IDA provide
extensive advice for its establishment and functioning. Fourth, it will execute the disbursements for
subproject financing if the CBSF is not put in place immediately by project effectiveness. Fifth, it will
provide support for the implementation of the technical assistance components including selection of
consultants, advice and participation in monitoring implementation of each component, and assisting the
Government in taking any corrective measures when necessary. Sixth, it will undertake periodic
supervision missions, including two term reviews during implementation.
8



(c) Administrative Arrangements for Project Implementation.
(I) Procurement. The Deputy Governor of BB will be responsible for procurement of goods, consultant
services and training for project component I. He will also be responsible for contracting the facility
manager and training of GOB/BB personnel under component II. Financial Intermediaries will procure
goods and services financed under the CBSF and consultants for their institutions under project
component II.
(I) Financial Management and Reporting Arrangements. BB will maintain a computerized financial
management, accounting, disbursement and reporting system for the project in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and practices. The accounts and records will be capable of disclosing a
true and fair view of the financial position and of facilitating progress monitoring. To facilitate this BB
will engage a full-time Accounts and Audit Expert (AAE) external to BB, reporting to the Project
director, and supervising an Accounts Officer and the Unit's support staff. They will prepare quarterly
and annual accounts and generate quarterly reports, to ensure consistency with IDA's requirements under
OP/BO 10.02. Annual financial statements will be audited by a private audit firm acceptable to IDA.
Internal controls will include a separate Project Audit Committee, proper segregation of functional
responsibilities, signing of checks after clearance by the AAE, verification of procurement proposals,
monthly reconciliation of bank accounts, and regular detailed reporting.
Participating FIs will submit annual audit reports to BB/CBSF management and IDA within four months
of the end of the year.
A special account will be opened with BB. Disbursements will be made by BB to the beneficiary
agencies on reimbursement basis directly from the Special Account. After initial advance in the Special
Account, quarterly disbursements would be made on the basis of submission of quarterly Project
Monitoring Reports (PMRs), the form of these reports is to be agreed during negotiations with the
Borrower.
(III) Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements. The project has set forth benchmarks and performance
indicators (Annex 1) to evaluate progress on individual components. These have been agreed during
negotiations and will be periodically reviewed to see their effectiveness against performance standards
and implementation schedules.
BB will present the following reports to IDA:
* For the CBSF (prepared by the CBSF Advisor): (a) monthly reports with key data on utilization and
status of its components and financial statements; (b) quarterly reports on the implementation of the
CBSF component; (c) semi-annual assessments of the FIs' demand for the three CBSF components;
and (d) annual projection of the CBSFs cash flow and balance sheet.
* For the technical assistance sub-components: quarterly reports on the progress of each sub-
component
The participating FIs will: (a) verify the status of subprojects supported under the CBSF by on-site
inspection at least quarterly; (b) prepare sub-loan portfolio management and progress reports covering
9



operations under the credit to be submitted to BB/CBSF management and IDA within thirty days of each
semester; and (c) undertake quarterly and annual assessments of the demand for funds from the CBSF to
be presented to BB/CBSF management.
IDA will undertake two term reviews during project implementation. BB will be responsible for ensuring
that the above audits and reports are prepared and submitted on time. It will also prepare the
Government's contribution to the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) at the end of the project
according to IDA guidelines.

D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
(a) A more ambitious project covering capital markets was rejected because ADB has recently
approved a Capital Market Development Adjustment Operation for Bangladesh. Moreover,
experience in Bangladesh has shown that focused operations have a much higher chance of
succeeding. As an example, the recently closed Private Sector Industrial Credit (PSIC) has been
successfully completed because it focused on a limited number of activities that were easy to review
and strengthen when problems arose.
10



(b) Although a pure technical assistance operation could achieve some of the project objectives, a term
financing facility is being considered under the project since it would take time to develop the long
term savings markets, particularly the shifting of investor preference from the safety of fully
government backed saving schemes and bank deposits to the non-guaranteed term paper of private
financial institutions. The proposed project will provide term financing and a bridge and standby
facility that would support efforts by eligible NBFIs and FIs to issue bonds and collateralized loan
and lease obligations in order to raise funds from the market.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
(a) Focusing on Main Activities. Experience in Bangladesh has shown that focused operations have a
much higher chance of succeeding (see DI(a)). Therefore the proposed project focuses on a limited
number of activities considered necessary and sufficient for achieving its objectives.
(b) Addressing Institutional Capacity Issues. Due to the complexity and innovative nature of the
CBSF and its transitional nature, which does not require GOB institutional strengthening, the project
will finance an independent manager with international experience to administer the CBSF facility
that will report to BB.
(c) Ensuring Sustainability. In spite of success of the PSIC, beneficiary FIs in Bangladesh achieved
limited increases in their own sources of funding, since there was no explicit mechanism to
encourage/support FIs development of funding sources. The proposed project will enhance the
possibility that participating FIs would raise funds from the market by: (i) supporting the
development of sources of funds for term lending through its bridge and standby components, (ii)
increasing FIs fund raising capabilities through technical assistance and training, and (iii) assisting --
through IFC participation -- in developing regulations for bond markets and creating support
institutions such as credit rating agencies and bond underwriters.
(d) Developing a Realistic Timetable. Although efforts would be made to shorten the implementation
timetable through technical assistance and the choice of government agencies committed to the
project, a realistic timetable will be developed based on past experiences taking into account the
procedures required to implement government actions in Bangladesh (e.g. selection of consultants,
issuing of decrees).
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Responding to the Ministry of Finance's concern about the lack of sources for financing investments by
the private sector in Bangladesh an IDA team prepared a Non-Bank Financial Markets Sector Report
outlining the measures needed for the development of term financing. The MOF agreed to follow-up the
recommendations and requested IDA's assistance through a project (letter of June 29, 1997) to which
IDA agreed. The MOF followed-up on the various recommendations and agreements of IDA's
preparation and appraisal missions that are reflected in the GOB's Statement of Reform Policy for the
12



Non-Bank Financial Sector (Annex 8). The actions agreed cover: (i) implementing IDA's
recommendations for Establishing a Sound and Competitive Banking Sector (report of June 1998), (ii)
discouraging NCBs from increasing their term lending activities until governance and management are
adequately reformed, (iii) eliminating restrictions to institutional investors (pension and life insurance
funds) to purchase private bonds, (iv) reducing/eliminating the stamp duties for issuance of corporate
bonds (implemented), (v) revising the National Saving Schemes to align their returns to those available in
the market (implemented), (vi) developing guidelines by SEC for issuance of bonds/debentures, and (vi)
developing a secondary market for TBs.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
IDA's participation in the proposed project is important because:
(a) It possesses in-depth knowledge of the NBFI markets in Bangladesh through its involvement in
previous projects and its preparation of the recent overview report on "Developing Non-Bank
Financial Markets."
(b) It has gained additional experience with the recently implemented PSIC in Bangladesh.
(c) It will provide different kinds of international expertise within and outside the Bank necessary for the
development of term financing.
(d) It will complement the actions being pursued under the proposed Central Bank Technical Assistance
Project and the Capital Markets Development Program recently approved by ADB.
(e) Its participation will provide assurance to FIs and other private institutions that the appropriate
conditions and market mechanisms for the development of term lending will be in place.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 11)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
[x] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$ 5.49 million; ERR= 14%
The overall economic benefit of the project would be its support of the expansion of the sounder and
more efficient part of the financial sector, providing alternative opportunities for savers and an increased
supply of term funds for competitive projects. Since the project is designed to have a catalytic role in
supporting NBFIs' and other FIs' efforts to raise term funds for investment lending it is difficult to
quantify its long term impact. This long term impact would consist in the additional benefits to the
economy arising from the more efficient use of savings to finance investment projects (increase in
consumer's and producer's surplus) during and beyond the project's life when FIs continue to raise funds
without the project's support. However, an attempt has been made to quantify the short term impact
during the project's life based on a projected stream of gross income for the potential subprojects (using
data from the previous operation - the PSIC) minus the cost of funds. As shown above this has yielded a
positive NPV and an ERR of 14% on IDA's credit. The long term effects are expected to be much
higher.
13



2. Financial
(a) Financial performance of FIs will be addressed by revision of the regulatory framework for NBFIs
under the proposed Central Bank Technical Assistance Project, incorporation of prudential standards in
the eligibility criteria for participating FIs under the facility, and development of institutional
development plans for those institutions that do not meet the eligibility criteria; (b) financial performance
of subprojects will be addressed by agreeing with eligible FIs on the evaluation methodology and follow-
up of sub-projects; (c) financial management capacity will be ensured through the contracting of a
manager for the CBSF and technical assistance to the eligible FIs.
3. Technical:
None.
4. Institutional:
(a) Institutional capacity weakness of GOB will be addressed through hiring specialized expertise for
managing the CBSF; and (b) the need to strengthen financial intermediaries capabilities to diversify their
sources of funding and appraise projects would be addressed through technical assistance and training.
5. Social:
None.
6. Environmental assessment:
(a) Issues: Industrial development has an impact on the environment. To address this, three types of
actions would be taken: (i) as criteria of eligibility for participation under the proposed CBSF, FIs
must prove that their subproject approval procedures include verification of the Department of
Environment (DOE) clearance and must assign a suitably trained member of staff to perform the
function of environmental compliance officer; (ii) processing of the subprojects under the proposed
credit facility would depend on whether these fall under the red, orange or green industrial categories
as established by the Department of Environment (DOE). Applications for subproject disbursement
would require clearance from DOE for those subprojects which fall under the orange and red
categories, which will be the principal responsibility of the environmental compliance officer; and
(iii) to ensure that appropriate training is available for Fl staff to fulfill the role of environmental
compliance officer, the project includes in its Fl capacity building component the establishment of an
environmental compliance course at the Bangladesh Institute for Bank Management or another
appropriate institution. The project will support the training of trainers so that the environmental
compliance course can be offered on an ongoing basis.
(b) Environmental category: B

(c) Justification/Rationale for category rating: Individual sub-loans have not been identified, but
given the fact that some are likely to fall into the orange or red categories of industries (as defined by the
DOE), a "B" rating has been given in line with prevailing practice and precedents.
(d) Proposed Actions: Based on OD 4.01, no separate Environmental Analysis or Environmental
Management Plan is needed for the reason that any potentially polluting subloans will require a separate
clearance from the DOE. Some subloans may also require an environmental assessment, based on
current DOE regulations.
(e) Status of any other environmental studies: "Setting Environmental Priorities in Bangladesh"
(white cover report, May, 1997) is the strategy document guiding IDA's environmental agenda in
Bangladesh. Both IDA and CIDA are currently initiating activities to improve the monitoring and
enforcement of industrial pollution guidelines.
7. Participatory approach:
Collaboration (COL) with potential financial intermediaries to: (a) identify major problems affecting their
development and propose means to address these problems; (b) determine the potential demand for term
lending and their needs; (c) address any institutional issues of BB for the processing of subproject
applications under the proposed financing facility; (d) review IDA/GOB proposed terms and conditions
and eligibility criteria under the proposed financing facility; (e) discuss their needs for technical
assistance to strengthen their capabilities; and (f) develop and implement seminaries and workshops.
& Checklist of Bank Policies
This project involves:

[x] Financial management (OD8.30) (OP 10.02) (BP 10.02)
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Sustainability of the project beyond implementation depends on three factors: (a) Capacity of NBFIs/FIs
for term lending and fund raising. The availability of a financing facility linked to stringent eligibility
criteria would encourage NBFIs and other FIs to strengthen their project evaluation and term lending
capabilities, while the bridge and standby facilities provided under the proposed project would promote
fund raising by NBFIs and FIs from the market. The development of an appropriate regulatory
framework for NBFIs under the proposed Central Bank Technical Assistance Project would ensure the
health of the NBFI system; (b) Development of market sources of funding for term lending. Necessary
actions required under the project were that the Government revise the conditions of its saving certificates
to reflect market conditions already implemented, and eliminate the stamp duties on issuance of
bonds/debentures so that financial institutions can become competitive in raising long term funds. The
development of the bond/debentures and CLO markets under the project would provide appropriate
instruments to raise funds from the market; and (c) Supply of funds by institutional investors. Allowing
insurance and pension funds to invest in bonds and securities would enhance the supply of funds for term
lending.

Annex 2
Financial Institutions Development Project (FIDP)
Project Description
Component 1 Resource Mobilization - US$1.52 million (total cost of component)
This component will address the external factors that delay or constrain resource mobilization from the
market. It aims at simplifying/streamlining regulations for market traded instruments to facilitate bond
and securities issues, creating an even playing field for individual investors between market traded
financial instruments and government saving schemes -- the latter being more advantageous but restricted
to individual investors and pension funds --, and developing benchmarks for issuing term paper through
strengthening government bond markets. Given the nature of this component and comparative advantage
among institutions, implementation of its subcomponents will be undertaken by IMF, IFC and IDA.
(a) Development of Issue Rules for Bonds and Debentures. The various decrees and circulars directly or
indirectly related to the issuance of market traded instruments will be reviewed, modifications will be
suggested as appropriate and a comprehensive circular will be issued by SEC. IFC will provide
assistance to the SEC in coordination with IDA and the ADB. (Cost: US$0.27m. Funding: SEC -
US$0.01 m; IDA - US$0.26m)
(b) Implementation of Procedures for Market Traded Instruments. Consultant assistance to SEC to
implement the issue rules under (a). (Cost: US$0.08m. Funding: IDA- US$0.08m)
(c) Training of SEC on Debt Instruments. SEC's main expertise is on equity instruments. This
subcomponent will finance travel expenses for SEC staff to learn about security exchange commissions
abroad in regulating debt instruments. (Cost: US$0.05m. Funding: IDA - US$0.05m)
(d) Training of BB on Debt Instruments. Given that the CBSF will be under BB's responsibility, this
subcomponent will finance travel of BB staff together with SEC staff to learn about experiences in
regulating/supporting debt market development. (Cost: US$0.05m. Funding: IDA-US$0.05m)
(e) Reform of National Saving Schemes (NSS). Aimed at reducing distortions that repress potential
demand for market traded instruments caused by the GOB's NSS. This will be accomplished by bringing
benefits of NSS closer to market oriented instruments. The subcomponent will finance an implementation
plan to facilitate access for small savers including the establishment of a computerized system and an
analysis on the impact on GOB's revenues with recommended measures if needed. (Cost: Consultants
and GOB counterparts- US$0.3m;Computers - US$0.37m. Funding: IDA - US$0.57m; GOB -
US$0.lm)
(f) Development of Procedures for Secondary Treasury Bond(TB) Market. Establishment of a secondary
TB market will increase liquidity of TBs thus promoting the development of a government bond market.
This task is being done by BB with assistance from the IMF. Although this subcomponent is not funded
by IDA, the project will benefit from its implementation. (Cost: US$0.4m. Funding: GOB - US$0. lim;
IMF -US$0.3 m).
23



Component 2. Strengthening of Financial Institutions - US$56.17 million (total cost of component)
This component consists on creating a Credit, Bridge and Standby Facility (CBSF) that would encourage
the development of term financing by the more efficient and healthy segment of the financial system.
The CBSF will provide funding from IDA to FIs through a variety of mechanisms that would increase
their funding while enabling and encouraging them to mobilize medium to long term resources from the
local market. The eligible FIs will obtain funds from the CBSF as a regular credit line on a back to back
basis up to an individual maximum of US$4 million. After this amount has been reached, the FIs would
have to mobilize resources from the capital market to obtain additional funds from the credit line. A total
of US$49 million of CBSF funding (including GOB's and FIs' contribution) is justified since it represents
6% of the estimated demand for term loans by potentially eligible FIs (see Annex 2a). The FIs can
accomplish the resource mobilization objective in two ways:
*            The first method involves the securitization and sale of its assets (credits). Under this
method, the FIs spin off accumulated quality earning assets and sell participation on these assets, in a
manner similar to loan syndications that are already practiced in Bangladesh. These participations will be
sold to investors in the forrn of certificates in a pool of loans or lease contracts called collateralized loan
or lease obligations (CLOs). A holder of participation certificates in a CLO has a share and undivided
interest in the payments on loans or lease payments on leases. Two or more FIs may combine their
subloans/leases into a CLO pool to be issued by he CBSF on behalf of the FIs.
*            The second method is for the FIs to issue secured bonds or unsecured debentures. For this
the FIs would enter into a "firm" agreement with acceptable underwriters to underwrite
bonds/debentures. Alternatively, acceptable major financial institutional investors, such as banks,
insurance companies and pension funds, could provide a take-out agreement.
An advisory group (firm with international experience) will assist BB in managing the CBSF.
Support under the CBSF
The following types of support will be provided:
-            Credit Finance. Credit line in local currency priced at market rates to be determined from
time to time. It will be provided to those FIs that meet the eligibility criteria under the project .
-            Bridge Finance. After the maximum amount permitted under the credit line has been
reached, FIs may require additional financing to accumulate earning assets to sell as CLOs. The CBSF
will provide bridge financing with a maximum period for the take-out, i.e. for the repayment of the bridge
finance by some other funding source. The CBSF would pre-approve the take-out arrangements.
*            Standby Support. Under the standby support, the CBSF would commit to purchase the
bonds/debentures or CLOs of the FIs that these are not able to sell into the market. However, only in the
event that the underwriters are unable to successfully market the bonds/debentures or CLOs will the
CBSF purchase the unsold balances. There will be a system of incentives and/or disincentives to induce
the underwriters to successfully place the bonds/debentures or CLOs.
*            Liquidity Mechanism. The CBSF will also have a mechanism to provide liquidity to
investors who have purchased CLOs and bonds/debentures. Under a Repurchase Agreement or "Repo",
the CBSF will purchase the bonds/debentures or CLOs at discount below their fair market value, 1 as
determined by the CBSF in its ownjudgment. The CBSF will not absorb the credit, market or interest
rate risks associated with the Fl's CLOs or bonds/debentures. The investors holding these instruments
continue to carry these risks. The investors must agree to repurchase the instruments within a
predetermined period.
' The CBSF may elect to impose a lower percentage purchase value depending on financial market conditions, the
quality of the Bonds/debentures or CLOs and the fnancial standing of the counterpart to the "Repo".
24



Development/implementation of the CBSF will require:
(a) Development of the CBSF. This subcomponent will consist of: (i) implementation of the CBSF's
organizational structure including role of Government and Facility Advisor; (ii) development/
implementation of accounting and MIS systems; (iii) training GOB/BB staff; and (iv)
development/implementation of a communications programfor the CBSF. (Cost: Accounting System and
Software Development - US$0.45m; Computers and Hardware - US$0.45m; Training of GOB/BB
personnel US$0.2m; GOB counterparts and contribution in kind - US$0.2m. Funding: IDA - US$1.1m;
GOB US$0.2m)
(b) Management of the CBSF (see Annex 2cfor Terms of Reference). A CBSF advisor (firm) will be
required to: (i) advise and assist BB with the operation of the CBSF; (ii) develop details of the operating
system of the CBSF; (iii) advise FIs on use of the CBSF; (iv) manage development of systems as
necessary; (v) handle documentation for formation of the CLOs of the FIs; (vi) implement the availments
under the CBSF; (vii) handle the servicing of the CBSF; (viii) recommend modifications of CBSF's
policies and procedures;' and (ix) submit reports and audits of the CBSF. (Cost: Expatriate and Local
Consultants and Staff- US$2.27m; Office Expenditures - US$0.20m; Computers and Equipment-
US$0.03m. Funding: IDA US$2.50m)
(c) Funding of CBSF. This will be divided as follows: (a) Credit line for US$28m; and (b) Bridge,
Backstop and Liquidity Mechanism for US$17m. (Cost: Subproject cost is estimated at least at US$49m.
Funding: IDA will finance US$40m through the CBSF, GOB US$5m, and FIs direct contribution to the
subprojects US$4m)
(d) Capacity Enhancement of FIs Business Planning, Resource Management and MlS. Assistance to
eligible FIs in: (i) enhancing their capacity to develop strategic and business plans to enable them to
adjust to economic, policy changes and environmental compliance1, (ii) strengthening their risk and
resource management in particular credit assessment and management and asset liability management,

Annex 2a
Methodology to Estimate the Funding under the CBSF
1. Introduction. The estimation methodology covers the following aspects: (a) potential demand for term
financing; (b) funding requirements by potentially eligible FIs; and (c) investors' capacity to support Fl's funding
requirements. As shown below, the CBSF which is composed of a line of credit for US$20 million and a bridge and
standby facility for US$25 million (with the objective of supporting an equivalent amount of bonds/debentures
CLOs) can be justified from these estimates (in addition to FIs own funds).
2. Potential Demand for Term Financing. Table I shows, past and projected macroeconomic figures for Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), Gross Domestic Fixed Investment (GDFI), Gross Private Fixed Investment (GPFI) and
private investment in construction, machinery and equipment, and transport equipment and fixed assets. Key
assumptions based on historical data and recent developments are: (a) GDP growth in real terms of 5.5% between
1995-1999 and 5.6 % between 2000-2003; (b) ratios of GDFI to GDP of 17.4% between 1997-1998 and 17.6%
between 1999-2003; (c) 37.9% share of private investment in GDFI; and (d) private investment as a component of
GDFI broken down into 80% for construction, 14% for machinery and equipment, and 6% for transport equipment
and other items. GPFI is projected to reach US$3.75 billion over the three year period 1999-2001 and US$6.62
billion over the five year period 1999-2003.

4. Sources of Funding. The sources of medium to long-term debt capital, i.e. potential buyers of bonds/debentures
and CLOs, include three general groups: some commercial banks, non-bank institutional investors and high net
worth individual investors. By far the largest group consists of banks, including nationalized commercial banks
(NCBs). Non-bank institutional investors consist of life insurance and pension /provident funds, and non-profit
organizations. High net worth individuals are major buyers of capital market debt instruments who have shifted
their investments to govermment saving schemes. Based on direct interviews with NCBs and insurance companies
it is estimated that banks have an annual flow of investable medium to long term resources of over US$535 million,
while insurance companies have a flow of about US$44 million (Table 3).

Highlights of the Credit, Bridge, and Standby Facility
(CBSF)
Background
I.     The International Development Association (IDA) is preparing a long-term credit line, under its Financial
Institutions Development Project (FIDP), to the Government of Bangladesh (GoB). IDA funding is placed at
US$40 million.' This Project supports Financial Institutions (Fls), consisting of eligible non-banks and banks,
which engage in medium/long-term lending to private sector enterprises. An important objective of the Project is
to develop the capability of the FIs to raise medium/long-term resources. The GoB proposes to provide co-
financing for the Project. The Project will establish the Credit, Bridge, Standby Facility (CBSF) to implement the
financing program for private sector enterprises through the FIs. Bangladesh Bank (BB) will act as the Agent of
the GoB and actively interface with the Facility Advisor.
Credit Component
2.     The CBSF is designed to provide the customary IDA credit line to FIs, while enabling them to mobilize
medium to long-term resources on a sustainable basis consistent with the enabling environment and requisite
institutional infrastructure. While the GoB will take the IDA loan in foreign currency, the CBSF facilities will be
denominated in local currency and priced at a market rate, ensuring that the IDA subsidy is captured by the GoB
as intended.
3.     The maximum Credit Component without any resource mobilization will be the equivalent of US$4
million per Fl. The FIs can accomplish the resource mobilization objective in two ways. The first method involves
the securitization and sale of its credits. The second method is to issue the FIs' secured bonds/debentures.
Resource mobilization, as defined, includes CLOs covering the securitization of outstanding and new credits and
the primary issuance of bonds or debentures. After an Fl uses US$4 million of credit component, there will be a
1:1 ratio between resource mobilization and Credit Component. Under this formula, an Fl may use an additional
US$1 of the Credit Component for every US$1 of resource mobilization, until the maximum of US$28 million in
Credit Component is reached. Thereafter, only resource mobilization will be allowed. All availments will be on a
first come, first serve basis. The Facility Advisor will consider other forms of acceptable resource mobilization in
addition to those already identified.
Resource Mobilization
4.     Under the first method of resource mobilization, the FIs spin off accumulated quality earning assets and
sell participations on these assets, in a manner similar to loan syndications that have become popular among
banks. The participations to the quality earning assets of the FIs that are sold to investors will be in the form of
Participation Certificates in a pool of either loans or lease contracts. These loan or lease receivables that are
pooled are called either "Collateralized Loan Obligations" or "Collateralized Lease Obligations", or "CLOs" for
short. A holder of Participation Certificates in a CLO pool of loans or leases, in effect, has an undivided share in
the interest and principal payments on loans or lease payments. Two or more FIs may combine their sub-loans or
leases into a CLO pool to be issued on behalf of the FIs. CLOs will be issued through single-purpose trusts.
28



Bridge Loans
5.     To enable FIs to accumulate earning assets to sell, the CBSF will provide "bridge" financing to the FIs to
fund the periodic disbursements on sub-projects to be financed. The "bridge" financing agreement would stipulate
the period for the take-out, i.e., for the repayment of the "bridge" finance by some other source. The maximum
contemplated allowable period for bridge loans is 18 months. The Facility Advisor will recommend to BB the pre-
approval of the take-out arrangements.
Standby Component
6.     Under its Standby Component, the CBSF would purchase the CLOs or bond/debentures of the FIs.
However, there should be a prior firm agreement from acceptable underwriters (merchant banks) to underwrite the
CLOs or bond/debentures to be purchased by the CBSF. If the underwriters are unable to market the CLOs or
bonds/debentures, the CBSF will purchase the unsold balance of the CLOs or bonds/debentures. There will be a
system of incentives and/or disincentives to induce the underwriters to market the CLOs or bonds/debentures and
utilize the Standby Component only as a last resort.
Liquidity Mechanism
7.     The CBSF will also have a mechanism that will provide short-term liquidity to the CLOs and the
bonds/debentures that are purchased by investors. The Fl, whose CLOs or bonds/debentures are to be used by
their holders to gain access to the liquidity mechanism, must continue its status as an eligible institution under the
FIDP. The CBSF will not absorb the credit, market or interest rate risks associated with the Fl's CLOs or
bonds/debentures. The investors holding these instruments continue to carry these risks. The CBSF will, under a
Repurchase Agreement or "Repo" (the equivalent of a rediscounting facility), purchase the CLOs or
bonds/debentures at prices based on guidelines defined in the CBSF Operational Directives (OD). (The OD spell
out specific guidelines that will govern the actions of BB and the Facility Advisor on various CBSF components.)
The investors agree to repurchase the instruments after a short period to provide the CBSF a rate of return that
reflects prevailing market conditions and the quality of the Fl's CLOs or bonds/debentures. The Facility Manager
will determine the holding period for the "Repo" and the underlying yield.
IDA's Role
8.     IDA's role will include, among others, the appraisal of the FIs to determine their eligibility, the periodic
supervision of the Project (including the periodic review and modifications of the Operational Directives), and
assistance in the resolution of other critical issues essential to the effectiveness of the CBSF and the success of the
Project.
GoB' Role
9.     The GoB's role consists of: (a) the adoption of the sector strategy, policies and reform agenda supportive
of the Project, in close consultation with the IDA; (b) relending and co-financing mechanisms; (c) Project
oversight for (i) CBSF policies, and (ii) CBSF operations review; and (d) operational control procedures for CBSF
funds, exercised by Bangladesh Bank, consisting of co-signing, together with the Facility Advisor, sub-
project/lease disbursement documents.
Facility Advisor
10.    A Facility Advisor will assist BB in implementing and managing the operational procedures of the CBSF
in a manner consistent with the GoB's Financial Sector Policy Statement. The objective of the work of the
Consultant is to: (a) develop details of the operating systems of the CBSF, defined in the Terms of Reference
(TORs) and formalized in the Facility Advisory Agreement; (b) assist BB in carrying out with prudence, diligence
and care the operations of the CBSF; (c) actively coordinate or assist in the coordination of Technical Assistance
(TA) components relating to the development of CBSF internal system, business plan and financial model, and
29



various institution building programs for the benefit of FIs; (d) define the implementation issues that may impede
the achievement of the objectives of the Project and recommend appropriate actions therefor; and (e) recommend
amendments and/or refinements in the CBSF so as to achieve the Project's objectives to the fullest extent possible.
Operational Directives
11.    The BB and IDA will adopt an Operational Directive (OD) that contains the basic policies and
procedures governing the operations of the CBSF. In particular, the OD covers: (a) the policies governing the (i)
different components of the CBSF and (ii) the management of temporary investments under its Investment
Management Account; (b) the eligibility criteria for Fls; (c) the reporting and monitoring system to be followed by
the Facility Advisor; and (d) the periodically-updated estimate of demand for CBSF components.
CBSF Component Pricing
12.    The CBSF will operate on the basis of market pricing commensurate with the appropriate cost of funds to
the FIs under the different CBSF components. The pricing for these CBSF components will be as follows:
Document                                     Pricing
Fixed interest rate equal to the pricing for the weighted average of the latest
Credit Access    issue of Treasury Bills of all maturities using the amounts of each maturity as
Agreement      the weights plus an appropriate margin spelled out in the OD. The Facility
Manager will fix the rate upon formalization of the Credit Component.
Until such time as Treasury Bills with maturities longer than one month are
Bridge Loan     fairly regular and substantial the benchmark will be the one-month Treasury
Access Agreement  Bill rate and the margin 50 basis points. When BB and IDA consider that TBs
with maturities longer than one month would be deemed appropriate they can
mutually agree on using as benchmark longer maturity TBs..
Standby Support   Standby commitment fee specified in the OD, commensurate with the overall
Access Agreement  cost of underwriting the CLOs or bonds/debentures of FIs.
Repurchase     Cost of funds commensurate with money market conditions and the quality of
Agreement      the FIs' CLOs or bonds/debentures, subject to additional guidelines in the OD.
On-lending Arrangements
13.    Under a Development Credit Agreement (DCA), IDA will lend the proceeds of the credit to the GoB in
US dollars at the standard IDA terms. The GoB will enter into an Administration Agreement (AA) with the BB on
behalf of the CBSF, providing for the same back-to-back grace and repayment periods. Given that local investors
are allowed to invest only in local currency investment instruments, it would be appropriate to denominate the
CBSF components in local currency. In view of the fact that the grace and repayment periods under the DCA are
longer than the servicing periods for the CBSF components made available to the FIs, the CBSF will have the
opportunity of recycling collections for the same components to deepen the attaimnent of the objectives of the
Project.
14.     To enable IDA to effectively monitor and supervise the Project, it is further proposed that IDA prior
written consent be sought for: (a) Fl eligibility; and (b) changes in (i) the Facility Management, (ii) the
Operational Directives that will guide the operations of the CBSF; (iii) the CBSF Chief Executive, and (iv) the
Master Facility Agreements with various FIs.
Downstream Agreements
15.    The CBSF will enter into a Facility Advisory Agreement (FAA) with a qualified international Facility
Advisor to provide advice and operational assistance to BB for handling the main components of the CBSF,
namely, the Credit Component, Bridge Component, and Standby Support Component. In addition, the Facility
30



Advisor will assist and provide operational assistance to BB for administering the CBSF's Liquidity Mechanism.
In turn, BB with advice from the FA will enter into a Master Facility Agreement (MFA) with eligible FIs covering
the standard terms and conditions, except those that will apply to specific transactions. Specific availments by FIs
of CBSF funding will require the formalization of transaction-specific terms, such as the pricing and the tenor of
the funding made available. Access to the Liquidity Mechanism will require the formalization of a "Repo"
covering the instruments eligible for liquidity funding.

Terms of Reference, Selection Method and Guidelines
For The Financial Proposal Of The Facility Advisor'
Background
1.     The International Development Association (IDA) is preparing a long-term credit line, under its Financial
Institutions Development Project (FIDP), to the Government of Bangladesh (GoB). IDA funding is placed at
US$40 million.. This Project supports Financial Institutions (FIs), consisting of eligible non-banks and banks,
which engage in medium/long-term lending to private sector enterprises. An important objective of the Project is
to develop the capability of the FIs to raise medium/long-term resources. The GoB proposes to provide co- -
financing for the Project. The Project will establish the Credit, Bridge, Standby Facility (CBSF) to implement the
financing program for private sector enterprises through the FIs. Bangladesh Bank (BB) will act as the Agent of
the GoB and actively interface with the Facility Advisor.
Objectives and Role of the Facility Advisor
2.     An International Consultant will be selected as the Facility Advisor for the CBSF. In that capacity, the
Facility Advisor will implement and manage the operational procedures of the CBSF in a manner consistent with
the GoB's Financial Sector Policy Statement. The objective of the work of the Consultant is to: (a) develop details
of the operating systems of the CBSF as defined in these Terms of Reference (TORs) and formalized in the
Facility Management Agreement; (b) assist BB in carrying out with prudence, diligence and care the operations of
the CBSF; (c) actively coordinate or assist in the coordination of Technical Assistance (TA) components relating
to the development of CBSF internal system, business plan and financial model, and various institution building
programs for the benefit of FIs; (d) define the implementation issues that may impede the achievement of the
objectives of the Project and recommend appropriate actions therefor; and (e) recommend amendments and/or
refinements in the CBSF so as to achieve the Project's objectives to the fullest extent possible. During the initial
stages of operations, CBSF earnings generated on the use and recycling of IDA funds are not expected to fully
cover the Facility Advisor's fees. TA funding drawn by the GoB would have to cover the deficiency during the
initial period.
3.     In particular, the Facility Advisor will:
(a)    advise BB and provide operational support for the efficient operation of the CBSF in accordance with the
objectives of the Project and the instructions of BB/IDA;
(b)    handle the documentation for the structuring of the CLOs of the FIs;
(c)    implement the availments under the CBSF and handle the underlying documentation, as appropriate;
(d)    cause the Fl that issues the CLO to contract for the services of a qualified
Trustee2 to represent CLO holders in all matters and, in such capacity:
Revisions to these notes will include provisions for: (a) the cancellation of the contract between the CBSF and
the Facility Advisor in the event of a cancellation of the Project by the IDA; and (b) the role of the GoB in the
control procedures relating to the use of CBSF funds originating from the GoB and collections from sub-
loans/leases. Bangladesh Bank, as the agent of the GoB, will co-sign, together with the Facility Advisor, sub-
project/lease disbursement documents for each Fl.
2 In the event there is no qualified private sector party that could act as the Trustee, the Facility Advisor may serve
as the Trustee.
33



(i)     establish an internal system to review compliance of covenants by all parties to the CLO or
bond/debenture issue;
(ii)    in the event of default or dispute, pursue all remedies and take all legal actions that are necessary
to protect and advocate the interest of the securities holders; and
(iii)    perform all fiduciary duties and responsibilities as detailed in the Trust Indenture of the CLO or
bond/debenture issue;
(e)     cause the Fl that issues the CLO to serve as the CLO's Servicing Agent' to:
(i)     issue timely billing invoices to borrowers/lessees of sub-loans/leases that have been pooled into
a CLO;
(ii)    maintain accurate records of payments and outstanding principal balances;
(iii)    monitor and seek immediate collection of delinquent payments;
(iv)    monitor the conditions and status of all assets financed by the sub-loans/leases that are securing
the CLO; and
(v)     perform all fiduciary duties and responsibilities;
(f)     cause the Fl that issues the CLO to contract for the services of a qualified Custodial and Paying Agent
to:
(i)     provide safekeeping for all collateral pledged to the CLOs;
(ii)    expedite the settlement and transfer of securities or certificates representing ownership interest
in the CLOs; and
(iii)    perform all fiduciary duties and responsibilities;
(iv)    maintain various accounts and records of the CLO or bond/debenture issue;
(v)     maintain a registry of holders of the CLO or bond/debenture issue;
(vi)    make proper and timely payments to CLO or bond/debenture holders;
(vii)   invest surplus or idle cash balances; and
(viii)  send pertinent notices to CLO or bond/debenture holders.
(g)     submit regular reports on the operations, financial performance and financial condition of the CBSF;
(h)     prepare, as needed, updated projections of the future operations, financial performance and financial
condition of the CBSF;
(i)     assist the BB/IDA in determining the eligibility of Fls to participate in the CBSF;
(j)     actively coordinate or assist in the coordination of TA components relating to the development of CBSF
internal system, business plan and financial model, and various institution building programs for the
benefit of FIs;
(k)     recommend possible modifications of the CBSF's policies, products and procedures to ensure the
attainment of the Project's objectives and the sustainability of the CBSF; and
(1)     arrange the audit of the CBSF according to International Accounting Standards and International
Auditing Standards.
I Normally, the FI wouldfunction as the Servicing Agent for the sub-loans/leases it originates so as to (a)
maintain the ongoing relationship between the Fl and the client, and (b) reduce the administrative burden for the
CBSF. Where FIs have pooled assets into a CLO, the participating FIs will act as the Servicing Agents for their
respective clients.
34



General Features of the Facility
4.     Credit Component. The CBSF is designed to provide the customary IDA credit line to FIs, while
enabling them to mobilize medium to long-term resources on a sustainable basis consistent with the enabling
environment and requisite institutional infrastructure. While the GoB will take the IDA loan in foreign currency,
the Credit Component of the CBSF will be denominated in local currency and priced at a market rate, ensuring
that the IDA subsidy is captured by the GoB as intended.
5.     The maximum Credit Component without any resource mobilization will be the equivalent of US$4
million per Fl. The FIs can accomplish the resource mobilization objective in two ways. The first method involves
the securitization and sale of its credits. The second method is to issue the FIs' secured bonds/debentures.
Resource mobilization, as defined, includes the issuance of CLOs covering the securitization of outstanding and
new credits and primary issuance of bonds or debentures. After the first US$4 million of credit component, there
will be a 1:1 ratio between resource mobilization and Credit Component. Under this formula, an Fl may use an
additional US$1 of the Credit Component for every US$1 of resource mobilization, until the maximum of US$28
million in Credit Component is reached. Thereafter, only resource mobilization will be allowed. All availnents
will be on a first come, first serve basis. The Facility Advisor will consider other forms of acceptable resource
mobilization in addition to those already identified.
6.     Resource Mobilization. Under the first method of resource mobilization, the FIs spin off accumulated
quality earning assets and sell participations on these assets, in a manner similar to loan syndications that have
become popular among banks. The participations to the quality earning assets of the FIs that are sold to investors
will be in the form of Participation Certificates in a pool of either loans or lease contracts. These loan or lease
receivables that are pooled are called either "Collateralized Loan Obligations" or "Collateralized Lease
Obligations", or "CLOs" for short. A holder of Participation Certificates in a CLO pool of loans or leases, in
effect, has an undivided share in the interest and principal payments on loans or lease payments. Two or more FIs
may combine their sub-loans or leases into a CLO pool to be issued on behalf of the FIs. CLOs will be issued
through single-purpose trusts.
7.     Bridge Loans. To enable FIs to accumulate earning assets to sell, the CBSF will provide "bridge"
financing to the FIs to fund the periodic disbursements on sub-projects to be financed. The "bridge" fmancing
agreement would stipulate the period for the take-out, i.e., for the repayment of the "bridge" fmance by some
other source. The maximum contemplated allowable period for bridge loans is 18 months. The Facility Advisor
would assist BB in pre-approving the take-out arrangements.
8.     Standby Component. Under its Standby Component, the CBSF would purchase the CLOs or
bond/debentures of the FIs. However, there should be a prior firm agreement from acceptable underwriters to
underwrite the CLOs or bond/debentures to be purchased by the CBSF. If the underwriters are unable to market
the CLOs or bonds/debentures, the CBSF will purchase the unsold balance of the CLOs or bonds/debentures.
There will be a system of incentives and/or disincentives to induce the underwriters to move the CLOs or
bonds/debentures.
9.     Liquidity Mechanism. The CBSF will also have a mechanism that will provide short-term liquidity to
the CLOs and the bonds/debentures that are purchased by investors. The CBSF will not absorb the credit, market
or interest rate risks associated with the Fl's CLOs or bonds/debentures. The investors holding these instruments
continue to carry these risks. The CBSF will, under a Repurchase Agreement or "Repo" (the equivalent of a
rediscounting facility), purchase the CLOs or bonds/debentures at prices based on guidelines defmed in the CBSF
Operational Directives. The investors agree to repurchase the instruments after a short period to provide the CBSF
a rate of return that reflects prevailing market conditions and the quality of the Fl's CLOs or bonds/debentures.
The Facility Manager will determine the holding period for the "Repo" and the underlying yield.
10.    IDA's role will include, among others, the appraisal of the FIs to determine their eligibility, the periodic
supervision of the Project (including the periodic review and modifications of the OD), and assistance in the
resolution of other critical issues essential to the effectiveness of the CBSF and the success of the Project.

Report/Documentation Contents and Formats to Develop
11.    As part of Project Implementation, the Facility Advisor will develop the content and forrnats for
prescribed reports, subject to the approval of the IDA/BB, and prepare/submit them as scheduled. In particular:
(a)    The Facility Advisor will prepare a monthly report that will provide a brief narrative of the highlights,
together with:
(i)    key data on the utilization and status of: (1) the three components of the CBSF, i.e., the Credit
Component, the Bridge Component, and the Standby Component, and (2) the Liquidity
Mechanism for CLOs and bonds/debentures; and the
(ii)    CBSF's financial statements, including the Income Statement, Cash Flow, Balance Sheet (with a
statement of the Investment Management Account).
The report would provide the following data for the Credit, Bridge and Standby Components, broken down per Fl
and consolidated for all FIs:
(a- 1)  the summary sub-project/client profile (amount of credit, grace/maturity,
pricing, collateral/security, product[s], subsector, project description, project cost and financial
plan, use of credit proceeds, principals/management, location, basic issues, and special
conditions);
(a-2)   commitments, disbursements, undisbursed commitments, repayments, outstanding amounts, and
arrears (if any);
(a-3)   credit classification and loss provisions made for sub-loans/leases in CLOs;
(a-4)   discussion of actions taken or to be taken to resolve any accounts in CLOs that are in arrears,
delinquent, in technical default, or in a bankruptcy court;
(a-5)   cash reserves and expenses for CLOs;

(a-7)  for the Liquidity Mechanism for CLOs and bonds/debentures:
(aa)   breakdown by FV/underwriter/investor and totals for all Fls/underwriters/investors;
(bb)   availments, repayments and outstanding amounts for liquidity support for CLOs and
bonds/debentures;
(cc)    a summary of the underlying instruments and their quality;
(dd)   the amounts unused under the liquidity mechanism feature of the CBSF;
(ee)   for securities held by the CBSF through the Liquidity Mechanism, a report showing
market valuation of the underlying collateral;
(ff)    a management system to immediate notify all parties on margin calls; and
(gg)   defaults, if any, under the liquidity mechanism and steps being taken to remedy the
defaults.
The Statement of the Investment Management Account will provide information on:
(b-i)  asset breakdown consisting of cash and current accounts, short-term deposits, short-term
obligations of the GoB, liquidity mechanism receivables from CLO or bond/debenture investors,
receivables from each Fl (broken down into current and long-tern portion), and other assets;
and
(b-2)  the yields on the different earning asset categories.
(b)    The Facility Advisor will prepare a quarterly report that narrates the implementation of the FIDP as it
relates to the operations of the CBSF, highlighting relevant implementation issues and the action program to
address the issues.
36



(c)    The Facility Advisor will prepare a semi-annual assessment of the FIs' demand for the three CBSF
components, providing adequate details for each Fl. The report will be based on a format to be developed by the
Facility Advisor and approved by the IDA/BB.
(d)    The Facility Advisor will prepare projections, on an annual basis and updated or refined as often as
necessary, of its cash flow and balance sheet with the following time horizons:
(i)    for the cash flow projections: daily basis for one week, weekly basis for one month, and
monthly basis for one year; and
(ii)    balance sheet projections: monthly basis for one year.
The cash flow projections will include:
(a-i)  receipts consisting of estimated collections for sub-loans/leases from each Fl, maturing short-
term investments, and fee/investment income; and
(a-2)   expenditures consisting of estimated disbursements for sub-loans/leases for each Fl, short-term
investments to be made, and operational expenses.
The balance sheet projections will include:
(b-1)  asset breakdown consisting of cash and current accounts, short-term  deposits, short-term
obligations of the GoB, liquidity mechanism receivables from CLO or bond/debenture investors,
receivables from each Fl (broken down into current and long-term portion), and other assets;
and
(b-2)  the liability and reserve account consisting of current liabilities, the payables to the GoB on
account of the CBSF (broken down into current and long-term portion), and accumulated
reserves (representing the excess of income over expenses).
There will be supporting schedules for each Fl, including a breakdown for CLOs and bonds/debentures, as
appropriate.
GoB Review of Disbursements
12.    BB, as Agent of the GoB, will co-sign CBSF disbursements on the basis of
documentation prepared by the Facility Advisor.
Undertakings of the Facility Advisor
13.    The Facility Advisor will make the following undertakings, among others: (a) arrangements for
transferring facility management skills to qualified local professionals; (b) an exit strategy for the CBSF, including
the option of privatization, the proposal for which would be prepared by the end of the second year after signing
of the Facility Advisory Agreement; (c) committed engagement of the Facility Advisor's executives for the
duration of the contract; (d) BB prerogative to ask for the replacement of any CBSF executive; and (e) BB no
objection required for CBSF executive replacement, in case it becomes necessary.
Contract Cancellation
14.    BB may cancel the Facility Advisory Agreement (as provided in the contract) in the event (a) the IDA
cancels the Project, or (b) the IDA determines that the financial market reacts differently and/or technical and
management skills need change compared with base case scenario expectations.
37



Qualifications of the Consultant
15.    Since the CBSF Facility Advisor will have access to confidential information on the clients of the FIs, the
Consultant serving as the Facility Advisor should not be an Fl operating in Bangladesh or a local group with
affiliation with such an Fl. Therefore, eligible consultants would include (a) local consulting groups with
international affiliation (but without any affiliation with any FI operating in Bangladesh), (b) international banks,
investment banking fimns, or other non-banks not operating in Bangladesh, or (c) international consultants.
16.    The Consulting Firn  should have expertise in designing and developing capital market financing
programs similar to the CBSF. The Facility Advisor assigned by the Consulting Firm to undertake the work
should have at least five years relevant experience in designing or developing capital market programs similar to
those under the CBSF. Professional exposure of both the Consulting Firm and the Facility Advisor in emerging or
developing economies is essential. Assisting the CEO is an Operations Manager who would also be the deputy of
the CEO. The Operations Manager could be a Bangladeshi with appropriate professional exposure of at least five
years in the financial sector. The Operations Manager should be the holder of a Masters Degree in either Business
or Economics. Both the Facility Advisor and the Operations Manager should be fluent in written and spoken
English, and computer-literate. Depending on the volume of transactions, the Consultant could have up to two
staff assistants.
Selection Method
17.    Quality-Based Selection (QBS) will be the basis for choosing the Facility Advisor from the short list of
consultants. The responsibilities of the Facility Advisor are highly complex and specialized. They require a
combination of the proper expertise and the judicious exercise of developmental and fnancial creativity. The
Consultant and key personnel must demonstrate an understanding of the success metrics of the Project, i.e., actual
resource mobilization activities of the FIs measured as a ratio of at least, if not greater than, 1:1 compared to the
utilization of the Project's Credit Component. The International Consultant should provide an indicative listing of
different components and related activities, their costs and duration, monitoring strategy and impact indicators, as
well as required local counterpart technical and financial input. The Consultants in the short list should submit
only the technical proposal. The GoB will request the Consultant with the highest ranked technical proposal to
submit a financial proposal along the lines outlined below.
18.    The GoB will evaluate each technical proposal, taking into account several criteria: (a) the Consultant's
relevant experience for the assigmnent and ability to ensure the uninterrupted implementation of the Project; (b)
the quality of the methodology proposed; (c) the qualifications of the key personnel proposed (the Chief Executive
and Operations Manager or equivalent); and (d) transfer of knowledge. Each criterion will be marked on a scale of
I to 100. The marks will be weighted in computing the scores. The weights of the different criteria are as follows:
38



Criterion                  Weight    Points (1 to 100)   Weighted Points
Consultant's specific experience & support  10
Methodology                                15
Key personnel
Chief Executive                          50
Operations Manager or equivalent         20
Transfer of knowledge                       5
Total                     100
19.    Since the key personnel ultimately determine the quality of performance, considerable weight is given to
this criterion. The key personnel will be evaluated on the basis of three sub-criteria:
(a)    general qualifications: education and training, length of experience, positions held in various
firms, time with the International Consultant as staff, experience in developing countries;
(b)    adequacy for the assignment: exposure in the financial sector, experience in the development of
capital market instruments and programs similar to the CBSF, familiarity with regional/local
fmancial sector issues and programs, and other specific experience with an important bearing on
the assignment; and
(c)    experience in the region: knowledge of the regional/local culture, administrative system, and
govermment structures and policies.
Guidelines for the Financial Proposal
20.    The GoB will request the Consultant with the highest ranked technical proposal to submit a detailed
financial proposal based on these guidelines: The Facility Advisor's compensation will be based on the following
formula:
F      =       OPE + VI, where:
F              Total fee of the Facility Advisor
OPE   =        Out-of-pocket expenses of the Facility Advisor
VI     =       variable income.
In turn, OPE          operating expenses consisting of personnel compensation and
administrative expenses,
VI     =       X (total outstanding CLOs, bonds and debentures of FIs floated
through the CBSF net of provisions per Bangladesh Bank regulations - CLOs,
bonds and debentures of FIs purchased by the CBSF under the Standby
Component), and
X      =       1%or0.01
The cumulative variable income should not exceed 30% of the total out-of-pocket expenses agreed.

Summary of Benefits and Costs:
An overall benefit of the project is that it will support expansion of the sounder and more
efficient part of the financial sector providing alternative opportunities for savers and increasing
the supply of term funds for competitive projects generating economic growth and employment.
During the first phase of the project the line of credit will increase available funds for investors
through eligible FIs, strengthening the efficient FIs and increasing the number of investment
projects. During the second phase the bridge and standby component will strengthen FIs
capabilities to raise funds from the market benefiting savers and investors. The project benefits
are difficult to quantify since once an efficient system of intermediation for term financing is
established it is expected to become self sustainable, which will be the main economic benefit.
However, a conservative estimate of the project's impact during its implementation phase
taking into account the revenues generated by the investment subprojects minus the cost of
funding shows an ERR of 14% (over the IDA funds) and an NPV of US$5.49 million (base
case). The expected benefits over the long run are expected to be substantially higher.
41



Main Assumptions: Benefits assume that projects have a ratio of gross income to investment of
0.2 (ratios for similar projects under the PSIC averaged 0.3 ex-ante). To estimate NPV,
projects of 10 year lifetime and no scrap value at the end of the project, were considered as
typical. Cost of funds was considered as interest on bonds and deposits at 12% plus 2% for
intermediation costs. To estimate the ERR, disbursements under the IDA credit were
considered at USS30' (i.e. US$10' not disbursed to support bond and CLO issues).
Sensitivity analysis: (a) Assuming a higher ratio of gross income to investment of 0.3 (similar
to ex-ante ratio on projects financed under the PSIC) NPV would be $33.76' and ERR 33%.
(b)Assuming that IDA's credit of US$40' is totally disbursed (full backing of bonds and CLOs)
both NPV and ERR would be substantially higher due to the low interest rate of the IDA credit,
but the long term benefits would be mininum.

Annex 6
Procurement*
6.1   Table 6.1 summarizes the project items, their related cost estimates and proposed
methods of procurement. Table 6.2 summarizes the thresholds for procurement methods and
prior review. Procurement of goods would follow procedures outlined in the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995 (Revised January and
August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999). Consultants financed by IDA would be
recruited according to the Bank's Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers, January 1977, revised September 1997 and January 1999.
6.2   Equipment (US$ 1.67 million): The project will finance about US$1,670,000 of
computers and related equipment. Computers and related equipment for about US$1,400,000
will be procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure. Urgently
required computers and related equipment costing less than US$20,000 per contract, up to an
aggregate amount of US$ 100,000, will be procured following National Shopping procedures
(i.e., by soliciting price quotations from at least three qualified suppliers). Software for a total
amount of US$220,000 will be procured through Direct Contracting Method.
6.3   Consultants' Service (US$5.58 million): Consultants' services will be required for:
(a) Consulting firms for (i) Management of CBSF (US$2.51 million plus-success fee)
will be selected on Quality Based Selection (QBS), and (ii) Training for FIs Capacity
Enhancement (US$0.80 million) will be selected on Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS)
methods. The process of contracting a consulting firm to manage the CBSF has been started.
Prior to negotiations, the GOB issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) among previously short-
listed firms. Prior to Board, the technical evaluation of the proposals will be presented to IDA.
The consulting firm will be appointed as a condition for credit effectiveness.
(b) Individual consultants for (i) Development of Issue Rules for Bonds/Debentures
(US$0.26 million), (ii) Implementation of Procedures for Bonds/Debentures (US$0.08 million),
(iii) Reform of Government Saving Schemes (US$0.20 million), (iv) Development of
Accounting System Software (US$0.20 million), (v) Resource Mobilization for FIs (US$0.44
million), (vi) Revision of CBSF Mechanism (US$0.41 million), (vii) Developing
Communication System for CBSF (US$0.20 million), (viii) Contract Processing at Bangladesh
Bank (US$0.03 million), and (ix) Capacity Enhancement of FIs (US$0.45 million) will be
procured on the basis of qualifications and experiences.
6.4   Procurement Plan: Draft Procurement Plan has been prepared by Bangladesh Bank
covering the total project. The final Procurement Plan would be included in the PIP.
* For details on financial management and disbursement arrangements, please see page 9 of the
Project Appraisal Document and the Borrower Implementation Plan.
44



6.5   Use of Standard Documents: For ICB procurement, the use of the Bank's Standard
Bidding Documents (SBD) for goods, modified by the government and agreed by the Bank, is
mandatory. The Bank's Standard Bid Evaluation Form for Goods and Works (April 1996,
modified by BDO) will be used for submission of evaluation reports to IDA. For requesting
proposals from Consulting firms, the Bank's standard Requests for Proposals (RFP) will be
used..
6.6   Procurement Capacity Review: Procurement capacity of Bangladesh Bank will be
strengthened for contracting goods and services. A local consultant will be appointed for this
purpose, the cost of which will be supported under the project.
6.7   IDA Prior Review
(a)   Goods: IDA will carry out prior review of all contracts for Computers and Accessories
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more. In addition, IDA will carry out prior
review of the first two contracts for Computers and Accessories under National Shopping
Procedure, irrespective of value. Further, IDA will carry out prior review of Computer
Software procured under Direct Contracting method.
(b)   Services: There are only two contracts for Consulting firms that will be financed under
the Credit. Since the value of the contract of both the consultants' services is above
US$100,000, IDA's prior review will be required for both. Moreover, all individual contracts
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more will be subject to prior review by IDA.
For other contracts for individual consultants, IDA will review the terms of reference (TOR).

Please refer.to your leter of December 22l998'regarding pohcytstatement on

has formulated apolie on Non-Bank Financial Instituton' which is"stated below' Futher

;instructed by the on ble Finance Minister-.;.              -
Oi3.    A well functioiing financial system is essential if the country sverall goals
i-regarding savinzgs mvestment, GDP growth and poverty alleviation are to be
realized. The function of the funancial'system in anj'countr is to servethe real
. sectors and meet people's legitimate needs for financial services. InoSther words,
-: the financial system must perform the dual function of mobilization and allocation
of resources. The financial system should perform these basic functions at the
*lowest possiblg'cost of intermediation and at' the same time,;offe.the widest
-choices to the pr,oyiders'and users of capital:
~4. "Banks are:the principal players in Bangladesh'financial system-.With 6000
branches all over the-'country, banking sector 'in Bangladesh'com'prises 4 NCBs,
:18 local privat banks,'4 specialized developmeiit.bankss 'and a dozen foreign
* banks. Althougi; the banking sector itself has'expanded at a reasonable rate over.
;the past two deE'ades, the contribution of the banking sector to .the' ouFY's overall
'economic developiment'needs to be improved, especially with respect' the quality.
of resource alocation and the strengt of the banksownTinanciaposition. In
particular, the banks have not performed satisfactortily'the financial intermediation
'finiition for the country, as evidenced by the high lievels of rion-performing loans.
In the last few yfars the Government has undertaken several reform measures, e.g.
;interest rate liberalization, establishment of money. loan courts' introduction of
prudential regulations, etc. However, much still remains to be done' 'and there is
now an urgentneed to undertake important new measures to strengthen and deepen
the reform process .This 'will require ia"cooperative' effort from all "the principal
48



-:parties involved the Government will need to provide an overall stable and
'-positive macro-environment in which the banking industry could'thrive; the
Bahgladesh Bank will need to provide effective supervision and enforcement; the
.banking industry will have to improve efficiency, strengthen its financial
-condition, and undertake lending more prudently; and the clients of the banking
'industry  must behave more responsibly, particularly the borro6wers must
-"-'understand that the loans they receive represent contractual obligations-which have
o be repaid diligently.
*5.   Considering that in the foreseeable future, the bankingisector:wtIl continue
to dominate deposit r4obilization, the GoVernment is committed; trestore the
.banking sectoe's 'abilitysto provide -financial intermediation,for the:.economy. The
-:,.Governmnent hase.eviewed tfie-Wdrld Bank's 're i'taEtblihdig a Sound

*-reforms. But theprobleMns of the banking sector are deep rooted and will require
. time and fiscal resources to resolve. There is also~reai.nsk of precipitating a crisis,
-if reformns are not well designed and properly sequenced
6.    Following`.the Bank's strategy report recommendatio'ns, -the.-;Govt. has
started to implement the desired reforn'nmeasures. The government is committed to
* implement the financial sector ref6rms and have already requested the World Bank
.for assistance in strengthening the reguplatory and supervisory capacity of the
Bangladesh Bank and in making it a stronger central bankic Bankruptcy Courts
have been set-up to adjudicate cases under the Bankruptcy Act, 1998. Loans, or
leases obtained :from  banks and other financial 'institutions must be repaid
according to contractual agreements. This is the only -way sound banking business
can be conducted. Therefore, GOB is determined 'to instill strict' financial
discipline in order to break the 'default culture'. The relevant legal framework-and
procedures are being reviewed and the laws will be'amended and enacted and
related proc'edures 'modified as necessary.. The' objective' will be to 'niake debt
recovery easier, quicker, and more practical. Various measures are also underway
to improve the governance in the banking 'sector, which'includes issuance of new
circulars defining'-clear-cut and transparent. roles and responsibilitiei'of bank
directors and management and containnment of laboirunion activities in' banking
institutions withii legally defined sphere. Bangladesh'Bank has signed agreements
with problem banks in the private sector to restore theirTiviability. The Bangladesh
Bank is also putting efforts to enforce the prudential'regulations more stringently
to' ensure financial discipline.  -
7.   The non-bank financial sector, comprisig'investment and finance
companies, leasing companies and mortgage banks'7'.and the capital markets,
constitutes as yet a small but growing component of the financial sector.- FIs as a
group provide Bangladesh with an opportunity to improve financial intermediation
for the economy. Although FIs account forlonly 4% of the assets of the financial
49



. sector, compared to 70% for the NCBs and 25% for the local private.banks, they
now account for -20% of the term financing(FY 1996-97) throughAleasing, project
finance and me.rchant banking activities. The'-volumeof term`finiance. they

-9.   To ensure the success of the strategy to strengthen the non-bankYfinancial
. sector, the NCBs'would be discouraged to increasei'&eir termI lending activities'
until govemanice and management are ad"quiately reied. Infact, NCBs term
lending disbursements fell in FY 1996-97 'to only 40%, of those in the'previous
year.    '
10.   To support the resource mobilization activities of the FIs,.GOB will set up a
facility with the a'sistance of the IDA. The Facility, 'called Credit, Bridge and:
Standby Facility (CBSF), will provide'funding from IDA'to FIs`through a variety
of mechanisms that-would increase their funding while enabling and encouraging
them to mobilize mediurm to long term resources from the. locail markit GOB
would also contribute USS 5.00 (five) million to the Facility
11.   Furthermoe;to remove the constraints faced by       e FIs    mbilizing

Summary of Appraisals of Candidate Financial Institutions
1. United Leasing Company Ltd. (ULC)
Established in 1989, ULC is the second largest leasing company, with an estimated market share of 26% in 1997.
Its shareholder mix includes a synergistic combination of a diversified business group, and multilateral and
bilateral financial institutions. Institutional investors associated with Duncan Brothers (Bangladesh) Ltd. (DBL),
whose parent company is Lawrie Group of U.K., holds 48% of company stock, with plans for further increasing
the holdings to 51%. In addition to their equity positions, Asian Development Bank and Commonwealth
Development Corporation have provided long-term funding support. Aside from its holdings in ULC, DBL has
interests in tea production and exports, insurance and bottled water. DBL reportedly accounts for about one-fourth
of the Bangladesh tea exports.
There are close business and management relationships between DBL and ULC. DBL provides ULC client
referrals and local business information relevant to the assessment of lease credits. There are cross-management
links between DBL and ULC that constitute an effective subsidiary relationship that could tend to ensure ULC
management continuity. Given the small complement of 29 officers and staff, ULC's Executive Committee
provides a vehicle for hands-on, top-level direction of operations. The company has a senior management team
with adequate operating experience to cope with a growing level of business. However, there are gaps in
professional skills that need to be filled or strengthened, especially in the area of credit appraisal, second level
professional support, and computer proficiency. The company lacks adequate human resource policies and
procedures concerning staffing requirements, recruitment and performance evaluation.
ULC has formal policies and procedures that guide company-wide operations but there appears to
be no time frame assigned to the attainment of goals and objectives. The company has yet to
develop a formal corporate/business plan that will embody its strategic directions, particularly its
planned diversification into operating leases and short-term finance, consisting of factoring and
commercial paper issues. ULC is facing competitive pressures that have caused growth rates to
slacken and spreads to narrow. ULC's ability to obtain regulatory clearance to open branches, and
thus, expand operations is deemed to have been negatively impacted by its resistance to
Bangladesh Bank policies that prescribe a liquidity ratio for the non-deposit liabilities of non-
banks and prohibit cross-directorships between two non-banks.
The company's governance documents include a Policy Statement that is adequate as it takes substantive and
relevant business and operational issues under its purview. The Policy Statement includes various operating
guidelines (e.g., governing laws, liaison with the government, lease appraisal policy, exposure limits, insurance,
provisioning policy, dividend policy, lease rates, insider transactions, and lease rates), the responsibility of the
Board of Directors, Executive Committee, the Managing Director, staff, management reports and policy revisions.
The company has fairly established policies and procedures governing credit appraisal and disbursements. ULC
needs to strengthen its risk analysis and supervision of clients on a programmed basis, beyond its present system
of payments monitoring and arrears follow-up. It has yet to develop formal policies relating to problem account
resolution.
The company has set policies governing product pricing in a manner that would cover the cost of funds, operating
costs and provisions and a reasonable return to capital that would enhance shareholder values. Its financial
management policies enable the company to cope with normal asset/liability management risks, although there are
areas for potential improvement, such as setting targets for key financial parameters, e.g., liquidity, gaping and
arrears collections. The company has a long foreign currency position resulting from keeping foreign currency
deposits as security for bank loans, rather than converting them into local currency for Taka-denominated
55



fnancing. A gradual but sustained currency depreciation has enabled ULC to realize positive spreads on this
aspect of its operations, while maintaining a high level of liquidity.
The current rudimentary MIS supports managerial decision-making through a variety of reports, but there is no
internal network. Management plans to strengthen its MIS by developing a database for operations and related IT
modules in collaboration with other leasing companies.
ULC's external auditors, affiliated with a major international auditing firm, audit the company books and assist in
the preparation of financial statements based on the Operating and Financial Methods in accordance with
International Accounting and Auditing Standards. The opinion issued by the auditors has been unqualified. That
said, the company needs to establish an internal audit unit to provide for checks and balances.
The company financial performance has shown a generally upward trend in terms of operating revenues, after-tax
profit and returns. Audited results for 1997 showed after-tax profit of Tk. 64 million, representing a return on
equity of 31% and return on assets of 9%. The after-inflation rates of return figures are significant. However, there
has been a deceleration in the growth of revenues and profit, accompanied by narrowing spreads, owing to a
slowdown in lease bookings caused by a combination of political disturbances and competitive pressures. The
strong financial performance has enabled the company to declare a rising level of dividends, although within a
defined maximum payout ratio. At the same time, the company has been able to raise shareholders' equity in
recent years by a growth rate consistently exceeding 20%. Notwithstanding the absence of a formal
corporate/business plan, the company has defined basic goals relating to market share and selective strategic
directions.
The company has attained satisfactory fmancial performance, while maintaining a fairly strong portfolio and
financial position. Its 1997 collection ratio was 94%, with portfolio infection of 3%, based on a 90-day
definitional cut-off for arrears. There is no undue concentration of risks other than to one business group and the
textile industry. The 1997 audited reports showed adequate provisions for doubtful accounts. The debt/equity ratio
stood at a moderate level of 2.8 times. A detailed rundown of the company's 1997 financials shows overall
compliance with the CBSF eligibility criteria for financial institutions. Unaudited data for 1998 show continued
overall compliance with the eligibility criteria, although the government's adverse ruling on depreciation
allowance negatively impacted earnigs. The financial eligibility of ULC under the CBSF would be validated
upon completion of the audited financial statements for 1998, the positive results of which are expected by
management. Final eligibility is premised on: (a) limiting exposure in the loan account with concentration of
credits; (b) issuance of a Corporate Strategy Statement, acceptable to IDA; (c) setting up of an Internal Audit
Committee; and (d) signing of the FIDP Participation Agreement and compliance with its conditionalities.
2. Industrial Promotion and Development Company Ltd. (IPDC)
IPDC commenced operations in 1983 based on the traditional mold of privately-controlled development finance
companies (DFIs) with a focused product orientation. IPDC's shareholders include the Government of Bangladesh
(GoB), which holds the largest single, though minority, block of 30%, International Finance Corporation (IFC),
Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), German Investment and Development Company (DEG) and
the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED). IPDC's shareholder mix has enabled it to gain a
measure of credibility in the market place, although the equity participation of the GoB has tended to generate a
resistance factor in the minds of providers of investible funds. There are plans to divest the GoB holdings in IPDC
through a rights issue and tap more institutional investors to join its shareholder list. IPDC has benefited from the
funding and technical support of its shareholders, particularly from IFC which has provided long-term foreign
currency resources to back relending operations.
Affiliation with multilateral and bilateral institutions has enabled IPDC to develop systems and access resources
associated with DFIs. Unfortunately, the financial results were disappointing during the initial stages of IPDC's
56



operations. The limiting factors, aside from the global experience of DFIs, included top management discontinuity
and ineffectiveness, the absence of a clear strategic vision, restrictive operational policies, and a time-consuming
project approval process. The ascendancy of the current Managing Director and CEO in 1986 has yielded
considerable improvements in operational levels, the quality of the portfolio, and the financial performance, with
financial results and portfolio values showing a credible upward trend. IPDC's strategic plan calls for the phased
diversification of its operations. In keeping with a gradualist approach to product diversification, IPDC is initially
branching out only into project leasing and working capital finance.
To cope with the directions for the future, IPDC has restructured a previously unwieldy organizational set-up and
established two main groups: one handling business origination, the second covering finance and administration.
IPDC realizes the need for deepening the in-house skills related to project financing and Information Technology.
The company needs to internalize new skills relating to working capital finance and project leasing. But the
greatest organizational challenge facing IPDC is to broaden the skills of senior officers to reduce the operational
burden on the Managing Director who is very much involved in detailed planning, major transactions and key
operational tasks. IPDC has yet to develop human resource policies.
IPDC governance documents include a business plan that incorporates investment policy, dividend policy and
financial prudence guidelines. While IPDC does not have a formal document on credit policies, it prescribes a
maximum debt/equity ratio of 1.5 times for its clients. The credit appraisal process is fairly detailed covering
various aspects of the project. The Business Plan also sets forth the pricing for different product lines, although the
financial rationale for pricing is unclear. In addition, IFC has stipulated financial covenants covering maximum
leverage, interest coverage, and asset/liability average maturity matching. IPDC has been able to maintain
matched average maturities for assets and liabilities, but it continues to incur a significant currency mismatch by
keeping large foreign currency deposits sourced from IFC's financing. IPDC pledges the forex deposits to
generate local currency lending funds. The historical, though gradual, depreciation of the local currency has
enabled IPDC to generate non-operational surplus that supports additional local currency borrowings.
IPDC closely monitors every project, especially the non-performing ones. The company has tended to utilize
amicable settlement as a process of problem account resolution, rather than pursue litigation as the final solution.
With respect to regular accounts, the operational staff prepares formal, bi-monthly inspection reports containing
qualitative information on the clients (their operations, business, capacity utilized, problems, etc.). Management
could strengthen the reports by including quantitative information that would facilitate overall performance review
(periodic financial statements, bank and cash statements, receivables, etc.).
Independent local auditors, affiliated with a major international auditing firm, handle the audit of IPDC's fmancial
statements based on International Accounting and Auditing Standards. The opinion on the financial statements
certified by the external auditors have been unqualified. To further strengthen its internal systems, IPDC
management is aware of the need to install an internal audit unit.
IPDC's financial results have improved substantially over the past few years due to: (a) a sharp increase in
operational income (resulting from a combination of increased business volume, higher rates, lower funding cost
and consequently higher margins); (b) substantial capital gains realized from the sale of three portfolio equity
investments; and (c) low provisions as collection and portfolio infection ratios improved significantly. The 1997
collection ratio was recorded at about 90%, with the portfolio infection ratio held at 16%. All of the 33 sub-
projects financed by a previous IDA credit line are performing. The financial operations resulted in 1997 after-tax
profit of Tk. 93 million, representing a 24% rate of return on equity and 13% rate of return on assets, both figures
substantially higher than the inflation rate experienced. The positive financial results have been achieved while
keeping leverage under control, with the debt/equity ratio standing at 0.9:1 at year-end 1997.
Based on a overall review of IPDC's compliance with FIDP eligibility criteria, using data up to 1997, IPDC would
qualify as a participating financial institution under the project. The review will be updated based on the audited
results for 1998. Preliminary figures for 1998 are encouraging. Assuming final confirmation of compliance with
the financial eligibility criteria, IPDC would be declared eligible on the following conditions: (a) issuance by
57



IPDC's Board of Policy and Corporate Strategy Statements, acceptable to IDA, which address the issues
identified; and (b) signing of the FIDP Participation Agreement and compliance with its conditionalities.
3. Industrial Development Leasing Company Ltd. (IDLC)
Operating since 1985, IDLC is the pioneer and largest leasing company in the country, accounting for about 40%
of the market. The participation of key institutional investors has contributed to a formalized governance
framework actively guiding its operations. The major institutional investors include the IFC, IPDC, Korea
Development Leasing Corporation (KDLC) and Korea Long-Term Bank (KLTB). IDLC has a comprehensive
Statement of General and Operational Policies which covers, among others, corporate objectives, areas of
activities, operational and financial prudence guidelines, and reporting requirements. IDLC's foreign investors
have provided institutional development and funding support. As the strategic investor, KDLC reserves the right
to nominate the Deputy Managing Director (DMD) to whom all operating units report. Currently, a KDLC
executive is serving as the DMD reporting to the Managing Director (MD), a Bangladeshi national, who also
serves as the CEO. Over the years, IDLC has succeeded in developing a seasoned, experienced management core
that has steered the company's dominance of the local leasing sub-sector.
Notwithstanding the stated strengths, there are organizational issues that IDLC recognizes and needs to address if
it is to maintain its position as a leading financial institution. In the light of increasing competitive pressures from
other market players, the operations of other entrants into the leasing sub-sector and the recent decline in IDLC's
market share, IDLC has opted to diversify its product lines to include merchant banking, short-term fnance and
housing finance. However, the company has yet to develop a formal strategic and business plan incorporating the
new initiatives, a document it expects to complete within the first half of 1999. It also has to prepare an up-to-date
Corporate Strategy Statement as part of the FIDP eligibility requirements.
The company's management recognizes that the current internal skills are inadequate to allow it to effectively
carry out its diversification plans. Accordingly, IDLC places importance on the recruitment of the required skills
and in-house training for a complete product cycle, especially the supervision of credits which is deficient.
Complicating the managerial challenge is the prospect of a vacuum at the top-most management level. The MD,
who has served as CEO since 1989, has plans of retiring for health reasons. A qualified professional, recruited to
succeed the MD, resigned. The DMD is scheduled to return to Korea, but his departure has been postponed to
avoid management disruption. The company also has to realign internal reporting relationships to remove
potential dysfunctional complications arising from the present set-up. It is IDLC's goal to stabilize the
management team, since the company has experienced a high turnover of officers and staff which has disrupted
operations.
IDLC's credit policies are fairly comprehensive as the risk evaluation or credit appraisal calls for professional
standards in the assessment of the managerial, technical, marketing and financial aspects of all lease proposals.
Special attention is given to the capacity of the lessee to service the lease obligation and the type of leased
equipment that will ensure a resale value. While IDLC has exposure limits, some of them tend to be more liberal
than the limits defned among the eligibility criteria under FIDP. IDLC would have to realign its operations to
conform to FIDP standards. IDLC pricing its products in a manner that will maximize spreads, while maintaining
its competitive position in the market. The company has prescribed procedures for monitoring that includes
equipment inspection to ascertain proper maintenance and tracking of defaults. There is a vigorous program of
dealing with problem accounts. As in the case of other leasing companies, however, IDLC does not monitor the
financial performance and status of clients, thereby mitigating its ability to anticipate account problems before
they arise.
IDLC's asset/liability management guidelines call for maturity matching. For every six-month period, total
payable should not exceed total receivables unless covered by unutilized funding commitments or normally rolled
over bank lines. The weighted maturity of funding instruments should at least equal the weighted maturity of
58



earning assets. An analysis of IDLC's position reveals gapping since the weighted maturity of earning assets is 4
years compared to the weighted maturity of 2.7 years for funding liabilities. To avoid or minimize interest rate
risks, IDLC writes floating rate leases wherever possible. IDLC does not take foreign currency risks.
A local auditing firm, with international affiliation, audits the books of the company. Financial statements
conform with International Accounting Standards. The auditors' opinion on the financial statements has been
unqualified. IDLC uses networks for information access and transmission. The company has a central server for
its network system covering most of the EDP-related work, but there is no system manual since management
considers the software to be at the designing level.
The company's reported earnings up to 1997 reveal satisfactory results, with the rate of return on equity reaching
27%. Consistent with the profitability of the company was the reported collection ratio of 86% and portfolio
infection ratio of 18%. Based on the 1997 financial performance and condition, it appears that IDLC could meet
the FIDP eligibility criteria. However, there are indications of a possible significant deterioration in the 1998
collection and infection ratios. Therefore a definitive evaluation of IDLC's eligibility under FIDP would have to
await the outcome of the 1998 financial audit.
Note: ULC, IPDC and IDLC have been participating financial institutions under IDA's Private Sector Industrial
Credit Project.
