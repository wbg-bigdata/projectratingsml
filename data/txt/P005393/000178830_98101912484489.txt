I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Introduction
1.01      All the basic transportation modes are present in the Moroccan
system: a network of 25,000 km of paved roads, serving a fleet of some
320,000 vehicles; a railway system of 1,760 km connecting the major population
centers; six major ports handling 13 million tons of general cargo imports and
exports per year; and eight major airports and a national airline with both
domestic and international services. The railway and certain ports have a
special purpose role in exporting phosphate, a major source of foreign exchange
and government revenue, while the airports and national airline are particu-
larly geared to promoting tourism, another important foreign exchange earner.
Roads, however, are the dominant mode. They account for about 95% of total
passenger-km and over 80% of freight ton-km excluding phosphate (or 60%
including phosphate). The full breakdown is given in Table 1.1. Total
expenditures on road transportation are estimated at DH 8,000 million (US$2
billion) per year.

B.   Transportation Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.02       In the present climate of fiscal austerity, transportation planning
in Morocco faces two principal issues. Firstly, there is a need for organiza-
tional and managerial changes to improve the productivity of existing facili-
ties and the financial performance of the transport agencies, so that growth



- 2 -
in demand can be met with a minimum of infrastructure. Secondly, the balance
of investments between modes needs to be restored to forestall deterioration
of the road network. The circumstances leading to this situation are as
f ollow s.
1.03       Recent investments in the sector are as shown in Table 1.2.  The
1973-77 Plan was expanded in mid-term to absorb the sudden influx of revenues
from phosphate, whose price was raised from $14 per ton in 1973 to $67 in
1975.  However, when the phosphate price dropped back to $36 in 1976 and $30.5
in 1977, and the phosphate company's contribution to government revenues
dropped from DH 2.7 billion in 1975 to DH 1.0 billion in 1977, the succeeding
plan had to be cut back in 1978 from a five-year period to a three-year
'holding' plan, restricted essentially to the completion of projects already
begun. Large-scale investments underway in ports, shipping and railways could
not easily be cut back.  Road investments, on the other hand, were reduced to
35% of the average level for 1973-77 (in real terms), even though master plan
studies had identified economically justified investments totaling over three
tines the 1973-77 expenditure level. Road maintenance funding under the
current budget has also been seriously eroded. The present project is con-
cerned primarily with this issue.
1.04       The Government's intended strategy for inland transportation has
been to promote its orderly and balanced development, directing traffic where
practicable to the railway. Transportation services are operated variously
by wholly private, wholly government-owned or mixed-capital enterprises on
broadly commercial lines, in a framework of government regulation intended to
insure that individual clients face uniform, fair rates and fares and condi-
tions of carriage and that traffic should use the lowest cost mode. In
general, transportation demand is indeed met with an adequate supply at a
reasonable cost, but there are a number of specific issues of concern to the
Government, particularly the structure of the trucking industry, the railway's
very large deficit, and the productivity of the ports, for which it is seeking
technical assistance under the proposed project in transportation planning and
coordination.
1.05       Responsibility for the transportation system is divided primarily
between the Ministry of Public Works (MPW, "Ministere de l'Equipement et de
la Promotion Nationale"), which is in charge of road and port infrastructure,
and the Ministry of Transportation (MOT) which supervises the railway, civil
aviation, shipping, general cargo port operations, and state-owned bus and
freight-forwarding companies, as well as regulating private road transporta-
tion. The infrastructure plans for both ministries are coordinated by the
Planning Secretariat, attached to the Prime Minister's office. The MOT was
set up in October 1977; many of its functions were previously carried out
by the MPW. Its Transportation Studies, Planning and Coordination Depart-
ment (Planning Department), established initially as a sector-wide planning
unit within the MPW under the Bank's Second Highway Project, is responsible
for intermodal coordination and in particular the collection and distribution
of data on costs and pricing. In 1977-78 it conducted a useful series of
traffic surveys and preliminary cost studies for each mode, and is gaining in
recognition.

C.   Highways
1.06       The road transportation system and network are discussed in Chapter
II.
D.   Railway
1.07       The railway system ("Office National des Chemins de Fer," ONCF) is
operating at a deficit as large in 1978 as the road investment and maintenance
budget combined. As already mentioned, the ONCF plays an essential role in
the phosphate industry; beyond that its role is restricted firstly by its
limited geographical coverage and secondly, by its insufficient financial and
operational autonomy from the central government and the phosphate mining
company, the Office Cherifien des Phosphates. Nine-tenths of the system is
single track. Between Casablanca and Rabat a second track is under construc-
tion, and an additional branch is planned to Jorf Lasfar, the site of a new
phosphate port near El Jadida. The central 40% of the system is electrified;
the remainder uses diesel locomotives.
1.08       Phosphates accounted for 60% of all railway traffic in 1978 (ton-km
and passenger-km combined) and their share is growing. The ONCF operates
an intensive, highly mechanized and efficient service of ore trains into
Casablanca port. General freight (21% of the total) is a different matter,
however. It has lost ground to road freight traffic, remaining virtually
stagnant since 1971 while road freight traffic has grown at an annual average
rate of 8-9%. Average general freight density is somewhat low, while locomo-
tive and wagon performance is poor and has been declining since 1974.
1.09       The ONCF is estimated to make a modest profit on phosphates, serious
losses on general freight (revenues covering only 54% of costs in 1978) and
even worse losses on passengers (revenues covering a mere 30% of allocated
costs). If due allowance is made for depreciation and the cost of capital,
the total deficit in 1978 was US$75 million. Average freight rates are well
below competing truck rates, so offer room for increases to cover costs under
current performance conditons. Passenger fares, on the other hand, are
already as high as bus fares, and buses offer generally faster and more
frequent services, leaving the ONCF little room for maneuver. The railway's
salary scales have remained at or below civil service levels and are uncompe-
titive with the private sector.
1.10       To assist the ONCF in reducing its deficit, MOT's Planning Depart-
ment is to conduct studies of the specific costs of different services, for
which it will need outside assistance, to be provided under the project.
E.   Ports and Shipping
1.11       Morocco's economy relies heavily on foreign trade, and the volumes
handled through the ports are considerable: 9-10 million tons of imports
per year (including 3 million tons of petroleum) and 18-19 million tons of
exports (15-16 million tons of phosphate and 3 million tons of general cargo).
Casablanca has traditionally been the principal port, and handles four-fifths



of the phosphate exports and half the general cargo. Crude oil is brought
in at Mohammedia, just north of Casablanca. There are four other major ports
(Safi, Agadir, Tanger and Kenitra) and ten smaller regional ports. Neither
the Atlantic nor the Mediterranean coastline offer natural harbors; large-
scale facilities are feasible only through the construction of costly break-
waters.
1.12      Port investments under the 1978-80 Development Plan account for
40% of the allocations for transport infrastructure. This is partly because,
whilst the other modes have had to cut back severely on new projects, priority
was given to completing on-going port projects. These include Jorf Lasfar, two
new fishing ports in the south, improved oil-landing facilities at Mohammedia,
and a new port at Nador.
1.13      The productivity of the existing ports is low, and Casablanca is
congested. Since new infrastructure is so costly and there is little room
at Casablanca for expanding inland facilities, the current Plan stresses the
need for managerial and operational improvements. Action to implement this,
however, is complicated by a division of authority in port operations between
civil service agencies that are part of the MPW and autonomous agencies that
are regulated by the MOT. Development of consistent policies regarding
such matters as port accounting and financial self-sufficiency is further
hampered by differences in the responsibilities of these agencies in Morocco's
five major general-cargo ports, due largely to historical accident. The MOT's
Planning Department is proposing to examine the merits of alternative reorga-
nizations.
1.14      Between 1973 and 1977 the Moroccan Government invested over DH 1
billion in building up a national shipping fleet, which now numbers 53 ships.
While this effort should save foreign exchange in the long run, the MOT is now
having to apply pressure on public-sector industries to use Moroccan vessels
for their imports and exports, as the fleet was initially being underutilized.
F.   Civil Aviation
1.15      Tourism is as important a source of foreign exchange for Morocco as
the export of manufactured goods. Air services to bring tourists in from
Europe and airports to receive them are accordingly well developed. The
number of passengers passing through Moroccan airports in 1977 totalled 3
million, 55% of them on international flights. Airport traffie is growing at
about 8% per year. One of the concerns of the MOT's Planning Department is to
assess longer term infrastructure needs.
1.16      The national airline, Royal Air Maroc (RAM), is expanding its
services rapidly and operates to Europe, the Middle East, West Africa, Brazil
and North America. Its traffic grew an average of 15% per year between 1973
and 1977, to reach 1.1 million passengers. The company broke even overall in
1977; profits on international flights were offset by losses on domestic
routes. In 1978, RAM absorbed Royal Air Inter, an uneconomically small
subsidiary company set up in 1970 as a complementary feeder airline.

G.   Previous Projects
1.17      The two previous highway projects, broadly similar in content, have
helped build up the staffing and organization of the agencies responsible
for road construction and maintenance and set up the organizational structure
needed for rational transportation planning and coordination. These two
activities are continuing long-run processes and the proposed project will
constitute the logical next step in their institutional growth and maturity.
The First Highway Project, for which a combined loan and credit totaling $14.6
million equivalent were signed in November 1969 (Loan 642-MOR/Credit 167-MOR),
included construction of one new highway, a program of localized improvements
on selected primary roads, and the purchase of maintenance equipment and spare
parts. The project was completed in a timely way with only minor cost over-
runs. Institutional benefits included the good performance of local con-
tractors, and efficient construction supervision undertaken by Moroccan
engineers of the MPW (see Project Performance Audit Report of April 1977).
1.18      A transportation survey also carried out under the First Highway
Project laid the ground work for the Second Highway Project five years
later, for which a $29 million loan (955-MOR) was signed in January 1974.
This included (a) construction of part of the Casablanca-Rabat expressway;
(b) a further program of localized improvements throughout the country;
(c) renewal and some expansion of maintenance equipment; (d) traffic studies
for Casablanca and Rabat; and (e) technical assistance for setting up a trans-
portation planning office. This project was physically completed in late
1979, but US$0.9. million still remains to be disbursed. Implementation
performance was again good. The local construction industry gained valuable
experience, as local contractors carried out all the civil works competently,
including the first high-standard expressway in Morocco. Cost accounting
methods for road maintenance recommended under the First Project were intro-
duced. The valuable contribution of the transportation planning unit has
already been mentioned (para. 1.05).
1.19      A total of 1650 km of road have been or will be constructed or
improved under six Bank-financed agricultural projects, for a combined loan
amount of $44.9 million (Table 1.3). These works have ranged from widening
and resurfacing of sections of classified roads to construction of unpaved
farm access roads, in support of irrigation and other agricultural development
investments. These roads have sometimes posed problems as to which institu-
tions should be responsible for their construction and maintenance and as
to appropriate design standards. The dialogue between the Government and the
Bank on these issues is continuing.

II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A.   The Network
2.01      Most of the road network is situated in the plain between the
Atlantic Ocean and the Atlas mountain ranges. The much lesser density of
the network between those ranges and in the southern region reflects the
limited potential of those areas.
2.02      Table 2.1 shows the administrative division of the network in
primary (10,200 km), secondary (8,400 km) and tertiary roads (36,600 km).
This division does not always coincide with the distribution of traffic
over the network, since many secondary roads carry heavy traffic as against
some lightly trafficked primary roads, particularly in the southern regions.
The primary roads carry about two-thirds of total traffic, expressed in
vehicle-kms.

2.03      Between 1972 and 1977, the total network increased by 7%.  The
length of paved roads increased by 14% during the same period. Historically,
the network has evolved through gradual upgrading of existing roads rather
than by the construction of new ones. The density of the primary and secondary
network meets presents quantitative demands, but the tertiary network needs
enlarging in some rural areas.
2.04      The geometric design standards of the classified roads are generally
satisfactory. However, for many roads the pavement structures have become
inadequate to carry present traffic. Because of financial constraints in
recent years, the Roads Department (RD-"Direction des Routes") in the MPW has
often had to apply temporary preservation measures like patching and surface
dressing where pavement strengthening through overlays or base reconstructions
would have been required. Also, because of lack of sufficient funding for
road maintenance, the road network has gradually deteriorated, in particular
the tertiary roads. The proposed project is designed to make it possible
for the RD to execute a three and a half year slice of a rational pavement
strengthening program and to reinstate a road maintenance program which will
prevent further deterioration of the network.
B.   Traffic and Road Transportation
2.05      Road deterioration on the Moroccan network is aggravated by the
relatively high traffic volumes compared to many countries with similar per
capita income. The RD's extensive program of regular traffic counts, in
operation since 1964, shows daily traffic averaging about 2,000 vehicles on
primary roads, 800 on secondary and 300 on tertiary roads. Ever since the
1950s, the level of vehicle ownership has been relatively high, and is cur-
rently about 17 vehicles per thousand inhabitants (12 passenger cars). The
vehicle fleet in operation in 1979 is estimated, based on the registration of
new vehicles, at 310,000-320,000 vehicles. European manufacturers have been
assembling vehicles in Morocco for many years. Eight such firms are currently
assembling in all 25,000-35,000 vehicles annually, three-quarters of the total
of 35,000-45,000 new registrations each year. Since 1973, truck traffic
growth has averaged 9% per year, and passenger traffic 5% per year.



2.06      Road-side surveys in 1977 and 1978 under the Second Highway Project
showed a generally efficient utilization of the fleet with regard to annual
distance driven and loading. They showed that buses, mostly privately owned,
carried over half of all intercity passenger traffic. In the freight market,
the surveys confirmed that small trucks (i.e. under 5.5 tons gross vehicle
weight), which ire unregulated, performed a considerably larger share than
large common-carrier trucks, which are regulated, despite their theoretically
higher costs per ton carried.  The MOT believes that small truckers, while
playing an important role in rural areas, have been holding down their costs
by neglect of vehicle maintenance and severe overloading, making their trucks
a significant safety hazard on the road.
2.07      An active debate is now taking place in Morocco on changing truck-
ing regulations, and the MOT is preparing various measures aimed at shifting
freight from smaller to larger trucks and where economical, from trucks to
the railway. The technical assistance requested by the MOT will advise on
this issue, including the economic trade-offs involved in the shift to larger
vehicles: lower operating costs per ton carried against an increase in road
pavement deterioration. It will also foster a continued dialogue on this
issue between the Government and the Bank. To help the MOT's Land Transporta-
tion Department improve its enforcement of proper axle loading, the proposed
project includes the purchase of weighing scales. The necessary legislation
and administrative systems already exist to make these weigh stations effec-
tive.
C.   Administration
2.08      The RD is responsible for the development and maintenance of the
classified network. There is a high degree of delegation to the regions
("arrondissements") in matters of planning, contract awards, and supervision
of works. Each arrondissement is geographically subdivided in an average of
three subdivisions, headed by an engineer (see Organization Chart-Annex I).
The central divisions have an overall planning and coordinating function and
provide guidance to the regions. Unclassified roads of local importance are
administered by the local authorities with financial assistance from the
provincial budget and, if necessary, technical assistance from the RD.
D. Planning
2.09      The Programming Division within the RD is responsible for planning.
A major planning exercise, financed by the Government, was carried out in
1976 by consultants (Sogelerg/Somet-France/Morocco) to establish the scope
for pavement strengthening of the national roads.  The consultants' recom-
mendations were generally followed in preparing the proposed project.
2.10       During the last few years, investments were dictated by the
restrictions in the budget. With the completion of a substantial part of
the Casablanca-Rabat expressway under the Second Highway Project, the con-
struction of new roads has virtually come to a standstill and the RD is
concentrating its planning on the maintenance and pavement strengthening of
existing roads. Planning of tertiary and feeder roads is done in the frame-
work of integrated rural development or agricultural projects.



- 10 -
2.11      Road maintenance planning is mostly based on the immediate needs to
halt the deterioration of already distressed pavements. One of the objectives
of the proposed project is to establish a long-term planning of preventive
maintenance through continuous pavement evaluations (para. 3.19). Economic
evaluation, particularly regarding traffic, plays a large role in establishing
priorities for maintenance.
E.   Financing
2.12      Road investments and maintenance are entirely funded from the
general budget; there are no earmarked funds for roads. As explained in
para. 1.03, the present road investment plan covers the three-year period
from 1978 through 1980. This holding plan represents a cutback from the
last five-year plan; as Table 2.2 shows, the average annual allocation for
road construction and rehabilitation is 35% of that under the 1973-77 plan
in real terms, and even below the 1973 level, before the phosphate boom.

F.   Engineering
2.13      The engineering staff of the RD is generally well-qualified, but is
not sufficient in number and is lacking in practical experience. Because
recently graduated engineers and technicians are immediately posted in the



- il -
higher echelons to fill existing vacancies, this trend will continue for some
time. The gap in middle-level management has partly been filled by experienced
French technical assistance, but has been widened again through the recent
departure of some of the French engineers. Because of its lack of experience,
the RD tends to employ consulting firms even for simple routine work which
elsewhere is normally done by regular staff. The mangement of RD is aware
of this but considers the present situation as an unavoidable transition to
greater self-reliance. To help spread RD's collective experience, staff from
all field offices are regularly brought together to discuss matters of common
interest.
2.14      Local consulting firms sometimes carry out the detailed  engineering
for RD's road projects or cooperate with foreign consultants for feasibility
studies. It may be expected that, as the experience of local consultants
increases over time, their share of work for the RD will also increase.
G.   Construction
2.15      Construction of roads and strengthening of asphalt pavements through
overlays is done through private contractors, often operating as joint ventures
between local and foreign contracting firms. There are about six or seven
firms qualified to carry out major road works and competition between these
firms is strong. Many more firms are capable of executing the strengthening
of crushed stone base courses and asphalt surface dressings. Contracts for
road works are awarded after competitive bidding. The quality of work is
generally good as apparent from the works completed under the previous Bank-
financed road projects. The supervision of construction is normally done
by RD's regional staff, assisted by the semi-private soils and materials
laboratory (Laboratoire Public d'Essais et d'Etudes-LPEE) in Casablanca.
H.   Road Maintenance and Improvement
2.16      Routine road maintenance such as minor pavement repairs, grading
of shoulders, and cleaning of drainage ditches and culverts, is done by
RD's own brigades in the subdivisions. The engineer in charge of a sub-
division plans the work programs and the engineering staff of the arrondisse-
ment is responsible for the overall coordination of the works within its
region.
2.17      Road improvements and periodic maintenance, such as overlays and
surface treatments, are contracted out to private road contracting firms
after competitive bidding. The bidding documents for these works are prepared
by the staff of the arrondissement, which also evaluates the bids and awards
the contracts. Supervision of the works is done by the subdivisions. The
policy of the RD to handle only strict routine operations by its own forces
applies also to maintenance of mechanical equipment. Major repairs or over-
hauls are therefore done by outside specialized workshops and only normal
maintenance and small repair jobs are done by RD mechanics.
2.18      During the last few years, the RD has not had sufficient funds
available for an adequate level of maintenance (Table 2.3).

(Mission estimates for average expenditures per km).
While the total road maintenance allocations have not kept up with increased
costs, equipment repair costs became disproportionately high because of over-
aged equipment. This left less and less funds available for other operational
expenditures and road maintenance has gradually diminished to maintenance of
the primary roads only. Although maintenance of the major roads has been kept
up as well as possible, insufficient maintenance of the secondary and tertiary
roads has led to near isolation of some rural areas and to uneconomically high
transportation costs for most of the tertiary and some of the secondary roads.
However, for 1980, the allocation for the maintenance of primary and secondary
roads has been raised again to the level that existed before the drop in the
phosphate price. The amount for 1980 should enable the RD to carry out an
acceptable maintenance program for the primary and secondary roads.
2.19      The proposed project includes the financing of new mechanical
equipment to replace the obsolete equipment, making it possible to reinstate
the routine maintenance for which RD's field organization was set up originally.
The estimated recurrent costs of executing the maintenance program during the
period mid-1980 to end-1983 (table 3.2) reflect the projected road maintenance
activity if new equipment becomes available. By mid-1983, the level of road
maintenance should be adequate for the primary and secondary roads and the
reinstatement of maintenance of the tertiary roads should begin to gradually
improve the quality of the rural network.
I. Training
2.20      Up to 1974, professional civil engineers were educated abroad, mainly
in France. With the establishment in 1974 of the Ecole Hassania des Travaux
Publics et des Communications in Casablanca, fully qualified engineers are
being trained entirely in Morocco. At the technician level, the Ministry
provides formal education in its institutes in Rabat, Casablanca, Oujda, and



- 13 -
Marrakech. The Vocational Training Department of the MPW is in charge of
post-academic training of MPW staff in general. Within the RD, seminars are
regularly organized to highlight special subjects of interest to its staff
and the soils and materials laboratory of the MPW employs about 20 RD staff
members on a temporary basis to familiarize them with the laboratory's tech-
niques. Training of equipment operators and mechanics is done through
refresher courses organized by the RD.
2.21      The RD attaches great importance to in house training for its less
experienced staff and is confident that, in general, it is able to handle
training without outside assistance. However, it has identified the need for
an outside expert to determine manpower requirements for, and to review its
present training of staff in charge of, the management and operation of RD's
fleet of heavy equipment. To this end, the project includes the financing of
about nine man/months for an expert in this field (para. 3.10).
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives
3.01      The proposed project will help the Government to continue the insti-
tution building process started under the First and Second Highway Projects.
It conforms to the Government's policy, reinforced under the current austerity
program, of protecting its past investments in the highway sector, rather than
constructing new roads. To this end, the project will help to:
(i) bring into operation a rational system of road maintenance, includ-
ing the maintenance of secondary and tertiary roads;
(ii) establish and partly execute a long-term program for pavement
strengthening and preservation;
(iii) improve the capability of the RD to manage its road maintenance
operations; and
(iv) strengthen transport policy recommendations by the Ministry of
Transport and help in their implementation.
B.   Description
3.02      The proposed project would consist of:
(i)  a three and a half-year time slice of a pavement strengthen
ing and preservation program;
(ii) a three and a half-year time slice of RD's road maintenance
program for the classified highway network, including the
renewal of mechanical equipment;



- 14 -
(iii)  assistance to the RD through:  (a) providing experts in cost
accounting of routine maintenance operations, in road mainte-
nance equipment management, and in training of personnel in
charge of road maintenance equipment (totalling 23 man-months
of consultants' services); (b) financing of laboratory equip-
ment for a pavement evaluation center; and (c) providing
advisory services by the soils and materials laboratory,
including those of pavement design experts, in preparing the
pavement strengthening and preservation program; and
(iv)  assistance to the MOT by providing:  (a) consultants' services in
transport planning and economics (totalling 64 man-months); and
(b) weighing scales to check vehicle axle loading.
Pavement Strengthening and Preservation
3.03       In 1976, the RD commissioned and financed a study by consultants
Sogelerg/Somet (France/Morocco) on pavement strengthening, resulting in
recommendations for a five-year pavement rehabilitation and strengthening
program, involving about 3,400 km of roads and costing US$117 million at 1976
prices. Because of budget restrictions since 1978, only a modest beginning
has been made with the execution of the strengthening program.
3.04      The consultants' recommendations were used as a guideline in prepar-
ing the proposed project, taking into consideration some pavement works that
have been carried out since the study and the continued deterioration of the
network in general. As a first step in the realization of a longer-term
program, about 700 km of pavement strengthening and about 1,000 km of preser-
vation are included in the project. The work will generally consist of apply-
ing asphaltic concrete overlays to strengthen existing asphalt pavements and
of preserving the existing road surfaces through surface dressing. In some
cases, existing roads will also be widened. Where appropriate, a road may be
strengthened by adding another layer of crushed stone base course, instead of
an asphaltic concrete overlay.
3.05      The road sections to be treated will be selected from the consul-
tants' list (Annex II) on the basis of technical and economic considerations.
The selection for the first year of execution of the pavement strengthening
program (280 km) has been made on the basis of visual inspections and pavement
deflection measurements by the soils and materials laboratory. The program
for the remaining years will be finalized from mid-1980 to end 1981. The
program for surface dressing will be established in conjunction with that for
strengthening. Depending on the outcome of engineering and economic studies
and on the ultimate costs of the works, the total length to be treated under
the project may differ from the presently estimated 1,700 km.
Routine Highway Maintenance
3.06      Under the First and Second Highway Projects, the Bank's financing
of mechnical equipment has helped the RD to improve its ability to under-
take routine maintenance works. However, the lack of sufficient funds



- 15 -
forced the RD to concentrate its road maintenance mainly on the primary roads,
while decreasing the maintenance of the secondary and tertiary roads (para.
2.18). Under the proposed project, the RD will continue to maintain its
primary network and it will expand the maintenance of the secondary and
tertiary roads.
3.07      In ratio with the deliveries of new equipment to be financed under
the project, RD's road maintenance will gradually improve over the project
period. The new equipment is to be purchased in two lots and ail of the new
equipment should be available on site by early 1983. When fully implemented,
the road maintenance program will include the routine maintenance of all of
the primary, secondary and tertiary paved roads, totalling about 25,000 km.
Maintenance of the unpaved roads and tracks, totalling about 31,000 km, is not
included in the program, but will be done on a selective basis as the need
arises. Periodic maintenance will include surface dressing at eight year
intervals of the paved primary roads, at nine year intervals of the paved
secondary and at 12 year intervals of the paved tertiary roads.
3.08      The proposed loan includes US$8.1 million equivalent for the
financing of road maintenance equipment. Delivery of the first lot will be
completed by late 1981 and of the second lot by late 1982. This time frame
should facilitate the transition to unfamiliar equipment for operators and
maintenance mechanics. The mechanical equipment to be procured under the
project (Annex III) was established in consultation with the RD and reflects
the minimum equipment requirements for the implementation of the road main-
tenance program up to late-1983. Since all the major manufacturers of road
maintenance equipment are well represented in Morocco, spare parts are not
included in the project.
Assistance to RD
3.09      The RD has requested that technical assistance by consultants be
included in the project to help improve the quality of its highway maintenance
operations and to strengthen its planning and budgeting capability in the area
of highway maintenance (total 23 man-months).
3.10      In total, the consultants will provide the RD with:
Man-Months
1    cost accountant to analyze the present methods of
cost accounting and to advise on improvements to be
made                                                         5
1    expert to help develop procedures for the
maintenance of heavy equipment                               9
1    expert to assist in determining manpower require-
ments for personnel in charge of highway mainte-
nance equipment and to advise on the most suitable
training methods for staff to operate and maintain
this equipment                                               9

3.11      To prepare the engineering for the pavement strengthening and
preservation program and to provide quality control of the pavement works, the
RD needs the services of the soils and materials laboratory in Casablanca for
the carrying out of tests on soils and materials and of pavement deflection
tests. In addition, the laboratory will, for the duration of its contract
with the RD, provide advisory services of two experienced pavement design and
maintenance specialists. They will assist the RD in the evaluation of the
laboratory results and in the selection of road sections to be included in the
strengthening and preservation program. The cost of the laboratory services
for the first year of the program are entirely financed by the RD. At RD's
request, the foreign cost of the services for the remaining years of the
program are to be financed from the proposed loan.
3.12      The Belgian Government has agreed to assist the RD in setting up a
pavement evaluation center (Centre d'Auscultation des Chaussees). The Belgian
National Road Research Center will help establish a highway data bank and it
will assist in training Moroccan staff to man the new center. It will also
advise the RD which type of equipment to purchase for the center.
3.13       Since the Belgian assistance will not provide for the financing of
non-Belgian equipment, the RD has requested the Bank to include this equipment
(Annex IV) in the proposed project. Because of the importance of the new
center for the preparation of a long-term pavement strengthening program, a
total amount of US$0.7 million (excluding price contingencies), representing
the foreign cost of this equipment, has been included in the proposed loan.
Assistance to MOT
3.14       Since its inception in 1977, the MOT's Planning Department has
concentrated on the collection of necessary data for transport planning. The
Department now wishes to make use of the data and develop concrete policy
recommendations for land, air, maritime and urban transport. To assist the
Department in its work, the MOT has requested the inclusion in the proposed
project of the services of a team of consultants, comprising:
Man-Months
1    team leader and coordinator                      24
4    experts for each of the transport modes
(land, air, maritime, and urban) 4 X 10 =    40
64
3.15      The Moroccan authorities intend to intensify the enforcement of the
legal maximum axle loads (para. 2.07). Because of the damage to the pavements
by over-loaded vehicles, more intense checks on overloading by roving enforce-
ment units is also strongly supported by the RD. To this end, the following
equipment has been included in the proposed project:
10 mobile weighing scales, inclusive of displays and power; and
4 fixed weighing stations



- 17 -
3.16      The MOT will be responsible for organizing and operating of the
control system. The fixed stations will be centered around Casablanca, which
is the origin or destination of about one-third of total freight traffic by
road in the country. The mobile stations will be used by regional offices
throughout the country.
C.   Engineering
3.17       Engineering for the project involves mainly the evaluation of exist-
ing pavements and the design of pavement overlays. Some sections will be
widened and some drainage work may have to be carried out, but the engineering
for this type of works is minimal. Engineering for approximately 280 km of
roads, selected for the first year of the strengthening and preservation
program has been carried out by the RD, in cooperation with the soils and
materials laboratory. The economic work and the engineering for the remainder
of the program will be finalized between mid-1980 and late 1981, well enough
ahead of the bid invitations for these works, but also not so early as to
overlook any pavement deterioration that may occur after the engineering is
completed.
3.18      The methodology for the selection of road sections to be included
in the pavement strengthening and preservation program was agreed upon during
appraisal and confirmed during negotiations (Annex VIII). The criteria for
Bank approval of subprojects will be that (i) the economic return of the
investment exceeds the opportunity cost of capital in Morocco; and (ii) the
first-year benefit/cost ratio equals or exceeds the opportunity cost of
capital. The application of the above criteria and the procedures for Bank
approval were confirmed with the Government during negotiations, and it was
agreed that a satisfactory economic and technical evaluation will be submitted
to the Bank before bids for the pavement works are to be invited.
3.19       In cooperation with the consultants provided under the project, the
RD is to establish the framework for a long-term pavement management system.
Under such a system, engineering for pavement strengthening will in future be
carried out as part of the continuous monitoring of the performance of the
existing pavements. This will, over time, improve the basis for establishing
the annual pavement strengthening and road maintenance programs.
D.   Cost Estimates
3.20       The total capital cost of the project is estimated  at US$94.3
million, including a foreign exchange cost of US$62.0 (Table 3.1). The
pavement strengthening and preservation program aims at completing about 1,700
km of roads. However, the ultimate length to be completed under the project
may be more or less than the presently estimated 1,700 km, depending on the
average cost per km over the total three and a half-year period. Since
the other project items are well defined, the cost estimate does not include
a contingency for quantity increases. The contingency for price increases
in both foreign and local currency amounts to 12% for 1979, 10.5% for 1980,
9% for 1981, 8% for 1982 and 7% for 1983.

3.21      The recurrent costs to be incurred during the three and a half-year
project period are estimated at US$104.7 million (Table 3.2). The cost of the
various maintenance operations is based on prices developed in a consultants'
study of 1971 and on recent actual cost figures for surface dressing, all
updated to mid-1979. In real terms, the recurrent budget during the project
periods would he about equal to the 1975 budget, before the onset of the
budgetary constraints. The total of the capital and recurrent costs for the
overall program amounts to US$199.0 million (Table 3.3). During loan negotia-
tions, all cost estimates were reviewed and confirmed with Government.
3.22      The estimated capital cost of the three and a half-year program for
pavement strengthening and preservation is derived from the estimate of the
average cost per km of the first-year program (DH 285,000/km), extrapolated
over the 700 km of the three and a half-year program slice and of the recent
costs for surface dressing. It assumes that all contracts will be won by
domestic contractors or joint-ventures of domestic and foreign contractors.
3.23      The estimate for road maintenance equipment is based on past offers
by manufacturers, updated for the effect of price increases (Annex III). The
foreign costs of equipment for the pavement evaluation center is shown in
Annex IV.
3.24      The estimates for technical assistance (Annex V), including the
services of the soils and materials laboratory, reflect actual costs in the
past for similar activities, updated to mid-1979. The average foreign cost of
technical assistance per man-month, including the cost of transportation to
and from the consultants' home office and the per diem in Morocco, is about
US$7,400 for the RD and about US$8,900 for the MOT. These amounts reflect the
costs of recruitment on a world-wide geographical basis in the 1979 base
year.
3.25      The estimate of the foreign cost of the weighing scales for the MOT
is shown in Annex VI.
E.   Financing
3.26      The proposed loan of US$62 million would finance 100% of the foreign
capital expenditures of the project (Table 3.3). The Government's contribu-
tion to the capital cost would amount to DH 122.9 million (US$32.3 million
equivalent). In addition to the local capital costs, the Government would
contribute DH 397 million (US$104.7 million), representing the recurrent
budget expenditures for implementing the three and a half-year slice of the
periodic and routine road maintenance program.
3.27      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained that Government
will provide all of the capital costs not covered by the proposed loan, and
ail of the recurrent budget expenditures needed for the execution of the
project.

F.   Implementation
3.28      The RD and the MOT will be responsible for executing their respec-
tive project components. The former's staff in the arrondissements will
invite bids from contractors for the pavement works and will also supervise
their execution. The procurement of highway maintenance equipment and the
technical assistance in the area of highway maintenance will be handled by the
Road Maintenance Division in RD's head office. The Technical Division in the
RD will be responsible for the procurement of equipment for the pavement
evaluation center and will coordinate and supervise the advisory services by
the road laboratory. During negotiations, agreement was reached with Govern-
ment that the pavement strengthening and road maintenance program will be
carried out in accordance with an overall action plan as agreed between the RD
and the Bank. The action plan will be updated through annual programs which
will be submitted to the Bank for review and comments.
3.29      The MOT will directly supervise the work of the technical assistance
team for transportation matters. Similar arrangements for technical assis-
tance to MOT under the Second Highway Project worked out satisfactorily. The
MOT will also be responsible for the selection and procurement of suitable
weighing scales. The timetable for project implementation is given in Annex
vII.
G.   Procurement
3.30      Contracts for the pavement works, for highway maintenance equipment
and for the weighing scales will be awarded after international competitive
bidding according to the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement." Bids for the
equipment for the pavement evaluation center will be directly invited from
a group of potential suppliers (Limited International Tendering), since the
number of suppliers for this very specialized type of equipment is limited.
The technical assistance will be provided by qualified and experienced special-
ists on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The services by the
soils and materials laboratory in Casablanca will be governed by a negotiated
contract, acceptable to the Bank.
3.31      A general announcement for the pavement works will be made in
"Development Forum," the local press, and to local representatives of the
Bank's member countries and of Switzerland. Because it is unlikely that
foreign contractors will be interested in executing the relatively minor
pavement works, the invitation for specific bids will be made only through the
local press and by direct notification to representatives of member countries
that are potential suppliers of the works required. To make bidding more
attractive for foreign and for local bidders, the pavement contracts will, as
much as possible and wherever practical, be combined into larger lots and
contractors will be allowed to bid for one or more lots, separately or in
combination. Because of the presence of six or seven locally established
pavement contractors, it is unlikely that a foreign contractor will win a
bid.



- 23 -
3.32      The bid invitation for highway maintenance equipment and weighing
scales will be announced in "Development Forum," the local press, and a copy
of the invitation will also be sent to the local representatives of the Bank's
member countries and Switzerland.
3.33      It is the Government's practice to supply bitumen free of charge
to contractors, carrying out works for the RD. The Government procures
the country's bitumen requirements through large scale bulk purchase contracts
with Seblima, a semi-government organization which functions as the sole
supplier of bitumen in Morocco. In its turn, Seblima procures the bitumen
through bilateral agreements between the Government and the country of origin,
lately Iraq. The RD, among other users of bitumen, is represented in the
committee which sets the price of the bitumen. The arrangement of bitumen
procurement through Seblima is considered to be economic and efficient and
ensures that the cost to the RD and other users is reasonable.
H.   Disbursements
3.34      The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed as follows:
% of Expenditures
Category            US$ Million                to be financed
(1)  Civil works                 45.00                   65% of total costs
(2)  Equipment                   10.45                   100% of foreign costs,
or, if procured domesti-
cally, 73% of total
expenditures.
(3)  Consultant's Services        0.85                  85% of total cost
(4)  Road Laboratory Services   0.30                    70% of total cost
(5)  Unallocated                  5.40
TOTAL                        62.00
3.35      For the civil works, the Bank will disburse on the basis of 65% of
the total costs, including the cost of bitumen.  However, the contract price
and consequently the monthly certificates on which the monthly payments to the
contractor are based, are exclusive of the cost of bitumen (para. 3.33). For
loan disbursements, the cost of the bitumen, as substantiated through certif-
ication by Seblima and the contractor, will therefore be added to the monthly
payment certificates.
3.36      For domestically procured equipment (Category 2) 73% of total
expenditures represent the estimated C.I.F. value of major imported items.
Disbursement of 70% of the total cost of the road laboratory's services repre-
sents the estimated foreign exchange component of these services.
3.37      The following disbursement schedule was confirmed with Government
during negotiations. Because of the open-ended nature of the pavement
strengthening program, any remaining funds can be used for Category 1. Any
balance remaining in the loan account after the Closing Date would therefore
be cancelled.

I.   Environmental Impact
3.38      The pavement strengthening will not detrimentally affect the environ-
ment. The improved maintenance of secondary and tertiary roads will enhance
the reliability of access to markets, schools and medical facilities and thus
improve the rural environment.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01       Unless the present downward trend in road maintenance and resurfacing
expenditures is reversed, the condition of the network will continue to
deteriorate. This would raise transport costs and reduce the accessibility of
remoter parts of the country and burden the Government with costly reconstruc-
tion works at a later date. The proposed programs of resurfacing and pavement
strengthening and improved maintenance will pay for themselves many times over
through the avoidance of accelerated wear and tear on road vehicles and



- 25 -
expensive road reconstruction. The overall economic return (ER) is estimated
at over 50%, consisting of 47% on the first batch of pavement works and 40-50%
on the remainder, and well over 50% on the maintenance improvements. The
benefit-cost ratio is over 4 to 1. The timing of these outlays is appro-
priate, as the benefits in the first year after implementation will exceed the
opportunity cost of the capital invested. The benefits will be widely distri-
buted geographically; about 55% of the operating cost savings will accrue to
truckers, 40% to passenger car owners and 5% to bus operators. Given the
regular revisions to public carrier rates and fares, it is reasonable to
expect that the operating benefits will be passed on to the general public
within one to two years through slower increases in rates than would otherwise
occur.
B.  Pavement Strengthening
4.02      As mentioned in paras. 3.03-3.05, the RD selected the sections to
be resurfaced from the five-year program prepared in 1976 by Sogelerg/Somet
(consultants) as part of their National Roads Master Plan. The RD selected
the first batch of sections totalling 280 km on the basis of the economic
evaluation described below. The remainder of the strengthening program will
be similarly selected during 1980 using the same methodology. The agreed
guidelines for the economic evaluation are attached as Annex VIII.
4.03      The evaluation methodology is adapted from the pavement maintenance
model being developed by the Bank, the British Transport and Road Research
Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, based on research
in Kenya and elsewhere. This involves relating vehicle operating costs (VOCs)
to a road's surface condition and comparing:
(a) the high and worsening VOCs projected on a road if it is
not strengthened and the high maintenance cost required
to prevent the road from completely breaking up; with
(b) the lower VOCs and maintenance costs on the road if it is
strengthened.
For this project it was also postulated that in the absence of an overlay,
reconstruction would be required at the end of the evaluation period to restore
the road to a condition comparable to that in the with-overlay case. The eval-
uation was carried out by personnel of the RD in coordination with Bank staff.
The approach and results are summarized below; details may be found in the
project file.
4.04      The composition and thickness of the proposed overlays were deter-
mined on engineering grounds on the basis of subsoil conditions, deflection
measurements, visual inspections of surface condition, and predicted traffic,
with each section being assigned one of six standard designs from the Moroccan
pavement design manual. Based on engineering judgement, the evaluation period
was set at 10 years. The pattern of surface deterioration without strengthen-
ing was assumed to go from medium-poor to very poor in most cases, or from
very poor to breaking up in extreme cases, while the pattern with strengthening



- 26 -
would be excellent declining to medium with asphalt concrete overlays and
good declining to medium-poor with surface treatments.
4.05      The National Roads Master Plan provided forecasts of long-run
traffic growth differentiated according to the economic prospects of the main
regions. They range from 4% to 9% per year. Most of the sections in the
first batch to be strengthened already carry over 2,000 vehicles per day.
4.06      The average difference in VOCs on an excellent paved road and a
poor paved road is estimated, in economic cost terms, at 2.6 USe per km. This
is 12% of total VOCs in ideal conditions or 10% of total VOCs in average con-
ditions.  The calculation of the unit saving is in the Project File.
4.07      The results (Table 4.1) show ERs on the first-year strengthening
program ranging from 20% to over 100%, with an overall ER of 47% (benefit-cost
ratio discounting at 10% of 4.0 to 1). The first-year benefit ratios range
from 11% to over 100%, averaging 35%. The overlays' economic justification is
not sensitive to reasonable margins of error in the estimates of costs and
benefits. A 20% increase in costs, which is extreme given the technical
simplicity of the works, would lower the overall ER to 40% (B/C ratio of 3.4),
and on the least profitable link to 17%. If benefits turned out 20% less than
estimated, a reasonable margin of uncertainty, the overall ER would be similarly
reduced to 39%, and on the least profitable link to 16%. In the unlikely
event of a combination of these errors, the overall ER would be 35% and that
on the least profitable link 13%. With the best estimate of overlay costs,
savings in VOCs would have to turn out more than 45% lower than their best
estimate to yield a return of less than 10% on the least profitable link.
C.   Improved Routine and Periodic Maintenance Program
4.08      The proposed improved road maintenance program will benefit both
the Government and road users. The equipment and service vehicles to be
purchased under the project will replace aging equipment suffering uneconomi-
cally high levels of down-time and provide greater mobility and better supervi-
sion for maintenance crews. Supported by the technical assistance, they will
thereby increase the productivity, frequency and quality of maintenance
operations. Ditches and culverts will be cleaned and shoulders on paved roads
repaired and reshaped more often, and potholes will be patched and localized
pavement failures resurfaced more promptly. Cracked pavements will be resur-
faced sooner, forestalling damage from water penetration. These activities
will extend the life of the pavements, avoid vehicle wear and tear increases
that would otherwise occur, particularly on narrow and low-standard roads, and
reduce the frequency of severity of road closures due to floods.

4.09      The planned annual maintenance budget during the project period
exceeds the 1979 level by some DH 30 million in constant prices, an increase
of about 40%. The increase in effective output will be even greater, thanks
to the higher productivity of the new equipment. To assess the economic
return on this program, only an order of magnitude estimate is possible.
Annual vehicle operating costs on the total network are estimated at about
DH 6 billion without tax, so that the incremental maintenance expenditure
would pay for itself if VOCs are reduced by no more than half of 1%. Expe-
rience with similar works indicates VOC savings of 3-5% within five years, six
to ten times the outlay each year.
D.   Technical Assistance and Weighing Scales for the MOT
4.10      The technical assistance to the MOT is aimed at increasing the
sectorts long-run productivity. The weighing scales, by deterring violations
of the 13-ton axle load limit, should cut down on damage to road pavements
and, by reducing overloading of smaller trucks beyond their safe physical
capacity, should bring down the number of accidents. Though precise estimates
of these benefits are not possible, the cost of both the technical assistance
and the scales is very small compared to that of the activities on which they
are expected to have an impact.
E.   Project Risk
4.11      There is a risk that the liquidity crisis in Morocco will prevent
the Government from providing local funds on the agreed scale, particularly
for the import of fuel and bituminous materials not covered by the loan. As
a safeguard against such a contingency, the annual review by the Bank of the
Government's proposed maintenance program and budget for the following year
(para. 3.28) will focus on keeping a technically and economically sound
balance in the program in the event any departure from the three-year program
agreed upon during negotiations proves unavoidable. The planned pavement
works are easily divisible, so that any cut-back would not harm the economic
justification of the remaining works; but if any cuts were proposed, the
Government would be reminded of the substantial benefits foregone and the
higher rehabilitation costs that would be incurred in the future.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During Loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal matters:
(i) before bids for pavement works under the project are
invited, the RD will provide the Bank with a satis-
factory economic and technical evaluation (para. 3.18);
and



- 29 -
(ii)  the RD will carry out the pavement strengthening and
road maintenance program in accordance with an action
plan as agreed with the Bank. Annual programs, con-
sistent with the action plan, will be submitted to the
Bank for its review and comments (para. 3.28).
5.02       The proposed project is suitable for an IBRD loan of US$62 million
to the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco. The loan should be on the
&&.bdared terms of 19 years, including a 4-year grace period.

THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
METHCJDLOGY FOR JUSTIFICATION OF PAVEMENT STRENGTHENING ON
INDIVIDUAL ROAD SECTIONS
I. Introduction
1.        Technical and economic studies will be prepared by the Government
for each road section proposed for pavement strengthening and rehabilitation
under the project. The Government will submit these studies to the Bank for
approval before calling for bids. The basic requirements for such studies
and the methodology for making the economic evaluation are outlined below.
Il. Basic Requirements for Feasibility Studies
2.        The studies shall include sufficient basic data for the Bank to
make a meaningful review and a duplication of the calculations. This should
include:
(i) a description of each road section: location, length, present
condition, pavement structure, geometric characteristics, deflec-
tion measurements, soil tests, age, and number of years since
latest overlay or rehabilitation;
(ii) a description of the proposed alternative pavement strengthening
and rehabilitation works: overlay or new pavement structure,
shoulder reconstruction; drainage, realignment, widening, and
other rehabilitation works;
(iii)  traffic data by vehicle type:  present traffic, expected traffic
growth, axle load data and trend;
(iv) unit costs and total costs of any improvement elements, with and
without taxes and subsidies, and breakdown in local and foreign
exchange costs;
(v) data on basic motor vehicle user costs: basis on which they were
developed, and operating costs for typical vehicles; and
(vi) current and estimated future road maintenance costs of the road
section.

Page 2
3.        In addition to the technical and economic documentation, the study
shall comprise in annex: all information needed to make the analysis meaning-
ful; details about the pavement thickness calculations, technical surveys on
which the proposed rehabilitation works are based, and if available, bidding
documents, description of proposed bidding procedures, etc.
III. Economic Evaluation
4.        The determination of the economic viability of an investment
requires basically three steps: first, the analysis of possible alternative
improvements; second, the choice of the least cost alternative; and third,
the choice of sections for inclusion in a limited budget.
A.   Alternatives
5.        The economic evaluation of investments requires the analysis of
possible alternative improvements. For pavement strengthening, with or
without other rehabilitation works, the following alternatives could be
considered:
(i) do nothing, defined as continuing at the present level of main-
tenance;
(ii) increase patching;
(iii) increase the frequency of surface treatments;
(iv) construct an overlay to meet traffic requirements for a 5- and/or
10-year period;
(v) widen and/or realign sections of the road combined with 5- and/or
10-year overlays;
(vi) rehabilitate a substantial part of the road combined with 5- and
10-year overlays; and
(vii) construct a new road.
6.        All reasonable or reasonably possible solutions should be considered
unless certain simplifying assumptions are warranted. Not all need to be
evaluated in detail, however. Some can be eliminated after a cursory exami-
nation if, for instance, they would involve the utilization of significantly
greater amounts of economic resources than would an overlay, without any
proportionate increase in benefits. The readily identifiable "do nothing"
alternative must always be considered, while other alternatives sometimes can
be omitted; for instance, if pavement strengthening is technically essential
for the roadway to remain serviceable, then increased patching or more fre-
quent surface treatments can be eliminated, at an early stage, from further
consideration.

Page 3
B.   Economic Costs and Benefits
7.        After the possible alternatives have been defined, their economic
costs have to be compared to arrive at the least cost alternatives. These
costs fall into three categories. The first is the direct investment (design,
construction, supervision, etc.), the second is the maintenance cost and the
third, user costs. The least present value of total cost will determine the
preferred alternative.
8.        The total cost must be examined in terms of the network and take
account of costs to traffic and costs on alternative routes (maintenance cost
increases or decreases) where traffic is diverted to and from. This is
because we are not always comparing the same traffic when comparing alter-
natives. The "do nothing" alternative could involve, as road serviceability
further deteriorates, traffic diverting to other roads, or disappear as costs
rise above various transport demand cost thresholds. The "rehabilitation"
alternatives may involve traffic diverted to the improved section and even
generated traffic.
9.        Maintenance cost, also, will vary substantially from one alternative
to another. In a "do nothing",alternative for pavement strengthening projects,
it should be assumed that routine and periodic maintenance (patching, surface
dressing, etc.) will increase rapidly Ôver the period of the analysis. (In
the absence of more reliable data, the total of maintenance outlays during
the period of analysis may be assumed equal to the cost of the corresponding
overlay). This is to avoid having user costs increase beyond transport demand
cost thresholds, and result in diversion of a substantial part of traffic.
10.       The next step is to evaluate the benefits which can be expected to
accrue from the various alternative improvements. Benefits for this type of
improvements are generally measured as savings in wear and tear on vehicles
and in stepped-up maintenance costs which would be necessary to maintain an
acceptable serviceability level. Traffic diversion, as the road deteriorates,
are to be accounted for.
IV. Other Improvements
11.       In those cases where significant improvements such as widening,
realignment or even reconstruction of some road sections are proposed for
inclusion with the basic pavement strengthening, the improvements must also
be subject to the test of economic justification, incrementally over and above
the basic pavement strengthening. To establish this, additional costs for
other rehabilitation works have to be compared with the incremental benefits
accruing from them. If the present value of the incremental benefits exceeds
the incremental costs at a discount rate equal to the opportunity cost
of capital, the proposed rehabilitation works are justified, and should be
incorporated in the project which may then be analyzed as an entity.

V. Comparison of Results
12.       The most profitable alternative should be selected using the net
present valu-, discounted at the opportunity cost of capital; unless there
are arguments to the contrary, this should be taken as 10%. The different
sections should then be ranked according to their economic return, starting
with the highest and working down, and showing the cumulative investment cost
with each section added.
13.       The final tabulation of results should also show the benefit/cost
ratio of the preferred alternative discounted at the opportunity cost of
capital, and its first-year benefits ratio.
