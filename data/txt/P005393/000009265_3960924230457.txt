PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1830-MOR)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report describes the preparation and
implementation of the Third Highway Project in Morocco, for which
Loan 1830-MOR in the amount of US$62 million was signed on May 19, 1980.
The loan became effective on September 19, 1980 and was to have been closed
by June 30, 1984. Two extensions brought the Loan Closing Date to
December 31, 1985. US$4.8 million of the loan was cancelled on May 3,
1985. The accounting books were closed on September 30, 1986, with a
surplus of US$4.3 million, which was also cancelled. The amount of the
loan that was utilized, therefore, was US$52.9 million.
This report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North
Africa Projects Department. It is based on information derived from the
files in the EMENA Information Center, supervisions missions, and a Project
Completion Report prepared by the Roads and Traffic Directorate of the
Kingdom of Morocco.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Copies of the draft report were sent to the Borrower for comment. The
Government reviewed the report and made observations regarding pavement.
evaluation and road maintenance equipment procured under the project (Annex 6).
The PCR has been changed to reflect the Government's observations.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1830-MOR)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The Third Highway Project was a road strengthening and maintenance
project. Its objective was to continue the institution building process
begun under the First and Second Highway Projects, while establishing a
long-term road maintenance and pavement strengthening program, based on
systematic application of technical and economic criteria. The project was
specifically designed to launch the pavement strengthening and preservation
program, to rationalize road maintenance operations and to strengthen
transport policy and planning. These were to be achieved through:
(a)  strengthening of 700 km of road sections and iesurfacing of
1,000 km of road sections;
(b)  acquisition of equipment for routine maintenance of
classified road network and for pavement evaluation;
(c)  strengthening of cost accounting of routine maintenance
operations, management of road maintenance equipment, and
training of road maintenance personnel;
(d)  development and implementation of recommmendations leading to
improved transportation planning and coordination; and
(e)  provision of mobile weighing scales and fixed weighing
stations to intensify enforcement of legal maximum axle loads.
Although these actions were not completed exactly as planned, the changes
that were made fully reflected subsector objectives and priorities set by
the Governmert.
2.       The project was completed two years behind schedule.  The
Government's difficult budgetary situation and insufficient liquidity since
the early 1980s slowed down the execution of ongoing civil works and led to
a postponement of new commitments. This culminated in two extensions of



(v)
the Loan Closing Datte, it;1  u Julit- 30, 1485, and thern to December 31,
1985.  To allow the PBrrowe.r lime ti tuinish fiinal withdrawal applications
for eligible expenditute!,  ht.I: Liut A ciunt was kept open uitLil
September 30, 1986.
3.       The actual prolec t cos-.t  ,,Is ,ibnult us$83 million.  This was
US$11 million (14%) below 1;pp,isal estimat.s.  However, in local currency,
total expendittare inci-2as,:J troum [dl 3'9 million to DH b33 million (76%).
This was caused hy a shar- rise in IJ: dollar paritv of the Dirham together
with an extension in tlre s eope ot the project to include an additional 400
km of road strengthleninlg, t:quipiclnt, and studies.
4.       Under this Third Project, institntion building would focus on
maintenance management capability, and transportation planning and
coordination. Instead of the direct technical assistance to the Roads and
Traffic Directorate of the Ministry ot Public Works, the Bank agreed to
finance a study on road maintenlance reorganization to strengthen the
management of maintenance operations.  Another project-supported study drew
attention to a number of issues relating to transportation planning and
coordination to be addressed in the future. Acquisition of pavement
evaluation equipment provided the permanenIt capacity to carry out extensive
_-easurements of pavement roughness and deflection under different traffic
volumes and pavement structural indices.
5.       The project objectives have been largely accomplished.  Points of
particular interest highlighted in tle project completion report are:
-   The comprehensive study on road maintenance reorganization
that made substantial recommendations for improving the
efficiency and productivity of road maintenance operations,
which are being implemented (para. 4.09-4.10).
-   The introduction of portable weighing scales that led to
implementation of axle-load control (para. 4.13).
-   The pavemenlt strenigthening and preservation component that
contributed measurably to the country's road conservation
objectives.  Without it, many sections of the main road
network would have deteriorated beyond repair as a result of
heavy traffic (para. 7.04).
-   Bank help to the Government of Morocco to find ways to
streamline the processing of contract awards and withdrawal
applications (para. 8.01).



KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1830-MOR)
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.01     Morocco thas a population of about 21 million growing at an annual
rate of 2.5%. The 1985 per capita GNP was estimated at US$570 at the
official exchange rate (US$1   DH 10).  The economy underwent a brief
period of accelerated growth in the 1970s when the GNP grew at an annual
rate of 6-7%. However, heavy external borrowing to finance large
infrastructure investments of low economic priority proved unsustainable
when world phosphate prices declined in the 1980s. The 1981-85 Development
Plan proposed substantial increases in transport investments over the two
previous Plans. But in 1983 the Government reexamined its public
investment program and determined that cancellation of some investments and
a slowdown in the implementation of other programs would be necessary to
meet budgetary constraints.
1.02     Most of the road network is situated in the plain between the
Atlantic Ocean and the Atlas mountain ranges. In 1985, it consisted of
60,000 km, including 26,500 km of paved roads, an increase of 7% over
1980. Although the design standards of the classified roads are
satisfactory, the pavement structure for many roads cannot accommodate the
present traffic distribution. For example, about 90% of the heavy trucks
are concentrated on 10% of the network. About 20% of the total paved
network is in good condition, 45% in average condition, and 35% in poor
condition.
1.03     The Roads and Traffic Directoiate (RTD) oI the the Ministry of
Public Works (MPW) is responsible for the design, construction, and
maintenance of the classified road network. In late 1982, road maintenance
operations were decentralized. District offices were delegated
substantially more reponsibility for contract awards and administration,
and supervision of works. Unclassified roads are administered by the local
authorities with financial assistance from provincial budgets and, whenever
necessary, technical assistance from RTD.
1.04     Under the First and Second Highway Projects, Bank financing of
mechanical equipment helped RTD improve its ability to execute routine
maintenance works. However, available funds barely enabled it to support
maintenance of primary roads. Under the Third Project, RTD would step up
maintenance of the primary network, while further expanding maintenance of
the secondary and tertiary networks.

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION PREPARATION, APPRAISAL, AND NEGOTIATIONS
A. Origin
2.01     Whell the Second Highway Project was approved in 1973, the country
was enjoying a plentiful inflow of foreign exchange from the export of
phosphates. But by late 1977 foreign exchange earnings had begun to
decline. At Lthe same time, inadequacies in the road network were beginning
to constrain rural development.
2.02     In 1.976, RTD engaged a French-Moroccan joint-venture consulting
firm for a study on pavement strengthening. The stiudy recommended a
five-year pavement rehabilitation and strengthening program. The program
was estimated to cost US$117 million at current prices.
2.03     In April 1978, a Bank supervision mission carried out a brief
reconnaissance of the highway network, paying !jarticular attention to the
condition of secondary and local roads. The mission found some
deficiencies in road maintenance techniques relating mainly to drainage,
which was causing the breaking up of pavements, landslides, and a reduction
of usable roadway width through the deterioration of shoulders. The
mission also concluded that investment in secondary and tertiary roads was
inadequate, and that substantial improvements were needed in primary
roads. It further identifi-4 needs for institutional strengthening in the
organization of road rnaintenance and in transport policy and coordination.
B.  Preparation and Appraisal
2.04     Project preparation was a collaborative effort involving RTD at
both central and district levels, and the autonomous Road Laboratory
(LPEE). The recommendations made by the maintenance study (para. 2.02)
were used as a guideline for drawing up a preliminary list of potential
subprojects covering some 3,400 km of roads. RTD had based the
economic-technical feasibility study on a computerized program for
evaluating economic rates of return, the RENTAREF model, prepared by RTD
experts.
2.05     In view of budgetary constraints, the project was designed to
include pavement strengthening of only 700 km and periodic maintenance of
about 1,000 km of existing roads. As a first step toward the realization
of the long-term program, it was envisaged that selected roads would be
strengthened and some of these also be widened. About 250 km of road
sections were identified for strengthening during the first year of the
project. RTD submitted to the Bank the detailed engineering and economic
evaluation of more than 300 km of road strengthening as a condition for the



- 3 -
invitation to negotiate. Owing to time constraints and to avoid further
deterioration of the roads, it was determined that detailed engineering and
economic evaluation of the remaining sections would have to be carried out
during project implementation. The Bank and the Government would agree on
the criteria for selecting these sections at negotiations.
2.06     Project-supported technical assistance was designed to improve
RTD's capability to manage road maintenance operations and the Ministry of
Transportation's (MOT) planning and coordination capabilities. Experts'
services would help RTD upgrade cost accounting of routine maintenance
operations, manage road maintenance equipment efficiently, and train staff
in charge of road maintenance equipment.  Studies financed under the
project were meant to provide the necessary technical assistance to improve
policy formulation involving all transport modes based on data collection
by MOT'S Planning Department.
2.07     The National Studies and Research Center (CNER) was being created
to establish a long-term road maintenance and pavement management system.
The Bank joined this effort by financing pavement evaluation equipment,
while the Belgian Government provided both financial and technical
assistance.
2.08     Overloaded vehicles were damaging pavements severely.  Moroccan
authorities, therefore, resolved to intensify enforcement of the legal
maximum axle loads by purchasing weighing scales and fixed weighing
stations.
C. Negotiations
2.09     Negotiations between the Bank and the Government of Morocco took
place from February 25 to February 29, 1980.  The Moroccan delegation
requested an increase in the proposed loan amount of US$57 million to
finance the foreign exchange costs of a portion of the pavement
preservation originally expected to be financed under the Government's
budget for periodic maintenance. The Bank agreed to an increase of the
Loan amount by US$5 million.
III. HE PROJECT
A. Description
3.01     The project, as described in the Loan Agreement, would consist of:
(a)  a three and one-half year phase of a long-term pavement
strengthening and preservation program covering approximately
700 km of road sections to be strengthened and approximately
1,000 km of road sections to be resurfaced. All sections
were to be selected in agreement with the Bank;



- 4 -
(b) a three and one-half year phase of routine and periodic
maintenance program for the classified highway network,
including acquisition of mechanical equipment;
(c)  strengthening of the management of road maintenance
operations by: (i) improving, with the assistance of some 23
staff-months of experts' services, RTD's cost accounting of
routine maintenance operations, management of road
maintenance equipment, and training of road maintenance
personnel; (ii) assisting in the preparation of the pavement
strengthening and preservation program through the provision
of advisory services by LPEE; and (iii) equipping CNER with
pavement evaluation equipment;
(d) assistance to MOT in the development and implementation of
recommendations on transportation planning and coordination
through 64 staff-months of consultants' services; and
(e) provision of mobile weighing scales and fixed weighing
stations to intensify MOT's enforcement of legal maximumi axle
loads.
B. Financing
3.02     The total cost of the project was estimated at about US$94 million
equivalent (Annex 1). The loan of US$62 million would finance the foreign
exchange component. The project would start by February 1980 and be
completed by December 31, 1983. The Loan fund allocation and disbursement
percentages eligible for financing were fixed by category as follows:
Amount of                    Amount
Category Loan Allocated          to be Financed
(1)  Civil works                  45,000,000                   65%
(2)  Equipment                    10,450,000              100% of foreign
expenditures and 73%
of local expenditures
(3)  Consultants' Services           850,000                   85%
(4)  Road Laboratory Services        300,000                   70%
(5)  Unallocated                   5,400,000
TOTAL                     62,000,000



C. Amendments to the Loan Agreement
3.03     The Loan Agreement underwent several amendments as follows:
(a)  April 24, 1981 (formalized with Bank letter of March 15,
1982).   Direct technical assistance to RTD (Section 3.03 of
the Loan Agreement) was ehlangpd to a study on road
maintenance organization.   In addition, the amendment allowed
for contracts tor resurfacing wotks costing less than
US$500,000 each to be awarded OtI the basis of locally
advertised competitive bidding. It also limited the Bank's
prior review of procurement decisionIs to contracts for civil
works estimated at US$500,000 or more and those for highway
maintenance equipment aud weigliing scales estimated at
US$100,000 or more.
(b) January_2, 1983. Financing of the long-term pavement
strengthening and preservation program under this loan was
increased from 700 km to 1,100 (Schedule 2 of the Loan
Agreement).  The date by which consultants for RTD and MOT
studies were to be employed was postponed from July 1, 1981
to July 1, 1982. Economic feasibility studies and
engineering work for the Fourth Highway Project were
included. Contracts for civil works estimated at less than
US$1.5 million each could be awarded on the basis of locally
advertised competitive bidding. Bank prior review of
contracts for civil works wouIld be limited to those estimated
at US$1.5 million each or more, and for service vehicles for
highway maintenance persoinnel to those estimated at
US$100,000 each or more.
D. Cancellation of Loan Funds
3.04     Two cancellations occurred:  (a) US$4.8 million on May 3, 1985
because of the increase in the value of the US dollar; and
(b) US$4.3 million, which were undisbursed when the loan account was
officially closed on September 30, 1986. Nonetheless, there were
sufficient funds to cover financing of additional 400 km of pavement
strengthening and of additional equipment. and engineering studies.
IV.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.  Pavement Strrepg theni_ng
4.01     Execution of the first yeai of the three and one-half year phase
of the road strengtthening progran started in earlv 1980.  By the end of the
year, RTD had signed contracts covering 196 km (69%),  and RTD and LPEE had



completed economic evaluation and detailed engineering work on the road
sections for the second and third years. When RTD had awarded all
contracts for the first year of strengthening (286 km) in early 1981,
contractors were unprepared to execute a sudden flow of new works. This
was because they ha(d reduced capacity in response to a recent cutback in
public works. Once strengthening was underway, work proceeded at a steady
pace, but withdrawal applications lagged behind the amount actually paid
due to slow administrative procedures. By mid-1982, all but one contract
for the original 700-km pavement strengthening program had been signed.
Works proceeded satisfactorily.
4.02     In 1982, a sharp increase in dollar parity from DH 3.8 to DH 6.3
reduced the share of the Loan amount that had been committed from 82% to
65%. This would leave an estimated surplus of about US$16 million.
Because the strenghthening program had been conceived as an open-ended
sector loan, the increase in dollar parity presented an opportunity not
only to expand the strengthening program, but also to finance other
project-related activities. A Loan Amendment of January 12, 1983 provided
for, inter alia, an additional 400 km of pavement strengthening and the
acquisition of additional maintenance equipment (para. 3.03 (b)) and
engineering studies.
4.03     By mid-1983, works on about 600 km of the original 700 km of
strengthening and about 250 km of the additional 400 kmn, had been
completed. Many of these works were starting much later than agreed and
lagged behind contractual implementation periods. The delays were caused
and compounded by a number of circumstances. In response to a temporary
shortage of bitumen, RTD had to suspend works. Much of the traffic on the
roads being strengthened could not be readily diverted. Payments from the
Treasury were behind schedule because of insufficient liquidity. When it
became clear that some road sections would not be completed by the Loan
Closing Date, the Bank approved a one-year extension to June 30, 1985.
4.04     In 1984, the difficult budgetarv sittuAtion resulting from
insufficient Treasury liquidity increased, and the execution of civil works
slowed down even more. During the third quarter, there were no payments at
all for project-supported civil works, goods, or services. RTD assured the
Bank that regular payments would resume as soon as the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) had revised the investment budget. This situation delayed ongoing
civil works and impeded commitments against new works. The delays reduced
the extent to which civil works could be fully executed by the new Closing
Date, causing a loan surplus. To allow more time for completion of works
that had already started and for the MOT studies (para. 4.11), the Loan
Closing Date was extended to December 31, 1985.
B. Pavement Preservation
4.05     Surface treatment of 1,000 km of primary and secondary roads was
carried out over four years instead of three. Some 709 km were completed
in 1981-82 as scheduled and 123 in 1983. This represented 42% of planned
surface treatment for 1983.  The remaining 168 km were treated in 1984.



- 7 -
C. Road Maintenance
4.06     The national budget for 1981 allocated DH 120 million for the
highway maintenance program.  This amount was in line with the projected
cost of the overall maintenance for the project period as agreed at
negotiations (i.e., DH 350 million, over three and one-half years, at 1980
prices). In fact, the annual maintenance action plan required by loan
covenant prevented a reduction in the real value of the allocation for
highway maintenance, while there was budgetary stringency elsewhere in the
public sector. Although from 1984 budgetary constraints held the
maintenance allocation below the agreed amounts, RTD managed to plan the
use of available amounts in a manner that kept the more important roads in
a satisfactory condition.
4.07     Road maintenance equipment was delivered in three tranches.
Delivery of the first and second tranches proceeded according to schedule.
The third tranche experienced repeated delays due to unsatisfactory tenders
and retendering. Annex 2 lists all road maintenance equipment procured
under the loan.
4.08     Pavement evaluation equipment was procured in 1981 under ICB
although the Loan Agreement allowed Limited International Bidding. CNER
technicians received training through Belgian technical assistance and
became proficient in the use and maintenance of the equipment. In 1983,
the RTD requested that additional equipment be financed under the loan. In
view of the commitment under the Fourth Highway Project to carry out
extensive measurements of pavement roughness under different traffic
volumes and pavement structural indices, the Bank agreed. Annex 3 lists
all pavement evaluation equipment procured under this loan.
D. Technical Assistance to the Roads and Traffic Department
4.09     In 1978, at the time of project identification, RTD was staffed
predominantly with young, French-trained engin:e"L.  A'LIough they had only
limited practical experience, they had a good grasp of the main issues
confronting them. Their relative newness in Government implied a time lag
between the upgrading of RTD personnel and the favorable impact on the
physical structure that could be expected to follow. With a view to
improving their capability to rationalize road investments and maintenance,
technical assistance under the project was originally to have been executed
directly through consultancy.  But an internal study, during the first year
of project implementation, suggested that structural modifications in RTD
might improve road maintenance management and operations. Since RTD
doubted that direct technical assistance could be effective in all respects
unless its organizatinal structure were better defined, it requested that
the project scope be modified to include a study leading to road
maintenance reorganization.  On review of the draft terms of reference, the
Bank agreed.



-8-
4.10     In early 1982, RTD evaluated the proposals it received from an
agreed short list of eight consultants and awarded the contract to a French
firm. The consultants examined the overall organization of road
maintenance, with particular attention to the organization of equipment
maintenance units, rate schedules for internal equipment rental, staff
training programs and the training center, and snow and sand removal. They
prepared a series of reports and produced five operational manuals. They
completed the study in late 1984, about one year behind schedule. RTD
drafted a comprehensive staff development plan based on the consultants'
recommendations and set up committees to prepare another plan for training
sessions to disseminate the conclusions of the study to central and
district staff.
E. Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Transportation
4.11     In November 1980, the Bank reviewed the draft letter of invitation
including descriptions of the various studies that would lead to upgrading
overall (i.e., multimodal) transport planning and coordination capability
in MOT. When the proposals were evaluated, the proposed contract price was
much higher than forecast with the result that MOT had to reject all of
them. MOT then excluded the study on railway management organization from
the terms of reference and invited the three best placed consulting firms
from the previous round to submit proposals. It selected a French/Moroccan
joint-venture.
4.12     The final draft reports were issued between March 1984 and June
1985. The studies focused heavily on the pricing and coordination of both
freight and passenger transport across modes, including urban and domestic
air transport. Four were carried out on air transport and meteorology, and
four on road transport. The ninth study, which was to assess the training
needs of MOT staff, was not carried out because a suitable expert was no
longer available. The Bank recommended that the results of the studies and
the data base be reviewed and used in the context of the Transport Policy
and Development Study to be financed under the Fourth Highway Project.
F. Vehicle-Weighing Equipment
4.13     Due to lack of technical knowledge, MOT did not prepare the
technical specifications for the purchase of mobile scales until mid-1981,
a year behind schedule. MOT's Land Transport Directorate (LTD) procured
ten double weighing scales in 1982 after a lengthy bid evaluation and
contract award process. Within a year there was an 80% increase in fines
for vehicle load violations. By mid-1983, procurement of fixed weighing
stations remained in a preparatory phase. LTD had prepared bidding
documents, which the Bank found unsatisfactory because LTD had failed to
consider the close interdependence between supplied equipment and
buildings. In assigning suitable locations for the installation of the
four fixed weighing stations, LTD repeatedly sought but failed to obtain
the cooperation of local authorities. It became apparent that considerable
time would be needed to reach an agreement between MOT and local
authorities to process bids, to construct necessary premises, and finally,
to assemble the equipment. LTD therefore decided, with Bank concurrence,
to cancel the fixed stations and purchase some i5 additional mobile
weighing scales and three vehicles to increase the number of existing check



-9-
points through random control by mobile teams. The last 15 mobile scales
were delivered in May 1985. MOT is using all 25 mobile scales and three
transport vehicles, purchased under the project, to carry out a continuous
program of axle-load control.
G. Feasibility Studies
4.14     RTD engaged a local branch of a French consulting firm to carry
out the economic evaluation, while LPEE performed the engineering work for
pavement strengthening for the Fourth Highway Project. The studies covered
the improvement and construction of approximately 900 km of provincial
roads, the repair and reconstruction of approximately 20 bridges on the
classified road network, and the pavement strengthening of approximately
800 km of primary and secondary roads. Also included was an update of the
feasibility study on the Oued Cherrat-Rabat section (29 km) of the
Casablanca-Rabat expressway, which had been carried out under the First
Highway Project. These studies were carried out competently and in a
timely manner.
H. Performance of Consultants
4.15     The same French firm executed studies for both RTD and MOT,
although in the second case it was in joint-venture with a domestic firm.
The study for RTD was successful and performance was good. With respect to
the studies for MOT, the conclusions tended to reflect MOT's point of view
rather than an independent one. However, after reviewing the original
version of this report, MOT pointed out that it had encouraged objective
assessments (Annex 6).
I. Performance of Contractors
4.16     All contractors for civil works were Moroccan.  Their performance
was generally satisfactory.
J. Performance of the Borrower
4.17     RTD's performance was satisfactory despite financial constraints
and cumbersome administrative procedures. In fact, RTD made every effort
to adhere to the implementation schedule and timely compliance with loan
conditions (para. 4.18). RTD carefully supervised the execution of civil
works under the project, while LPEE provided assistance in testing and
quality control where necessary. MOT, on the other hand, was slow in
preparing technical specifications for the purchase of mobile weighing
scales (para. 4.13).
K. Adherence to Loan Covenants
4.18     The Government's compliance with loan covenants was generally
satisfactory, although it had some difficulty complying with the following
covenants:



- 10 -
(a) Section 3.02 (ii). RTD was to have submitted its annual
programs of civil works and road maintenance for 1982 and
1983 for Bank review by September of the previous years.  It
submitted these several months past the due dates. For
subsequent years, however, the target was regularly met.
(b) Section 3.02 (ii). MOT was to have hired consultants for the
transport policy and coordination study by July 1, 1981,
which was later extended to July 1, 1982 (para. 3.03-(b)).
The financial proposals that were received far exceeded MOT's
budget, and MOF refused to raise the allocation during a
period of austerity. The scope of the study was finally
reduced, and a contract was signed on August 9, 1983, over
one year past the revised aue date.
(c)  Section 3.05 (c).  An ex-post evaluation report on the
execution and initial operation of the project, its cost and
benefits, and other project-assisted activities was due from
RTD on June 30, 1986, six months after the Loan Closing
Date.  It was not received until January 1987.  Discussion of
project preparation and implementation issues was lacking in
some instances and cursory in others. On the other hand,
tabulations relating to the economic reevaluation were
extensive, though incomplete.
(d) Section 4.03. During the inital years of the project (i.e.,
until 1984), budget allocations for road maintenance were
sufficient to comply with the agreement reached at
negotiations on the amount of maintenance to be carried out
annually, but by 1984 continued devaluation of the Dirham
caused budgetary constraints, which allowed for sufficient
amounts to keep only the major roads in satisfactory
condition (para. 4.06).
(e)  Section 4.05.  The Loan Agreement provided for reasonable
measures to be taken by the Government to ensure the proper
use of its national highway system. This condition could not
be fully met until mobile scales to be procured under the
project were operational. MOT was thus unable to begin a
program of random checks of vehicle axle-load until January
1983 (para. 4.13). Axle-load control is now carried out
regularly with satisfactory results.



- 11 -
V. PROJECT COST AND DISBURSEMENT
A. Project Cost
5.01     Actual project costs compared with appraisal estimates are shown
in Annex 1.  Pavement strengthening and preservation amounted to 80S of
total project cost, as estimated at appraisal. The total expenditure in
local currency was increased by 64%. In US dollar equivalent, the total
cost decreased by 182 because of a sharp decrease in the ve.lue of the
Dirham in relation to the dollar auring the implementation period. The
unit cost of pavement strengthening increased by 34% in local currency from
DH 285,000 to DH 383,000 per km, but decreased by 232 in equivalent US
Dollars from US$75,000 to US$57,000 per km.
5.02     Foreign exchange costs were about 88% of appraisal estimates.  But
the cost of technical assistance to RTD was several times appraisal
estimates:  1552 for consultants' services and 280% for laboratory services
provided by LPEE. This marked increase was mainly due to the financing of
feasibility studies and engineering work for the Fourth Highway Project,
pursuant to the Loan Amendment of January 12, 1983 (para. 3.03 (b)). The
foreign cost of equipment was lower than expected: 911 for highway
maintenance equipment, 59% for weighing scales, and 79% for laboratory
equipment, including the additional laboratory equipment purchased for
CNER. The bulk of equipment (92%) was for highway maintenance. Price
increases for this equipment were lower than expected.
B. Disbursement
5.03     Actual disbursements lagged behind the appraisal schedule.  This
lag was caused not only by the usual delays in implementation and
procurement, but also by slow administrative procedures. By June 30, 1984,
the original Loan Closing Date, actual disbursements were 731 of expected
disbursement. The Closing Date was extended to June 30, 1985, by which
time total disbursements increased by only 3%. It was extended again to
December 31, 1985, but the Loan Account was kept open until September 30,
1986. Cancellations amounted to US$9.1 million (para. 3.04).
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PEFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01     The two previous highway projects contributed to the
organizational and manpower development of the relevant agencies by helping
build the structures needed for rationalizing road construction, road
maintenance, and overall transportation planning and coordination.
Institutional gains under the First Highway Project were underscored by
good performance of local contractors and efficient construction



- 12 -
supervision by RTD engineers. Under thie Second Project, the local
construction industry continued to gain valuable experience. Local
contractors carried out all civil works competently, including the
country's first modern expressway. The Second Project also introduced cost
accounting methods for road maintenance recommended under the First
Project.
6.02     The Third Project provided the next logical step in institutional
growth and maturity. RTD requested that technical assistance by
consultants be included in the project to help improve the quality of its
maintenance operations and to strengthen its planning and budgeting
capability. But an internal assessment in RTD, which was carried out
shortly after implementation was underway, found that some organizational
restructuring could enhance mainteniance management.  This led RTD to
reconsider the kind of technical assistance needed and to change direct
assistance to a study (para. 4.09). The study outlined a strategy for
long-range operational planning and made recommendations for upgrading cost
accounting procedures, developing procedures for heavy equipment
maintenance, and improving the agency's capability in maintenance manpower
planning anid development. Before the project was coumpleted, RTD had
planned training courres for central and district staff. Mhe other study,
which was directed at sectorwide planning and coordination in MOT,
identified and outlined major issues facing the transport sector to be
addressed outside the scope -f the Third Project (para. 4.11).
6.03     Despite major changes in the technical assistance component,
significant institutional growth occurred. It was both concomitant with,
and a direct result of, the project. In late 1982, during the course of
project implementation, road maintenance operations were decentralized.
Under the new scheme, RTD headquarters began to focus on matters of general
planning and coordination, while delegating contract awards and
administration, as well as supervision of works, to district offices. The
field organization was extended to 40 provincial offices, grouped under
seven regional offices, with 70 subdivisions. This structure enhanced
reporting relationships and communication between central staff and
engineers in charge of district offices, allowing problems to be identified
and solved quickly.
6.04     The loan also financed pavement evaluation equipment to be used in
the new CNER, which was being assisted with Belgian bilateral aid
(para. 4.08). Acquisition of this equipment provided the subsector with
the permanent capacity to carry out extensive measurements of pavement
roughness under different traffic volumes and pavement structural indices.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01     At appraisal, the Bank agreed on a methodology to program
strengthening works. It consisted in evaluating the Internal Rate of
Return (IRR) on a set of road sections. Works were to proceed on those



- 13 -
road sections with highest values. It was agreed that strengthening was
not warranted for economic reasons on road sections that showed a return of
less than 12%.
7.02     RTD applied a computerized model, RENTAREF, which was prepared by
its own experts. The model took into account: (a) road roughness and its
effects on vehicle operating costs (VOCs); and (b) routine maintenance
costs on each road section before and after strengthening. This method was
applied to 286 km of road sections that were selected at appraisal as a
priority in the first stage of project implementation. It was then updated
to take inflation into account and applied to the remaining road sections.
During project implementation RTD submitted to the Bank for approval the
list ot roads to be strengthened for which the IRR was calculated.
7.03     Following project completion, new traffic counts were taken on a
sample of the roads strengthened with project financing and ex-post IRR's
were calculated using the same methodology as agreed at appraisal. Ex-post
economic evaluation showed an average IRR of 32% as compared with the
original 39% (Annex 4). This is based on 75% of road sections strengthened
for which comparative data are available, including those appraised before
and after loan effectiveness (para. 2.05). The higher ex-post IRRs on some
sections are due to higher than expected traffic growth between 1981 and
1985 on sections where circulation tends to concentrate between the high
density population centers. Sections below the 12% threshhold (para. 7.01)
show an average IRR of 7% as compared with the original 29%. The lower
ex-post IRRs occur because initial calculations were based on standard
structuires. In some cases, however, detailed engineering shows that
stronger pavement was needed because of local subsoil and drainage
conditions which increased the cost of strengthening. By the time RTD
staff calculated ex-post rates, they had gained experience using the Bank's
Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM), which requires many more inputs
than RENTAREF. At the Bank's suggestion, RTD has compared the two models,
applying RENTAREF to road sections included in the Fourth Highway Project,
which had been studied through the application of HDM. Almost invariably,
HDM results are higher; on average, they are 60% above those given by
RENTAREF. One reason for this improvement is that HDM takes into account
the actual roughness for each section before strengthening, which is
generally higher than 3,500 mm/km, whereas RENTAREF assumes a constant
roughness equal to 3,500 mm/km. On that basis, the 7% average ex-post IRR
on sections below the 12% threshhold would have been about 11% if HDM had
been applied. Annex 4 provides a breakdown by section of ex-post and
original IRRs on 75% of project-assisted strengthening and Annex 5 a
breakdown of VOCs in 1983.
7.04     Overall, the project proves to have been a good investment for the
Government. Without the pavement strengthening program, many sections of
the main road network would have deteriorated beyond repair as a result of
heavy traffic. Most importantly, it established in the Ministry of Public
Works a methodology to evaluate economic returns on all future investments,
which is subject to further refinements and adaptation to the specifics of
each investment.

VIII.  ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01     The Bank devoted 51 staff weeks in the field to the project from
its inception to its completion. Supervision missions visited Morocco at
least twice a year during implementation. Bank missions maintained a
continuous dialogue with the Government on ways to minimize the time lag
between the implementation of studies and works, and disbursement of loan
proceeds. As the Loan Closing Dates approached, the Bank emphasized the
need to increase the amount of withdrawal applications to ensure full
financing of project items.
8.02     Bank staff helped the Government examine ways to reduce the scope
of the MOT studies while it stressed the importance of selecting
high-quality consultants and starting the studies without further delay.
Because MOT lacked the appropriate knowledge to prepare technical
specifications for the purchases of mobile weighing scales, the Bank
referred MOT to the description of a type of mobile scale already approved
under a loan for another country. The Bank constantly monitored the
preparation of bidding documents for this equipment.
8.03     The flexibility of the sector-loan approach to pavement
strengthening and road maintenance allowed for additional civil works and
procurement of equipment when exchange rate fluctuactions were causing a
loan surplus. This was accomplished without having to change original
project objectives and thus facilitated amending the Loan Agreement.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     The Third Highway Project achieved its objectives and contributed
to the country's long-term pavement strengthening and preservation
program. The loan surplus resulting from exchange rate fluctuation made it
possible for RTD to benefit from Bank financing of pavement strengthening
of an additional 400 km of road sections. The management of road
maintenance operations and equipment has improved measurably as a direct
result of the project. The project, therefore, had a decisive impact on
the institutional growth of the subsector, although its contribution to
improvements at the macro level of transport planning and coordination must
still be confirmed. As a result of the project, the Bank has learned
lessons in the following areas: (a) preparation of technical assistance
components; (b) effectiveness of loan covenants that cover recurrent
expenditure; and (c) the continuing need to help the Government improve the
processing of contract awards and withdrawal applications.
9.02     It was necessary to scale down MOT studies due to the
unavailability of local funds.  Consequently, the technical assistance
component fell short of expected results. In future transportation

projects, the Bank should seek assurances from the Government at
negotiations that adequate local tunds will be available to execute agreed
studies.  The Banik should also supervise their progress closely to assure
that they maintain an independent point of view.  Loan covenants should
require that studies follow proven methodologies and approaches.
9.03     Loan conditions should also specify budgetary allocations for road
maintenance. This approach was successful during the early years of
project implementation and prevented cutbacks in road maintenance
operations while the reEt of the public sector faced austerity. In view of
the implications of satisfactory road maintenance for overall agriculture
and infrastructure development, similar condition lities in future projects
could help offset austerity measures.
9.04     In 1984 a Regional Procurement Review ' m:.,ttee examined the basic
decrees for rules and regulations for procurement of works, goods, and
services and recommended some changes and clarifications in Local
Competitive Bidding rules and procedures. In the transportation sector,
the Bank has maintained a continuous dialogue with the Government on
related issues in the context of the Fourth Highway project, the Casablanca
and Mohammedia Port Project, the Public Enterprise Rationalization Loan,
and proposed Transportation Sector Loan. In conjunction with ongoing and
future projects in Morocco, the Bank should continue this dialogue with a
view to helping the Government streamline administrative procedures
affecting the execution of public works to minimize the time lag between
implementation of works and disbursement (para. 8.01).

SUBJECT: Completion Report on Third Highway Project

REF: Your letter of August 14, 1987
Dear Sir:
Further to your above-referred letter we have the honor to inform
you that after reading the completion report on the Third Highway Project we
have the following comment to make:
Page 10, paragraph 4.1'
Because of its concern to know the true situation of the transport
sector in Morocco, the Ministry has never influenced the opinions of experts
to turn the conclusions of their studies toward its point of view. On the
contrary, it has encouraged them to interview transport system users in the
field in order to better ascertain the actual situation of the sector.
We would accordingly request you to delete the last sentence of
paragraph 4.15.
Yours sincerely,
s/Abdelkader Nouini
Secretary General
for the Minister of
Transport
Stamp: Minister of Transport
Kingdom of Morocco
