                         The Board approved revised PDO are:

                         (i) strengthen fiscal decentralization, improve accountability in the use of local government resources, and improve management of intergovernmental transfers and
                         demand-driven urban investments; and

                         (ii) increase access to infrastructure and services in the unplanned areas of Dar es Salaam and improve revenue performance for sustainable operations and
                         maintenance.

                          Component 1 of LGSP is designed to support the GoT Local Government Capital Development Grant System, inter alia through provision system of capital and capacity
                         building grants for local government authorities (LGAs). This component aims to support (i) a sound intergovernmental fiscal framework and (ii) capacity-building so
                         that LGAs can better meet their service-delivery obligations. Together with bilateral donors, the Project targets all 132 LGAs in the country. Component 2 of LGSP
                         focuses on Dar es Salaam, supporting the upgrading of infrastructure and services in unplanned settlements, and improving local revenue collection and systems for
                         operation and maintenance of infrastructure. Component 3 is designed to strengthen capacity in the Prime Minister#s Office - Regional Administration and Local
                         Government (PMO-RALG) to perform monitoring, oversight and management functions with respect to the grants supported by Component 1.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since 2004/05, the Local Government Support Project (LGSP) in partnership with other Development Partner inputs, has enabled the Government of Tanzania to establish a
                         transparent formula-based system of inter-governmental transfers to all local governments in support of the Devolution by Decentralization (D by D) Policy. As part of fiscal
                         decentralization, local government authorities (LGAs) are allocated grants through a transparent and equitable formula-based system. The Local Government Development Grant
                         (LGDG) system provides council development grants (CDG, previously known as Capital Development Grants) and capacity building grants (CBG) on a formula basis, but only where
                         LGAs have met performance criteria. IDA contributions towards such grants ended with the last transfer in September 2010. LGSP has played a critical role in the establishment of a
                         single, harmonized mechanism for local development grants to LGAs in Tanzania. As such, LGSP was successful in its core objective.

                         The LGDG has proved successful to an extent that was not foreseen in the original design. Initially it was foreseen that the LGDG system would be piloted on a small subset of LGAs
                         for a few years, but GoT decided with additional DP support to upscale and roll out across the country at an early stage. Likewise, various large project modalities for sector support
                         interventions – most notably agriculture and RWSS –have been transformed into LGA fiscal transfers and over the project period established a LG development grant system through
                         which very substantive funds (also in regional comparison) are now channeled. The LGDG grant system has promoted a set of concepts and principles, and generally achieved
                         implementation in accordance with these principles, including allocation of grants on a formula basis, the need for LGAs to achieve a certain set of minimum conditions, the
                         importance of the timely disbursement of grants, and so on. That said, due to an overall constrained national budget, the LGDG system faces challenges such as the late transfer of
                         grants from central to local governments; with strengthened national audit systems and requirements, local governments struggle to meet enhanced audit criteria; and reporting
                         systems require continued attention.

                         LGSP also supported the Dar es Salaam Local Authorities (DLAs) in implementing the Community Infrastructure Improvement Program (CIUP) and a Revenue Enhancement
                         Program (REP). The first phase of CIUP has been completed and work on the second phase began in mid 2010. Construction has now been completed across the three Municipal
                         Councils. Final inspection of completion was conducted in early April 2012. Both phases of CIUP have resulted in upgrading of almost 20 percent of Dar es Salaam's unplanned
                         settlements (estimated that 70 percent of Dar es Salaam's population lives in such unplanned settlements). Under the REP initiative, the project has facilitated the identification and
                         valuation of all taxable properties across the three DLAs. All field work for valuation has been completed and data cleaning is currently underway. This activity is expected to result in
                         substantial revenue enhancement for the DLAs in the following fiscal year.
