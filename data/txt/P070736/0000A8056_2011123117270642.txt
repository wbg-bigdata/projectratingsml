                         The Board approved revised PDO are:

                          (i) strengthen fiscal decentralization, improve accountability in the use of local government resources, and improve management of intergovernmental transfers
                         and demand-driven urban investments; and

                         (ii) increase access to infrastructure and services in the unplanned areas of Dar es Salaam and improve revenue performance for sustainable operations and
                         maintenance.

                          Component 1 of LGSP is designed to support the GoT Local Government Capital Development Grant System, inter alia through provision system of capital and
                         capacity building grants for local government authorities (LGAs). This component aims to support (i) a sound intergovernmental fiscal framework and (ii)

                         Component 2 of LGSP focuses on Dar es Salaam, supporting the upgrading of infrastructure and services in unplanned settlements, and improving local
                         revenue collection and systems for operation and maintenance of infrastructure. Component 3 is designed to strengthen capacity in the Prime Minister#s Office
                         - Regional Administration and Local Government (PMO-RALG) to perform monitoring, oversight and management functions with respect to the grants supported
                         by Component 1.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since 2004/05, the Local Government Support Project (LGSP) in partnership with other Development Partner inputs, has enabled the Government of Tanzania to establish a
                         transparent formula-based system of inter-governmental transfers to all local governments in support of the Devolution by Decentralization (D by D) Policy. As part of fiscal
                         decentralization, local government authorities (LGAs) are allocated grants through a transparent and equitable formula-based system. The Local Government Development Grant
                         (LGDG) system provides council development grants (CDG, previously known as Capital Development Grants) and capacity building grants (CBG) on a formula basis, but only where
                         LGAs have met performance criteria. IDA contributions towards such grants ended with the last transfer in September 2010.

                         LGSP also supports the Dar es Salaam Local Authorities (DLAs) in implementing the Community Infrastructure Improvement Program (CIUP) and a Revenue Enhancement Program
                         (REP). The first phase of CIUP has been completed and work on the second phase began in mid 2010. Construction is at very advanced stages of completion across the three
                         Municipal Councils. Final inspection of completion is scheduled for mid to late January 2012. Both phases of CIUP will result in upgrading of almost 20 percent of Dar es Salaam's
                         unplanned settlements (estimated that 70 percent of Dar es Salaam's population lives in such unplanned settlements). Under the REP initiative, the project is facilitating the
                         identification and valuation of all taxable properties across the three DLAs. All field work for valuation has been completed and data cleaning is currently underway. This activity is
                         expected to result in substantial revenue enhancement for the DLAs in the following fiscal year.
