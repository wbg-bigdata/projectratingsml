SECOND MAE MOH LIGNITE PROJECT
(LOAN 2407-TH)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Mae Moh
Lignite Project in Thailand for which Loan 2407-TH in the amount of US$59.1
million was approved on April 24, 1984. An amount of US$44.1 million was
canceled on December 23, 1986. The loan was closed on April 30, 1991 three
years behind schedule. The last disbursement of US$146,178 equivalent was
made on August 6, 1991 making the total disbursement equivalent to
US$14,360,577.28. The balance of US$639,442.72 was cancelled.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Industrv and Energy Operations
Division, Department I of the East Asia and Pacific Region, and the Energy
Division, Technical Department of the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evalua-
tion Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of the PCR was started when the Borrower was requested
to provide statistical data for Part III. In addition the PCR is based on the
Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project Agreements, supervision reports
and correspondence in the Project Files.

SECOND MAE MOH LIGNITE PROJECT
(LOAN 2407-TH)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.        The project's main goal was to expand lignite mining capacity to
5.0 million tonnes per year in order to provide fuel to three additional
150 kW power generating plants (Units 5, 6 and 7) and increase total
generating capacity to 825 kW. Other objectives were: (i) to reinforce
economic pricing policies to ensure that planned lignite expansions are
economically and financially justified and EGAT's mining operations are
viable; (ii) to strengthen EGAT's technical and financial operations through
technical assistance; and (iii) to minimize any adverse environmental impact
of lignite-based electricity generation (Part I, para. 3.1).
Implementation Experiences
2.        The project was successfully implemented ahead of schedule except
for procurement delays, which were unrelated to the main project scope and
were the cause of a three-year loan closing extension. The construction and
commissioning of Nos. 5, 6 and 7 generating units was completed six months
earlier than scheduled. Lignite production for these units was available when
needed and has exceeded requirement to the present (end 1991).
3.        The project experienced a major change in mining operations.
Encouraging results from contracting out (to local contractors) overburden
removal led EGAT to decide that it would contract out all overburden rewmval
as well as a substantial proportion of innerburden removal and lignite
handling. As a consequence, there was no need for EGAT to purchase the mining
equipment it would have required had it carried out this work. Thus
US$41.1 million from the Bank loan was cancelled, leaving a loan amount of
US$15.0 million. The use of contractors for suitable mining operations has
been successfully expanded. EGAT keeps losing trained personnel to
contractors, but this is out weighed by competitive bidding for contracts
(Part I, para. 5.1).
Results
4.        1he project achieved its main objectives:  (i) lignite production
has consistently exceeded power generation requirements; (ii) lignite transfer
prices have been fixed in accordance with the Lignite Pricing Study;
(iii) EGAT's training program continues to provide high quality staff for both
itself and indirectly its mining contractors, (iv) villagers occupying mine



- iii -
areas have been successfully and equitably resettled; (v) stack emission has
been maintained below Bank guidelines; and (vi) satisfactory internal economic
and financial rates of return have been achieved (see Paut III, paras. 6.1 to
6.10 for details concerning the calculation 3f economic and financial rates of
return).
Proiect Sustainability
5.        The Mae Moh complex has already reached a generating capacity of
1725 MW, some 900 MW in excess of that attributable to the project. The mine
has sufficient proven and economically mineable lignite (628 million tons) to
suprort the present'.y planned expansion to 4425 MW peak generation capacity.
This will enable mining and generation operations to continue until the year
2023 as planned. At that time there will then remain a further 524 (minimum)
million tons of lignite to be exploited from the lower part of Mae Moh basin.
It is reasonab. t to expect that the requisite skills, equipment and techniques
will have been developed by the time these more difficult reserves are needed
and can be economically recovered (Part I, para. 7.1).
Findings and Lessons Learned
6.        EGAT has done an excellent job of managing the Mae Moh lignite
mining complex while turning over to the private sector more than half the
operations. In the process, mining unit costs have been reduced to about a
third the original amount, much of it due to competitive bidding. The reduced
lignite costs have not only benefitted EGAT and its customers, but in effect
recoverable lignite reserves were increased by making more of the in-place
deposits available at an economic cost. EGAT's success with having the
private sector help exploit its lignite deposit could serve as a model for
other Bank borrowers in similar circumstances (Part I, para. 6.6 and 9.1).

Sector             : Energy
Subsector          : Mining/Power
2.        Background
2.1       EGAT started open pit lignite mining in a small way during 1973 to
feed a fertilizer plant and a power generating plant, both no longer in
service. In 1978 EGAT started a large scale lignite production program to
supply three 50 MW power plants. The Bank's first lignite loan (Loan No.
1852-TH) which became effective in 1980 was designed to raise lignite
production from an annual 1.0 tonnes to 2.8 tonnes, the amount needed for
adding a fourth plant (150 MW). The second lignite project now under review
was designed to raise production to 5.0 million tonnes per year.
2.2       The Mae Moh power and mine complex is located in north Thailand in
Lampang Province, approximately 650 km north of Bangkok and 12 km east of the
town of Lampang. The main land use in the area is commercial teakwood and
tobacco cultivation; there is also some limited subsistence agriculture.
Population density in the basin is low and the climate is tropical, with an
average annual rainfall of 1,000 to 1,500 mm. The area is adequately served
by paved roads and by a raiJ-pur line which connects the site with the
national rail system approximately 5 km to the south of Mae Moh.
z.3       At appraisal lignite reserves were determined to be ample and
assured for the 825 MW generating capacity available on completion of the
project as well as for future additional capacity. Lignite reserves with an
average ash content of 22 percent and a calorific value of 2,700 kcal/kg were
determined to be 814 million tonnes. However, due to restrictions on pit
design because of slope instability, geological losses and other factors
recoverable reserves were set at the much lower value of 451 million tonnes of
mineable lignite. To illustrate the magnitude of these reserves, a further
expansion to 1,725 MW (from the 825 MW at project completion) of power
generating capacity would require 335 million tonnes over the plant's useful
lifetime.



-2-
3.        Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.1       The project expanded lignite mining capacity to 5.0 million tonneL
per year in order to provide fuel to three additional 150 kW power generating
plants (Units 5, 6 and 7) and increase total generating capazity to 825 kW.
Its main objectives were: (i) to reinforce economic pricing rolicies to
ensure that planned lignite expansion are economically and financially
justified and EGAT's mining operations are viable; (ii) to strengthen EGAT's
technicai. and financial operations through technical assistance; and (iii) to
minimize any adverse environmental impact of lignite based electricity
generation.
3.2       The project comprised engineering, procurement and erection of
mining and related equipment (mainly conveyor belts, semi-mobile crushers,
off-highway trucks and auxiliary equipment, technical assistance, training and
civil works for the required mining expansion.
4.        Project Design and Organization
4.1       Project design was based on a thorough study of alternative mining
plans and methods. Foreign mining experts helped EGAT prepare a mining and
soil reclamation plan suitable for EGAT's current and future mining
operations.  The selected wining method was technically sound and presented
minimal technical risks. 't consisted of trucks and shovels in combination
with semi-mobile crushers and conveyors. Alternative methods considered
included bucket wheel excavators which were unsuitable for mining conditions
at Mae Moh and mobile crushers which were considered technically risky.
4.2       With the experience gained in carrying out the first lignite
project, EGAT was well prepared for the second project. Lignite mining
operations and project implementation were well organized and professionally
executed under the overall direction of the Lignite Mine Department. Project
management and related responsibilities were delegated to the Directorate of
the Department under the supervision of the Deputy Director.
5. Project Implementation
5.1       Construction and commissioning of the three project-related 150 MW
generating units, numbers 5, 6 and 7, to raise total generating capacity to
825 MW, was completed by September 1985, six months earlier than originally
anticipated in the appraisal report. Lignite production for these units was
ahead of the appraisal scheduling and has continued to be in excess of
generation requirements to the present time (1991). the overall Mae Moh
generating capacity having now reached 1725 MW of the ultimately programmed
4725 MW. The major procurement item in the original project financing plan
was an in-pit system for overburden crushing, transportation and dumping
valued at US$39.7 million, 67% of the tctal US$59.1 million loan amount.
However, successiul experience in their first contracted-out overburden
removal operation showed EGAT that major practical and financial benefits
could be achieved by subcontracting. This subsequently led to a decision to
contract-out virtually all of the overburden removal and a significant
percentage of the interburden and lignite handling from then on. The decision
to do so obviated the requirement for EGAT to procure the in-pit overburden



-3-
system, since the proposed contracts would require contractors to provide
their own capital equipment. In consequence, the decision to contract-out
resulted in EGAT's cancellation of 75% of the total loan in December 1986,
some US$44.1 million, effectively reducing the loan amount to US$15.0 millicn.
Although the procurement of most of the other project-related equipment was
generally completed on time, the requirement for some minor items was lessenpd
by the success of the contracting-out. Consequent delays in procurement
resulted in the loan closing date being extended by s total of three years.
5.2       While the original EGAT project was based upon the then-anticipated
lignite reserves of 150 million tonnes of lignite, a subsequent exploration
program has increased the proven resource to almost 1,500 million tonnes and
has prompted the continuous up-grading of the planned power generating
capacitv to its presently planned ultimate level of 4425 MW - 3600 MW greater
than that planned within the Bank-financed project under discussion. This
capacity would require the produztion of 628 million of the 1,152 million
tonnes of lignite which are presently considered to be economically mineable
at Mae Moh. Uncertainties regarding the technical feasibility of mining the
remaining non-scheduled 524 million tonnes of lignite situated in the deepest
part of the Mae Moh basin still remain to be resolved. Neither EGAT nor
Coleman Associates, the Australian long-term mining consultants resident at
Mae Moh, are able at this time to predict the practicability or economic
viability of mining the 500 meter-deep center of the basin. lae Moh's working
ratio of overburden to lign_te is, and will continue to be, an advantageously
low 5 cu. m.
5.3       Increased expertise in equipment operation, repair and maintenance,
coupled with the contracting-out of the major part of overburden removal, have
resulted in a major increase in equipment availability and a consequert
reduction in EGAT's future requirements ;or replacement shovels, trucks,
bulldozers, etc. There is every reason to believe that continued success in
contracting-out operations will inevitably result in the inclusion of even
more of the operational sectors presently carried out by EGAT equipment and
staff, in the newer contracts, thus leading to less capital equipment
requirements for EGAT's mining directorate together with lower unit mining
costs due to competition.
6.   Prolect Results
6.1       The project clearly achieved its objective of assisting in the
increase of Mae Moh's power generating capacity to a level of 825 MW (via a
lignite production of 4.5 million tonnes) by 1986 rather than the 1987
forecast in the SAR. Further, generating units 8 and 9 were commissioned in
1989 and 1990. Lignite production has consistently exceeded requirements and
has been able to provide an in-pit inventory of exposed (immediately
accessible) in-situ lignite of approximately 14 million tonnes (1.5 years'
present consumption) at peak demand. Current planning assumes the production
of over 30 million tonnes of lignite per year for units 1-19 by the year 1998
which can already be confidently expected to be achievable.
6.2       EGAT's lignite transfer prices are fixed in accordance with the
recommendations of the Lignite Pricing Study and are consistent with stated
objectives to reflect the economic cost of imported coal and to provide for



- 4 -
the financial viability of EGAT's mining operatior.s. The price is designed to
cover production costs and includes a further margin to ensure the covering of
debt servicing, replacement of fixed assets and EGAT's exploration expenses.
6.3       EGAT's training programs have been highly successful although the
contracting-out of overburden removal has resulted in the 'poaching' of
trained and experienced engineering staff and operators by the private
contractors now involved at Mae Moh - a practice which is normal in similar
situations worldwide. In effect, as the mine production becomes greater and
overall technical staff req-4rements expand, kGAT continues to provide and
train the majority of the engineering staff requiret by itself (voluntarily)
and the contractors (involuntarily) despite reducin6 its own requirements by
progressively contracting-out an increasingly high proportion of its field
operations.
6.4       As it gained experience, EGAT has become more successful in the
resettlement of villagers occupying the mining areas. The new resettlement
townships to the south of Mae Moh are well established and the new inhabitants
appear to be settling in satisfactorily. Roads, power and water supplies,
drainage and communal and municipal buildings are in place and to a high
standard. House building to traditional Thai design is assisted by EGAT and
the buildings themselves are of a higher standard than those vacated in the
villages disturbed by the mining operations. A model agricultural
smallholding has been established by EGAT in the village in an attempt to
encourage self-sufficiency but the scheme has reportedly had disappointing
results since a large number of the displaced villagers are employed on the
mine and feel no need to participate.
6.5       During project implementation and subsequently, average levels of
sulfur dioxide and other stack e-issions have not exceeded Bank guidelines.
However, the addition of units 12 and 13 is expected to do so and EGAT will
include wet scrubbers in their design and specifications. In addition, if it
proves to be necessary, EGAT will retrofit units 10 and 11 with sorbent
injection systems. Mine dust disturbance is minimized by water-spraying on
haul roads and at conveyor transfer points. As areas of permanent overburden
dumps are completed they are being graded and contoured and planted with trees
in accordance w4.th an approved final restoration master plan. Predetermined
areas will be restored to agriculture with recovered topsoil. The mining pit
itself will not be restored to previous surface levels but will be allowed to
fill with water to : rm a large lake intended primarily for recreational
purposes.
6.6       The project and its subsequent expansion has had and is hesing a
substantial impact on what was previously a remote and rural area. The area
is now served by well-maintained and modern road and rail facilities, and the
mine/power station complex is providing direct employment for over 2,000
people and indirect employment for many others. The project has resulted in
-he formation of a well-trained, highly skilled and efficient workforce which
can be used to expand EGAT's operations to other parts of Thailand in the
ftture, e.g. to form the nucleus of the necessary workforce for the proposed
lignite mine at Saba Yoi in southern Thailand. While the present planning
envisages a completion of operations in 2023 and subsequent abandonment of the
area by EGAT, improved mining techniques can be expected to have been



developed by that time to enable mining of the 500 million tonnes in the
center of the basin. This would enable further stations to be constructed and
extend the life of the complex and its associated benefi; to the local
community for many years.
6.7       The economic and financial rates of return calculated in the SAR and
reevaluated in this PCR are tabulated below. The basis of the calculations
and the variances between the SAR and PCR are explained in Part III, paras.
6.1-6.10 inclusive.

7.   Prolect Sustainabilitv
7.1       The complex has already reached a geaerating capacity of 1725 MW,
some 900 MW in excess of that related to the subject project. The mine has
sufficient proven and economically mineable lignite (628 million tonnes) to
support the presently planned expansion to a 4425 MW peak generation capacity.
This will enable mining and generation operations to continue until the year
2023 as planned. At that time, there will then remain a further 524 (minimum)
million tonnes of lignite to be exploited from the lower part of Mae Moh basin
if experience of the present mining limits show that at least some portion of
this is economic and practicable. With progressive development of equipment,
skills and techniques, it should be possible to recover at least a good
proportion of this deeper layer.
8.   Bank Performance
8.1       The Banlk can be considered to have performed efficiently and
adequately throughout the project cycle. The fact that the majority of the
loan was eventually canceled was due to a decision by EGAT, fully supported by
the Bank, that must be regarded as the best possible outcome for the project.
It resulted in a sizeable reduction in the mine's unit costs, reduced EGAT's
future capital requirements at Mae Moh and provides continuing major oppor-
tunities for private sector participation in Thailand. EGAT intend to award
earthmoving contracts worth, in total, approximately US$4.0 billion by the
year 2016.



9.   Borrower's Performance and Proiect Relationship
9.1       The credit for the success of this project and the previous Mae M4oh
project is due, in the most part, to the skills and commitment of EGAT's mine
directorate staff, both in their Bangkok headquarters and at the mine itself.
The efficiency of the mine can now be favorably compared with any other
successful international mining project--Bank financed or otherwise. A strong
dedication to environmental protection is also clearly defined and evident at
the mine and in the power station development. EGAT's project procurement
department procedures and their communications with the Bank cannot be faulted
and could advantageously be used as a model for other borrowers. Documenta-
tion is always timely and requests for information are promptly, courteously
and efficiently fulfilled.
9.2       Relationships between EGAT and the Bank have been, and continue to
be, close, cordial and technically profitable. The gradual move towards the
tr'.nsfer of major earth-moving operations, via contracts to the private sector
inevitably means that less Bank assistance will be required on mining projects
but shc'uld not affect the continuation of assistance in
power-generation-related projects.
10.  Proiect Documentation and Data
10.1      No problems were encountered in the project's documentation during
the life of the project. In addition, EGAT's computerized MIS was instru-
mental in their ability to be able to provide essential relevant information
on all aspects of technical and financial management in a timely fashion
whenever it was requestea or required.

SECOND MAE MOH LIGNITE PROJECT
(LOAN 2407-TH)
Part II   PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.   Project Background
Due to the growth in energy demand and the world oil crisis
during 1970, more power plants were envisaged and planned for construction.
Thus, EGAT requested the first Mae Moh Lignite Project loan from the Bank
under Loan No.1852-TH provided for the mine expansion for power plant unit
4 which was operated in March 1984. In operation of 4 units, lignite
consumption was increased from 1.0 million tpy to 2.8 million tpy.
During  this  decade,  further  exploration  of Mae Moh  lignite
deposit has been intensively carried out.  Geological drilling  results
identified  total  geological lignite  reserves  of  approximately  1,468.0
million tonnes at Mae Moh -Mine which are sufficient to sustain 1725 MW
(units 1-10) power generating capacity, for at least 30 years.  In order to
cope with the increase in power demand in the  country  and  to  reduce
imported fuel oil in accordance with the Government's policy, EGAT further
constructed power units 5-6-7 of 150 MW capacity each on the same- site.
Subsequent expansion of mine operation to produce lignite of 5.0 million
tpy. was required for serving 7 power units at total 825 MW. capacity.
The long term mining plan was prepared by EGAT deciding to select
trucks and shovels in combination with semi-mobile crusher with conveyor
belt and stacker which was studied the most suitable mining method for Mae
Moh Mine.
In seeking financial support for the project, EGAT requested the
second Bank loan for the expansion of Mae Moh Mine for the power plant
units 5-6-7.  The Bank mission had appraised the project in 1983 and the
Loan No.2407-TH Agreement at the estimated amount of US$ 59.1 million was
signed on November 9, 1984  covering  the  expenditure  for engineering,
procurement and erection of mining eqjuipment.

2.   Project Results
Considering the technical and overall implementation of the
project, the performance can be assessed efficient and effectiye.  The
project  yielded  the  positive  results  regardircl  the  adeauacy,  the
timeliness, and the satisfactory outputs which generally met the targets.
The project evaluation and assessment to support the above concluded result
is shown in the Summary Sheet for Project Review, and details of
incremental financial and economic rates of return in Annexes 1,2 and 3.
Though the financial spending, in respect of the project cost and
the loan, was regarded well managed, the timeliness of the disbursement
from the loan was rather behind schedule which resulted in three time
extensions of loan closing date, from originally April 30, 1988 to April
30, 1991.

A.  OVERALL SUMMARY (PROJECT PERFORMANCE)
1. Project Purpose, Goal, and Accomplishment
EGAT's purpose to expand the mine to increase lignite production
as substitution of imported oil was fulfilled.  The coal supply to the
seven lignite-fired power units at Mae Moh has greatly reduced the
dependence on the fuel oil and has saved a large amount of budget during
the plant operation. The goal to produce lignite of 5.0 million tonnes per
year for power generation was also accomplished sooner than scheduled due
to earlier operation of the additional units 5-6-7.
2.   Financial Spending
The revised project cost for the mine expansion for power units
5-6-7 was estimated USS 86.240 million. The actual spending of USS 75.943
million was lower than planned by 12 per cent.
The revised funding sources for this project were in form of loan
from the Bank, supplier's credit from KFW, Government contributions, and
EGAT's own revenue.
Because of cancellation of waste handling system pturchase, the
originally agreed loan amount of US.S 59.1 million was requested by EGAT to
reduce to US$ 15.0 million.
For disbursement, the loan amounts were mainly spent on equipment
and  engineering  services.   Upto August 6, 1991         the  loan  of. US;
14,360,557.28 out of US$ 15.0 million was disbursed. The final balance of
USS 639,442.72 or 4.26% of the loan was cancelled due to the latest agreed
closing date.
3.   Lesson Learned
During the course of project implementation; EGAT have learned
about the advantages of contracting out the oyerburden remoyal and the
equipment maintenance work.
EGAT's original mining strategy was to carry out the overburden
removal  activities  by  its  work  force.   However,  after  consideration
of previous experience in contracting out the oyerburden removal,
coincidentally with i-he Government's National Borrowing Plan and the Debt
Ceiling Policy, EGAT, then revised the mine operation plan and decision was
made to contract out the long-term overburden removal. According to this
strategy, EGAT could reduce the inyestment cost for procurement of
equipment and spare parts and meet the Government's policy in promoting the
private firms to undertake the large scale contract.



-11-
The equipment maintenance contract could also solve the delav
problem in waiting for spareparts and thus improve the overall maintenamce
performance. Besides, the increasing of staff could be controlled in line
with EGAT's policy.
4.   Conclusion
The project was executed successfully as the mine could produce
lignite of 5.0 million tonnes per year for supply to all seven power units
as planned.
With regard to the privatization policy, it is advantageous for
EGAT in contracting out the overburden removal which resulted in
considerable  cost  reduction.   Besides,  the  invitation  for competitive
bidding, EGAT could gain benefit by getting the most reasonable price.
From the evaluation of economic impact, the incremental analysis
based on two cases i.e. mine expansion only, and the combined mine and
power development, the economic rates of return are 15.96% and 12.55%
respectively which are lower than the original estimate in the SAR (case 1
- 17.20%, case 2 = 14.30% respectively), but still above the estimated
opportunity cost of capital in Thailand of 12%.
It can be seen also in the financial impact analysis that the
incremental rate of return of 15.85% for the mine expansion only is above
the estimate in the SAR (9.20%) while 9.13% of the second case based on
the combined mine and power development is lower than the estimate in the
SAR (12.00%L However, they are still above the original estimates under the
existing covenants which require to have the rate of return of at least 8%,
by FY 1982 and thereafter.
According to the rate of return analysis, it could be assumed
that the Mae Moh Mine Expansion Project for Power Urnits 5-6-7 is feasible.

6.   Proiect Results
A. Direct Benefits
6.1       The mining expansion for Power Plans 5, 6 and 7 has created
additional job opportunities, raised living standards and substantially
improved the quality of life of the local population. About 370 families had
to be resettled approximately 7 km to the west of the mining area. Each
household received fair compensation along with a farm and family land plot.
The resettlement area has developed into a good sized community complete with
better roads, water supplies, electricity, market area, health center, primary
school, recreation area and religion center.

B. Economic Impact
6.2       The economic rate of return on the project is reevaluated by
adopting the same approach as used in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR). The
analyses are carried out in two separated bases:
(a) on an incremental basis with and without the project, and
(b)  on a substitution basis whereby the relative benefits and costs of
the mining and power development are compared to a coastal power
plant burning imported coal under the assumption that a 450 MW coal-
fired plant would substitute for the combined mining and power
investment for Mae Moh Units 5-7.
6.3       For all calculations, cost and benefit streams are based on 1990
terms. Import duties, taxes and interest during construction are excluded.
The analysis are made over the same study period as used in the SAR. The
Manufacturing Unit Value (MUV) index was used to convert the foreign currency
(FC) portion to 1990 terms while Publc Fixed Capital Formation Deflator
(PFCD) is used for the local currency (LC) portion.
Incremental Analysis
6.4       Economic rate of return estimates were made on the two cases:
(a)  Case 1 - Mine Expansion Only.  The cost of mine expansion alone is
compared to revenues from sale of lignite to the power plant at the
lignite transfer price. Sales revenues are calculated based on the
sales tonnage of lignite production of the mire. The actual value
of lignite transfer price are used for year 1985 to 1990 and the
estimated value is used for 1991 and assumed constant thereafter.
The incremental capital cost contains only the investment for the
mine expansion, the replacement expenditures of the mine equipments
are omitted since the actual project cost of those equipments are
difficult to analyze. Operation costs comprise EGAT operating costs
together with the contractor costs for removal of overburden.
(b) Case 2 - Combined Mine and Power DeveloRment. The combined cost of
mine development and Power Units 5-7 are compared with incremental
energy sales (GWh) generated from the power plants. The cost of
lignite production is used to represent the fuel cost of the power
plants. The sales revenues are calculated based on actual tariffs
for year 1985 to 1990, and the estimate values of 1991 are used and
assumed constant after that.



- 22 -
6.5       The economic rate of returns on the project based on the incremental
basis of the two cases compared with the SAR results are:
SAR            Reevaluated
Case 1                         17.20                15.96
Case 2                         14.30                12.55
The details of cost and benefit stream of each case is shown in Annex 2.
It can be seen that the reevaluated values of economic rates of return are
slightly lower than the original estimate which is mainly the result of the
lower lignite transfer price and power tariff and also the higher cost of
Power Units 5-7.
Substitution Analysis
6.6       The economic rate of return based on a substitutional basis is made
by analyzing the differential cash flow of the project mining operation
combined with power development and the imported coal-fired plant. The
benefit stream comprises the sales revenue from Mae Moh Power Units 5-7 and
the 450 MW imported coal-fired plant. Both sales revenues are based on the
same tariff rates.
6.7       The capital and operating costs for the proposed mine and power
development at Mae Moh are the same as used in the Incremental Analysis. The
capital and operating cost of the 450 MW imported coal-fired plant are
allocated from the cost of the 700 MW Ao Phai Plant with the associated
transmission system. The cost of coal is adopted from the CIF price estimated
by Industry and Energy Operations Division of the IBRD on May 29, 1991 and
ircluded cost of inland transportation. The coal price of US$54/ton is
applied for the year 1985 to 1991 and assumed 0.9% p.a. increase in real terms
from 1992 to 2006 and assumed constant after that.
6.8       The calculated economic rate of return based on substitutional basis
compared with the 6AR result is:
SAR            Reevaluated
Economic Rate of Return        13.70               13.75
C. Financial Impact
6.9       The financial rates of return of the project are estimated on the
incremental basis of:
(a) the mine expansion only (Case 1), and
(b) combined mine and power development (Units 5-7) which are designed
as one package (Case 2).



- 23 -
The cost and benefit streams of the project are derived from the same approach
as applied for the economic rate of return study, but the import duties, taxes
and royalties are included.
6.10      The financial rates of returns of the two cases compared with the
values calculated at the project appraisal are:
SAR            Reevaluated
Case 1                          9.20              15.85
Case 2                         12.00               9.13
It can be seen that present financial rate of return for Case 1 is higher than
previously estimated while Case 2 is lower. The main reason is that for Case
1 the capital and operating cost of mining is much lower while the total
present value of sales revenue is slightly increased and for Case 2 the higher
capital and operating cost of Power Units 5-7 bring down the financial rate of
return of the whole package. The present value based on 1990 base year at 12
percent discount rate of each item can be compared below:
