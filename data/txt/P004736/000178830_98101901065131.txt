THAILAND
SECOND MAE MOH LIGNITE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Kingdom of Thailand and the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) have requested a Bank loan to help
finance the cost of a second stage expansion of the Mae Moh open pit
lignite mine, increasing production capacity from 2.8 to about 5.0 million
tonnes per year. The first expansion was financed in part by the Bank
(Loan 1852-TH) in 1980. The proposed Project forms part of (i) a long term
national development strategy to develop indigenous energy resources to
reduce dependence on oil imports, and (ii) a medium term investment program
to increase use of lignite for power generation from 11% in 1982 to an
estimated 25% in 1990. The expansion in lignite production would be used
to fuel three 150 MW power plants (Units 5-7) under construction at Mae
Moh, increasing lignite-fired power generation at Mae Moh from 375 MW to
825 MW. The Mae Moh mine and associated power plants are owned and
operated by EGAT.
1.02      The Project's financing requirement, including escalation,
contingencies, interest during construction and working capital, is
estimated at US$250 million, of which about US$153 million in foreign
exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$59.1 million would cover 24% of the
financing requirements. The balance of US$190.9 million will be provided
from a grant from the Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB), a
loan from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), commercial borrowings,
Government equity contributions and EGAT's internal cash generation.
1.03      The Project was appraised in January, 1983 and a follow up
mission was made in June, 1983. The appraisal team consisted of
Mrs. M. 0. Smith, Mr. P. Kotschwar and Mr., A. Leon.
II. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A.   Energy Consumption
2.01      During the 1970s energy consumption in Thailand grew at a rapid
pace (averaging 8.8% p.a.) due to growth and structural change in the
economy that expanded industrial and service sectors as well as
commercialized agriculture. The growth in energy consumption was
unrestrained by domestic energy prices, which were not adjusted in line
with increases in international oil prices. In 1981, total commercial
energy consumption in Thailand was 16.2 million tonnes of oil equivalent
(toe), compared to 5.9 million toe in 1970.



-2-
2.02      The efficient development of Thailand's indigenous energy
resources is of primary importance to reducing the country's import
dependence, increasing its fore4gn exchange savings and promoting its
industrial development. Following the two oil shocks in the 1970s, the
average value of Thailand's energy imports as a share of total imports rose
from 13.4% between 1970-74 to 28% between 1979-81. The average value of
energy imports in the two periods rose ten-fold (from Baht 5.1 to 52.0
billion) and by 1980, the economy's export earnings required to finance
energy imports reached 45%. Virtually all petroleum products, accounting
for 71% of total energy, were imported or were refined from imported
crude.
2.03      In response to the economic developments of the 1970s, the
Government prepared the Fifth Five Year National Economic and Social
Development Plan (1982-86) which addressed four interrelated basic energy
sector issues: (i) development of indigenous energy resources, such as
natural gas, lignite and hydroelectricity; (ii) establishment of rational
energy pricing policies; (iii) promotion of energy conservation programs,
and (iv) improvement of energy sector management, coordination of policies
and investments.
2.04      Prospects for meeting the Plan's energy sector objectives in the
1980s are good. Since the Plan was formulated, domestic energy prices have
been adjusted to reflect economic costs for most products (para. 2.14).
The growth of energy consumption has been sharply reduced for most products
(from an average 8.8% p.a. in the 1970s to about 2.5% p.a. since 1979), due
to the steep rise in energy prices and the global recession which has
slowed Thailand's economic growth.
2.05      Based on the development of natural gas and lignite resources
proven to date and on the continued expansion of hydro potential, as well
as energy conservation and curtailed energy demand, particularly for
petroleum products, Thailand should be able to achieve a structural shift
in composit±on of its energy consumption, reducing the share of energy
imports in its overall energy consumption from 89% in 1981 to 38% by 1990.
The share of lignite in total energy consumption is expected to increase
from 4% in 1981 to 10% in 1990.
B.   Energy Resources
2.06      Natural gas reserves in the Gulf of Thailand are currently
estimated to amount to about 20 trillion cubic feet (tcf), of which about
4 tcf are proven. Gas production began in September 1981 in the Erawan
field at a rate of 70-80 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD).
During 1982 and 1983 production gradually increased to about 150 MMSCFD,
but remained short of the 200 to 250 MMSCFD which had originally been
expected. The shortfall is attributable to technical difficulties and to
the fact that the gas reserves are distributed over smaller than expected
reservoirs. Proven reserves have recently been reassessed downwards.



-3-
2.07      Exploration and current finds of oil in Northern Thailand have
improved expectations of increased domestic oil production. Three small
oil fields in the Fang area currently yield about 800 barrels per day
(bpd). Production at Sirikit began in 1983 at a rate of 5,000 bpd,
increased to 10,000 bpd by January 1984, and is expected to increase to
17,000 bpd by 1986. Oil shale deposits in Tak province are under
feasibility study by the Department of Mineral Resources, with the
assistance of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. At
present oil prices, however, oil shale development is unlikely to be
economically viable.
2.08      Substantial increases in Thailand's lignite deposits have been
indicated by recent drillings. Known reserves are 857 million tonnes of
which 814 million tonnes are at Mae Moh (para. 2.28). Mae Moh's reserves
are sufficient to sustain 1,725 MW in power generating capacity for at
least 30 years, and are the basis for estimates that by 1990 about 25% of
EGAT's total generation could be from lignite-fired thermal stations.
2.09      The total hydroelectric potential of Thailand's rivers is
estimated at about 9,300 MW, not including the international rivers (Mekong
and Salween) whose development potential of 25,000 MW is currently beyond
reach due to major political and social obstacles. About 1,380 MW of
hydropower are now in operation, 2,100 MW are under construction, and about
2,500 MW in 25 projects are at various stages of identification or
feasibility study. Mini-hydro potential at over 100 sites is estimated at
about 3,290 MW. According to current plans, hydropower production will
increase at an average annual rate of about 13% between 1981 and 1995.
2.10      Thailand's other energy resources include fuelwood and possibly
geothermal enEry. Fuelwood resources, once plentiful, are rapidly being
depleted and deforestation is becoming a serious problem. Geothermal
exploration is being carried out by EGAT in the northern part of Thailand
near Chiangmai.
C.   Sector Policies
2.11      Energy sector policy and planning functions involve the Cabinet,
the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) and the National
Energy Administration (NEA). In principle, NEA, which is under the
Ministry of Science, Technology and Energy, is responsible for sector
planning and coordination. NEA, however, is a relatively weak institution
and energy sector decisions are often taken ad hoc by various Cabinet
committees and subcommittees.  There are, however, limitations in NEA's
statutory power which restrain its formal authority. As part of the
Government's structural adjustment program, an energy strategy formulation
study is being initiated to provide the basis for determining an
appropriate approach to energy sector p'lanning and for improving the
institutional policy framework.



-4-
2.12      A number of public agencies are involved in the energy sector in
Thailand. For power, three state enterprises provide the overriding share
of electric services (para. 2.19). For petroleum and gas products, the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT), under the Ministry of Industry, has
an important role in importing, producing, and marketing, along with an
active private sector. The Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) in the
Ministry of Industry has the main jurisdictional authority for the oil and
gas sub-sector. The DMR also exercises control over lignite mining through
enforcement of mining laws and regulations, and granting of mining licenses
and concessions.
2.13      Energy is now the single most important sector for public
spending. For the Fifth Plan period, the NESDB projects that the energy
sector will account for about 26% of total governmental spending, up from
the average of 18% during the Fourth Plan period. Energy sector spending
weighs even more heavily in total public investment, at 31.9% in 1981, up
from 13.7% in 1977. The energy sector is expected to continue to account
for more than 50% of state enterprise investment throughout the Fifth Plan
period. EGAT is expected to retain its large share (55-75%) in energy
spending for the Fifth Plan period, with PTT continuing to grow in
importance as it is involved in further gas and oil development and
utilization projects.
2.14      Until 1979, Thailand's domestic energy prices were held
substantially below the average import price of oil. Since then, however,
the Government has increased domestic energy prices (by 160-180% between
1978-82) to reflect international price developments. Electricity tariffs
have also been raised and broadly reflect the marginal cost of power
generation, being set at levels that generate a financial rate of return of
about 8% on revalued assets (para. 3.13).
2.15      Thailand has established the price levels for its commercial
fuels on an individual basis and there is no coordinated pricing system
across the energy sector. The introduction of natural gas on a large
scale, the development of lignite and changes in petroleum product prices
are leading to substantial changes in energy consumption and investment
patterns.  The Government recently initiated two energy pricing studies to
rationalize pricing policies in the energy sector and promote the efficient
utilization of energy. The first study on lignite pricing, carried out
under the first Mae Moh Lignite project (Loan 1852-TH), was reviewed by
EGAT and the Bank in June 1983 and is in the final stages of completion.
The second study, undertaken in the context of the Structural Adjustment
Program (SAL I), covers petroleum products, and natural gas and its
constituents and is now under review.
2.16      Tariff levels were adequate throughout the late 1960s and the
early 1970s, and the financial position of the power subsector remained
strong. During that period, the electricity subsector enjoyed substantial
economies of scale through shifts to hydroelectric and large steam
generation coupled with rapid increases in electricity demand, allowing



-5-
periodic generation coupled with rapid increases in the demand, allowing
periodic tariff reductions. This trend was reversed with the fuel crisis
and economic downturn of 1973/74 which necessitated large increases in
tariffs. Only partial adjustments, however, were politically feasible.
2.17      Severe droughts in 1977 and 1978 adversely affected the
thermal/hydro generation mix, and in 1979 fuel oil prices increased some
115%. In an attempt to prevent higher energy costs from accelerating
inflation, the Government chose to delay passing on the rising costs of
electricity to consumers. By mid-1979, the Government, faced with mounting
criticism of its handling of the economy, introduced direct budgetary
subsidies on electricity tariffs, costing an estimated US$9.0 million per
month.
2.18      In 1980, however, the Government agreed to a Plan of Action to
remove subsidies and restore the sector's financial viability, in
connection with Loan 1852-TH. This plan was implemented through a
surcharge on heavy consumers established in August 1980 and tariff
increases in October 1980, January 1981 and April 1981. Thus, despite a
difficult political climate and rapid inflation, the Government implemented
overall increases of 158% in EGAT's electricity tariff between February
1980 and April 1981 and eliminated oil subsidies.
D.   The Power Subsector
1.   Institutions
2.19      Thailand has three autonomous state electricity enterprises.
EGAT, under the direction of the Prime Minister's Office, is responsible
for power generation and transmission and sells bulk power to large
industrial consumers and to power distribution authorities. EGAT, as the
beneficiary of the proposed loan, is described in more detail in Chapter
III. The Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) was established in 1958
as a wholly-owned Government corporation under the Ministry of Interior
with responsibility for supplying electricity to the Bangkok Metropolitan
Area covering the provinces of Bangkok, Thon Buri, Nonthaburi and Samut
Prakon. MEA purchases all of its energy from EGAT. The Provincial
Electricity Authority (PEA) was established in September 1960 as a
wholly-owned Government corporation under the Ministry of Interior with
responsibility for providing and distributing electricity in all provinces
of the country except in the areas served by MEA. PEA purchases most of
its energy in bulk from EGAT but also generates small quantities in areas
not yet connected to the grid. PEA is the Government agency responsible
for implementing rural and provincial electrification programs.
2.20      In addition to NESDB and NEA (para. 2.11) six other Government
agencies have a direct interest in the power sector: the Committee for
Power Policy and Development (CPPD); the Budget Bureau; Tariff Rate
Committee (TRC); Ministry of Finance (MOF); Foreign Loan Committee (FLC);
and Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT). These agencies review: tariff
recommendations; capital project proposals and budgets for submission to



-6-
the Council of Ministers; annual financial performance; and requests for
Government equity and loans. None of them has overall policy
responsibility; decisions on the sector are arrived at after all the
agencies including the state utilities reach a consensus. The system is
designed to ensure that sector capital expenditures are rigidly
controlled.  PTT's interest in the sector arises from the fact that EGAT,
as the utility responsible for generation, will be for some time to come,
a major customer for natural gas and is the largest customer for fuel oil.
2.21      Power subsector coordination among the different government
agencies concerned is achieved through (i) the operations of the Load
Forecast Working Group, made up of representatives from NESDB, the NEA,
EGAT, PEA and MEA; (il) the current procedure for setting electricity rates
whereby attention is given to the cross-funding necessary to ensure that
EGAT, PEA and MEA each generate an adequate proportion of their capital
investments and to prevent cash imbalances; (iii) CPPD which was formed in
1977 to oversee the functioning and development of the subsector and to
provide overall coordination; and (iv) the Ministry of Science, Energy and
Technology which was established in 1979 for the development of
non-conventional energy sources and new uses of existing energy sources.
While coordination in the power subsector is satisfactory, possibilities
for further strengthening of policy coordination 4in the energy sector as a
whole are being pursued through continuing dialogue with the Government and
under the Bankts structural adjustment loans to Thailand (para. 2.11).

At the end of FY82, EGAT owned 88.5% of the country's 4,620 MW power
generating capacity, PEA and NEA 1.7%, and self-generating industries
9.8%.  Steam plants represented about 48% of installed capacity, hydro 30%,
gas turbines 16%, and diesel 6%. About 71% of the electricity generated
during FY81 relied on imported sources of energy. Total electricity
consumption was 13,886 GWh in FY81 or 290 kWh per capita.
3.   Investment Program
2.23      Since FY79, power demand growth has slowed dramatically from an
average annual rate of 12.5% (FY73-79) to 6.4% for the three year period
ending September 1982, in response to (i) significant 4-ncreases in power
prices (para. 2.18); and (ii) slower overall economic growth during the
period as compared with that of the 1970s. Accordingly, official power
demand growth projections have been scaled back from 11% for the 1980-86
period to 8.5% for the 1982-92 period to reflect the economic downturn
(para. 3.17).
2.24      EGAT's total investment program for the Fifth Plan period has
also been reduced and rescheduled (from an estimated cost of Baht 95
billion to Baht 77 billion). Projects under construction and which are
designed largely to replace imported oil with domestic energy resources in
the medium term (before 1988), have been retained within the program
including the planned power Units 5-7 and proposed lignite expansion at Mae
Moh, while other projects have been deleted or postponed. Details of
EGAT's power development plans are shown in Annex 1.
E.   Bank Participation in the Sector
1.   Previous Loans
2.25      The Bank has made eleven loans to EGAT and its predecessor
utilities, totalling $542 million, to help finance power plants and
transmission facilities, and another of $72 million for lignite
production.1/ In addition, three loans for a total of $136.6 million were
made to PEA7to help finance its Accelerated Rural Electrification Projects
and the Provincial Power Distribution Project (Loans 1527-TH, 1871-TH and
2312-TH). Details of Bank lending to EGAT are given in Annex 2.
2.26      Since 1978, the Bank has expanded its assistance into the natural
gas sector, starting with a $4.9 million engineering loan to the Natural
Gas Organization of Thailand (NGOT, absorbed by PTT in 1979) in 1978 (Loan
S-10-TH).  The loan financed the engineering work required for a first gas
pipeline project, technical assistance to NGOT and a study of gas
1/ Loans No. 175-TH (1957), 333-TH (1963), 406-TH (1965, 489-TH (1967),
655-TH (1970), 790-TH (1971), 977-TH (1974), 1485-TH (1977), 1690-TH
(1979, 1852-TH (1980), 2000-TH (1981).

reserves. Further loans to PTT, totaling $197 million, were made in 1979
and 1982 to finance the natural gas pipeline and a gas separation plant and
marketing facilities (Loans 1773-TH and 2184-THl, respectively).
2.   Project Performance Audits
2.27      To date, project performance audit reports have been prepared on
three of the early loans to EGAT: the First Power Project (Loan 655-TH),
the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project (Loan 798-TH) and the Ban Chao
Nen (Srinagarind) Hydroelectric Project (Loan 977-TH). The audit reports
concluded that the major objectives of the respective projects had been
met. EGAT complied with all the covenants and its financial performance
was satisfactory.
F.   Lignite Resources
1.   Reserves and Production
2.28      In the last two years, known lignite reserves in Thailand have
increased from 750 to 857 million tonnes predominantly at Mae Moh where
reserve levels have increased by 25% (from 650 to 814 million tonnes).
EGAT has been exploring intensively over the last several years at Mae Moh
and also in the vicinity of Krabi mine, where known reserves are limited
(20 million tonnes) but where promising new outcrops have been discovered.
EGAT expenditures on exploration have been in the range of US$1.4-2.0
million p.a. Reserves have also been developed at Li (10 million tonnes)
through NEA's relatively small program for exploration and drilling of
lignite, at Mae Tip (11 million tonnes) and at various other areas.
Details of reserves are given in Annex 3.  Thai lignite deposits are of
medium to good quality. Heating values lie in the 2,300 to 3,000 kcal/kg
range (as received). Volatile matters can be as high as 35%, ash content
usually varies from 20 to 30%, and sulphur is generally high.
2.29      Lignite in Thailand is used almost exclusively for large-scale
power generation at the mine site since its high moisture and ash content
make it uneconomical to transport, and its potential disaggregation and
spontaneous combustion characteristics make it unsafe to store. Power
generation accounted for over 90% of lignite use in 1982. The primary
industrial uses of lignite are in tobacco curing, cement and other, minor
uses such as ceramics. Most of the lignite used in industries is produced
in four small mines, two in the Li Basin (Ban Pa Kha and Li mines, managed
by NEA and Ban Pu Chiang Mai Fuel Ltd.) and one each at Mae Tip (Phrae
Lignite Co.) and Mae Tuen (Thai Lignite Ltd.).
2.30      Between 1978 and 1979, when the first expansion at Mae Moh mine
was started, lignite production in Thailand more than doubled (from 0.6
million tonnes to 1.3 million tonnes) and over the last five years
(1977-82) has shown an average growth rate of 25% p.a. The major sources
of production are the EGAT-owned and operated mines, Mae Moh and Krabi, as
shown in the table below.

2.   Development Prospects
2.31       The major development prospects for lignite are at Mae Moh where
814 million tonnes of reserves are known. Lignite production capacity at
Mae Moh is currently under expansion (under Loan 1852-TH) to 2.8 million
tpy to support 375 MW power generation capacity (Power Units 1-4); Unit 4
(150 MW) will be completed in May 1984. Under the proposed Project, the
mine would be expanded to 5 million tpy to support an increased power
generation capacity of 825 MW to be achieved by March 1986, through the
addition of Power Units 5-7 (150 MW each), construction of which is well
advanced (para. 4.26).
2.32       Long term plans for the Mae Moh mine provide for an eventual
expansion to 12 million tpy to support an ultimate power generation
capacity of 1,725 MW. This will be achieved through the construction of
Power Units 8, 9 and 10 (300 MW each), to be completed in the early 1990s.
No investments for the latter expansions are called for before 1986-87, at
which time EGAT would review the proposed investments in light of current
power load forecasts, the availability of alternative fuels and their
comparative economic costs.



-10-
2.33       EGAT has included in its investment plans the development of
potential new reserves at Krabi (para. 2.28) in support of a new 75 MW
power plant to start-up in 1988 and two additional power plants (75 MW
each) in 1989 and 1990. The present mine (0.4 million tpy) and 60 MW power
plant will be retired in mid-1990.  These plans are at an early stage since
lignite reserves at Krabi still require delineation and development.
Development of lignite by industrial and other small concerns is expected
to be modest due to the relatively small size of private holdings and
optimum use of lignite for power.
3.   Lignite Pricing
2.34       Since Mae Moh lignite i-s produced by EGAT exclusively to supply
its Mae Moh power units, there is no market price reflecting its relati've
worth.  Under the first Mae Moh Lignite Project i4t was agreed with EGAT
that the financial separation of the Company's mining operations from its
electricity operations was required to ensure that the mines were operated
in a financially viable manner and that the economic scarcity value (rent)
of lignite was not being ignored in its use as a fuel for power
generation. In order to establish an appropriate price for intra-company
sales of lignite by the Lignite Mine Department to EGAT's electricity
operations, it was also agreed that EGAT would undertake a lignite pricing
study, based on opportunity cost principles. This study was contracted to
Meta Systems Incorporated (MSI, United States); a draft was completed in
January 1983 and, after joint review by EGAT and the Bank, is now being
finalized.
2.35       The results of the pricing study indicated that the lignite
transfer price of US$19.22/ton in effect during 1983 was close to the
estimated lignite opportunity cost of US$18/ton.  In addition, it is
estimated that, under current estimates of the size of reserves, lignite
demand, future mining costs and substitute fuel prices, the economic rent
element, or depletion premium, of lignite would rise from US$0.52/ton in
1983 to US$3.55/ton by the year 2000. The economic rent accounts for the
cost to the economy of using an exhaustible resource that deprives the
economy of future welfare (by reducing the amount of lignite available in
the future to generate power at a lower cost than other known energy
sources).
2.36       As the opportunity cost of lignite is strongly influenced by
movements in the prices of substitute fuels, particularly steam coal, and
the estimated date of depletion of the lignite resource, assurances were
obtained during negotiations that EGAT would carry out a lignite pricing
policy review in 1985, for application in 1986, and at least every three
years thereafter.  In addition, EGAT agreed that the lignite transfer price
would continue to be based on economic principles, while meeting the
objective of ensuring the financial viability of EGAT's Lignite Mine
Departments.  In order that these dual objectives continue to be met pri or
to the next full price review, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that EGAT would increase the price by 2% each year, in real terms, in 1984
and 1985.

III. EGAT - THE BORROWER
3.01      The borrower would be EGAT.  EGAT is a wholly-owned Government
corporation established in 1968 through merger of the Lignite, the Yanhee
Electricity and the North East Electricity Authorities to provide for the
efficient supply of electricity throughout the country.
A.   Organization and Management
3.02      EGAT is organized and functions as modern public utility with a
considerable degree of autonomy. EGAT is charged with the operation of the
power generation and transmission installations under its jurisdiction and
the establishment of such new facilities as required for the power grid
down to transmission voltages of 115 kV and 69 kV. EGAT also owns and
operates lignite mines at Mae Moh and Krabi.
3.03      EGAT is functionally organized with deputy managers for
administration, technical planning and procurement, engineering and
construction and hydro and thermal power plant operations. The Lignite
Mine Department reports to the Deputy Manager for Construction. Details
are shown in Annex 4.
B.   The Lignite Mnie Department
3.04      EGAT's Lignite Mine Department consists of a headquarters office
in Bangkok and two field offices, at Mae Moh and at Krabi, with direct
operational responsibilities for the mines at these sites. The
headquarters office has four divisions responsible for geology, short- and
long-term planning, feasibility studies and technical designs and
production cost analyses. The detailed organization is shown in Chart
3-1.
3.05      The Department has been reorganized and expanded in size and
scope over the last three years to support EGAT's lignite development
plans. Details of the new organization of the Mine Department are shown in
Chart 3-1. The main changes are (i) the expansion of the Mae Moh Mines
Division to include new mine planning, maintenance planning, geology and
quality control, training and computer sections, and management positions
(assistant superintendents) for engineering, administration and operations;
and (ii) the establishment of the Mine Accounting Division under the
supervision and control of the Controller's Department to handle cost
control, planning and budgeting and accounting for the mine operations.
EGAT transferred financial management responsibility for mine operations to
the Lignite Mine Department in connection with the first Mae Moh Lignite
Project.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that EGAT would continue
to operate its mining activities as Mine Accounting Centers and to maintain
separate accounts and financial statements for such centers.

3.06      The Department's new mine accounting system is soundly based but
not yet fully used to facilitate efficient management of mining
operations. This is due to lack of familiarity of the Lignite Mine
Department with the management control techniques that the system permits
and inadequate communication between the Mine Accounting Division, which
prepares the financial data, and Lignite Mine Department personnel. To
facilitate this communication, EGAT plans to relocate the Division from the
Controller to the Lignite Mine Department. The Department plans, also, (i)
to establish quarterly planning meetings between the Mine Accounting and
Mine Planning Divisions; and (ii) to include a financial training program,
devoted specifically to the Planning Division of the Lignite Mine
Department, on the basic financial and managerial aspects of the mine
accounting system.
3.07      The Department has successfully developed a professional core of
capable technical personnel that have gained experience through
implementation of the first mine expansion at Mae Moh, the only large
open-pit mine in Thailand. The Department lends its services on occasion
to NEA, DMR and other Government agencies with mining interests.
C.   Manpower and Training
3.08      Management and staff of both the Lignite Mine Department and EGAT
as a whole are competent and well-qualified. EGAT had a total of 26,736
employees at the end FY82. Manpower has grown at an annual rate of 13.8%
between 1978-1982 to meet the needs of the increased numbers of projects
under construction and the Mae Moh mine expansion. Lignite Mine Department
staffing totals 2,023. Of the total, 1,362 are heavy equipment operators,
technicians and skilled labor mostly at the mine sites and 288 are
semi-skilled laborers. The balance comprises engineers (87), geologists
(17) and supporting staff (269). Staffing has increased by about 60% in
the last three years, primarily due to the first major expansion at Mae
Moh. The Department is conscious of the implications of overstaffing on
overhead costs and is planning no further major increases, and possible
slight reductions, in manpower over the next several years. Under the
Project, EGAT has taken action to limit further additions to the permanent
work force (para. 4.22). Details of EGAT's and the Lignite Mine
Department's manpower are shown in Annex 5.
3.09      Training is on-going under the first Mae Moh Project, in mine
planning and operations as well as in financial forecasting, variance
analysis and capital investment evaluation. Technical assistance is being
provided in establishing a management information reporting system that
provides feedback to the Lignite Mine Department necessary for managerial
decisions, and information to relevant financial departments (Controller,
Budget, Treasury, Internal Audit, Systems and Procedure) in a timely
manner.



-14-
3.10      Under the Project, EGAT has agreed to prepare a detailed
definition of supplemental training requirements (para. 4.11) to provide
the reinforcement necessary for full implementation of the proposed
Project, including the strengthening of technical, financial and managerial
functions of its Lignite Mine Department.
3.11      During the past eight years EGAT has experienced rapid growth,
with sales and peak demand doubling over the period (10.5% p.a. growth), as
shown in the table below. Losses have risen slowly but, at 8.9%, are still
within acceptable limits; the annual load factor has fluctuated over the
years but shown a slight improving trend. As mentioned above (para. 3.08),
employment has grown rapidly due to the large investment program and the
manpower needs of the Mae Moh mine and power plant expansions.

D.   Financial Position
3.12      During the FY77-79 period, EGAT consistently generated operating
surpluses, in spite of large increases in fuel costs and Government-imposed
constraints on tariff adjustments as a part of the Government's
anti-inflationary measures, through greater efficiency resulting from
increases in hydro generation and larger steam plants. In FY80,



-15-
however, EGAT's financial position deteriorated (with a loss of US$44
million equivalent in FY80). To help solve EGAT's liquidity problems
during 1980, the Government granted EGAT equity contributions of Baht 1.2
billion (US$59 million) and also arranged a transfer of Baht 100 million
(US$5 million) from MEA and PEA to EGAT. EGAT also increased its
borrowings in 1980 over the previous year by about 20%, These equity and
loan funds ensured that EGAT's normal operations and investment program
were not affected, although EGAT was forced to reduce its working capital,
eroding its current ratio.
3.13      Since then, implementation of the Plan of Action (para. 2.18) to
restore EGAT's and the sector's financial soundness has been effective.
EGAT's income recovered to US$126 million equivalent in FY82 and US$154
million in FY 1983 (before the Government appropriation), and its liquidity
position improved substantially. These results were better than expected
mainly due to (i) the unusually high percentage of energy generated by
hydro plants in place of thermal plants using heavy oil (resulting in an
estimated cost savings of US$39 million); and (ii) lower than expected
interest rates on borrowings. EGAT's rate of return on net revalued fixed
assets, which was negative in FY80, increased to over 8% in FY81 and 11% in
FY82 and FY83, meeting the existing covenant that requires EGAT to have a
rate of return of at least 8% by FY82 and thereafter. This covenant, and
that requiring an 8% rate of return for the sector as a whole, are repeated
in the proposed loan (para. 6.05).
3.14      EGAT's detailed historial financial statements are shown in
Annex 6 and slected financial indicators are given below. These indicators
show the sharp improvement in the rate of return since 1981 (para. 3.13) as
a result of a 73% rise in the average electricity price and consequent
increase in the debt service coverage, ratio from 0.6 in 1980 to 2.0 in
1983.
3.15      Under the first Mae Moh Project, the Lignite Mine Department
began preparation of financial statements for the mine operations, making
use of a transfer price based on production costs plus a margin. These
statements (beginning in FY81) have been audited as part of EGAT's regular
audit and show that the mining operations had a net operating profit of
Baht 115.4 million (US$5.0 million) in FY1983 after covering all expenses
including depreciation, interest, and apportionment of central
administration expenses. EGAT's Lignite Mine Department detailed
historical income statements and balance sheets are shown in Annex 7.

E.   Accounting and Auditing
3.16       The accounting system is adequate and the staff is competent.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that EGAT will continue to submit
unaudited quarterly and audited annual financial statements for the mining
operations and EGAT on both an unconsolidated and consolidated basis.
EGAT's audit is performed by the National Audit Council, the Government
organization responsible for auditing all state enterprises. The
international accounting firm, Coopers and Lybrand, is retained as
financial consultants to cooperate with the National Audit Council and
issue a separate report on the annual accounts.  To date, reports have been
submitted on time and the performance of the consultants has been
satisfactory. EGAT will continue to employ independent external auditors.
F.   Load Forecast and Development Plan
3.17       EGAT's development plans are based on the consolidation of
detailed forecasts made by MEA, PEA and the direct consumers after taking



-17-
into account the effects of load diversity, system losses and station
services. The load forecasts for MEA and PEA were derived by a study of
historical growth trends of different categories of consumers. The
sectoral load forecast is shown below:

Growth in the next few years is expected to be slightly higher than the
average over the past decade, declining to about 6.5% p.a. by the early
1990s and resulting in an average demand growth of about 8.5% over the
1982-1992 decade.
3.18      EGAT's installed power generating capacity at the end of FY82 was
4,088 MW, of which oil-fired steam accounted for 40%, hydro 34%, gas
turbine 18%, lignite-fired steam 7%, and diesel 1%. This composition has
changed significantly since 1978 when oil-fired steam accounted for over
55% of installed capacity. EGAT's power development plan is based on the
principle of the least-cost sequence of development, following an extensive
study of alternative generation and transmission projects, using computer
programs available in-house. New additional capacity for the period
1983-1996 is estimated at 6,837.2 MW. By the end of 1996, EGAT's total
installed power generation capacity would be 11,045 MW, a 7.2% p.a. average
growth. Details are shown in Annex 1.
3.19      EGAT's development plan also involves the construction of
transmission lines and substations necessary for distribution and the
extension of the network to cope with increasing load requirements and to
improve system reliability and efficiency.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope and Objectives
4.01      A first lignite loan made by the Bank to EGAT (Loan No. 1852-TH)
became effective in 1980. It was designed to meet the incremental demand
of the power generating facilities up to and including the 150 MW Unit 4,
necessitating an increase in lignite production from 1.0 million to 2.8
million tpy. This first project has since been implemented with only minor



-18-
problems and is generally within budget. The proposed Project represents
the second stage of the mine expansion, to 5.0 million tpy by 1987, when
three additional power stations of 150 MW each (Units 5-7) will be
constructed, increasing the total generating capacity to 825 MW.
4.02      The scope of the second stage expansion Project for the Mae Moh
open pit lign4te mine includes engineering, procurement and erection of
mining and related equipment (mainly conveyor belts, semi-mobile crushers,
off-highway trucks, and auxiliary equipment), technical assistance,
training and civil works, to increase Mae Moh mine production capacity from
2.8 to about 5.0 million tpy.
The main Project objectives are:
(i) to increase the lignite-fired electricity generation capacity of
Thailand from 375 MW in 1984 to 825 MW in 1987, in order to
reduce the country's dependence on imported fuel oil for power
generation, in line with EGAT's least-cost development program;
(ii)  to ensure the economic and financial viability of the mining
operations through, inter alia, use of a lignite transfer price
that reflects the opportunity cost of substitute fuel and thai:
provides for financially sound operations;
(iii)  to strengthen EGAT's Lignite Mine Department in technical,
operational and financial aspects through the provision of
technical assistance and training in specialized areas, and to
strengthen its administrative capability in regard to large
overburden removal contracts; and
(iv)  to minimize any adverse environmental impact of lignite based
electricity generation.
B.,  Project Description
1.   The Mae Moh Lignite Deposit
4.03      The Mae Moh power and mine complex is located in North Thailan.d
in Lampang Province, approximately 650 km north of Bangkok and 12 km east
of the town of Lampang (Map IBRD No. 14430 RI). The main land use in the
area is commercial teakwood and tobacco cultivation; there is also some
limited subsistence agriculture. Population density in the basin is low
and the climate is tropical, with an average annual rainfall of 1,000 to
1,500 mm. The area is adequately served by paved roads and by a railspur
line which connects the site with the national rail system approximately 5
km to the south of Mae Moh.



-19-
4.04      Extensive exploration campaigns have been carried out over the
Mae Moh lignite deposit. Prior to 1978, some 1,720 boreholes were sunk.
From 1979 to 1981 EGAT, assisted by Longworth CMPS Engineers (Australia),
conducted some 73 km of high-resolution seismic lines and drilled a further
454 holes, totalling some 98,000 m. All exploration work was carried out
in a competent and professional manner. Fill-in drilling for detailed mine
planning is continuing, well ahead of the mine face.
4.05      Lignite reserves, with an average ash content of 22% and
calorific value of 22700 kcal/kg, were established at 814 million tonnes;
due to restrictions on pit design as a result of slope instability,
geological losses, and other factors, 451 million tonnes are presently
defined as mineable reserves. A further expansion to 1,725 MW of power
generating capacity would require about 335 million tonnes of lignite over
the plants' useful lifetime. Reserves, therefore, are ample and assured.
2.   Mine Planning
4.06      The first feasibility studies and mine plans for the Power Units
1-4 were prepared by Rheinbraun Consulting (RC, FR Germany), from 1972 to
1978. Subsequently, in 1980/81, Dr. Otto Gold Consultants (FR Germany)
prepared a Master Mining Plan (as covenanted under Loan 1852-TH), which was
then refined by RC, and now serves as the basis of EGAT's mine planning.
The Plan and subsequent feasibility study cover all mining activities
throughout the life of the Project, and take into account a possible
expansion to 1,725 MW (para. 2.32), foreseeing an ultimate pit depth of 200
meters and overall stripping ratio of 5.1 bank cubic meters (bm3) per
tonne. A Land Reclamation Plan has been prepared by RC (under Loan
1852-TH) based on these mining plans.
4.07      Geotechnical work for the determination of pit slope stability
(covenanted under Loan 1852-TH) has been undertaken by EGAT, RC, and
Longworth for the mine configuration required for Units 1-4. Further
geotechnical work is required in conjunction with the mine expansion for
Units 5-7 and will be carried out by consultants satisfactory to the Bank
under the technical assistance program (para. 4.10).  In view of the
importance of this work, assurances were obtained at negotiations that EGAT
would furnish to the Bank a complete report on mine slope stability
required by expansion plans by January 31, 1985.
4.08      In the end-of-life mine feasibility study, EGAT examined three
alternative mining methods: (i) trucks and shovels in conjunction with
semi-mobile crushers and conveyors; (ii) shovels, mobile crushers and
conveyors for overburden removal; and (ii±) bucket wheel excavators for
overburden removal in the upper benches of the pit. The shovel/truck/
semi-mobile crusher alternative in conjunction with conveyor belts and
stackers for both lignite and overburden transport has been selected by
EGAT. This is considered to be a technically sound decision as bucket
wheel excavators are not suitable for work under the relatively hard rock
mining conditions at Mae Moh and mobile crushers are at an experimental
stage of development and would be technically risky.



-20-
3.   Technical Assistance and Training
4.09      Although, over the last 10 years, EGAT's Mine Department has had
a very good record in implementing mine expansions and operating open-pit
mines at both Mae Moh and Krabi, the size and scope (including management
of the contractual work) of the next expansion requires training of
addittional technical personnel and technical assistance from abroad.
4.10      For this purpose, EGAT is the recipient of technical assistance
totaling A$5.7 million (US$4.9 million equivalent) under an agreement
between the Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB) and the
Government. The technical assistance covers both the Mae Moh and Krabi
mines and about US$4.2 million equivalent will relate to Mae Moh. The
objective is to assist EGAT in detailed mine design, mine management and
operation, geological and geotechnical investigations with regard to pit:
slope stability in connection with the extended mine configuration, and
environmental protection. The program will be carried out over a four-year
period (from mid-1983 to mid-1987), for a total of 283 man-months of
consulting services. The budgeted cost per man month, excluding equipment
and computing services, is approximately US$13,000 including subsistence
and travel, which is considered appropriate. The scope of work of the ADAB
program has been reviewed by the Bank and is considered to be
satisfactory. ADAB has selected a consultant (Coleman and Assoc.,
Australia) considered satisfactory by EGAT and the Bank.
4.11      The Project includes a limited amount of specialized follow-on
assistance to the ADAB program which is considered important to Project
implementation. This assistance consists of:
(i)  an estimated 100 man-months of foreign consulting services for
engineering, procurement assistance and erection supervision of
the conveyor systems, at an estimated cost of US$1.3 million;
(ii)  180 man-months of short-term training for technical personnel at
similar mine operations abroad, in countries other than
Australia, at an estimated cost of US$0.8 million; and
(iii)  about 7 man-months of on-the-job training for Mine Department
personnel in financial and management aspects of mine accounting
at an estimated cost of US$0.1 million.
The consulting services would be financed out of the proposed Bank loan,
while EGAT will finance the training out of its internal cash generation.
4.12      Detailed definition of the envisaged supplemental technical
training needs will be carried out by EGAT in consultation with the
Australian experts during the course of the Australian training program.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that EGAT would present to the
Bank a detailed technical training program and a detailed financial
training program as follows:
-    for the technical training no later than March 31, 1985, to start
implementation no later than July 31, 1985;



-21-
-    for the financial training no later than September 30, 1984, to
start implementation no later than January 31, 1985.
4.   Environmental Aspects
4.13      EGAT is conscientiously seeking to minimize the negative
environmental and health impact of its operations at Mae Moh and is now
preparing a general environmental impact statement for submission to the
Thai National Environmental Board. Mine reclamation (covenanted under Loan
1852-TH) is underway and EGAT has carried out a successful resettlement
program, relocating about 300 families from the mining area to a new
serviced village. EGAT has carried out a water sampling program for over
three years and heavy metal determinations have shown that no risk from
such substances is present.
4.14      With regard to air quality, electrostatic precipitators with
99.5% efficiency (as compared to 95% in the previous generating Units 1 and
2) were installed in order to minimize fly ash dust emissions. Ash
disposal is being made at disposal sites outside the excavated area
according to the Master Mining Plan (para. 4.06). EGAT has commissioned an
air-quality study with Simons Resources Consultants (Canada), financed by
the ADB under a previous power loan and by the Bank under Loan 1852-TH, and
has agreed to increase the stack height of Units 5-7, now under
construction, from 120 to 150 m, in order to comply with Bank guidelines
for sulphur dioxide ground-level concentration. The Bank has also financed
environmental monitoring equipment in order to strengthen the program
already in effect. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that EGAT
would continue to follow environmental standards staisfactory to the Bank
and the Government throughout the Project life.
C.   Project Management and Implementation
4.15      The Project is to be owned, implemented and operated by EGAT
which is the only sponsor. Responsibility for overall Project execution,
coordination and monitoring lies with the Directorate of the Lignite
Mine Department, which is at present successfully implementing the first
expansion phase.
1.   Project Management
4.16      Responsibility for overall project execution, coordination and
project monitoring lies with the Directorate of the Lignite Mine
Department.   Project management responsibilities are delegated to the
Deputy Director of the Department, a civil engineer with long experience in
project implementation, both in the power sector as well as the first Mae
Moh mine expansion. The Directorate is in charge of overall project
scheduling and monitoring, and coordination of project-related planning and
engineering activities. The Directorate liaises with EGAT's procurement
department and monitors project progress and costs through weekly, monthly,
quarterly and annual reports and frequent site visits, identifying problem



-22-
areas and taking corrective action. The Directorate also contracts,
supervises and deploys consultants to be used either in the technical or
financial divisions of the Lignite Mine Department, or at the mine site.
The organization of Project management is shown ln Chart 4-1,
4.17      Physical Project implementation will be under the responsibility
of the Superintendent, Mae Moh Mine who reports directly to and is
controlled by the Directorate. The Superintendency was recently
restructured to direct all divisions of the mine, including management of
operations as well as the implementation of the expansion Project.  In this
respect it has three main areas of responsibility:
-    Implementation of the mine plan by the mine operating division,
for which technical assistance will be provided by the ADAB
program;
-    Supervision of the overburden contractor (para. 4.21), for which
purpose a special unit will be created, drawing on the expertise
of the engineering and administrative divisions; and
-    Supervision of the erection of the crusher, conveyor and stacker
systems for both coal and overburden. This unit is already
established for the installation of the first lignite handling
system for Power Units 4 and 5. Specialized consultants, to be
financed by the Bank, will assist in this task.
4.18      These three units, directly controlled by the Superintendent, are
in charge of the front-line Project supervision and data collection
required for Project mon4toring and reporting activities. They are
assisted by the mine accounting units in assembling cost control data.
Mine accounting has been strengthened by technical assistance under Loan
1852-TH and further training, including the establishment of a computerized
management information system to streamline the system, is included in the
Project. The three Project execution units report back through the Mae Moh
Superintendency to the Directorate.

4.19      In order to assure that Project monitoring and control is done in
a professional manner, EGAT will continue to furnish to the Bank the normal
quarterly and annual Project progress reports, all current critical path
schedules, monitoring reports and cost control monitoring statements. In
addition, assurances were obtained from EGAT during negotiations that
project management arrangements including project scheduling, cost control
and monitoring satisfactory to the Bank will be maintained at all times.
4.20      The Lignite Mine Department has demonstrated in the past its
capability for sound project execution with the Mae Moh I project. This
first project is on schedule and is expected to be completed in April 1984
in time for the first firing of the related Power Unit 4. EGAT has built
up the technical and financial staff of the Department and reorganized it
in support of the first expansion of Mae Moh. With additional training and
technical assistance to be provided under the proposed Project (paras. 4.10
and 4.11) the Mine Department should be fully capable of taking on the
second and larger expansion. EGAT's Procurement Department, which is fully
familiar with Bank procurement procedures from twelve previous Bank loans,
will assist the Mine Department in procurement matters. Project management
arrangements can be considered adequate for successful Project
implementation.
2. Overburden Removal
4.21      EGAT plans to mine the lignite and to remove a portion of the
overburden and intercalation that lies in thin layers between the lignite,
using equipment to be financed under the project. In addition to their own
operations of mining 10 million bm3 per year of overburden and lignite,
EGAT has contracted the removal of 15 million bm3 annually up to a total of
90 million bm3 of overburden from the Mae Moh lignite mine, over a period
of seven years (1983-90).  Subsequently, when 25 million bm3 per year are
required from 1990 to 1995, with stripping requirements tapering off
thereafter, EGAT will re-evaluate its position and, with the Bank's
concurrence, either continue contracting or carry out overburden removal by
itself. The overburden contract was bid only among local Thai construction
firms, subsequent to a policy decision taken by EGAT's board which was
fully approved by the Government at the Cabinet level. The contract will
be fully financed out of EGAT's internal cash generation.
4.22      EGAT, having a long history of successfully handling large civil
work construction contracts (hydroelectric dams, power stations,
transmission lines) sees several advantages resulting from such a
contractual arrangement. By contracting most of the required overburden
removal work, it is able to minimize the initial capital investment
required for the mine expansion. More importantly, EGAT, being a
parastatal institution, does not wish to have considerable increases in its
labor force, during the peaks in the overburden stripping, of which it
cannot divest itself later.



-25-
4.23      The pre-stripping work to be carried out from 1983 to 1986 under
the overburden contract has been included in total Project costs (para.
5.01). Pre-stripping costs account for about one half of the total
contract costs. EGAT signed the overburden removal contract in August 1983
with a local joint venture between a civil works contractor and heavy
equipment supply firm (Sahakol Engineers Company Ltd. and Bangkok Motor
Equipment Company Ltd). The Bank has reviewed and approved the contract
and Bank technical support will be given to EGAT in supervision of contract
work. Assurances have been obtained from EGAT that, by July 31, 1987,
three years before the expiration of the contract, EGAT will, jointly with
the Bank, assess the contractor's performance in order to re-evaluate the
cost and benefits of the arrangement and agree on whether to:
-    renew the contract, under the same or revised conditions; or
-    to terminate the contract at its expiration date and have EGAT
carry out the work under its own account and management.
In the latter case, EGAT will present to the Bank a satisfactory
implementation schedule and financing plan, showing how EGAT intends to
equip itself to do such work and the financing sources required therefore.
3.   Project Implementation Schedule
4.24      Project preparation is well underway; the Project implementation
schedule is shown in Chart 4-2. Following the signing of the overburden
contract in August 1983, which was necessary at that time to ensure that
the contractor reach full production capacity of 15 million bm3 p.a. by the
end of 1985, the one remaining project component on the critical path is
the installation of equipment needed for EGAT's portion of the overburden
removal. The erection of the waste conveyors and associated semi-mobile
crushers and spreaders will require about 18 months, and detailed
engineering, manufacture and delivery will require between 14 and 16
months. Therefore, in order to complete the installation by early-1987,
detailed engineering was begun in July 1983 and bids are to be invited no
later than mid-1984.
4.25      In order to defer investments for as long as feasible and to
maximize utilization of the forty one 85-ton truck fleet to be replaced by
the overburden conveyor system, EGAT's construction schedule calls for a
one year gap between the commissioning of the last power plant, Unit 7, and
the completion of the conveyor system. Since the mine, at that point in
time, will have to be in full production and the truck fleet will be close
to the end of its useful life, a shortfall in EGAT's overburden removal
schedule could be anticipated. To minimize this risk EGAT plans to
re-evaluate the performance of its trucks in 1985 and, if required, advance
the procurement of the new trucks to be acquired in conjunction with the
conveyor system, in order to reinforce the ageing fleet.

4.26      On the power side, units 5, 6 and 7 are under construction, and
in March 1984 were, respectively, 65%, 19% and 12% completed. EGAT is
exercising purchase options obtained while bidding for Unit 4, and
procurement procedures are well underway. The planned start-up dates of
Units 5, 6 and ultimately, Unit 7 by March 1986 appear to be realistic and
no major slippages are anticipated.
V. CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   Capital Costs
5.01      Total installed Project cost (excluding interest during
construction and the Bank front-end fee, but including taxes and duties of
US$27.2 million equivalent) is estimated at US$231.8 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$135.0 million.  Estimates are at January 1983
price levels and are based on suppliers' quotes obtained by EGAT on
equipment and EGAT experience with civil works contracts. Advance
overburden removal costs are based on the contract proposals received in
May 1983 and review of contractor cost estimates in June 1983 with the
Bank.2/ Estimates include contingencies amounting to US$44.0 million, or
23% of the base cost. Physical contingencies were calculated at 15% of the
mining equipment base cost excluding advance overburden removal costs
(where contingencies are built into the unit cost) and equipment for which
orders have already been placed. Price contingencies are based on
projected international and local price increases for (i) foreign costs of
6.5% in 1983, 9e0% in 1984, 7.5% in 1985 and 6.0% thereafter; and (ii)
local costs of 3.5% in 1983, 6.5% in 1984, and 6.0% thereafter. Foreign
price contingencies reflect trends in prices of mining equipment which,
including equipment requirements of pre-stripping and geological drilling,
account for about 95% of foreign project costs. The Project capital cost
estimate is shown in Annex 8 and summarized below:
2/  Overburden removal totaling 36.5 million bm3 will be required during
FY1983-1986, the cost of which will be capitalized as pre-operating
expenditures.  Based on a contractor stripping cost of US$2.00/bm3 and
an estimated EGAT cost that ranges from US$1.36/bm3 in FY83 to
US$2.01/bi3 the average pre-stripping cost over the period is estimated
at US$1.76/bm3 (January 1983 terms), for a total of US$64.2 million.
This cost will begin to be amortized when Project production commences.

B.   Financing Plan
5.02      Foreign costs would be met by (i) the proposed Bank loan of
US$59.1 million, which will cover 39% of direct and indirect foreign costs
and 27% of total financing requirements excluding duties and taxes; (ii) a
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) loan of US$16.8 million equivalent;
(iii) an ADAB grant of US$4.2 million equivalent; (iv) commercial borrowing
or export credits of US$10.0 million; and (v) EGAT internal cash generation
of US$62.5 million equivalent to finance the indirect foreign cost of the
geological drilling and pre-stripping operations, training, interest during
construction, and a small amount of equipment and engineering. Local costs
would be met by Government contribution of US$14.4 million and EGAT cash
generation of US$82.8 million. This financing plan is shown on an annual
basis in Annex 9 and summarized below:

5.03      Government tax rebate contributions were approved on March 18,
1983 by announcement of the Ministry of Finance on tax exemptions on
imported equipment for EGAT construction projects up to and including Power
Unit 5 and the related mine expansion. The ADAB grant of A$5.7 million
(US$4.9 million equivalent) for a four year technical assistance program
covering both Mae Moh and Krabi mines, and of which US$4.2 million
equivalent will be applied to Mae Moh, was approved in the second half of
1983. The KfW loan for DM 47.0 million was signed on August 25, 1982 and
disbursements have already started. During negotiations EGAT indicated
that, at an appropriate time to be determined in consultation with the
Government and the Bank, it would consider replacing part of the US$145.3
million internal cash generation and the US$10.0 million of commercial
bank/export credit funds for the off-highway trucks with a possible B Loan
of up to US$50 million. Such a B Loan would be sustainable within the
financial covenants applicable to the Lignite Mine Department (para 6.12).
5.04      Following the precedent set in the first Bank loan for Mae Moh,
the guarantee fee payment to Government that is normally required by the
Bank for its industrial projects would be waived on an exceptional basis,
as assurances were obtained that no lignite produced under the Project
would be used in applications other than power generation, and would not
enter commercial markets.
5.05      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that any funds necessary
to meet cost overruns or shortfalls in financing would be made available
promptly by the Government to EGAT to complete the Project. For purposes
of this covenant, Project completion is defined as (i) completion of
physical construction of all facilities included in the Project; and (ii)
when the mine has produced 2.5 million tons of lignite over a 6 month
period or when it has operated for a 12 month period at the production



-30-
level required to provide Power Units 5-7 with sufficient lignite to
sustain operations with such uniformity as not to cause a power plant shut
down due to lack of lignite, whichever occurs first.
5.06      In considering the mine expansion and related Power Units 5-7
developments as one development investment package, the Bank loan would
meet 6.4% of the total financing required (US$926.5 million). Co-financing
would account for about 37% of the remaining financing required by mine and
power developments, comprising the (the Export-Import Bank of Japan and
Japanese supplier's credits (17.6%), Asian Development Bank (4.9%), KfW
(Germany, 2.5%), the Economic Development Corporation (Canada, 2.0%),
Government of Switzerland (1.8%), ADAB (Australia, 0.5%) and commercial
banks (7.9%).
C.   Procurement and Disbursement
5.07      About 91% of all equipment to be financed under the proposed Bank
loan would be procured by ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelines. A
preference of 15% of the c.i.f. cost of the imported goods or the
prevailing custom duties and other import taxes, whichever is lower, would
be extended to qualified local manufacturers. Procurement of individual
equipment packages not exceeding US$250,000 would be by limited
international tendering acceptable to the Bank up to an aggregate level of
US$5.0 million.  It has been agreed that prequalification of prospective
vendors for the crusher-conveyor-stacker system will be required due to the
complexity of this package. It is proposed that the Bank would subject the
first 10 procurement packages, including the trucks and conveyor systems
packages, constituting about 95% of the equipment base price, to prior
review and that the remainder of the ICB packages would be submitted by
EGAT to the Bank for post-review. A detailed list of procurement packages
for the Project is shown in Annex 10 and summarized below:

Initial disbursements of the Bank loan will be slow, due to the long
manufacturing time of the main equipment component (crusher-conveyor-
stacker system). Therefore, only about 30% of the loan will be disbursed
by the end of 1985 and 50% disbursement will occur only by the second
quarter of 1986. The estimated disbursement schedule is shown below:

following assumptions were used: 10% at time of placing the order, 65%
at shipment and the remaining 25% at the end of the commissioning
period.
5.09      Detailed estimated disbursements for the whole Project are shown
in Annex 8. The disbursement profile is somewhat different from the
standard disbursement profile for Bank industrial loans in the country but
is similar to that being experienced under the first Mae Moh Lignite
project, and is considered valid.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Mine Operating Costs
6.01      The operating costs of mining lignite at Mae Moh were estimated
by EGAT in January 1983 terms based on the Master Mining Plan prepared by
Rheinbraun-Consulting GmbH and EGAT's own operating experience. The costs
consist of: (i) operating costs for the small portion of waste removal to
be carried out by EGAT; (ii) operating costs for the lignite mining to be
carried out by EGAT; and (iii) the full costs of overburden removal to be
charged by the contractor who will carry out the major portion of the
overburden work. The production schedule, showing the production build-up
to be achieved in full by 1987 (5 million tpy) and the portions of work to
be carried out by EGAT and the contractor respectively, is given below:

6.02      At full production (FY87), it is estimated that, in 1983 terms,
total operating cost per tonne for Mae Moh II will be US$9.98 of which
overburden removal will account for US$8.56 (86% of the total) and lignite
mining will account for US$1.42. The total production cost per tonne
(1983 terms) is expected to be US$17.66 and is broken down into its
component parts below. The detailed breakdown of EGAT and contractor ciDst
estimates per bm3 at full production is shown in Annex 11.

6.03      In the projections the operating costs have been assumed to
decrease in real terms by 1% p.a from FY86 through FY90 to reflect the
expected increase in Mae Moh mine productivity. After FY90 they are
assumed to remain constant. Operating costs for Krabi Mine have been
estimated by EGAT based on operating experience at Krabi and are assumed to
remain constant in real terms. After FY90 no production has been assumed
for Krabi Mine since the mine is expected to be depleted, and delineation
and development of new outcrops in the Krabi vicinity is only at a
preliminary stage. In FY87 Krabi operating costs are estimated to be, in
January 1983 terms, US$14.18 per ton.
B.   Financial Projections
1.   EGAT
6.04      The projections for EGAT, summarized in the table below, show
that the Company is expected to maintain a sound financial position over
the forecast period (1984-92) with energy sales increasing at an annual
growth rate of 7.7% (from 18,832 GWh to 34,042 GWh), and revenues
increasing by 12% p.a. (from US$1.2 billion to US$3.0 billion). An
increasing proportion of revenues is expected to be available to help
finance capital expenditures due to the expected continued decrease in
operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) associated
primarily with the substitution of lower cost fuels for imported oil. The
operating ratio which exceeded 90% in the late 1970's is projected to
decrease from 79% in 1983 to 74% in FY92. To finance its construction
program through FY90, EGAT intends to borrow about 81% of the required
funds, obtain 2% from the Government as equity to cover duties and taxes
and provide the remaining 17% from internal cash generation.

6.05      As shown in the following summaries, EGAT is projected to meet
tariff covenants previously established with the Bank over the forecast
period and maintain a sound financial structure. Under existing covenants
EGAT and the sector are required to have rates of return of a least 8% by
FY82 and thereafter. In addition, EGAT is required to review the adequacy
of its tariffs on a quarterly basis and maintain a fuel cost adjustment
clause in its tariff schedule. The cost of lignite, at the transfer price
charged to power plants, is included in the fuel cost calculations.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that EGAT would continue to meet
these requirements. Assurances were obtained also that EGAT would meet
existing debt control covenants limiting the ratio of long term debt to
equity to no more than 60:40 and short and medium-term debt to no more than
15% of total debt.
6.06      EGAT financial projections assume tariff levels necessary for
EGAT and the sector to produce a rate of return on net revalued fixed
assets of at least 8%. This was done by first calculating revenues for
EGAT, PEA and MEA at the level required to yield a rate of return on net
revalued fixed assets of 8% each year. Calculations were then made of
average tariffs at the consumer level for each one of the utilities. Next,
keeping these tariffs unchanged, the excess cash in PEA and MEA was
transferred to EGAT by increasing EGAT's bulk tariff to PEA and MEA,
resulting in a more rational use of sector financial resources.
6.07      Capital investments assumed in the financial projections reflect
the latest development program, prepared by EGAT, required to meet the
demand forecast (para. 3.17). It was assumed that Government equity
contributions to EGAT would be restricted to approved reimbursement of a



-37-
part of the cost of multi-purpose projects undertaken by EGAT and of duties
and taxes paid by EGAT on imported equipment for approved projects under
the Fifth Five Year Development Plan.
6.08      Prior to September 30, 1982 EGAT had been exempted, by a Cabinet
Resolution, from remitting net income to the Ministry of Finance. A
Resolution, however, was signed in January 1983 requiring EGAT to remit
Baht 190 million (5% of net income) to the Ministry for FY82. The
financial projections assume that EGAT will continue to remit funds at the
rate of 5% of net income as was the case in FY82. Domestic and
international inflation assumptions are the same as those used in
estimating the Project capital cost (para. 5,01). Other important
assumptions underlying the EGAT financial projections concerning fuel
consumption and costs, other operating and maintenance costs, and
depreciation, are shown in Annex 12.
2.   Lignite Mine Department
6.09      Lignite Mine Department operations comprise the Mae Moh and Krabi
mines. Each mining operation is treated as a separate mining accounting
center by EGAT and overhead costs are allocated proportionately. The
financial accounts of the Department consolidate those of the respective
mining operations. Production schedules for the financial projections are
based on the expectations that Mae Moh will reach full production in FY87
and the Krabi mine will be fully depleted after FY90.

_  .                            _  _
6.10      Lignite Mine Department revenues were calculated using an actual
lignite base price in FY83 of US$19.22 per tonne.  This price reflects the
long run marginal cost of lignite as well as its opportunity cost (based on
imported coal as an economic substitute), and is in line with the dual
financial and economic pricing objectives discussed in Chapter I.
Under the lignite pricing arrangements agreed with EGAT (para. 2.37), the
lignite price is escalated in real terms by 2% p.a. through 1985. For the
purposes of financial projections, lignite prices have been escalated at 1%
p.a. in real terms after 1985. However, a review of lignite prices is to
ke made by EGAT in 1985 and further adjustments in real prices will be
determined with EGAT at that time. The lignite prices assumed in the
projections in real and current terms are shown below:

operating costs and other administrative expenses, (depreciationr
amort4zation of advance overburden removal, administrative expenses,
exploration costs, interest charges and reclamation fund expenses) over the
forecast period (1984-92) and generate sufficient cash in the Department to
meet debt repayment obligations (predominantly the Bank Loans for Mae Moh)
and on-going capital requirements. It is also projected that the
Department will meet its share of EGAT's income tax obligation (para.
6.08).

6,12      To strengthen the financial management and disciplTne of the
mining operations, assurances were obtained from EGAT during negotiations
that the Lignite Mine Department will meet standard debt covenants.  The
covenants are (i) a debt:equity ratio of no more than 60:40; and (ii) a
,debt service coverage of at least 1.3. The Mine Department debt:equity
ratio is at present within the covenanted range (58:42) and expected to



-39-
improve as a consequence of the high proportion of equity funding of the
proposed Project. Together with Government tax rebate contributions and
the Australian Grant (para. 5.03), Project financing comprises 65% equity.
Financial forecasts indicate the Departments' capability to meet the debt
covenants. The rate of return on net revalued fixed assets of the Mine
Department ranges from 11% p.a. to 21% p.a., exceeding the minimum
covenanted return with EGAT (8% p.a.) at all times.
C.   Financial Rate of Return
6.13      The financial rate of return of the Project has been estimated on
an incremental bas±s, (i) for the mine expansion alone (Case 1); and (ii)
for the combined mine and power developments (Units 5-7) which have been
designed as one package (Case 2). The returns have been estimated using
cost and benefit steams developed on a "with" and "without" Project basis.
The streams were calculated in January 1983 terms taking into account the
real changes in lignite prices, power tariff rates and operating costs
assumed in the financial projections. The calculations are made over a 30
year period, ending in 2010.
6.14      Case 1 - Mine Expansion Case.  The rate of return calculation on
the mine expansion alone assumes as the benefit stream revenues from "sale"
of lignite to the power plant at the lignite transfer price. Sales
revenues are calculated using only the sales tonnages at Mae Moh produced
under the Project (shown on a yearly basis in para. 6.09); and the lignite
price in real terms assumed in the financial projections and shown in
para. 6.10.
6.15      Incremental capital costs for the production increases comprise
capital costs for the Project including (i) replacement expenditures based
on schedules prepared by EGAT and reviewed by the Bank; (ii) working
capital requirements; and (iii) taxes on imported mining equipment. A tax
rebate stream has been added to account for the rebates on mine equipment
associated with Power Unit 5 (para. 5.03). Operating costs comprise (i)
EGAT operating costs; and (ii) the contractor costs for removal of
overburden to be charged to EGAT. These costs are shown in detail in Annex
13. An expected decrease in operating costs at Mae Moh, by 1% p.a. until
1990 (para. 6.03), has been reflected in the operating cost stream. After
1990 operating costs have been assumed to be constant. The operating cost
stream includes royalties to be paid to the Government for lignite
extraction (Baht 6.52 per tonne of lignite). The streams are shown in
Annex 14.
6.16      The incremental rate of return on the mine alone is highly
dependent on the lignite transfer price. Under the assumed pricing
arrangement, the rate of return on the internal investment in the mine
expansion is 9% and the rate of return on net revalued fixed assets of the
Lignite Mine Department is 12% in 1984 increasing to 21% in 1986 at full
Mae Moh production build-up. The Mine Department's return is far higher
than the minimum 8% rate of return on net revalued fixed assets agreed



-40-
between EGAT and the Bank (Loan 1852-TH) and demonstrates the financial
viability of the mining operations "with the Project."
6.17      Case 2 - Mine and Power.  The rate of return of the combined Mine
and Power Unit 5-7 developments assumes, as the benefit stream, revenues
from incremental power sales arising from the mine expansion and related
power unit investments. Sales revenues are based on (i) estimated
incremental energy sales (GWh) from the additional 450 MW in generation
capacity to be provided by Power Units 5-7; and (ii) tariff levels which
are expected to decrease in real terms (from 6.lt/GWh in 1983 to 5.3g/GWh
in 1986) through 1986 and remain constant thereafter, under assumptions
described in Annex 12 and shown in the financial projections for EGAT.
6.18      Cost streams comprise (i) the capital and operating costs for the
mine as described above; and (ii) the capital and operating costs for Power
Units 5-7. The Bank has reviewed cost estimates for the power plants with
EGAT and considers them satisfactory. The cost of lignite production is
handled in the calculation as a fuel cost to the power plants. Taxes on
power and mine investments have been included in capital costs. A tax
rebate stream has been added to the cost/benefit streams for all taxes
remitted on imported mine and power equipment associated with the Unit 5
development (para. 5.03). The streamsare shown in Annex 14.
6.19      The incremental financial return on the combined Mine and Power
Unit 5-7 developments is a satisfactory 12%, thus indicating the financial
viability of the second stage of EGAT's development investments at Mae Moh.
6.20      Sensitivity tests have been carried out on the financial rate of
return for the combined Power Units 5-7 and related Mae Moh Mine expansion
since they are interdependent investments which would not have been
undertaken in isolation. The results of the sensitivity tests are shown
below.
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return for
Mae Moh Mine Expansion and Power Units 5-7
Base                                      12.0
Capital cost increase      +10%          10.7
Capital cost decrease      -10%          13,4
Operating cost increase   +10%           11.2
Operating cost decrease   -10%           12.8
Tariff increase            +10%          14.0
Tariff decrease            -10%           9.8
6.21      The return is most sensitive to changes in electricity tariffs.
No major changes, however, are expected in the tariff levels based on the
requirement that EGAT earn a minimum 8% rate of return on net revalued
fixed assets. The return is also sensitive to capital cost changes. Major
changes are unlikely to occur as construction is well underway on the power
units and capital cost estimates for the mine expansion are considered
reliable.



-41-
D.   Project Risks
6.22      There is relatively little risk associated with the proposed
Project. Measured lignite reserves are more than adequate. Demand for
lignite as a fuel for electricity generation is virtually assured in light
of the projected rising demand for electricity over the medium and
long-term and the lower cost of domestic lignite for electricity generation
than imported coal. Capital and operating costs for the project are fairly
straightforward estimates, thus minimizing the possibility of a reduction
on return. Potential environmental hazards to air and water quality have
been handled well by EGAT under the first expansion and will be monitored
adequately under the proposed Project to avoid undue risk (para. 4.14).
There is some risk in implementation plans associated with the large
overburden contract which EGAT has let although (i) Bank review and
approval of the contract proposal; (ii) heightened EGAT awareness of the
potential contracting hazards; and (iii) technical assistance and training
under the Project, should minimize technical and financial risks (para.
4.23). There is also risk of delay in completion of Power Units 5-7,
particularly since there is a six month delay in completion of Unit 4.
However, construction of Units 5-7 is underway and the schedule appears to
be firm. Sensitivity tests show that a full year's delay, which is
unlikely, would reduce the financial and economic returns only marginally
since the major mine investments are made towards the end of the Project
period in (FY86 and 87) and would not change even should a delay in power
plant construction occur.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Rate of Return
7.01      The economic rate of return on the Project has been analyzed in
two separate ways. First, the return has been analyzed on an incremental
("with" and "without" Project) basis in similar manner to the financial
rate of return analysis but omitting taxes, duties and royalties from the
calculations. Second, the return has been analyzed on a substitution
basis, where the relative benefits and costs of the proposed mine and power
development are compared to a coastal power plant burning imported coal
under the assumption that a 450 MW coal-fired plant would substitute for
the combined Mine and Power investment in Units 5-7. In all calculations,
cost and benefit streams have been made in January 1983 terms, taking into
account real changes in lignite prices, electricity tariffs and operating
costs. The analyses were made over a 30 year period. No shadow pricing
has been carried since this is not required in Thailand at present.



-42-
1.   Incremental Analyses
7.02      Economic rate of return estimates have been made on the following
basis: Case 1, for the mine expansion alone; and Case 2, for the mine and
power Units 5-7 developments treated as one package. The same assumptions
and the same cost and benefit streams as for the financial rates of ret:urn
were used, (Chapter VI) with taxes, duties and royalties excluded (Annex
15). On this basis the incremental economic rate of return on the mine
expansion alone is 17%, above the estimated opportunity cost of capital in
Thailand of 12%. 3/ The return on the mine and power development together
is 14%, slightly above the opportunity cost of capital, indicating that. the
projected level of electricity tariffs (which assures an 8% rate of return
on revalued assets) is close to the incremental cost of electricity
production (para. 2.14).
2.   Substitution Analysis
7.03      The economic rate of return on substitution has been made by
analyzing the relative benefits and costs on a differential cash flow basis
of the proposed mine and power developments and a coastal power plant
burning imported coal. This analysis takes into consideration the fact
that the optimum use of lignite in Thailand is in power generation, due to
its constraints related to transportation, handling and its physical
characteristics (para. 2.29).
7.04      The benefit streams are assumed to be sales revenues:  (i) for
the proposed mine and power development from incremental energy sales
generated by Power Units 5-7 (totaling 450 MW); and (ii) for the coal-fired
plant from incremental energy sales generated by the 450 MW coastal plant.
The tariff rates assumed in valuing the power are the same as those used in
EGAT's financial forecasts (Annex 12).
7.05      The capital and operating costs for the proposed mine and power
development are the same as those used in the economic analysis of the
combined investment shown in Annex 15. The capital and operating costs
data for the coal-fired plant were estimated by EGAT assuming the plant
site is on the coast at Ao Phai and a 230 kV double-circuit transmission
line, 97 km long, is required from Ao Phai to Min Buri Substation.  The
criteria and assumptions for capital and operating costs for Power Units
5-7 and the coal-fired plant and associated transmission line are shown in
Annex 16. The transmission line requirements for Power Units 5-7 have also
been included in the calculations. Taxes, duties and royalties have been
excluded.
7.06      Coal to be burned in the alternative coal fired plant is assumed
to be imported from Australia, the closest supply source. As shown in
Annex 17, recent contract quotes established prices at approximately
US$45-50 per tonne for thermal coal for the New South Wales area. Annual
average f.o.b. export prices in current US$ per tonne were: US$44 in 1981
and US$48.5 in 1982. For the return analysis it was assumed that the
3/ Report No. 4366-TH, IBRD, August 31, 1983.



-43-
Australian f.o.b. price will be US$48 per tonne in 1985 (January 1983
terms) and escalated in real terms at an annual average rate of 1% through
1990. Specifications of Australian thermal coal were assumed to be 6,000
kcal/kg, less than 1% sulfur content and about 12% ash.
7.07      Recent ocean freight quotes for coal from Australia to Thailand
are in the range of US$15-20 per tonne for small spot contracts using small
vessels (30,000 dwt). For the return analysis ocean freight was assumed to
be US$15 per tonne (January 1983 terms) taking into consideration that port
facilities for the coal-fired alternative at Ao Phai could handle vessels
in the range of 50,000-100,000 dwt size. An additional inland freight and
handling charge of US$7.5 per tonne for delivery of coal imports to the
power plant has been assumed; this amount includes the amortization of
capital expenditures (about US$150 million) for the required port
facilities, including dredging of a channel to accommodate larger vessels.
7.08      The economic rate of return based on substitution outlined under
the assumptions above is 13.7% which is only marginally above the estimated
opportunity cost of capital of 12%. This confirms the results of the
lignite pricing study, which show the rent element in the total lignite
opportunity cost to be small, implying that lignite's cost advantage over
coal, the substitute fuel, is also small (para. 2.35). The cost and
benefit streams are shown in Annex 18.
7.09      Sensitivity tests have been carried out on the economic rate of
return for the Power Units 5-7 and related mine expansion as compared to a
coal-fired power plant, since this return is more indicative than the
incremental rate of return of the cost to the economy of developing
lignite. The results of the sensitivity tests are shown below:
Sensitivity Test on Economic Rate of Return
for the Power Units 5-7 and Related Mine  xpnsio
Compared with a Coal-Fired Plant
Base case                                   13.7
Capital cost increase - 10%                 10.1
Operating cost increase - 10%               11.4
Coal price increase to US$52 per tonne   16.1
Coal price decrease to US$44 per tonne   11.4
The return is particularly sensitive to changes in international coal
prices and increases by 2.4 percentage points when coal prices are assumed
to increase by US$4 (from US$48 to US$52 per tonne). This is 'Likely since
coal prices are expected to improve over the remaining 1980s with moderate
strengthening of the international coal market.4! When coal prices are
assumed to fall to US$44 per tonne the return decreases to 11.4%.
4/ Recent Bank thermal coal price projections assume a 1 to 2% p.a.
increase in real terms, in the later half of the 1980s, with coal
prices reaching in range of US$53-55 per tonne in the early 1990s.



-44-
B.   Foreign Exchange Savings and Other Benefits
7.10      The average net foreign exchange savings under the proposed
Project have been calculated as in the economic rate of return analysis,
which assumes that the combined mine and power investment in Units 5-7
would substitute for a 450 MW coal-fired plant. The net foreign exchange
savings resulting from reduced coal imports under the coal-fired
alternative, over the 30 year life of the Power Units 5-7, are expected to
average US$42.3 million p.a. in January 1983 terms, taking into account the
impact of debt service (see Annex 19).
7.11      The proposed Project would provide for technology transfer
through technical assistance and training at the mine site and would
strengthen the institutional aspects of the power utility through proposed
managerial changes and related training. Despite its capital-intensive
nature, the Project would provide some increase in economic activity in the
remote northeastern region of Thailand, through the anticipated increased
staffing at Mae Moh and the employment of local contractors for overburden
removal. The resettlement program under the first expansion project is
benefitting the area through establishment of a school, health center,
water supply, electricity and other facilities which will be continued and
fostered under the present Project.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A.   Agreements
8.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:
(a)  With the Government
(i)  that the electricity sector should earn a rate of return on
net revalued fixed assets of not less than 8% every year
(paras. 3.13 and 6.05).
(il)  to make available to EGAT such funds as are needed to carry
out the Project (para. 5.05).
(b)  With EGAT
(i)  to use a price for the lignite produced and transferred to
its power plants that is determined taking into account the
economic costs of substitute fuels and the need to ensure
the Lignite Mine Department's financial viability.  Lignite
pricing policy reviews are to be carried out by EGAT in
FY1985 and at least every three years thereafter and the
pricing methodology is to be agreed upon with the Bank. For
FY1984 and FY1985 it has been agreed that EGAT will raise
the transfer price by 2% p.a. in real terms (para. 2.36).



-45-
(ii)  to continue to maintain separate accounts for EGAT's mining
activities (para. 3.05).
(iii) to continue having EGAT's accounts (consolidated and
unconsolidated for EGAT and its mine operations) audited by
independent auditors (para. 3.16).
(iv)  to continue geotechnical work at Mae Moh and furnish to the
Bank an assessment of the geotechnical aspects of slope
stability at Mae Moh, by January 31, 1985 (para. 4.07).
(v) to furnish to the Bank a financial management and analysis
training program by September 30, 1984, to be implemented
not later than January 31, 1985, and a mine operations
training program by March 31, 1985, to be implemented not
later than July 31, 1985 (para. 4.12).
(vi)  to execute and operate the Project and associated power
plant in accordance with environmental standards
satisfactory to the Bank and the Government (para. 4.14).
(vii) to apply project management practices and procedures
satisfactory to the Bank during Project execution (para.
4.19).
(viii) to re-evaluate the overburden removal contract with the
Bank, by July 31, 1987 and, with the Bank's concurrence,
decide whether to renew it, draw up a new contract or
undertake the removal with EGAT's own equipment. In the
latter event, EGAT will provide the Bank with a satisfactory
plan for acquiring the necessary equipment and financing
therefore (para. 4.23).
(ix)  to use lignite produced under the Project only for power
generation purposes by EGAT (para. 5.04).
(x) to achieve a rate of return on EGAT's average revalued net
fixed assets of not less than 8% and provide the Bank with
quarterly analyses of how this will be achieved in the
current and following fiscal years (para. 6.05).
(xi)  to maintain a fuel adjustment clause in its tariff, which
would also reflect the cost of lignite (para. 6.05).
(xii) to maintain a debt/equity ratio of no greater than 60:40 and
short and medium term debt at no more than 15% of all debt
(para. 6.05).



-46-
(xiii)  to limit borrowing related to lignite mining activities such
that the Lignite Mine Department's debt/equity ratio is no
greater than 60:40 and its debt service coverage ratio is at
least 1.3 (para. 6.12).
B.   Recommendations
8.02       With the agreements reached on the above, the Project forms a
suitable basis for a loan to EGAT of US$59.1 million for a period of 20
years, including 5 years of grace, with the guarantee of the Kingdom of
Thailand.

EGAT's Financial Projections
Assumptions
Assumptions underlying the EGAT financial projections concerning
fuel consumption and costs, operating and maintenance costs, and
depreciation rates, are outlined below. Other main assumptions such as
revenues, tariffs and capital investments are outlined in the main report.
The projects assume foreign inflation of 6.5% in 1983, 9.0% in 1984, 7.5%
in 1985 and 6.0% thereafter, and -domestic inflation of 3.5% in 1983,
6.5% in 1984 and 6.0% thereafter.

THAILAND - Second Mae Moh Lignite Project
Financial Projections of the Lignite Mine Department
Assumptions
Assumptions underlying the Mine Department financial projections
concerning operating costs, depreciation schedule, projected interest
charges, royalties, taxes, an working captial requirements are outlined
below. Other main assumptions such as lignite production, lignite pricing
and detailed mine operating costs are outlined in the main report.
At full production build-up at Mae Moh in 1987, the estimated
average production costs for Mae Moh and Krabi mines is US$17.72 per tonne
as detailed below. Lignite production is estimated at 5.1 million tonnes
in 1987, of which 4.9 million tonnes would be from Mae Moh and 0.2 million
tonnes would be from Krabi.

EGAT's fixed assets and depreciation are revalued on an annual basis in
accordance with tariff covenants (under Loan 1852-TH) with the Bank.  The
Mine Department is assumed to follow the same procedure.
The interest chre forecasts for the Mine Department are shown
below. These include interest on the proposed IBRD, KfW and commercial
loans for the Project. The proposed Bank loan is for US$59.1 million at
the standard interest rate and front-end fee with a grace period of 5 years
and maturity of 15 years. The KfW loan is for DM 47.0 million (US$19.2
million) at 9.5% interest and 0.25% commitment fee with a grace period of 2
years and maturity of 10.5 years. Part of the KfW loan will be used for
Mae Moh II (US$16.8 million equivalent). The commercial loan, to be
obtained by EGAT in the future, is assumed to total US$10.0 million and to
have terms similar to the IBRD loan.

Royalties are paid to the Government at the rate of Baht 6.52 per
tonne (US$0.823) of lignite, and have been included in the forecasts.
Import duties and taxes on equipment have been calculated in accordance
with currently applied rates which average about 30% of the cost of mining
equipment to be procured under the Mae Moh II Project. Taxes on imported
mining equipment associated with the mine expansion for Power Unit 5 are
charged, but assumed to be rebated by the Government in accordance with the
preference granted projects approved under the Fifth Five Year National
Plan.
The following assumptions were used in calculating requirements
under the Project:
