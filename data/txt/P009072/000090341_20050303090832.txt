Introduction
Turkey's agricultural sector is of considerable importance in terms of its share of the nation's GDP, about
14%, as well as employment, about 40%, and over one-third of agricultural GDP is dependent on
irrigation. Bank analytic work in the early 1990s (see list of studies in Section 10) determined that key
problems in the irrigation sector were unsatisfactory operation and maintenance (O&M) services due to
inadequate government funding and inefficient investment. Regarding O&M, the main problems were
inadequate funding and low recovery of funds from users, which had resulted in major deterioration of
irrigation schemes. Regarding irrigation investment, the main difficulties were negligible cost recovery,
poor planning of new schemes, and extensive delays in project completion.

The principal agencies responsible for irrigation development and management are: the State Hydraulic
Works (DSI), which develops and manages very large irrigation systems; the General Directorate of Rural
Services (GDRS), responsible for minor irrigation works and on-farm development of many irrigation
works completed upstream by DSI; and a variety of small organizations commonly referred in Turkey as
Water Users Organizations (WUOs). These WUOs manage irrigation schemes of different sizes. Typically
Irrigation Cooperatives (ICs) under the tutelage of GDRS have a command area of 600/700 ha, while
Water User Associations (WUAs) under DSI have about 3,000 ha), report to different agencies, and
operate under three different laws: law no. 442 regulating village authorities (that manage less than 1% of
irrigated land), law no. 1580 regulating municipalities and WUAs that manage 54% of irrigated land, and
law no. 1163 regulating ICs that manage 24% of irrigated land. The remaining 22% of irrigated land
(approximately 1 million ha) is represented by schemes (usually very small, about 5 ha) constructed and
managed by the farmers themselves without the support of any WUO.

In part under the Drainage and On-Farm Development Project, the Bank encouraged the government in the
early 1990s to transfer O&M responsibility to WUOs, an approach that had been found highly effective in
Mexico and other countries. The Participatory Privatization of Irrigation Management and Investment
Project (PPIMIP) was set within the context of an extensive program of reform in agriculture aimed at
achieving higher productivity and efficiency and decreasing government intervention.
3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The objectives of the Participatory Privatization of Irrigation Management and Investment Project
(PPIMIP) were to:

1. strengthen irrigation-related institutions by supporting: (a) DSI and GDRS in providing guidance and
    technical support to Water Users Organizations-WUOs (a definition that encompass Water Users
    Associations-WUAs and Irrigation Cooperatives-ICs); and (b) WUOs in fulfilling their responsibility
    for irrigation management and investment (including the purchase of O&M equipment and improving
    irrigation systems) in an efficient and sustainable manner;
2. relieve the public sector of its traditional responsibility for funding and subsidizing the costs of
    irrigation O&M;
3. initiate a process of reducing public sector responsibility for funding and managing irrigation
    investment; and
4. promote efficient and sustainable utilization of irrigation systems which would contribute to improved
    agricultural productivity.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.

3.3 Original Components:
Component A: Operation and Maintenance Equipment

Component A is the core of the project. Provision of grants through DSI to WUAs to finance purchase of
irrigation and O&M equipment. Grant rates (share of total cost provided by the project) were expected to
reach 28% in average and range from 15% to 45% by a complex schedule involving region, type of
equipment and type of irrigation system (gravity or pump). This was the largest component of the project
for which originally US$12.37 million or 62% of the loan amount were allocated. It was a detailed and well
designed component.

Component B: Institutional Strengthening

    l Provision of advisory services, training and equipment to DSI and WUAs to facilitate
         implementation of Component A and to prepare irrigation improvement schemes;

    l Provision of advisory services, training and equipment to GDRS and to an IC (Uluborlu Irrigation
         Cooperative) to facilitate implementation of Component C and prepare irrigation improvement
         schemes.

This component was not sufficiently detailed in the original project documents. The original amount
allocated for this component was US$5.22 million or 26% of loan amount. This was clearly oversized if
we assume that the component was mainly aiming at providing TA and equipment to facilitate
implementation of the remaining US$15 million project. It was also not clearly targeting specific identified
larger needs of the implementing agencies or farmers organizations, since no WUOs or public agencies
training needs assessment (or similar evaluation) was ever carried out during preparation.

Component C: Pilot Drip Irrigation Scheme

Provision of grants to a specific irrigation cooperative, Uluborlu IC, to finance the purchase and
installation of drip irrigation systems. As provided in the original component C, irrigation of 200 ha and
purchasing on-farm drip equipment was foreseen. The grant rate was set at 40% for civil works and 16%
for goods. On the average, 28% was to be provided from project funds and 72% from the WUO budget.
For this component, a sum of US$2.02 million or 10% of loan amount was originally allocated. The
component was well designed but very strictly built around the peculiar needs of the foreseen investment in
Uluborlu IC.

3.4 Revised Components:
The components were revised and adapted quite often during project life and the loan agreement was
amended twice (as shown below in Table 1) to allow the major changes to be effective.

Component A was indeed well designed and started working effectively from the beginning of the project.
Nevertheless, the first project amendment in June 2001 adopted uniform grant rates at the top limit of the
original range, 45%, for all regions and all types of equipment. Grant rates were made uniform in order to
provide better clarity and equitability, and therefore also enhance project and implementing agency
credibility, among WUOs in the cost sharing arrangements. The decision of setting the uniform grant rate
at the top limit of the range was decided in response to the added financial burden imposed on all WUOs as
a result of the 2001 financial crisis in the country that weakened substantially the WUOs financial
possibilities. As a final result the grant rate for O&M equipment provided under this component was about
38% on average. In a worldwide irrigation context, where farmers typically pay a small proportion of
O&M costs, the fact that WUOs here were willing to pay more than half of the cost of new O&M



                                                       - 3 -

equipment is really rather exceptional. Even more exceptional results could be obtained in the future by
decreasing again the grant rate now that the effects of the financial crisis seem to be finished. As a matter
of fact during calendar year 2004 a huge amount of WUA grant applications were addressed to the project
that remained unsatisfied. These would have required an additional amount of US$8 million at the current
grant rate of 45% to all be accepted.

Component A was, also in June 2001, expanded from covering only the purchase of irrigation and O&M
equipment (which became Sub-component A1) to include financing for rehabilitation and minor
improvements to irrigation schemes in what was called the Pilot Rehabilitation Program (PRP or
Sub-component A2). These rehabilitation and minor improvement interventions were funded on a 50%
basis from the loan, and the remaining 50% from the participating WUOs. This was done on the basis of
the findings of a survey undertaken in 2000 in seven regions representative of various types of irrigation
systems in the context of the project to assess the need for rehabilitation and the extent of the interest of
WUOs in investing to upgrade the operational efficiency of the irrigation systems serving them. The
intention of the Government was for this pilot program to pave the way for a larger project which would
have supported a national effort to assist WUOs in the rehabilitation and upgrading of the irrigation and
drainage infrastructure on a country-wide basis. This pilot has proven to be successful, and even in this
case the high amount of farmers contribution makes of this experience a quite unique model in this field for
many other countries, and not only developing ones.

As a result of the high level of requests from the farmers and of the two combined amendments of June
2001 and November 2002 Component A1 actually disbursed US$14.01 million or 70% of the loan amount
and component A2 about US$1.92 million or about 10% of loan amount.

Component B was quite quick initially in disbursing the allocated amount for provision of equipment to
DSI and GDRS but found serious obstacles at the moment of defining which training activities should be
financed and targeted to whom. Component B was proposed for a revision in 2001 trying to strengthen the
link between proposed training activities to the needs, and not only technical needs, of the WUOs. A first
agreement was reached with DSI about the urgent need of carrying out a WUOs training needs assessment
but successively, this agreement was lost mainly due to: (i) the approaching of the end of the project and
time constraints in implementing under the project any solution to what the needs assessment could have
identified; (ii) the necessity of organizing an inter-departmental group within DSI for carrying on the
training needs assessment (PPIMIP was implemented by the DSI O&M department); (iii) the pressing
request for additional funds to be reallocated to the successful component A; and (iv) a general distrust in
DSI about effectiveness of large amounts to be spent on TA for WUOs. Therefore, all through the project
life this component was the subject of lengthy discussions between the Bank and the implementing agencies
and as a final result only US$3.28 million were disbursed or 16% of loan proceeds, mainly for equipment
for the two implementing agencies and for salaries of the PCU consultants (CC and ACC). This report
considers that the main problem here was poor design and agreement/ownership at entry, which even
intensive effort during supervision could not compensate for.

For Component C, the originally-identified IC for drip irrigation (Uluborlu) did not follow through. It
appears that the farmers there expected some financing from the local administration. This is indeed
nothing surprising given the fact that ICs have always, in the past, obtained substantial rehabilitation and
construction investments through a mix of financing by GDRS and local administration at zero cost for
them. Consequent to Uluborlu declining to participate, the LA was first amended to introduce a set of
eligibility criteria for participation enlarged not only to ICs but also to WUAs, to include sprinkler
irrigation and to increase the grant rate to 40% . It was then substantially downsized in November 2002
when the large investment of an eligible WUA was included in the PRP (WUAs report directly to DSI and


                                                       - 4 -

DSI was in charge of implementing component A2). Eventually, only 3 ICs participated in the sprinkler
irrigation part of the project for a very modest amount of about US$50,000.

It should be noted that while the financed IBRD portion of the project was US$19.7 million, the overall
final project cost was US$45.1 million, including the contributions of the government agencies involved
(about US$1.1 million), and especially, of the beneficiaries, US$24.3 million.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at Entry is considered unsatisfactory, although slightly and although it only marginally affected
achievement of overall project objectives.

The project was consistent with the 1997 CAS, which supported "privatization" of irrigation. It was also
consistent with the Bank and the government's overall approach to the agricultural sector, which sought to
reduce government involvement in the sector. The goal of devolving responsibility for management and
financing of irrigation O&M was adopted prior to project inception and was supported by substantial
analytical work (see section 10 for list of studies).

The objectives were quite realistic and were clearly stated in the project documents. The basic project plan
was generally sound and focused around the core of the project, component A. However, there were three
aspects of the project design that were unrealistic. First, making establishment of a "Unified Legal
Framework" for all WUOs a condition of effectiveness was not realistic considering the history of such
endeavors involving the Parliament (in the event, the condition was waived and such a law has not yet been
passed). Second, the Bank was not realistic when it set the grant rates for Component C and even more
when it designed the whole component around the needs of such ICs, to the point to name it explicitly in all
project documents and to refer to it as the sole beneficiary of the pilot. Moreover, Uluborlu cooperative,
accustomed to GDRS services at little or no cost, was not prepared to pay 60-80% of the funding of these
schemes and was indeed actively looking for having local administrations to pay for the remainder of the
costs not covered by the Loan or GDRS. GDRS should have alerted the Bank that this plan was
impractical. Finally, contents of component B were not specified enough and, more important, could not
find its rationale on the basis of a needs assessment or similar activity. Those shortcomings did not affect
achievement of project objectives since the main project activities (equipment and pilot rehabilitation)
aimed at supporting WUOs in implementing their basic function (that is implementation of O&M activities)
produced positive results per se independently from the policy setting and the legal environment around
them. Also, in implementing the project a large number of WUOs across Turkey were forced to learn by
doing and to upgrade themselves, so that they are now obviously more capable and self- confident than they
were before the project. Of course these effects would have been further enhanced by a unified legal
framework and by a partial restructuring of DSI in its role towards WUAs, but this would have meant
introducing the seed of an institutional reform that was not explicitly among the agreed main aims and
objectives of the project, which was probably impossible.

The principal government agency involved in the project was DSI, which implemented activities covering
US$17.8 million or 89% of Loan amount, and its support for and involvement in the project was strong,
although not all departments of the agency were as positive and cooperative as its top officials. GDRS had
a much smaller role, US$2.2 million of loan amount or 11%, and was much less enthusiastic.

Technical and economic aspects of the project were satisfactory, although with some shortcomings. The
project focused on the purchase of O&M equipment--the largest component--with smaller amounts of
funding going to institution building and the pilot drip irrigation component. The O&M equipment
purchase component was appropriately detailed and proved successful. However, the SAR lacked a TOR



                                                     - 5 -

for a training needs assessment for the institution building component, and while the TOR was initiated
during the project, the activity was never undertaken. Also, the SAR did not specify consultant
qualifications or job descriptions, nor specify whether international consultants or national experts were to
be used, which later became an issue between the Bank and the Government. Procurement support and
financial management were adequately arranged prior to project inception.

The risk factors identified in the SAR lacked realism and relevance. For example, reversal of the transfer
of irrigation schemes, potential lack of WUOs commitment, and difficulty in finding consultants with
relevant experience do not seem to be significant risks while, as experienced during project life, lack of
financial capabilities of the WUOs or control of local administrations over the WUAs general assembly
were indeed critical. Especially with regard to finding consultants, the existence of successful programs in
Mexico and Israel indicated adequate availability of expertise.

As a final point, Monitoring and Evaluation was strongly overlooked. The PPIMIP had in fact little in the
way of meaningful monitoring indicators, establishment of initial benchmarks, or systematic data
collection. The project was designed to promote participatory involvement of WUOs in irrigation
investment, and it would have been much stronger in this regard if the M&E had been better developed.
The project design can therefore be faulted in this regard with consequences that spilled over the design
phase. In fact later it was quite difficult during the implementation phase to convince DSI O&M
department that accurate M&E needed to be carried out since those activities had not been agreed from the
beginning and DSI claimed that there were no resources allocated under the project for this purpose.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Introduction
Outcome is assessed as overall satisfactory, as the project strengthened WUOs by providing support for
O&M equipment and for rehabilitation, which significantly enhanced WUOs credibility in the minds of the
farmers and, in turn, allowed collection of revenues that enhanced financial sustainability, reduced water
losses and improved development of technical and managerial capacities. The rehabilitated irrigation
schemes resulted in a greater quantity of water available (due to lower losses) and also permitted a more
reliable supply (due to fewer breakdowns).This enhanced credibility and service validated the bottoms-up,
participatory approach of the WUOs and contributed to the achievement of objects 1(b), 2, and 3.The
project contributed to a paradigm shift, already underway prior to project inception, which changed the
mind-set of farmers--in the past accustomed to receiving irrigation services at little or no cost--(1) to pay
for the water they used; and (2) to become more pro-active and supportive of WUOs in their efforts to take


                                                        - 7 -

greater responsibility for managing and paying for the O&M of irrigation schemes.

It should be noted that the increased tendency for farmers to pay for the water they used comprised a
significant shift.Prior to 1993 (when the paradigm shift began), farmers normally paid only for
rehabilitation or new investment (and the payment scheme used resulted in farmers paying considerably less
than full cost) and did not pay for O&M costs. While still far away from paying for full O&M cost of
water (for example bulk water is still provided by DSI for free to its WUAs) WUOs have increased notably
the recovery of the O&M cost supported by them at secondary and tertiary level.

Objective (1): Strengthen irrigation-related institutions by supporting: (a) DSI and GDRS in
providing guidance and technical support to WUOs; and (b) WUOs in fulfilling their responsibility
for irrigation management and investment (including the purchase of O&M equipment and
improving irrigation systems) in an efficient and sustainable manner.

Achievement in the area of Objective 1 was overall satisfactory, with significant benefits achieved under
objective 1(b) substantially outweighing deficiencies in objective 1(a).

Objective 1(a) Strengthen irrigation-related institutions by supporting DSI and GDRS in providing
guidance and technical support to WUOs.

Although some benefits were achieved in this area, achievement of sub-objective 1(a) is assessed as
unsatisfactory.On the positive side, long and short-term consultants supported DSI, GDRS and WUOs in
all aspects of project activities.Study tours and other training benefited these organizations, DSI and the
WUAs are now more capable in selecting appropriate equipment for maintenance of irrigation
infrastructure after the experience of purchasing equipment under the project grants.And DSI local
managers and technical staff gained experience in selection and implementation of rehabilitation projects
based on WUAs' demand and commitment to share investment cost. The results and lessons learned were
disseminated by implementation in 6 different DSI regions as well as through national WUAs Heads
meetings in Adana (in November, 2002) and Antalya (in May, 2004).

However, achievement of objective 1(a) was unsatisfactory largely because insufficient training was
provided to WUOs. As they were rapidly acquiring new responsibilities and financial obligations, they
were not provided with a commensurate augmentation of their expertise.It was intended that DSI would
provide the training needed, and while the agency did provide some training, it was too rooted in the older,
"top-down" paradigm, and too theoretical, to be effective.The training the WUAs needed was in e.g.,
management, irrigation technology, and water pricing.While the PCU developed a TOR for a "training
needs assessment" for the WUAs as well as DSI itself, these were never implemented, in part due to
insufficient agency support as well as confusion surrounding the extension of the project in late 2002 (see
sec. 5.1). (It should be noted that WUAs largely made up for the lack of formal training by
"learning-by-doing."See discussion of achievement under Objective 3, below).

An additional factor in assessing Objective 1(a) was that the government did not pass a WUO law during
the period of project implementation, despite this having been a condition of effectiveness (later waived).

Objective 1(b): Strengthen irrigation-related institutions by supporting WUOs in fulfilling their
responsibility for irrigation management and investment (including the purchase of O&M equipment
and improving irrigation systems) in an efficient and sustainable manner.

Achievement of this sub-objective was satisfactory.The provision of O&M equipment and rehabilitation of


                                                      - 8 -

irrigation schemes was very successful in meeting this objective because it provided a tangible
demonstration of the capabilities of the newly-empowered WUAs. Farmers were more willing to
participate and pay their water bills because they were assured of more adequate and more reliable service,
and--based on anecdotal data-- increases in efficiency and productivity (for example in Adana region,
after the rehabilitation works in 5 WUAs cropping patterns are clearly shifting from cotton to oranges with
an increase of financial net margins of about 150%).The PPIMIP helped to build confidence between
WUOs and farmers.Evidence of achievement in this area includes:

l The much higher portion of rehabilitation costs paid by WUAs in Turkey compared to other developing
    countries
l Greater pro-activity in undertaking O&M by WUAs that manage their own work compared to those
    managed by DSI
l Higher collection rates at WUAs participating in the project than the general population


WUAs paid half of rehabilitation costs: It should be noted that WUAs paid 50% of the cost of
rehabilitation and minor improvement works provided under the project.This is an exceptionally high
ratio by the standards of other developing countries (except Mexico).In no other developing or middle
income countries do water users pay as much as 50% of such costs, and Turkey is ahead of some
industrialized countries as well (e.g., France, where payments are typically 25-30%, and Germany, where
user payments for drainage infrastructure average around 40%). In a country where irrigation services have
typically been provided free by a highly centralized agency, the autonomy and self-reliance now achieved
by Turkish WUAs are actually quite stunning.

More pro-active O&M:Figures 1 and 2 show maintenance activity undertaken in 2003 in areas
managed by DSI (Figure 1) and in areas managed by WUAs (figure 2) as a percentage of estimated
needed amount of O&M to be implemented at the beginning of the same year (in both cases, for DSI
and for the WUAs the estimation has been made by DSI). As can be seen, the WUA-managed areas were
more active in undertaking O&M:in 5 of the 6 categories of activity, WUA-managed areas were more
active, in many cases by a large margin.These data seem to validate the point that participatory irrigation
schemes generate better maintenance than those provided by the central government.

Higher Collection Rates--Collection rates were higher at WUOs that participated in the project and
rehabilitated existing irrigation schemes.

The tangible benefits provided to WUOs, especially rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes, increased
farmer satisfaction by providing better and more reliable service, which resulted in higher collection
rates.This is illustrated in Figure 1 below.The data show that the 1997-2002 collection rate for all
irrigation systems transferred from DSI to WUAs varied from 50% to 67%, with no clear trend; the rate for
2002 was 60%.While time series data for the 280 WUAs participating in the O&M sub-component were
not available, 2003 data for all 13 participating WUAs under the PRP showed an average collection rate of
82%.This higher collection rate was validated by interviews with WUAs and government officials, who
unanimously attributed the higher collection rate to the changed mind-set of farmers and their greater
willingness to support O&M for which they had greater responsibility and ownership.

  years. 2003 data provided by individual associations to PCU.

Sharing of Equipment: Interviews with 5 WUAs in the Adana region, held during ICR preparation,
indicated that WUAs are generally willing to share O&M equipment that is not in current use with nearby
WUOs. Several WUAs also reported that use of Bank procurement procedures saved considerable money
in the purchase of O&M equipment, compared to the procedures that had been used earlier. These WUAs
stated that they would continue to use such procedures for purchases outside of the PPIMIP.

Objective (2): Relieve the public sector of its traditional responsibility for funding and subsidizing the
costs of irrigation O&M

Achievement in this area was satisfactory, with:
l A major and continuing decline in O&M spending by the Government
l A large decline in the gross area provided with O&M services by the Government
l A more modest reduction in the size of DSI's O&M staff and facilities.


While the PPIMIP cannot claim credit for all of the decline in O&M spending, by demonstrating the
efficacy of WUOs and contributing to the paradigm shift in the mindset of farmers, it was a facilitating
factor in these trends.

Decline in O&M Spending: Table 2 below shows that DSI O&M expenditures have fallen dramatically
over the last 14 years. While they fell 62% from 1990 to 1997, they declined a further 63% during the

So to the extent that PPIMIP contributed to WUAs taking greater responsibility for the financial support of
maintenance and equipment purchase, this contributed to a reduction in the fiscal burden of these
functions.

Trend in Size of Area Maintained by DSI: The most important factor in the large decline in DSI O&M
expenditures was the decline in the size of the areas it serviced. Table 3, below, shows the trend in the size
of the area currently provided with O&M by DSI. As can be seen, the total irrigation area developed by
DSI rose by 47% from 1990 to 2004. However, the area provided with O&M services by DSI fell
dramatically, starting before project inception. During the period of the PPIMIP, the area provided with
O&M services by DSI fell by 59%. By 2004, DSI support for O&M had become negligible, covering
around 4% of all irrigable areas (command areas) developed by DSI, with the balance supported
predominantly by WUAs, and to a small extent by villages or municipalities.

A further trend revealed in Table 5 is the steady decline in the irrigation ratio of the land for which DSI
continues to provide O&M services. In effect, DSI has transferred O&M responsibility for the more
attractive plots, while retaining responsibility for the less attractive areas.

Downsizing of DSI: DSI is moving to downsize its O&M staff and facilities, and while its O&M
operations are shrinking, the decline has not been commensurate with the rapid fall in the size of the areas
maintained or in expenditures. DSI's ultimate goal is to devolve all responsibility for O&M--and the
associated capital equipment--to the WUAs. Since fewer facilities will be needed to manage O&M, DSI is
also moving to divest facilities it no longer needs, and reduce its staffing. In the Adana region, for
example, DSI has closed 13 local offices in the last 8 years, of which some have been sold and the
remainder are in the process of being sold. The DSI staff in the Adana region has been modestly reduced,
mainly by attrition, as shown in Table 4, below.

The decline in DSI staff nationally has been proportionately larger: from 1993 to 2003, the number of DSI
staff working nation-wide on O&M declined from around 10,000 to 6,000. And total DSI national staffing
has declined from around 35,000 in 2001 to 31,000 in early 2004.

The decline in DSI involvement in O&M is part of a broader trend of reduced government involvement in
the agricultural sector, including reduced price support, etc. Figure 4, below, shows this trend; budgetary
support for agriculture has declined, in real terms, from about 3.5 trillion TL in 1999 to around 1.5 trillion
TL in 2003.

Objective (3): Initiate a process of reducing public sector responsibility for funding and managing
irrigation investment

Achievement in this area was satisfactory. As described in earlier sections, PPIMIP provided a
highly-effective demonstration of how WUOs could manage, and partially fund, irrigation investment and
rehabilitation. As noted, WUAs contributed more than 50% of these funds, an exceptionally high
proportion among developing countries. And WUOs demonstrated by on-the-job-training that they could
develop the requisite management, technical, and planning skills to implement these projects successfully.
(The increased efficiency produced by PPIMIP is discussed under Objective 4).

PPIMIP investment to rehabilitate irrigation schemes is summarized in Table 5. Thirteen WUAs received
16 grants averaging US$239,000, which they matched. (In one instance, 7 WUAs collaborated to obtain
project funds that were used to rehabilitate a trunk canal that served all seven.) The rehabilitation included
rebuilding damaged sections of canals, building canalets, replacement of faulty valves and other hardware,
and replacement of earthen canal beds with concrete. Some of the benefits of the pilot investment program
have been discussed earlier; the rehabilitation program was regarded by all persons interviewed by the ICR
mission--WUAs staff, government officials, and farmers--as a highly cost- effective way to raise
efficiency and productivity in the irrigation sector.

Government satisfaction with PPIMIP--In part due to the fiscal savings resulting from devolution of
responsibility to WUOs, the government has expressed considerable satisfaction with the project:

l The government has expressed interest in pursuing a follow-on project of a similar type
l The government believes that the PPIMIP effectively demonstrates the benefits of public-private
    partnerships, and put forth the project as an example of "best practice" in this area at the Development
    Summit in Johannesburg in 2000. The government is pursuing the replication of the concept in the
    area of licensed warehousing by the Agricultural Sales Cooperatives Unions (potentially with Bank
    support).

Objective (4) Promote efficient and sustainable utilization of irrigation systems which would
contribute to improved agricultural productivity.

Achievement in this area was moderately satisfactory, with anecdotal evidence of greater efficiency and
less positive results in the area of sustainability.

Greater Efficiency and Productivity--The sections above have described how the PPIMIP contributed to
the change in the mind-set of farmers vis--vis supporting WUOs, which in turn utilized and maintained
irrigation schemes in a more efficient manner.

The PPIMIP did not systematically collect data on the greater efficiencies produced by its investments.
However, there is anecdotal evidence of greater efficiency and productivity as a result of rehabilitation
efforts under the project. Associations visited during the ICR mission reported less water loss after
rehabilitation--up to 50% less for some canals (where concrete had been cracked, for instance). One
association reported that its irrigation ratio rose from 65-70% prior to the rehabilitation to 90% afterward.
This same association reported that rehabilitation increased the capacity of its main canal from 8.5
m3/second to 10 m3/second, with much less spillage. Spillage is undesirable because of the water loss but
also because the spilled water erodes support for the concrete canals.

Another WUA reported that the amount of its land under cultivation increased by 2% after the
rehabilitation had been completed. This was due to the elimination of leakage, which had saturated the land
adjacent to the canals and made it unsuitable for cultivation.

A third WUA stated that the greater availability of water permitted by the rehabilitation program enabled it
to bring an additional 750 ha of land under irrigation, a 14% increase over the 5,500 ha it had been able to
irrigate earlier.




                                                                - 15 -

Sustainability: There is a lack of good evidence that all WUOs (not only these participating under the
project), having been given operational and financial responsibility for O&M, are presently receiving
sufficient funding from their memberships to be sustainable in the long run. Although systematic data were
not available, not all WUAs visited during the ICR mission were able to state unambiguously that their
revenues were adequate to cover O&M costs. It should be remarked that this is particularly true among the
poorest WUOs and that, for the same reasons, some of those poorest WUOs could not participate, or at
least not as they would have wished, under the project activities. If a follow-up operation should be
investigated in the future, attention should be paid to the existence of areas or micro areas currently
characterized by uneconomic or very marginally positive economic irrigated agriculture and, on the basis of
the findings, identify ad hoc measures to target these specific realities. In summary it seems that in some
areas a problem of ability to pay is more binding than willingness to pay and that, in order to create a
proper supporting mechanism, more investigation and more tailoring of targeting measures to these realities
is needed.

However, WUAs Directors were convinced that their operations were sustainable. They stated that they
"tailored O&M expenditures to fit available resources;" that they levied special assessments on their
members when they needed to make large expenditures; that they would buy used equipment if required;
and that they were confident that they would be able to raise water fees as required to meet O&M needs.

4.2 Outputs by components:
Component A-Operations and Maintenance Equipment


Table 6 below shows the O&M equipment supplied by the project to WUOs nationwide in sub-component
A1. As can be seen, 3,115 pieces of light equipment were provided to 280 WUAs and irrigation
cooperatives, with 36% of the US$5.6 million cost supported by the project. The project also provided 551
pieces of heavy duty equipment, with 39% of the cost of US$30 million supported by the PPIMIP. The
average grant rate (all types of equipment) provided by the sub-component was 38%.

Table 7 below shows the 13 WUAs that participated in the Pilot Rehabilitation program (PRP,
sub-component A2). It should be noted that the 13 WUAs in six different regions (Adana, Izmir, Eskisehir,
Kayseri, Kahramanras and Aydin) signed 15 separate contracts. Two WUAs, Pamukova and Guney
Yuregir both in Adana region, participated with two separate contracts in 2002 and 2004. In one case seven
WUAs associated themselves for carrying on rehabilitation works on a main conveyance canal whose
performance was affecting all of them. WUAs paid 50% of the contract amount.

Component B: Institutional Strengthening

US$3.28 million was spent on support to DSI, GDRS and WUOs. As noted earlier much of this amount
was spent for equipment and for salaries of the PCU consultants (CC and ACC). Nevertheless within the
scope of this component, the following training activities were also completed:

l Long and short-term consultants were provided. DSI training staff, and trainers from Ministry of
    Interior had an important role in local and foreign training of DSI and GDRS staff as well as WUA
    managerial and technical staff. In this area:

        - Some 240 WUA accountants were trained on procurement, disbursement, bookkeeping, water
        pricing, water fee collection matters, etc.
        - Some 161 WUA engineers were also trained on water distribution, irrigation planning, operation
        and maintenance of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, rehabilitation investments, managing of
        O&M equipment, increasing of irrigation areas and irrigation efficiency etc.



                                                     - 16 -

l The capability of DSI and WUAs on timely and effective monitoring and evaluation of water flows in
   real time within the system was increased by new software and use of a new on-line system. A total of
   127 DSI technical staff and 17 GDRS technical staff involved in project implementation participated in
   English language training courses during the first three years of the project.

l A total of 51 persons from WUOs, DSI and GDRS participated in the study tours, and 22 staff from
   DSI and GDRS participated in short term training courses and seminars. In study tour programs, staff
   visited Spain, France and Holland to review irrigation and drainage management, organization and
   legal issues, rehabilitation and investment matters. Similarly, 17 staff from GDRS and WUOs visited
   Israel and the USA to study drip/sprinkler irrigation design and management issues. In short term
   training, 10 technical staff from DSI attended seminars and IMT meetings in Italy, Spain and
   Indonesia. Similarly, 12 technical staff from GDRS participated in seminars in Italy and a training
   course on pressurized irrigation projects design in Israel for two weeks.

l The project financed the cost of computerizing the O&M Department of DSI, of training and office
    equipment, water level measuring devices, and field vehicles--one for each DSI region.

l GDRS was supported by purchasing computers and software on drip/sprinkler irrigation design and
    training of relevant staff on the issue. The computers and software purchased are still in effective use
    for the drip/sprinkler irrigation design.

l The PCU developed and translated training materials and publications that were distributed to all DSI
    and GDRS offices and to the WUOs by the DSI O&M Department (see list in section 10). They
    included (1) the Turkish translation of a World Bank-EDI publication (book and CD), "Improving the
    Operation of Canal Irrigation Systems;" (2) a booklet (in Turkish) introducing the project in brief,
    "Participatory Irrigation Management and Participatory Irrigation Rehabilitation in Turkey." This
    booklet was published in Turkish and English and distributed to all relevant agencies, WUOs and to
    some foreign countries and of course to the Bank; (3) "Spanish Irrigation Unions and Its National
    Federation" was published in Turkish with pictures of logos of several WUOs of Turkey and
    distributed to all WUOs and relevant agencies.

Component C-Pilot Drip Irrigation Scheme

Only US$40,000 out of an expected US$2 million were disbursed under this component. The main reasons
for the lack of disbursement were:

    (1) Uluborlu IC, which had been expected to be the only participating IC in the Credit Agreement, did
         not do so due to the fact that it was not able to raise a contribution from its local administration as
         it was indeed planning. This process, before the clear drop-out of Uluborlu from the project lasted



                                                      - 18 -

         two years during which the component made no progress.

    (2) After the amendment that included sprinkler irrigation, as well as drip and allowed potential
         participation under the project of ICs other than Uluborlu, the pilot implementing agency, GDRS,
         believed that pilot could be realized in areas where designs had already been prepared by GDRS
         but for which there was no GDRS budget. This approach, beside being top-down and therefore
         conflicting with the general approach of the project, had the effect that no possibility for
         participation was provided to those ICs with available resources but actually more attention was
         paid to those more in need that tried, as previously Uluborlu and again, to mobilize the remainder
         of needed funds from local administrations. However during this phase 4 cooperatives in Afyon
         received grants and did install spray irrigation systems. The Afyon systems seem to be working
         well, with a growing number of users, and the participating cooperatives are unanimously
         affirming that the value of the benefits being generated in each ICs are exceeding costs. However,
         operational or financial data were not available, and there has been only 1 or 2 seasons of
         experience, and so a more definitive judgment will have to await further investigation.

    (3) GDRS covers the support function, at least during the construction phase, for small schemes and
         therefore deals exclusively with ICs. ICs do not have a regular budget (as do the WUAs served by
         DSI), which made it much more difficult for them to participate in a project such as that proposed.

    (4) Excessively high grant rate. This factor should be seen within the context of the relationship
         between GDRS and ICs. Coop members have historically been accustomed to receiving services
         from GRDS for free (and when this was not possible to have GDRS on their side to push for
         mobilizing funds from local administration). Therefore they were not enthusiastic about paying
         60-84% of the cost (in Afyon, local governments contributed funding, which reduced the cost to the
         users to only 25% of the total).

Despite the overall lack of success of this component, several additional benefits were produced. One
WUA, Sarimsakli in Kayseri region, presented a proposal that fitted completely the pilot criteria but was
included into the PRP due to the fact that, being a WUA and not an IC, it reported to DSI (the
implementing agency for PRP). One cooperative in Isparta which was contacted by the project team in
2002 stated that it did not have the funds to pay for over 60% of the project cost. However, they retained
an interest in drip irrigation, and recently completed installation of a US$600,000 drip irrigation project
using foreign technology that had been brought to their attention by project staff. GDRS, using training
received on the job during the PPIMIP, assisted in this installation, which was made possible by
contributions from local government that brought the coop share down to 33%. Another benefit of the
project was that, as a result of participation in the project, GDRS has actively begun to consider how it can
change its mode of doing business to foster greater participation and cost-sharing.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial NPV in 1998 US$=71.30 million (see annex 3)

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Institutional Development Impact was substantial overall,with the following positive achievements:

l The devolution of responsibility by DSI for irrigation O&M activities improved both the efficiency and
    effectiveness of this activity, thereby helping the country to make more efficient use of its financial


                                                      - 19 -

    resources, e.g. as shown in sec. 4.1 above
        - Greater pro-activity in undertaking O&M by WUAs that manage their own work compared to
        those managed by DSI
        - Higher collection rates at WUAs participating in the project (in particular in PRP) than other
        WUAs
l Government agencies formerly responsible for irrigation O&M were reduced in size, and excess
    facilities are being sold off.
l The capacity of participating WUAs was enhanced. The additional O&M equipment bolstered their
    capabilities.
l Based on anecdotal data, agricultural productivity of WUAs that participated under the project seems
    to have increased as a result of more effective irrigation O&M, thereby improving the ability of the
    country to make better use of its natural resources.

As noted earlier, efforts to strengthen DSI and GDRS were unsatisfactory (Component 1.A), however, the
Institutional Development Impact (IDI) achievements cited in the previous paragraph substantially
outweigh these deficiencies.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
l During the second half of 2002, project progress slowed considerably when the Bank sent the
    government notice that the original closing date (December 31, 2002) was approaching. In the event,
    the government requested that the project be extended and the Bank agreed to an 18-month extension
    (which was granted in November 2002) only after having initially refused such extension. The initial
    refusal was linked to a more general issue linked to general management of the WB project portfolio in
    Turkey and was not project specific. However significant progress was lost during the period of
    uncertainty, and it contributed to the non-completion of some planned project activities (e.g., training
    needs assessments).

l The February, 2001, financial crisis slowed purchases of equipment, reduced farmers' and WUOs'
    incomes, and increased uncertainty, thus delaying realization of some project benefits.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
l Regarding the slowdown in progress during the second half of 2002, the Bank's rationale behind the
    initial position not to extend the project was based on a number of Government positions. The Bank
    believed that it was not possible to justify the extension of a project not linked to the agreed reform
    agenda, and that the project also lagged in some institutional and policy changes that would make
    participatory WUOs a permanent element of water resource management (namely the approval of the
    WUOs law). As discussed below (sec. 7.2), portfolio management issues were also a factor.

l There was considerable turnover among GDRS officials during the project and also in DSI soon after
    the November 2002 project extension was granted.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
l Project training activities could not be effectively planned due to inadequate knowledge of WUOs'
    training needs. The WUO training needs assessment was long discussed between the Bank and DSI,
    but was dropped when, even after the extension had been granted, DSI officials still seemed not fully
    convinced of its importance. An additional factor was the shortness of remaining time; even after the
    extension, it was not clear that implementation of the needs assessment would have led on time to
    meaningful follow-up activity in a difficult area.

5.4 Costs and financing:
The project was expected to disburse the entire loan of US$20 million, with an additional US$24.5 million
contributed by the Borrower and beneficiaries. Final disbursement amounts to $19.7 million due to
impossibility of including the remaining US$320,000 in the approved 2004 DSI Budget. It should be noted
that the project became effective in April, 1998, with a planned closing date of December 31, 2002. An
18-month extension was granted, in part due to the 2001 financial crisis, and the project closed on the
revised closing date of June 30, 2004.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability of the reforms supported by the PPIMIP is assessed as likely for the following reasons:

l The paradigm shift away from government support of irrigation schemes toward a system of much
    greater beneficiary participation and financial support is continuing. The increased confidence of
    farmers in WUOs, and their increased propensity to pay for water they use, shows no signs of abating.

l The main government agency that has been providing and financially supporting irrigation schemes,
    DSI, has embraced the paradigm shift and is downsizing its local presence and its O&M staff. As
    shown in data presented above, particularly Table 5, this paradigm shift has accelerated significantly
    since 1998 and is highly unlikely to be reversed.

l The devolution of funding responsibility from DSI to WUOs and the agency's consequent downsizing
    has resulted in fiscal benefits. From 1997 to 2003, DSI O&M expenditures declined from 30.4 trillion
    TL (in constant 2003 TL) to 8.6 trillion, a reduction of TL 21.8 trillion, or 72% (Table 4). These
    savings are much appreciated by government, are consistent with its program to rationalize the
    structure of expenditures in the agricultural sector, and make it more likely that the benefits from the
    changes supported by the project will be sustained.

l Where O&M responsibility has been devolved to WUOs, based on anecdotal data, greater efficiency
    and agricultural productivity seem to have resulted.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Transition to regular operations is already complete. The WUOs are using the equipment, rehabilitated
irrigation schemes, and expertise they gained from the project. The government agencies are functioning
more effectively, in most aspects, and the devolution of O&M management is progressing very well.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
As described above (se. 3.5), Quality at Entry was overall unsatisfactory.

7.2 Supervision:
Supervision was overall satisfactory. The project team worked closely with the PCU and the Borrower
agencies through the 2001 financial crisis and 2 amendments to bring the project to a satisfactory
conclusion. The adjustments made in the amendments refocused the project and had a positive effect on
performance.

The Bank also monitored project activity closely. A survey was made of all WUOs that received


                                                     - 21 -

equipment, and in only one case out of 300 was misuse of equipment discovered. The Bank also verified
through extensive visits that for all WUOs that implemented rehabilitation projects, the decisions had been
approved by the WUO general assembly (improvements in governance) and that rural communities were
generally satisfied with the results.

However, there were some deficiencies. From 1998 to 2001, the project had 3 Task Team Leaders, which
negatively affected communications and necessitated that the new TTLs ascend the project "learning
curve." Also, during the period July-November, 2002, there was considerable uncertainty over the possible
extension of the project, which delayed implementation of some components. The main reasons behind the
initial refusal of the Bank to agree to the Government's proposal were only partially connected with the
project (including the lack of approval of a WUO law), as discussed in sec. 5.2 above. It was also linked to
portfolio issues: the type and length of projects in the Bank portfolio, including a large number for which
extensions had been requested. The Bank decided to extend the project for an additional 18 months in
November 2002, just before its scheduled closing; the PPIMIP was one of only two projects extended of the
6 for which extensions had been requested. But significant momentum was lost during the period of
uncertainty, which contributed to the non-implementation of some planned project activities, in particular
the training needs assessment was nearly agreed in 2002 but later in 2003 DSI did not consider the activity
favorably anymore, and it was therefore definitively dropped.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank Performance was satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance in preparation was satisfactory. This was facilitated by the concurrence of views
on the direction that policy toward irrigation O&M should take. DSI, in particular, was helpful in project
identification.

Taking into account the number of implementing agencies, DSI and GDRS state agencies as well as WUOs
all over the Country, identification took longer than envisioned. Several field visits were made to existing
WUOs for components A and C with participation of DSI and GDRS staff. Also, a questionnaire was
circulated to all WUOs to determine their readiness to participate and try to fix their commitments.
Excellent cooperation and ideas on implementation were obtained from all parties.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
On balance, government implementation performance was satisfactory, although it varied significantly
among agencies. DSI and GDRS were the principal implementing agencies (along with Treasury). DSI
was very cooperative and collaborative with other agencies. However, GDRS was less so as noted earlier,
while DSI overall was quite positive, some components of the agency were not so constructive. During the
last two years of implementation, GDRS participated little in project activities. Borrower performance was
adversely affected by the macroeconomic crisis of February, 2001. Study tours during project
identification to the U.S. and Mexico were quite effective in conveying to staff the key elements involved in
the devolution of responsibility and funding to WUOs; however, later study tours during project
implementation (the Netherlands, France, and Spain) were less effective in this regard.

It should be noted that project progress was considerably facilitated by strong support from the principal
implementing agency, DSI. DSI staff in Ankara and at the regional levels enthusiastically supported
devolution of responsibility for O&M, and after the project was amended, for rehabilitation as well, and
DSI regional staff worked very closely with project coordinators to convince WUOs to participate.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Performance of the PCU was satisfactory. The PCU was very active in promoting the project to WUOs
across the country. Project beneficiaries and government officials praised the professionalism and
responsiveness of the project PCU. Procurement was handled effectively despite the inexperience of
WUOs in this area. All procurement guidelines were followed, despite initial difficulty in convincing the
staff of WUOs and Ministry of Interior auditors that Bank procurement procedures needed to be followed.
While some WUAs accountants were concerned over potential misprocurements, this problem was
diminished by several training courses for WUA accountants held by the DSI O&M Dept. and the PCU
with contributions by Ministry of Interior auditors. An illustrative diagram in the annex shows the
pathway of grant applications from eligible WUAs and payments to the suppliers of goods and works.

As noted earlier (sec. 4.2, Component B), the PCU was also active in disseminating materials relevant to
the project, and in translating into Turkish and distributing relevant foreign materials.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower Performance was satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned


l Rehabilitation is more important than equipment--The original project concept involved only
    equipment for O&M, with rehabilitation of irrigation schemes added later. However, rehabilitation
    provides a more tangible benefit, and provides it more rapidly, thus having a greater impact on the
    performance and credibility of the WUO.

l Effective training for WUOs is critical--Because they are being given increased responsibility for
    managing and funding O&M, WUOs need effective training in management, finance, water distribution
    techniques, and rehabilitation priorities, as well as other areas. In the PPIMIP, adequate training was
    not always provided, however, the WUOs learned "on the job" and reached an adequate level of
    competency. Additionally, PPIMIP was successful in part because it focused mainly on WUAs that
    are currently much better trained than other types of WUOs.

l Facing a new paradigm, DSI needs to reorient its mission--Functioning within a new paradigm,
    DSI needs to reorient its mission to more explicitly focus on WUO support, and it might require
    training in the modalities of its relationships with WUOs. DSI also needs more assistance than was
    provided in the PPIMIP to help its training function adapt to the new reality and provide training that is
    relevant and useful to the newly-empowered WUOs.

l Monitoring and Evaluation should have been stronger--The PPIMIP had little or no identification
    of meaningful monitoring indicators, establishment of initial benchmarks, or systematic data collection.
    The project was designed to promote participatory involvement of WUOs in irrigation investment, and
    it would have been much stronger in this regard if the M&E had been better developed.

l Having more than one implementing agency with clearly different relative roles in project
    implementation can lead to a problem of dedication to the project of the agency covering the minor
    role. The pilot drip irrigation component was probably overlooked by GDRS also due to the relatively
    small amount of funds allocated and due to the prominent role the other implementing agency, DSI, had
    in the project. Very often GDRS management did not seem to have that sense of ownership towards the
    project that was typical of DSI.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The ICR was transmitted to the Undersecretariat of Treasury in early November 2004 and only one and a
half pages of written comments have been received by the Bank, only from GDRS. Those comments were
quite general and insisted on the necessity of continuing with similar activities to those implemented by the
project and, whenever possible, to increase the level of grant rate for activities aimed at targeting ICs.
Additionally, several meetings among the TTL, the former PCU director and deputy, the two implementing
agencies, the Undersecretariat of Treasury and the State Planning Organization took place in Ankara on
December 7 and 8, 2004. From the discussions held during those meetings it emerged that:
l No major issue about the ICR has been raised by any of the parties mentioned above.
l There is a general request to the Bank of continuing with financing similar project activities in the
    future.
l The mild tone used in the ICR and the general tone of this document aimed at sharing equitably merits
    and responsibilities among users, implementing agencies and the Bank, has been widely appreciated.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

Lack of precise M&E data makes it quite difficult to run an economic analysis for PPIMIP and typical
calculation of NPV and/or ERR. Nevertheless some realistic assumptions can be made and approximate
results can be observed. The approach used below has been very conservative:

        It takes into account as costs the amount of loan disbursed (US$19,680,000)
        It takes into account as benefits only those coming from implementation of component A (both
    A1-O&M equipment and A2-Pilot Rehabilitation Program) that utilized 80% of the disbursed
    Loan amount. All costs related to component B (institutional strengthening), component C (pilot
    drip/sprinkler), and project management has not been considered as generator of benefits.

Calculation of the NPV for the project has been obtained adding up NPVs calculated at year zero (1998)
for the three parts of the project, O&M equipment, rehabilitation and rest of the project.

Sub-Component A1
Under sub-component A1 O&M equipment has been provided to 280 WUAs out of the about 350 that have
been established in Turkey. The 350 WUAs cover an area of approximately 2.6 million ha and therefore we
can assume in proportion that the 280 WUAs participating under the project manage infrastructure
commanding an area of about 2.0 million ha. Interviews with twelve WUAs held by the project team in
May 2004 shows that provision of O&M equipment under the project supported the WUAs to provide
water to an estimated small percentage of 1-5% of area that was not receiving it (usually at the tail ends)
and improve supply to another 10-25% that was not receiving adequate provision. We can therefore affirm,
conservatively choosing the low-end of those ranges, that sub-component A1 was decisive in contributing
to provide irrigation to 1% of 2.0 million ha= 20,000 ha and to provide adequate irrigation to 10% of 2.0
million ha=200,000 ha. Following again the conservative approach it was decided not to include: (i) the
benefits due to increased reliability of water supply that could have caused a shift towards more economic
crops over the whole area of 2.0 million ha, therefore no change in cropping patterns was assumed; and (ii)
any benefits that a better provision of water as a result of the better O&M could have caused on the
remaining 89% of the area.

On the basis of the agronomic and economic data collected during economic analysis of intervention under
PRP it can be affirmed that average incremental annual financial gross margin for crops in Turkey between
irrigated and not irrigated land ranges from US$600 to 2,000 per ha per year and that average incremental
annual gross margin between poorly and adequately irrigated land ranges from US$100 to 300 per ha per
year. Again, following a conservative approach the lower end of these ranges has been utilized and a 0.5
conversion factor applied. The 0.5 conversion factor used to reduce financial gross margin to economic
ones reflects the reduction necessary to evaluate at economic prices the PSE (Prod. Subsidy Estimate)-
AMS (Aggregate Measures of Support) level of roughly 20% in Turkey during the observed period of
project implementation. Therefore the economic unit benefit associated to 1 ha of new irrigated land has
been 0.5*600=US$300 and those associated to 1 Ha of land with adequate provision of water
0.5*100=US$50.

On the cost side the investment costs (US$14.01) have been distributed uniformly along the six year
implementation period and it has been assumed that, in order to produce the benefit above described, the
associated areas involved an additional cost of annual US$15 per ha in terms of variable costs (fuel, labor
etc.).

The result of the analysis shows that even under such very conservative assumptions the economic NPV

(using a 12% discount rate) of the component in 1998 US$ is US$8.8 million (almost US$26 financially).

Sub-component A2
Calculation of economic and financial NPVs in 1998 US$ for sub-component A2 has been made much
easier by the existence of the economic and financial analysis of each single investment calculated in detail
during project implementation before proceeding with approval of each single grant request (that was
needed in order to verify the economic feasibility of each rehabilitation request, detailed documentation is
available in the project files). It should be noted that in those calculations both increase in gross value of
agricultural production and savings in terms of less amount of water used has been computed. This is
different from the approach used for sub-component A1 when only the former was used but it has been
made possible by the existence of WUA specific detailed data. Clearly the main difficulty has been
calculation of the shadow price of irrigation.

On the cost side, the annualized costs of providing irrigation have been estimated at $250/ha/year based on
DSI's investment program costs, as show below. Adjustment has been made for inclusion in the analysis in
accordance with the prior calculations made for WUA investment projects made by DSI.

  shadow value of water at marginal cost


Industry and urban users are assumed not to compete for the use of irrigation water in Turkey and none of
the WUAs selected for analysis command water resources on international or potentially disputed waters.
Hence, barring competition among the WUAs themselves, the scarcity rent would be equal to zero and
therefore the real shadow value of water can be assumed to be equal to the average (marginal) cost of
supplying it to users. Nevertheless it should be emphasized that the rate of US$250/ha/year applies to new
schemes where all crops  existing or potential - switch from dry to irrigated conditions, hence generating
very significant incremental returns to the investment and justifying the same investment. In rehabilitation
schemes, where returns to investments are modest, the annualized costs are much lower, and must apply
only to incremental quantities of water that will be consumed in irrigation on the incremental areas to be
improved, duly adjusted for the scarcity value of water. In this context, there appears to be a need to adopt
a normative approach and make a downward adjustment in the above computed average cost of provision
of irrigation. The adjusted costs of irrigation have been computed using the following reasoning: this cost
as percent of marginal cost of new investment is therefore assumed to be very low and in line with the
amount of necessary O&M variable costs needed for maintaining the system capable of performing its
water conveyance function without major loss. This value has been therefore approximated to 6% of
US$250 or US$15/ha/year that is in line with the value of needed O&M variable costs used in the analysis
for sub-component A1. Scarcity rent value of percent of marginal cost of new investment has been
assumed to be zero. The Standard Conversion Factors (SFC) adopted for converting financial prices
(market prices) into economic prices have been borrowed from prior analysis reports on WUA investment
projects and some additions were made on the basis of locally available information (different by crop and
in some cases by region). Use of these crop-specific SFCs associated with the fact that these are applied to

realistic crop patterns (WUAs included under PRP were thoroughly investigated prior to financing
including their cropping patterns) allow us a much more `exact conversion between financial and economic
values than the approximate 0.5 factor used for analysis of sub-component A1. Observing the final total
economic NPV and total financial NPV of table 10 and 11 it can be said that in case of sub-component A2
the average adopted SCF is 0.7.

The above calculated financial and economic NPV for sub-component A2 expressed in 2003 US$ have
then been discounted at 12% to bring them back at 1998 values.

Rest of project costs
These costs (US$3.67 million) have been assuming as not generating any benefit. Their total amount has
been spread uniformly during the six years life of the project and the stream discounted at 12% to obtain
the negative NPV in 1998 terms.

The final results of the analysis are summarized in the table below and, despite the conservative
assumptions made, that sometimes were quite severe, show a total NPV in 1998 terms of US$71.3 million
(financial) and US$28.47 million (economic).
