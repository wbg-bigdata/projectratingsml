UPPER REGION AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1291-T-GH)
PREFACE
1.       This is the completion report (PCR) on the Upper Region Agri-
cultural Development Project. The loan was approved by the Executive
Directors in June 1976 in the amount of US$21.0 million. The project
closed September 30, 1984, twenty-one months after the original closing
date.
2.       The report comprises a Project Completion Report prepared by
the Project's Monitoring and Evaluation Unit with consultant assistance
and a Bank Overview prepared by the Western Africa Regional Office. The
report was sent to the Operations Evaluation Department, where it was
read. It was then decided not to audit the project, and was sent to the
Borrower on March 11, 1987 for comments. Word came on April 10, 1987,
from the Ghanaian Embassy that there would be no comments forthcoming on
the report.
3.       Western Africa Regional Office gratefully acknowledges the
valuab'e assistance provided by the Government and project staff in the

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GHANA
UPPER REGION AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.        The Upper Region Agricultural Development Project was the first
broad-based area development project to be financed by the Bank in Ghana.
The project was identified in October 1974, prepared in late 1974 and 1975
and appraised in November 1975. Board approval was in June 1976 and the
project became effective in April 1977. The project closing date was
postponed twice and the project closed September 1984, 21 months after the
original closing date. The delay between approval and effectiveness was
due to the time taken to rppoint key staff and set up the Farmers Services
Company (FASCOM).
2.        The project was designed to increase production of foodcrops,
cotton and livestock by providing inputs, improved agricultural extension
and animal health services, supporting infrastructure and institutional
strengthening. The project was also designed to improve water supplies and
strengthen nutrition and health services. 2 The project area comprised the
Upper Region of Ghana, covering 27,300 km with 125,000 farm families,
which was sub-divided into the Upper East and Upper West Regions in 1984.
3.        The project was implemented during a period of considerable
political change and steady decline of the country's economy and
infrastructure. The effect on the project was that the supply of
agricultural inputs and raw materials was unpredictable, management did not
always enjoy the support of central and regional administrations and
farmers could not count on consistent incentives to raise production.
4.        The project was successful in shifting Government policy to the
support of small farmers, the decentralization of agricultural services and
an improvement in the distribution of inputs through a Farmers Services
Comp,any (FASCOM) in which farmers would build up part ownership. The
project was not successful in having a demonstrable impact on crop and
livestock production and the Economic Rate of Return is estimated to be
below 10 percent.



- vi -
5.        There were considerable delays in implementation due to country
conditions and poor management. The project closing date was postponed
twice, for a total extension of 21 months, in order to complete key
infrastructure, provide essential agricultural inputs, which were in short
supply due to foreign exchange shortages, fund emergency assistance for a
Rinderpest campaign and restructure FASCOM whlch experienced serious
mianagement and financial problems in 1981/82. The restructuring was
successful and FASCOM is now under competent management.
6.        Total project costs are estimated at US 166.1 milllon compared
with US $54.6 million at appraisal, a cost overrun of 21%. While the value
of ths cedi was held stable at 02.75 to US $1.00 dollar during the period
1977-82, it vas excessively overvalued in dollar terms and between 1983 and
the project closing in 1984 there was an accumulated official devaluation
in excess of 1200%.
7.        The PCR raises issues on (a) project design which failed to
provide for the difficult geographic location of the Upper Region and was
over ambitious in its infrastructural objectives and its projections for
both crop and livestock production; (b) management problems arising from
attempting to take on 'the entire Ministry of Agriculture services in the
Region; and (c) the failure to maintain an effective dialogue between the
Bank and Government which contributed to the inconsistency in farmer
Incentives.
8.        The following important lessons are highlighted:
-    project design should not be over-complex, the number of
components should be kept commensurate with the management
capabilities of implementing agencies who should participate
fully in the design process;
-    integrated area development projects which demand a high
level of managerial skill and are relatively costly in use
of financial resources are unlikely to be cost-effective in
Ghana's economic conditions with agricultural support
services widely rundown;
-    until Government salaries are raised it will difficult to
attract suitably qualified management staff or motivate
field staff to contribute more than a small part of their
working day to project work;
-    development projects should not be implemented in the
absence of an effective dialogue on agricultural policy and
pricing.

PROJECT COMPLETION RTIPORT
GHANA
UPPER REGION AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
_ (Loan 1291-T-GH)
BANK OVERVIEW
I. GENERAL
Introduction
1.01      The Completion Report was prepared by the Project's Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit (PMEU) with the assistance of a consultant. The report
provides a fair account of how the project was iaplemented but, because of
the lack of firm production data, is short on quantitative analysis of
project achievements. The overview draws some conclusions on project
impact and elaborates on the issues raised and lessons learned.
1.02      The project was identified and prepared in 1974 and appraised in
November 1975. Board approval was obtained in Jtne 1976 and the project
became effective in April 1977. The project closed in September 1984
following two extensions totalling 21 months. The United Kingdom provided
technical assistance and cofinancing, while the Netherlands Government
provided independent funding for an agricultural training institute, in the
Upper Region, which assisted the project.
Project Design
1.03      The project, which was the first broad-based agricultural
development project to be financed by the Bank in Ghana, was designed to
increase production (foodclops, cotton and livestock) and family incomes in
an area covering 27,300 km wbich supported 125,000 farm families and 40X
of Ghana's livestock population. The project was expected to be
implemented over five years and to include:
(a) Farm Development: establish 90 Farm Service Centers (FSC);
provide farm inputs, better animal health services and
establish 10 livestock ranches; assist applied research and
a functional literacy program; expand radio broadcasting;



- viii -
improve on-farm grain storage, nutrition and health services
and staff training;
(b) Physical Infrastructure: construct 120 small dams and
rehabilitate 100 to provide for dry season gardening,
development of fruit trees and fish ponds and water for
cattle; improve soil and water conservation; construct 700
wells, stores, FSCs, houses and offices; and two cotton
ginneries;
(c) Institutional Support: establish project management unit
and a Farmers Services Company; strengthen the regional
branch of the Agricultural Development Bank and the Upper
Region Development Corporation;
(d)  Development Planning:  prepare ten year development plan for
areas in the Upper and Northern Regions freed from
Onchocerciasis.
1.04      Project design followed the custom in the mid'70s of funding both
improved agricultural development services and the filling of obvious gaps
in nutritional, health, literacy and water supply programs which might
otherwise constrain agricultural development. In addition, the project'
Introduced an innovative approach to improving the supply and distribution
of farm inputs (fertilizer, seed, chemicals, tools) with the creation of a
Farmers Services Company (FASCOM) in which farmers would build up an equity
interest, and eventually ownership, through a 2i percent mark-up on sales.
A feeder road program was not included since it was expected that some 800
km of feeder roads would be improved during 1977/80 under a separate
highway project (Cr. 594/Ln. 1182-GH). In the event, only a small part of
the road program was implemented. 1/
1.05      The project represented a major shift in Government policy which,
since 1960, had concentrated on schemes for direct production by the state
and assistance to larger farmers (particularly mechanized rice farming).
Attempts to improve agriculture in the Upper Region date back to the 1930s
and, by the late 19508, ox cuiltivation and use of soil and water
conservation techniques were well established particularly in the densely
populated eastern sector around Bawku. Although Government assistance to
small holders decreased after 1960, a number of non-governmental
organ'.zatinns (NGO) continued to operate in the Upper Region, and in the
early 1970s, the Federal Republic of Germany also provided assistance for
fertilizer distribution. It was expected that the Upper Region
Agricultural Development Project (URADEP) would build on the work of one
NGO (The Christian Service Committee of the Christian Council of Ghana) in
spreading improved agricultural practices through extension and provision
of inputs, and to assist, inter alia, dry season gardening, bullock
training and supply of farm implements.

1.06      The thin research base and complexity of the mixed cropping
patterns in use tiroughout the Region was recognized in the Staff Appraisal
Report 2/ as was the difficulty of estimating production responses from the
mixed cropping system. Some 70% of gross benefits were expected to stem
from increased production of cotton and rice for which improved technology
was available - although, in the case of cotton, it would involve a change
to pure stand cropping. Much of the increase in production was expected to
come from greater use of fertilizer. At appraisal the Economic Rate cf
Return was projected at 40%.
Project Implementation
1.07      The PCR highlights major problems in implementation due to
management and country conditions as well as technical considerations
arising from project design. The project was implemented during a period
of considerable political change and steady decline of the country's
economy and physical infrastructure. There were five changes in government
and following the advent of the present government in December 1981, the
creation of Workers' Defense Committees and Peoples' Defense Committees
which were expected to participate in management and resource allocation
nationwide$ added a new factor to project management. Senior MOA staff in
Accra did not provide the necessary support in assigning suitably qualified
and experienced staff to the project or allocation of inputs. Even the
Regional Administration was not always supportive in allocation of raw
materials and made unreasonable demands on logistical support from the
project.
1.08      Problems of changes in the national political scene c'mpounded
what was from the start a difficult relationship between the project and
the Ministry of Agriculture. The project was the first major attempt to
decentralize agricultural services to the reglonal level. At the time,
departmental directors in Accra controlled all technical and administrative
decisions, including staff movement, and it was not until towards the end
of the project that responsibility was shifteu to Regional Agricultural
Directors and Deputy Secretaries for Agriculture appointed to regional
administrations. Unfortunately, at about the same time that these changes
were introduced in 1983/84, the senior civil service echelon in the
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) was dismissed leaving MOA, Accra ill equipped
to play its essential role of framing policy and resource allocation. The
project never received the support of Accra based departmental directors
and as a consequence was often excluded from the allocation of the few
inputs procured by MOA. As a result, Government did not meet its expected
contribution to non-incremental costs.
2/   Appraisal of Upper Region Agricultural Development Project - Ghana.
Report No. 1061a-GH, June 3, 1976.



1.09      At the regional level the project effectively took over all the
services of the Ministry of Agriculture in the Upper Region. This proved
too large a task for project management and, compounded by oversights in
staff recruiting procedures (PCR para 5.02), led to serious unrest which
affected implementation. Poor management was a major factor in the
suspension of disbursements by the Bank in 1980 and although management
aubsequently improved it was unable to deal effectively with the changing
political situation and rapid decline in the economy 1980/83. Although the
major staff problems in URADEP were resolved in 1981, trouble in FASCOM
surfaced early in 1S82. FASCOM's senior management was dismissed and the
company wr- - through a difficult time until the appointment of the present
Managing Director in June 1984.
1.10      Initially (PY1-3) the project was successful in increasing the
supply of farm inputs, mainly fertilizer, to the Region and stepping up
animal health services (see PCR table 1 and PCR Annex 2, Tables 1 & 2).
Later animal health services continued in line with target but input
supplies fell well below target as country conditions worsened. However it
took between two and three years to start construction of physical
infrastructure and achievement fell way short of target (PCR Table 1). The
PCR (para 3.44) highlights delays 'i implementation due to the time taken
to complete procurment of the dam building equipment financed under the UK
loan. The equipment was delivered in 1979 and construction did not start
until 1980/81 four years after project effectiveness. Subsequently fuel
shortages (particularly acute during 1981-1983) constrained implementation.
Implementation of the broadcasting component was also made difficult by the
complexity of the final design of the broadcasting station compared with
the provisions at appraisal (PCR para 3.23).
1.11      Implementation of key components was also affected by the failure
of other agencies. The project lost control over seed supplies in 1979
when the Government transferred responsibility for seed production
nationwide to the Ghana Seed Company. The key cotton component (38% of
projected gross benefits) was affected by the failure of the Cotton
Development Board (CDB) to purchase seed cotton on time or provide inputs.
Indeed the relationship between URADEP and CDB and role of each in
provision of extension and input supply services was never properly
defined. As a result, the project did not have sufficient control over a
key component. While the road program (para 1.04) was not implemented as
expected this is not regarded as a significant factor in the project's
failure to meet its production targets - except to the extent that the
worsening access to the south effected the access of traders to the Region.
1.12      As a result of the serious implementation problems that had
developed, a joint Bank/ODA mission recommended in October 1980 that the
project scope be scaled back. Project staff prepared a revised two year
program which was agreed with the Bank and ODA in November 1981 (PCR para
3.06), Even this program proved over ambitious with the deterioration in
conditions 1981/83. As the project geared up its capacity to implement the
infrastructure program, so the supply of raw materials began to dry up. At
the request of the Government, the project closing date was postponed twice



- xi -
for a total of 21 months to aid inter alia the completion of village
stores, the cotton ginnery, radio broadcasting station and dam construction
and rehabilitation program, as well as to fund agricultural inputs and to
provide short term financial assistance for a nationwide Rinderpest
vaccination program. Although by project rompletion reasonable progress
had been made on the village store program, the cotton ginnery had been
completed and 'mothballed' and the broadcasting station building had been
completed, the broadcasting equipment had still not been commissioned. ODA
agreed to provide additional technical assistance through December 1985 for
the small dam program and continued to assist URADEP and the Ghana
Broadcasting Corporation with the commissioning of the broadcasting
equipment.
II. PROJECT IMPACT
Project Objectives
2.01      The project had two principal objectives:  first to increase
agricultural production and thus farm incomes; and second, to establish
permanent farmer support services. The project was expected to do this by
redefining the role of agricultural services and intensifying extension for
crop and animal production and human nutrition; by developing associated
physical infrastructure, including an intensive effort to halt the rapid
rate of soil erosion; and by developing specialized institutions to service
the commercial and financial requirements of the Region's farmers.
Impact on Production and Farm Incomes
2.02      The Project's Monitoring and Evaluation Department (PMED) failed
to produce reliable data on the impact of the project on agricultural
production. The project inherited a large and unwieldy organization from
MOA and in spite of recommendations from t-wo Bank supervision missions the
hiving off of a small unit specifically to monitor project progress was
never implemented. The unit was without a qualified head between 1980 and
1983 and did not receive the necessary support from project management, but
continued to service the wider needs of MOA, Accra. The failure of the
monitoring and evaluation system was addressed in the design of the other
Bank supported area development project in Ghana - the Volta Region
Agricultural Development Project which is on-going. A small unit,
independent of MOA's Economic Research and Planning Services, was set up
and has been supervised regularly by technical assistance which also
provides back up services.
2.03      Cultivated area and production fluctuated during the project
period due to varying rainfed conditions, supply of inputs and producer
incentives. Data prepared in 1980 showed a decline in area cultivated and
production between 1975/76 and 1978/79 but an increase in yield attributed
to the increased supply of inputs, mainly fertilizer. Following drout;it in
1981/82, foodcrop prices rose through 1984 and the area under cultivation



- xii -
increased in 1984. Fertilizer availability rose sharply between 1977 and
1980 (PCR table 1) but fell thereafter as Government had difficulty in
financing imports.
2.04      At appraisal the distribution of net benefits between crop
production and livestock production had been estimated at 60:40. Some 38%
of gross benefits from crop production were projected to be derived from
cotton and 32% from maize and rice. In the event, cotton production fell
steadily between 1976/77 (PY1) and 1984. Following a sharp increase in
price (from J0.10 to 40.35/lb) in 1974/75, profitability declined as price
for seed cotton was held constant 1974/75 to 1977/78 and subsequent
increases did not match the rise in foodcrop prices. The Cotton
Development Board ran into sericus problems of transport and shortage of
funds so that seed cotton was not bought on time. Rice production was
affected by fluctuating rainfall.
2.05      Targets on livestock production from provision of improved
veterinary services were met but the ranch program and stock improvement
program proved over ambitious and without a sound sociological or
technological basis. In addition the funds allocated to the emergency
Rinderpest vaccination program contributed to the containment of the
disease at a time when the Veterinary Department was very short of funds.
The project also introduced a program for vaccination of village poultry
flocks against Newcastle Disease.
2.06      Overall, only 25% of the small dam construction and
rehabilitation program was implemented, with difficulty. Nevertheless the
social and economic value of the schemes has been demonstrated and it is a
component which deserves continuing support. However a more effective
institutional vehicle for implementation would be required to organize
farmer participation and assure supplies of fuel and raw materials.
2.07      While PMED was unable to calculate an Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) for the project, it is clear, based on the shortfa: in input supply
for foodcrop production in the latter years, the decline in cotton
production and the failure to develop the ranch program, that it would fall
far short of the 40% estimated at appraisal. Sensitivity tests in the
appraisal report indicated a 9% ERR given a 75% reduction in incremental
crop and livestock direct costs and benefits. However in the context of
the deteriorating economic situation the "without" project situation could
have been substantially worse than the actual situation during the life of
the project. Nevertheless, in view of the cost overruns and substantial
shortfalls in production the ERR was clearly below the acceptable 10%
cut-off point.
Impact on Agricultural Services and Institutions
2.08      The project, which was the first attempt to decentralize MOA
activities, had a major impact on the organization of agricultural services
through its effect on decentralization, agricultural extension and input
supply. The principles of the "Training & Visits" System of Agricultural



- xiii -
Extension were introduced with farmers organized into groups around
proposed input delivery points. This was the first time that the system
had been tried in Ghana and it faced considerable problems not least of
which was the existence of a number of parallel services covering crops,
livestock and home extension all with vested interests in remaining
independent. Good progress was made in reorganizing services during the
project but achievements will not be sustainable without further technical
assistance and, above all, an improvement in staff salaries and payment of
travelling expenses.
2.09      The establishment of the Farmers Services Company (FASCOM) was a
major innovation for the improvement of input distribution in an area with
extremely difficult access to the ports and suppliers in the south. The
company after a successful launch experienced serious management problems
in 1982 (PCR para 5.04). The Regional Administration successfully tackled
these problems with the assistance of a consultant study. By project
closing, FASCOM had been reorganized under competent management. The time
required to resolve these problems was a major factor in the Bank agreeing
to extend the project closing date.
III. ISSUES
3e01      The PCR faults project design on grounds that it failed to
provide for the difficult geographic location of the Upper Region, that it
set over ambitious targets for construction and over estimated livestock
producers' incentive to maximise income. The area selected, which was a
disadvantaged region, was an obvious candidate for the integrated
agricultural development projects designed at the time to focus on
attacking poverty and agricultural production. Furthermore, it was
expected that the Onchocerciasis eradication program would allow people to
return to the more fertile river valleys and that the project would prepare
the agricultural services for meeting these future demands. However, the
location of the project area posed considerable logistical problems which
were exacerbated not only by the rapid decline in country economic
conditions, but also by the limited support given by the Government in
Accra for the duration of the project. The deterioration in conditions of
infrastructure and transport between 1975 and 1983 was considerable. The
country's transport fleet became completely rundown without spares and
tyres, and fuel supplies dried up. Road maintenance ceased and journey
time between Accra and Bolgatanga increased twofold. Transporters were
unwilling to risk their vehicles on the roads without the project providing
new tyres. With hindsight, given the conditions that ultimately prevailed,
the project can be said to have been overdesigned and this was recognized
in 1980 when the program was reviewed and cut back. Construction targets
were ambitious bearing in the mind the complexity of the project and the
problems which arose on procurement point to the need to take greater
account of delays inherent when a number of organizations with different
criteria are involved.



- xiv -
3.02      The Region agrees that potential for increasing cattle production
through private ranches was over estimated and did not take into account
sociological factors. Similar experiences have been recorded in livestock
components on projects throughout West Africa and lessons learnt have been
taken into account in the design of new projects. The area also posed
considerable problems for the increase in crop production since the
research base was thin for the particular soils and rainfall regime. While
project design made provision for an agricultural research component to
adapt available technologies, the component was poorly implemented and a
number of separate sections were retained to cater for individual
personalities. It was not until towards the end of the project that these
were brought together and even then petty rivalries persisted.
3.03      The second issue which the Region would like to highlight is that
of management. The project set out to build up the capacity of the
agricultural service institution and in attempting so to do effectively
took on the entire Ministry of Agriculture services structure in the Upper
Region. The problems and mistakes made are summarized in the PCR (para
5.01/5.02). The successful integration of a target orientated project
within the civil service bureaucracy proved impossible, in spite of the
increased resources available and degree of financial autonomy provided.
One result was that staff numbers increased considerably. However, here
also, the decline in economic conditions exacerbated the situation. As a
result of rapid inflation and devaluation, the real buying power of civil
services fell dramatically to the point where they provided no more than
20% of minimum subsistence needs. As a result there was, and still is,
little motivation to stay on the job and the majority have to farm on their
own account.
3.04      Experience with URADEP highlights the need for sarong management
and support from the centre as well as the Regional Administration, if
decentralization is to work.  The most appropriate organization og Regional
Agricultural Services is an issue to be addressed under the Agriculture
Sector Rehabilitation Project now under preparation.
3.05      The project was more successful in the establishment of the
Farmers Services Company (U/R) Limited (FASCOM). The company went through
a difficult perlod (PCR para 5.04) but now, following the efforts made
during the period of project extension, is under strong Ghanaian
management. In an area of difficult access for the private sector FASCOM
has a role to play in supplying the input requirements particularly of
small farmers. It will need to work with the private sector and farmer
groups to minimize costs and will need the support of Government in working
out the appropriate organizational form. The unconventional proposal in
the SAR to issue shares to farmers through a mark up on sales, proved
difficult to implement and was not properly resolved at project completion.
The consultants (para 2.09) have proposed that amounts reserved for
farmers' equity be issued as share capital to the FSC Committees. This
approach appears the most satisfactory in the circumstances.



-xv-
3.06      A third issue is the impact of the failure to maintain an
effective dialogue between the Bank and the Government of Ghana during
Implementation. The project was implemented during a period when the
dialogue effectively ceased; while on-going projects continued to be
supported by the Bank, no new projects were presented to the Board. The
customary macro-economic dialogue ceased and contributed to the failure to
implement successfuly the agreement to review agricultural pricing and
subsidy policy (PCR para 5.12), with disastrous effects on cotton
production. The Government paper on the subject requested by 6/30/77 was
never submitted, and it was not until the dialogue had resumed in 1983 and
the first stage of the Economic Recovery Program put together, that, in
meeting the run up to the first Rehabilitation Import Credit, fertilizer
subsidy was abruptly removed. This coincided with a devaluation of about
1000% and the consequent tenfold increase in price of fertilizer seriously
eroded small farmer confidence; even though foodcrop prices were sufficient
to yield an attractive financial return to fertilizer use. The failure to
maintain an effective dialogue also led to difficulties in procurement of
the project's share of inputs and raw materials.
3.07      In view of the continuing problems which beset the project, the
question should be asked whether or not the project should have been closed
down when the macro-economic dialogue broken down and key conditions, such
as provision of an overdraft facility (PCR para 3.03), were not met. The
question was actively discussed at the time, particularly in the run-up to
the decision to suspend disbursements informally in December 1980, and the
Region concluded that it would be better to complete unfinished
infrastructure and use remaining funds to provide farm inputs and, later,
restructure FASCOM. Conditions set for the resumption of disbursements
included appointment of a strong manager and a chief accountant, action on
the Committee of Enquiry's (PCR para 5.01) recommendations, reshaping of
the project and Government to provide adequate local funds and fertilizer.
Disbursements were resumed in April 1981 when these conditions had either
been met or satisfactory action initiated.
IV. LESSONS LEARNED
4.01      Lessons learned from URADEP have been taken into account in the
development of the Bank's lending program to Ghana and in the design of the
proposed Agriculture Sector Rehabilitation Project. Important lessons are:
-    project design should not be over-complex, the number of
components should be kept commensurate with the management
capabilities of implementing agencies who should participate
fully in the design process;
-    integrated area development projects which demand a high
level of managerial skill and are relatively costly in use
of financial resources, are unlikely to be cost-effective in
Ghana's present economic conditions with agricultural



- xV! -
support services widely rundown and civil salaries
insufficient to attract high calibre managers;
until Government salaries are raised it will difficult to
attract suitably qualified management staff or motivate
field staff to contribute more than a small part of their
working day to project work;
development projects should not be implemented in the
absence of an effective dialogue on agricultural policy and
pricing.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GHANA
UPPER REGION AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1291-T-GH)
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      The Upper Region Agricultural revelopment Project (URADEP), which
was the first broad based agricultural development project financed by the
World Bank (IBRD) in Ghana, was designed to increase farm production and
family incomes and to establish permanent farmer support services in the
region. In addition to the World Bank, the United Kingdom Government
provided financial support and technical assistance, while the Netherlands
Government provided independent financing for a training institute which
trained project staff.
1.02      Average farm size in the Upper Region is estimated at 2.4
hectares and is mainly planted to food crops of which millet and sorghum
are the most imp6rtant. Principal cash crops are groundnuts, rice and to a
lesser extent cotton. Cowpeas is an important legume for consumption and
sale. The Region carries about 60% of Ghana's cattle population.
1.03      The project was prepared against a hackground of poor performance
in the agricultural sector. Emphasis in the 1960s in Ghana was given to
large capital state farms which resulted in high costs and registered
little or no impact on the majority of the population. Lack of an
effective program to increase smallholder productivity and the weak
agricultural support services accounted for the country's reliance on food
imports even for commodities which it had the potential to produce. URADEP
represented a major attempt to switch attention to the small farmer sector.
1.04      The project was implemented during a period of serious economic
decline and political instability in Ghana. In the five years between 1977
and 1982 there were five changes of government. Following the change in
Defense Committees were created nationwide and played a role in management
and resource allocation in all productive enterprises including URADEP. In
January 1984 the Upper Region was, for administrative purposes, split into
two regions - Upper East 1/ and Upper West  2/.  Political instability was
reflected in a continuous deterioration of the economy. In the period
1970-82, GDP declined at 0.5% per annum, real per capita income fell by 30%
and there was a marked deterioration in physical infrastructure.
1.05      This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by URADEP's
Project Monitoring and Evaluation Department (PMED) with the assistance of
a consultant. The PCR is based on the draft prepared PMED and the work of
the consultant who reviewed data available at the World Bank, URADEP
offices and obtained the views of certain officials and farmers involved in
1/   Bolgatanga, Bawku, Navrongo and Sandema districts.
2/  Wa, Lawra and Tumu districts.

the Project. Preparation of the PCR has been constrained by lack of
substantial statlstics and records of quantitative accomplishments.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
A.   Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      The project was identified by a World Bank mission in late 1974
and the preparation report was prepared by the Bank's Resident Mission in
West Africa (RMWA) and Ghanaian staff in early 1975. At the request of the
Government of Ghana, a pre-appraisal mission from the World Bank and the
Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM), UK Government, visited Ghana in
June 1975. The project was appraised in November 1975 by a joint World
Bank/ODM mission.
2.02      The Government of Ghana raised a number of issues at appraisal,
including: (a) concern over the number of expatriate staff proposed (total
of 22); (b) need to give maximum support to irrigation, small dams, etc. as
providing more reliable water sources was a major concern in the region;
(c) large size of project which might absorb too many of scarce qualified
staff; (d) on-iending rates for credit to small farmers which. were seen as
too severe; and (e) provision for post project maintenance. It was agreed
that: (i) the project should increase the provision for improving water
supplies; and (ii) expatriates would only be employed where suitably
qualified Ghanaians were not available. The issue of heavy subsidization
of fertilizer (85%) was raised by the World Bank and Government agreed in
principle that the subsidy should be reduced. No explicit or dated
commitment was given, but Government agreed to submit a paper before June
30, 1977 on agricultural pricing policy, particularly focusing on the
reduction and eventual removal of fertilizer subsidy.
2.03      At appraisal project costs were US$54.6 million, IBRD providing
US$21.0 million (38%), UK US$11.0 million (20%), Government US$13.7 million
(25%) and local financial Institutions and Farmers US$8.9 million (17%).
The IBRD financial assistance was provided as a third window loan while the
UK provided US$8.8 equivalent as a loan for UK manufactured goods and
US$2.2 million equivalent for technical assistance. In parallel the
Government of the Netherlands partially financed a training institute.
B.   Project Description
2.04      Objectives:  The project had two principal objectives: first, to
increase agricultural production and thus farm incomes, and, second, to
establish permanent farmer support services. The project would redefine
the role of agricultural services, intensify extension for crop and animal
production and human nutrition, develop associated physical infrastructure,
including an intensive effort to halt the rapid rate of soil erosion; and



- 3 -
develop specialized institutions to service the commercial and financial
requirements of the Region's farmers (125,000 farm families)
2.05      Components:
(a) Farm Development. The project was to:
-    establish 90 service centers, to provide improved extension
services to small farmers (1300 per center) and management
advice to a relatively few larger farmers,
-    provide farm inputs (including insecticides, seed dressing,
improved seeds, fertilizers, spare parts and farm
equipment);
-    provide improved on-farm grain storage;
-    provide better animal health services and improve animal
husbandry, and establish ten small (2,000 hectares)
ranches for local livestock owners;
-    develop seven applied research and demonstration units
together with an associated seed multiplication program;
-    establish a pilot functional literacy scheme;
-    expand Ghana Broadcasting Corporations's facilities for
rural broadcasting;
-    improve human nutrition and health througb agricultural
extension services, the functional literacy program
and radio; and
-    provide in-service training for Project staff at the
existing Navrongo Agricultural Institute,
(b)   Physical Infrastructure:
-    construct about 120 new small dams and rehabilitate about
100 existing dams, to develop dry season gardening, fruit
tree nurseries, and fish ponds, provide water for cattle,
and improve water conservation;
-    develop soil conservation measures to protect some 160,000
hectares of farm land;
-    construct 700 village wells;
-    construct stores and offices at farm services centers,
district and regional Project offices, and houses for
project staff;



- 4 -
-    provide vehicles and other equipment; and
-    construct two cotton ginneries.
(c) Institutional Support
-    establish the Upper Region Agricultural Development Project
Management Unit (URPMU) to implement the Project;
-    establish the Farmers' Services Company (UR) Ltd.
-    strengthen (i) the regional branch of the Agricultural
Development Bank (ADB) and (il) the Upper Regional
Development Corporation (URDECO), particularly the latter's
transport and wholesale divisions.
(d) Development Planning
-    establish an Onchocerciasis Area Survey and Planning Unit.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
A. Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01      The project was approved by the Board of the World Bank on June
22, 1976.  The Loan Agreement was signed on June 28, 1976.  There were six
conditions of loan effectiveness, namely that: (a) Ghana Government (COG)
had set up an account for URPMU with a Commercial Bank in Bolgatanga and
had funded the account wit", an initial 03.0 million; (b) GOG would also
arrange to establish suitable overdraft facilities for URPMU guaranteed by
GoveLnment to an amount, reflected by the approved URPMU budget, of up to
03 million; (c) the Project Coordinating and Project Technical committees
had been established; (d) Farmers Service Company (FASCOM) had been
established with regulations acceptable to the Bank and a Managing Director
appointed; (e) the Project Manager and Chief of Field Operations (CFO) had
been appointed; and (f) Government had reached agreement with the UK
Government on the terms and conditions of the UK loan.
3.02      Retroactive financing for up to US$750,000 available from Xay 1,
1976, was made available for the employment of key staff, purchase of
related support vehicles and construc'ion of housing and office
accommodation at Bolgatanga. The Ghanaian project manager was appointed in
July 1976, but effectiveness was delayed by delays in appointment of the
internationally recruited CFO and Managing Director, FASCOM, plus the time
taken to set up FASCOM. The condition of appointment of the CFO was lifted
by the Bank; an acting CFO was appointed in December 1976, but was
confirmed only in the second half of 1977. The rest of the conditions were
met and the project was declared effective on April 11, 1977.
3.03      In spite of a declaration to the contrary from the Commissioner
for Agriculture at the time of loan effectiveness, an overdraft facility
for not less than 03 million (3.01 (b)) was never made available to the
Project. Also the paper setting out Government's proposed agricultural and
subsidy policies which Government proposed to submit by June 30, 1977 (para
2.02) was never submitted. The fertilizer subsidy was, however, eventually
removed in 1984.
B.   Changes in Project Design
3.04      The economic environment for the project during the first phase
provided insurmountable problems of which the following were noteworthy:
(a) the severe limitations caused by the near breakdown in communications
either by road,telephone, mail or aJ!.; (b) below subsistence salary levels
of middle and lower scales in the public sector (c) Government controls
restricting local markets; (d) the virtual unavailability of spare parts,
outside the public sector except in the unofficial, CFA-franc dominated
market at over six times the official rate of exchange; (e) the
unreliability of electricity and water supplies which particularly affected
the processing of agricultural products; and (f) the severe budgetary
constraints within the public sector.



- 7 -
3.05      Given these factors and that during its life the project operated
under four different Governments (3 military and one civilian) and faced
problems with each change-over, it became apparent in 1980 that the Project
was too large, complex and was generally over-ambitious for a first stage
project. It attempted to execute too many diverse activities (22
components) too quickly rather than develop methodically and slowly.
Furthermore, some of the individual components of URADEP had been poorly
designed, and paid little attention to local realities, e.g., (i) the
cattle ranching proposals were based on an earlier IBRD project in East
Africa; (ii) the dam constrh -ion and rehabilitation program targets were
far too high reflecting the %.esire to achieve a predetermined economic rate
of return on investment rather than what was physically feasible given
local conditions and available resources.
3.06      Following the suggestions of a joint World Bank/ODA supervision
mission in October 1980 and guidelines prepared by World Bank mission in
April-May 1981, Project Management prepared proposals for a revised 2-year
development program 3/. The report was submitted in July 1981 and fol-
lowing discussions in Washington and later with a World Bank ODA supervi-
sion mission in November 1981, it was agreed the project should:
(a)  continue the rainfed crop extension program while improving the
mobility of staff, maintaining a training program and
implementing a T&V system;
(b)  implement a modest dam building and rehabilitation program using
existing equipment. The target was to build four new dams and
rehabilitate fifteen dams and nine dugouts in 1981/82, rising in
1982/83 to the building of eight new dams and rehabilitation of
twenty dams and nine dugouts;
(c)  maintain veterinary services with support for improved staff
mobility and supply of drugs and vaccines;
(d)  complete the Farm Service Center (FSC) construction program of
the remaining 48 construction bases still to be completed, 57
prefabricated stores to be erected and associated low cost
housing for field staff;
(e)  complete construction of the Ghana Broadcasting Studio and
installation of transmitters;
(f)  complete the Tumu Ginnery;
(g)  set up an improved Monitoring and Evaluation Unit;

staff of URADEP, July 1981.



-8-
(h) concentrate the Agricultural Research Program on three sites;
East, Central and the West and to improve coordination within the
Region;
3.07      At the request of the Government, the project closing date was
postponed twice. In December 1982, it was postponed by 12 months to
complete the revised 2 year program launched in 1981 (para 3.06). A second
postponement was agreed to in December 1983 - to September 30, 1984 - in
order to complete the restructuring of FASCOM, implement a National
Emergency Rinderpest Vaccination Campaign (for which the project agreement
had been amended) and finance additional farm inputs.
C.   Physical Implementation
1.   Farm Development
3.08      Field Organization:  To implement the farm development program
around the Farm Service Centers, URADEP created a Field Operations
Department comprising the units previously under General Agriculture (Crop
Extension, Home Extension and Plant Protection) the Department of Animal
Husbandry and Fisheries, the Department responsible for small dams and
irrigation plus four new specialized divisions - Horticulture, Farm
Management, Agronomic Research and Plant Breeding. The Department was
headed by the Chief of Field Operations whose main function was to
coordinate work programs and to represent the Department at the regional
level. Activities of district divisional heads were coordinated by a
District Development Officer (DD), while at the community level (Farmers
Service Center), extension work was carried out by a Development Officer
(DO) and three Development Assistants (DA). The DA was responsible for a
zone with 3 zones per Farmers Service Center (FSC).
3.09      The arrangement of the Field Operations Department worked as well
as could be expected under the prevailing conditions. Problems of
management at all levels were experienced but in the districts the problems
were more acute as the resources were limited. There were constant
disputes over the use of the one vehicle and the small quantities of
petrol, oil, etc. received. Withi- the context of general economy
decisions as to who had the use of the vehicle and who got a gallon of
petrol became major areas of concern. The DDO, as the District Coordina-
tor, usually commandeered the use of the vehicle (a landrover of high
petrol consumption) and the "major share" of fuel.  Staff resentment
affected his technical role as a coordinator. The resentment arose over
resource allocation and his authorization of travel claims. In the initial
years, this led to severe morale difficulties and staff allegiances were
often misplaced. After the initial excitement of receiving a motorcycle or
bicycle, staff motivation to work, dropped off noticeably. In 1978/79 and
1979/80, there were serious disruptions in field activities as Project
Management imposed control over salary payments and supervision of the
Civil Servants (seconded 3taff).



3.10      Extension Services  The Project introduced radical changes in the
organization and management of the extension service, including the intro-
duction of a unit within General Extension to deal specifically with animal
traction. Extension services were organized around the ninety-seven FSCs.
A modified version of the training and visit system (T&V) wars introduced
and staff training in T&V was initiated at IFCAT early in 1979/80. Under
this system, between 5 and 15 farmers would form a contact group and work
on a demonstration plot of between j to 2 acres. Each Development
Assistant (DA) was responsible for conveying the technological package of
improved seed, fertilizer and guidance on how to cultivate the crops to 16
such groups. A Development Officer (DO) supervises 4 DAs, or between 90
and 240 contact groups with a total of over 450 farmers. Unfortunately,
political changes together with a shortage of fuel resulted in setbacks to
the implementation of the T&V system. Although DAs were able to reach
farmers by bicycle, the DOs and DDOs were unable to supervise their staff
effectively. Groups were formed but left unsupervised,while the
uncertainty of getting inputs inhibited DOs from setting up other groups.
In all, a total of 1495 such groups were formed as against 4,656 planned
(32% achieved). Some 1872 contact farmer groups cultivated improved maize
(Composite IV) and 623 groups cultivated sorghum (Naga White). These
groups were initially supported by a small-scale loan scheme, with each
group getting about 50 worth of improved seeds and fertilizers, but this
scheme was discontinued in 1980.
3.11      Poor extension service was aggravated in the last three years of
the project by a serious decline in the real value of salaries.
Extensionists also found it difficult to establish credibility with the
farming communities as they tried to define their new role. Before the
Project, extensionists supplied fertilizer and other inputs, but under the
project farm input sales were in the hands of FASCOM who often ignored the
recommendations of extension staff. The extension strategy of introducing
new maize and sorghum varieties to be grown on a group farm in pure stands
was alien to most small farmers. The target of the DA visiting two groups
a day for a total of sixteen groups per fortnight was also taxing under the
conditions prevailing. This led to the reorganization of the extension
groups during the 1981/82 cropping season. By the end of 1982, groups
covering all the 97 FCS were formed at a ratio of nine groups per DA
instead of the previous sixteen, a total of 2,619 groups. One problem with
the T&V system was that the role of the Subject Matter Specialists (SMS)
was not fully appreciated as these specialists wanted to maintain contact
with the farmers and showed reluctance to work through the DA. Many SMS
viewed participation in the T&V system as a further erosion of the old
departmental arrangement. Very often spurious arguments of a technical
nature were used to exclude general extensionist from participating in an
area where the SMS sought to gain a clear advantage with the farmer.
3.12      The livestock development component was to be the first phase of
a long-range program to increase livestock production in the Upper Region
through animal health measures, strengthening the animal husbandry service
and the development of private ranches. Improvement in production coeffi-
cient was partly to come from the improved veterinary service and partly



- 10 -
from increased supplies of crop by-product and better water supplies due to
the project.
3.13      Animal Hpalth Services.  The project aimed to strengthen the
Upper Region's Veterinary Services Department to enable it to carry out
vaccinations for the control of epidemic and endemic diseases, control of
internal and external parasites through deworming and dipping; control of
imported livestock through quarantines; and meat inspection in urban
centers. The department was apparently well organized and was supplied
with drugs and vaccines and the necessary equipment for effective work.
Cattle immunization and sheep/goats drenching programs were implemented in
line with expectations. Offtake rate from the cattle population is claimed
to have increased by about 2% (12.5-12.7), in line with appraisal, while
herd growth is considered to have recorded an average annual increase of
about 3.8% compared to 1-2% at appraisal. A pilot scheme for the
immunization of small scale village poultry flocks against Newcastle
disease and Fowl Pox was introduced in 1983. This scheme was initiated at
the Frafra veterinary district and registered 85% success. Results were
impressive, although it was constrained by the lack of mobility which
prevented the participation of the district extension staff. The
Veterinary Department was declared a priority division in the allocation of
replacement vehicles and their requirements have been met which has
improved greatly the mobility of the vaccination team and total coverage.
Payment by livestock owners for drugs and some vaccines was initiated
during 1979/80 and a revolving fund was established in 1984 to ensure
continuity ofl this activity.
3.14      In 1983, at the request of the Government, USS 350,000 from the
loan was allocated for supporting a National Emergency Rinderpest Vaccina-
tion Campaign. The request followed a suggestion from the World Bank to
the Government that in view of the outbreaks of rinderpest in neighboring
countries, funds could be reallocated from existing projects to step up the
vaccination program. The project funded vaccines, vehicles and equipment
and the level of vaccination was stepped up. The emergency program was
expected to be followed up by a regional program under preparation by
EEC/FAO.
3.15      Animal Husbandry.  In the Upper Region, animal hustandry services
before the project were restricted to administrative tasks and to operating
the five animal husbandry centers at Doba (pigs and poultry), Babile and
Bazua (cattle) and Busa and Wa (sieep and goats). The wide investlgation
and extension service program of the division is described in the appraisal
reports as follows: development of improved pasture and fodder crops,
investigation of the feasibility of smallholder stall-feeding; develo?ment
of feed rations for work oxen based on local feeds; development of optimum
sheep and goat management systems at village level; distribution of
Improved breeding stock from Government stations to farmers; and demon-
stration and advice for all livestock producers.
3.16      Livestock and poultry extension services were strengthened under
the project by filling the Subject Matter Specialist positions, improved



- 11 -
livestock management was encouraged and there was some increase in the sale
of breeding stock (Annex 4).   There were inadequate water resources and
feeding materials during the initial life of the project and although the
water situation improved with the building of dams and dugouts and the
rehabilitation of old dams, the feeding problem remained acute because of
the high cost of animal-feed and insufficient funding for the division.
This problem was compounded during the dry season by the periodic burning
of vegetation by bush fires.
3.17      Tumu Ranching Scheme:  Initially ten ranches of 2,000 ha each
were planned as company ranches with 15 shareholders contributing about 20
animals each. The ranches were to produce cattle for sale either locally
or to the meat processing plant in Bolgatanga. The ranching component was
abandoned because: (a) investment cost of a typical 2,000 ha ranch in
dollar terms amounted to some US$150,000 in 1980 (not counting cattle
purchases or contingencies) compared with US$38,000 estimated at appraisal;
(b) the questionable ability or willingness of local farmers to invest more
than US$2,000 each (of 20%) plus cattle in the scheme; and (c) ADB
participation was not forthcoming. Moreover, URADEP staff met with
considerable resistance from the local people who showed little enthusiasm
for the ranching scheme, regardless of the cost.
3.18           URADEP decided in late 1980 to develop a pilot commercial
cattle ranch of 2,000 hectares in Tumu district with the objective of
developing a ranch technique applicable to the Upper Region, to train
animal husbandry staff in ranching and to test and demonstrate the
feasibility of ranching to cattle owners in the Region. However, by the
end of the project period there had been only the construction of a 7-km
fence line with a firebreak, construction of a dugout at the proposed ranch
site and 4 km of access road. Another scheme attempted by URADEP was the
establishment of three commercial grazing paddocks in areas earmarked by
the Animal Husbandry Division, since the eight paddocks proposed at
appraisal were found not to be acceptable. Farmer groups were to be formed
and encouraged to bring breeding animals into the paddocks and to be
trained in modern methods of livestock production. There were to be three
years of animal husbandry control of the paddocks during which grazing fees
were to be collected for each animal to be paid annually by the owner of
the stock to help cover development aad running costs incurred by URADEP in
the formation of the project.Only one paddock was actually established at
Kologo-Haga and this has not been operating commercially as envisaged due
to lack of village/community participation, and the logistical problems
which affected URADEP.
3.19      It was not easy to demonstrate benefits from the Animal Husbandry
Component and the World Bank did not select it as a priority for continua-
tion during the 1980/81 project review. The expatriate ranch specialist
was repatriated in 1981.
3.20      Seed Multiplication and Research.  The project aimed at supplying
improved sokghum (Naga White), maize (Composite IV), rice and groundnut
seeds to farmers. It took over the Seed Multiplication Unit (MOA) which



12 -
was also in charge of certifying all seeds and planting materials being
introduced into the Region for the purposes of research/or multiplication.
In 1977, delays occurred in establishing maize and groundnuts areas at the
Vea irrigation site due to lack of machinery. However, the unit managed to
clean, dress and sell to farmers about 1,050 tons of improved rice, maize
and groundnut seeds. Subsequently, at the end of 1979 the production and
packaging of seed became the responsibility of Ghana Seed Company, while
URADEP's research section maintained small areas of breeders and foundation
seeds at the Tono and Vea Irrigation Schemes, and at Babile. Although it
was recognized that timely supply of improved seed was important in
increasing crop production, URADEP did not have direct authority over the
new Ghana Seed Company in seeds supply. Sales of improved rice and maize
seeds exceeded appraisal estimates during the first four years but were
lower in the following two years. The supply of sorghum seed was poor
throughout the 6 year period. Cotton seed production fell steadily and was
negligible in 1982 due to poor collection and delays in payment by the
Cotton Development Board as well as low prices.
3.21      Research.  Research under the project was carried out by Agronomy
and Plant Breeding Units with farm management providing a link with exten-
sion. The project aimed at establishing seven (7) research stations, one
in each district in the Region. These stations were established in 1978
but were able to carry out only limited trials because of land and staff
limitations. There were no significant responses in any of the trials and
in 1981, it was realized that research was not meaningful and this led to
the reorientation towards investigating recommendations for multiple crop-
ping system and varieties which fit into it. However, no concrete recom-
mendations have been passed on to the farmers for adoption since 1981.
3.22      In early 1983, at the suggestion of the Bank/IDA supervision
mission, the Agronomy, Plant Breeding and Farm Management Units were merged
to form the Farming Systems Research Unit. The objective of the merged
units was to establish a permanent and stable system of rainfed agriculture
in an increasing intensive state by decreasing risks and adopting manage-
ment practices that should sustain fertility. There have apparently been
no major accomplishments as at end of the project period but it is believed
that given the leadership of the present head of the Unit, the objectives
will be achieved in time. Steps have been taken to conduct research work
in conjunction with the University of Legon.
3.23      Radio Broadcasting Station.  The project included establishing an
FM network and distribution of transistor radios to motivate active
participation by farmers in the project and to disseminate agricultural
development information. The main station at Bolgatanga and substation at
Han had not been commissioned at the time of preparing the PCR. Delays
could be attributed to changes in the design of the building, and problems
over the choice of whether to use AM or FM bands only or a combination
thereof, the stoppage of construction work when in 1982/83 the Government
failed to pay the contractor and the departure of the radio engineering
consultant in 1983. The design of the Bolgatanga station was much more
elaborate than at appraisal reflecting the wish of the Ghana Broadcasting



- 13 -
Corporation to make it a regional station. Costs bore no relation to
appraisal estimates and the Bank agreed to pay no more than $200,000. The
Overseas Development Administration, which funded the  equipment and the
consultant, agreed in 1984 to assign a new radio engineering consultant and
to send radio engineers to complete installation and make the station
operational.
3.24      Institute for Field Communication and Agricultural Training
(IFCAT). The project at appraisal envisaged the creation of a unit in
URADEP to handle communication and training of its staff basing the activi-
ties at the former Navrongo Communications and Training Institute.  In
January 1977, the International Agricultural Center (IAC) in Wageningen,
and the Netherlands Government agreed to establish a training course in
extension in Ghana in cooperation with the Institute which was renamed the
Institute for Field Communication and Agricultural Training (IFCAT). The
Netherlands Government agreed to train the newly recruited training staff
at IFCAT and support the Institute with a team of communication experts and
funds for equipment and provided scholarships for the Ghanaian staff. The
project entitled Training in Rural Extension for National Development
(TREND) became operational in December 1977 and was completed in 1983.
3.25      An ex-post evaluation mission  4/ concluded that:  (a)  IFCAT
with its capacity in 1984 could cater for training needs of government and
non-government personnel for extension communication in Upper and Northern
Ghana; (b) TREND/IFCAT had an impact on URADEP's performance but only a
very limited impact on the level of living of farmers in the Upper Region;
(c) IFCAT had a chance to continue, provided inter alia, it is given a
clear status and is properly funded and managed.
2. Physical Infrastructure
3.26      Small Scale Irrigation and Dam Construction  The project envis-
aged the construction of 120 new small dams, rehabilitation of 100 existing
dams together with associated works for dry season gardening, fruit trees
and fish ponds, cattle watering and soil conservation. The component was
well received by the population, but the project was unable to satisfy
demand for assistance. Plant and equipment procured with the UK loan did
not arrive until 1979, and work started in 1980/81. Work was severely
constrained by lack of spare parts, the recurring fuel shortage and by a
lack of compaction equipment, which was apparently net considered necessary
at appraisal. Project accomplishments as of October 1984 included
completion of three new dams and 18 dugouts rehabilitation of 34 dams and
three new dams under construction. Following the death of the expatriate
land development officer, the component was short of technical supervision.
Staff from the Irrigiation Development Authority assisted. ODA offered

Navronga, Ghana; Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam, July 1984



- 14 -
further help from an engineer and irrigation specialist in 1982 but were
unable to locate suitable staff. In October 1984, ODA agreed to continue
support for the component with technical assistance and spare parts. An
engineer and irrigation specialist arrived in January 1985. Farmers who
assisted with rehabilitation work received World Food Program (WFP) food
for work done.
3.27      The well program was not implemented as CIDA assisted a major
program in the region.
3.28      Building Construction Program. At appraisal funds were provided
for: (a) offices for URADEP and FASCOM at Bolgatanga, and for seven
administrative centers; (b) 90 FSCs with offices and 7 district stores; and
(c) housing at various locations. New offices were not constructed at
Bolgatanga, instead the existing Ministry of Agriculture building housed
URADEP while FASCOM rented offices. The construction program was delayed
by shortages of materials and poor performance by contractors.
Construction of houses was let to contractors while the FSCs, imported as
prefabricated buildings, were erected by force account on bases built by
village labor who provided sand and stone and who received WEP food for
work. Houses at FSCs were built in a modified traditional design using
local materials (adobe houses) but only one was occupied by completion of
the project. Of twenty houses constructed on contract at Bolgatanga, ten
had been occupied by the completion of the project.
3.29 Cotton Ginnery Two cotton ginneries each with a capacity of 9,000
tons per annum were planned at appraisal. Ultimately, only one was con-
structed at Tumu, capacity 10,000 tons/annum. The ginnery was com-
missioned in June 1983 and immediately mothballed due to lack of seed
cotton. Cotton production fell sharply during the project period due
primarily to the low price paid for seed cotton in relation to food crop
prices.
3. Institutional Support
3.30      The Farmers Service Company ('ASCOM) was set up in 1978 under
URADEP to provide physical inputs as well as the required commercial
atmosphere and opportunities necessary for farmers to adopt and maintain
improved agricultural production practices. The company is owned by four
shareholders; Government of Ghana,Ghana Commercial Bank, National Invest-
ment Bank and Bank of Ghana and had authorized share capital of 012,000,000
of which 09,000,000 was subscribed and the remaining 03,000,000 of author-
ized capital shares was held In reserve for eventual use in creating equity
shares for the farmers in the Region.
3.31      FASCOM was specifically charged with the responsibility of: (a)
establishing contact with farmers of all categories through the setting up
of Farmers Service Centers throughout the Upper Region as a chain of retail
outlets; (b) providing the appropriate agricultural services including
agricultural machinery hire services to the individual farming areas; (c)
procuring, distributing and selling fertilizer and other recommended farm



- 15 -
inputs to farmers in the Region; (d) providing adequate facilities for
storing and marketing farm produce; and (e) ensuring farmers' adequate
purchasing power by operating a deferred payment scheme.
3.32      The Company was allocated approximately US$10,500,000 of URADEP
funds for use in obtaining farm inputs, vehicles, equipment, supplies and
construction of storage facilities at the Farmers Services Centres and
staff housing.  By the end of September 30, 1978, approximately
US$2,000,000 had been spent. The Company's assets were liquid, with
reserves in excess of 1,000,000 in 1978. FASCOM's operations for year
1978 resulted in a net earnings of 0114,613 which was approximately 4% of
gross revenue. The Company maintained fairly good trading results for the
subsequent two years of its operations due largely to the availabiity of
foreign exchange zo purchase inputs from abroad, the relative shortage of
imports from other sources as well as the ability of the expatriate
Managing Director.
3.33      When the contract of the expatriate Managing Director expired
there was a succession crisis which when finally resolved left the Company
divided.  The Company then plunged into very serious management problems at
the end of 1981 due to worker militancy as a result of the 31st December
revolution, the unorthodox management style of the first management, the
lack of documented procedures and policies, and the new management
exceeding financial authority limits. The entire senior management was
ousted in early 1982, and thereafter the Company was nominally run by an
Interim Management Committee consisting of part-timers from other
organizations while real power rested with the Workers Defence Committee.
The Tforld Bank decided that unless suitable management was fond for the
Company no more funds would be released. Following the recruitment of a
suitable local Managing Director in April 1984 and other Management staff
later in the yaar the IBRD allowed the use of part of the loan funds for
the replacement of the Company's vehicle fleet and the purchase of other
inputs.
3.34      Management Consultants were also engaged to recommend the
reorganization of the Company and prepare procedural manuals for its
running. Messrs. Coopers and Lybrand Associates, the Management
Consultants, concluded that FASCOM is best placed to service farmers needs
as there is no reason to suppose that any other organization could
undertake this role any more efficiently. The Company now has the
managerial capability and the potential to deliver essential services
efficiently to the farmers of the Upper Regions provided the improved
systems are implemented and Government supports the Company.
3.35      Technical assistance was provided to ADB but the credit program
was wound up in 1980. The development planning component was never
implemented as other donors took this on.

3.36      It is difficult to make any meaningful analysis of the apparent
cost overruns shown in table 2 due to the extraordinary inflation and
resulting economic dislocation experienced in Ghana during the period
1977-1984. It should be noted that the cedi was held stable, at a rate of
approx. 2.75 to US$1.00 during the period 1977-1982, and was excessively
overvalued in US dollar terms. Accordingly, using the conventional
accounting treatment of converting cedis Into US dollars at the official
exchange rate results in apparent cost overruns in US dollars. In 1983,
however, the Government of Ghana devalued the cedi against the US dollar to
cedis 30 to US$1.00 (in excess of 1000%) and devalued again in 1984 to
cedis 35 to US$1 (an accumulated devaluation in excess of 1200%). Further
devaluations of the cedi have since taken place. It is not unreasonable to
assume that if the cedi had been devalued gradually during the period
1977-1982 to the cedi 35/US$1 level, costs incurred during this period
would have been substantially lower when expressed in US dollars possibly
resulting in cost underruns.
3.37      IBRD and UK Government funding, although disbursed more slowly
than planned, reached 92% and 86% respectively of SAR estimates at December
31,1984. Since that time further disbursements have been made from the
IBRD loan bringing the estimated disbursements to approximately 96.6% of
SAR. Approximately US$701,000 remained undisbursed from the IBRD Loan of
US$21.0 mn. At loan closing on March 31,1985, this undisbursed balance of
the loan was cancelled.
E.   Disbursements
3.38      The IBRD loan was projected to be disbursed in five (5) years,
but actual disbursement took place over approximately eight (8) years.
Annual disbursements (Annex 7) were only about US$667,740 as against the
appraisal estimate of US$1,050,000 or a variance of US$382,260. The
original schedule was too optimistic and did not anticipate the problems
that could arise in the project, it being the first broad based
agricultural development project in Ghana.

3.39      A reallocation of loan funds were made upon request of the
Government of Ghana. The original and revised allocation of loan and
percentage of expenditures to be financed follows:

F.   Procurement
3.40      Considering the dual external funding (IBRD and UK) arrangement,
the project was saddled with somewhat more complicated than usual procure-
ment procedures. The problem was made more difficult due to inflation in
Ghana, the very tight foreign exchange situation of the Government and the
relative isolation of the Upper Region which made direct and fast
communication extremely difficult.
3.41      There were no major problems of procurement for items financed
under the IBRD loan. Civil works within the project area were carried out
through local contractors who were awarded contracts through acceptable
local tendering procedures. The program had, however, procured
prefabricated steel structures for erection at the 97 farmers service
centers and these were procured through ICB. Also, during the initial



- 19 -
stages of the project, considerable quantities of cement and essential
construction materials were procured through ICB procedures. When such
materials were issued to local contractors, appropriate adjustments were
made in the contract amount for their values. During the life of the
project, a number of ICB's were carried out. This gave the project the
facility of choosing the source of supply from an international market
providing access to a wider range as well as competitive post-sales
services. If also allowed, for the selection of suppliers based on
predetermined criteria, for evaluation of bids.
3.42      From 1978 to 1980 FASCOM was responsible for coordinating pro-
curement with the occasional assistance of the Amsterdam-based procurement
agents, Central Buyers BV. This agency provided a shopping service for the
imported items and also temporary financing of the purchases with subse-
quent reimbursement by World Bank. International Procurement Agency (IPA)
replaced Central Buyers as procurement Agents during the latter part of
1983. During the initial stages of the implementation of the program, it
became necessary to air freight a considerable amount of items to
Ouagadougou airport for subsequent delivery to Bolgatanga. Fertilizers
were procured by FASCOM through Ghana National Procurement Agency which
resulted fertilizer arriving late for distribution to farmers.
3.43      The involved procedures for the British Loan were cumbersome and
slow. The Ghana Supply Commission (GSC) in London and Accra served as
agent in the procurement of materials and equipment in UK utilizing the UK
loan. It was quite difficult to determine the status of orders and
delivery times. Generators, spare parts for Ford lorries and radio phones
took over eighteen months to arrive. Shipping documents arrived after
lengthy delays and therefore goods attracted port charges in the interim.
Application made to the Ministry of Transport and Communication for waiver
in the payment of charges took a long time to process. Application for
Special Unnumbered Licence (SUL) for all imported items also took a long
time to process in the Ministry of Trade. These obstacles, which revolved
around Government Ministries, Ghana Supply Commission, the British Crown
Agents and the absence of competent personnel staff in URADEP and FASCOM in
the early stages, caused several delays in procurement which delayed
project implementation.
3.44      Procurement of goods financed under the UK loan involved a large
number of intermediaries to ensure among other things that the goods
procured were of British origin. This made the procurement process lengthy
and cumbersome.  To remedy the situation, a joint IBRD/ODA mission in July
1978 reviewed the procedure and the initial flow chart was revised to
include amendments to improve the system as well as the relations between
URADEP and GSC, the two major participants to the system, resulting in a
better understanding of the procedure and requirements of all parties
concerned.
3.45      The Project Manager had envisaged the procurement of some of the
farm inputs from local sources but the virtual non-availability of



- 20 -
materials from within the country through most of the project period gave
the program no alternative but to procure from overseas.
IV. EVALUATION OF PROJECT IMPACT
A. Crop Production
4.01      The Project was intended to increase crop production from the
major cereals--mixed millet and sorghum, dwarf sorghum, maize, rice and
groundnuts, yam, cowpeas and tomatoes. Increases were to be brought
through incremental supplies of fertilizer, insecticides and animal trac-
tion equipment. Improved seed through the introduction of new varieties of
maize, dwarf sorghum and groundnuts were also important components in
package of practices.
4.02      Insecticide for seed dressing and stored grain has been adequate
throughout the Project period but it was not until year 4 that the use of
seed dressing gained wide acceptance. Fertilizer was generally available
in the first three years but unspecified quantities (estimated at between
15-20%) did not reach the intended beneficiaries. There was a much reduced
quantity available in year 4, a negligible quantity in year 5 and although
the situation improved markedly in year 6 the quantity was far from ade-
quate. In all years the fertilizer was sold through retail outlets late.
Supply of ox carts, ploughs and ridgers was inadequate. There was also a
general shortage of spare parts for maintaining equipment. FASCOM, Agri-
cultural Development Bank, URDECO and Non-Governmental Organizations
supplied an estimated 3,500 oxploughs/rldgers and 800 ox/donkey carts. The
makes of ridgers sold by FSC, ADB and URLDECO were new to the farmers and
there was strong resistance in the first three years to the purchase
thereof.
4.03      The Extension Staff were active in promoting the improved maize
variety (Composite IV) and the dwarf sorghum (Naga White) in years 1 and 2.
The adoption of improved maize (now including La Posta, Composite IV and
TZW) is very good and the anticipated target has been met. Production has
concentrated in four localities and is primarily produced by commercial
oriented farmers. Dwarf sorghum has not been generally adopted although it
has been shown to yield better than the traditional varieties. This can be
explained by the fact that sorghum is a more traditional crop than maize
with emphasis on local consumption.  It would, therefore, be expected to be
grown as part of the mixed stand, Naga White produces less straw which is
softer than the traditional varieties and consequently not as suited for
fuel and the pito (sorghum beer) resulting from its different color and
flavor. Research efforts continue to be directed to finding suitable crop
combinations of Naga White with the traditional mixtures.
4.04      The "Chinese" variety of groundnut has gained wide acceptance as
it possesses a clear advantage In harvesting. Limited seed available
through official sales hindered spread in the early years of the Project



- 21 -
but by year 5 and 6 it had diffused through informal market channels.
Estimates show that groundnut production has increased over the life of the
Project.
4.05      Yam production has been static although there is evidence that
farmers, in some areas, have put labor saved through the introduction of
animal traction in land preparation into increasing the area under yams in
their farms. The returns from sustained good prices have also contributed
to maintaining yam production. The program of treating yam sets started in
year 5 has suffered through transportation problems at critical times and
the non-availability of chemicals at the FSC store level.
4.06      Cotton production has been very disappointing, has fallen
steadily and by year 6 was negligible. This situation is attributed to
poor collection of harvested cotton, long delays in payment and low prices.
Until this situation is rectified there is no hope of a recovery in produc-
tion.
4.07      Rice production has fallen in the major rice producing valleys.
This can be attributed to poor cultural practices that have led to a
serious weed problem, an inability to maintain adequate mechanical
services, no attempt to create physical structures to improve water
retention and reduction in available fertilizer. In the last three years
of the Project there has been a noticeable increase in small scale
production of rice in depressions and this could have resulted from a
diffusion of the efforts of the small scale irrigation extensionists and
continuing good prices.
4.08      Cowpea production has been variable, depending on rainfall and
attack by aphids. The latter were severe in the West of the Region in year
4. Campaigns to combat insect attack through seed dressing and spraying
have been hampered by transportation problems, the lack of spraying
equipment and in many cases the distance of water supplies. New varieties
of cowpea were introduced in the last three years of the Project on a trial
basis and indications are that sustained yields can only be assured with
reasonable insect control.
4.09      Discounting production from the two large dams, Tono and Vea,
Tomato production has increased steadily from the small dams and from dry
season gardens. The development of new irrigable areas has been far below
target but interest in production has remained high and quantities in the
local markets have been adequate over the Project period. Because of
inadequate transportation, tomato production, except from a few small dams
in Navrongo, has not been leaving the Region and expansion of irrigated
crops has been focused on onions. An increasing quantity of good quality
onions has been transported to markets outside the Region particularly from
small dams in Bawku and the Project can be credited with this achievement.
4.10      The introduction of a "low-input agriculture" package in 1982 to
emphasize the use of farm yard manure, compost, etc. in the absence of
fertilizer did not catch on well with the farmers. This was because (i) a
very small percentage of farmers possess large herds of cattle, sheep or



- 22 -
goats to produce adequate quantities of farm yard manure for gainful use;
(ii) most farmers had not learned to house their animals properly for the
production of farm yard manure; (iii) very few farmers could make their own
compost.
B. Farmers Organization
4.11      Extension service made great achievements in the area of farmers
organization aid participation. In the 1981/82 season, a start was made in
the organization of the FSC Committees and a year later, all the FSCs had
functional committees comprised of nine (9) members, selected by the
farmers themselves; three representatives from each zone in the FSC. The
foremost responsibility of the committees was to control and distribute
farm inputs sold from the FASCOM store. This was an onerous task as
quantities were always inadequate but it removed some of the allegations of
favoritism from FASCOM and extension staff
4.12      The FSC Committees were also responsible for organizing communal
labor for the construction of the bases on which the prefabricated FASCOM
stores were erected, except in Wa and Lawra where contractors were used.
They also organized the construction of 'adobe houses' for junior staff at
the selected FSCs. These efforts, although not always of the quality
desired, showed a significant potential of human resource that can be used
in the development process. A program was initiated in 1981 to purchase
grain at the FSCs for resale during the lean seasnn (April-July). This was
started on a pilot scale with 15 FSCs in Bolgatanga, Navrongo, Sandema and
Bawku districts and modalities were such that the Committees performed most
of the transaction. In 1982, an injection of 02.5 million from a Dutch
Government fund boosted this program to cover 17 FSCs. The number of FSCs
which participated in the program increased and general coverage extended
to the three Western districts. The program could have operated even more
successfully had the funds been available earlier.
V, INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A. Major Problems during Implementation
5.01      Problems beset the project in the early years of implementation
which culminated by the Government of Ghana setting up a Committee of
Inquiry into the Operations of the URADEP in June 1980. The committee,
under the chairmanship of Professor Bortei-Doku was asked to: (a) investi-
gate and ascertain the causes of industrial actions embarked upon by the
General Agriculture Workers Union of the URADEP; (b) examine the existing
administrative me.chinery of the URADEP and ascertain areas of sources of
conflict between the programme management and the "seconded" or "absorbed"
technical personnel of the Ministry of Agriculture under the URADEP; and
(c) investigate and ascertain the causes of the apparent conflict between
the Programme Manager and the former Acting Chief of Field Operations.



- 23 -
5.02      The committee, which reported in December 1980  5/, observed
that:
(a) the automatic inclusion of all the civil servants of the depart-
ments of the Ministry of Agriculture into the project, without
taking the necessary steps to integrate them fully into the
program had created a serious administrative problem, especially
in the areas of discipline and budgetary control. This became
the basic cause of controversy that resulted in the series of
industrial actions embarked upon by the staff of the Ministry of
Agriculture;
(b) there existed a large area of potential and actual conflict
between the Programme Manager and the former Acting Chief of
Field Operations; the specific causes of conflict were related to
budgetary control of Ministry of Agriculture financial allocation
in the Upper Region, personnel administration of the "seconded"
staff and loss of confidence;
(c)  the status of URADEP had been controversial since its inception;
if the project appraisal report had been critically examined by
MOA before acceptance of the project many of the problems could
have been avoided;
(d) the committees established to guide and facilitate the operations
of the URADEP never functioned effectively with the exception of
URADPEC which, even though it met regularly, could not solve some
of the basic problems that bedeviled the operations of URADEP;
and
(e) there had been instances of alleged embezzlement and other
financial improprieties on the part of some project staff. There
was lack of internal control in the Accounts Department as it was
understaffed and was without a substantive Chief Accountant
during the period 1979-1981.
5.03      Following the findings of the Committee, a new Programme Manager
with experience in the civil service was appointed in April 1981; also a
Chief Accountant, recruited with the assistance of the World Bank, took up
his post in December 1981. With these appointments, the morale of the
staff improved and a more constructive approach was taken to the project.
5.04      In March 1982, project implementation was affected by further
problems when, following a petition by FASCOM's Workers Defence Committee
to the Regional PNDC Secretary, senior officials of FASCOM, including the
5/   Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the operations of URADEP,
Bolgatanga, December 1980.

local Managing Director and Chief Accountant, were suspended on suspicion
of corruption. Government set up the Upper Region Investigation Committee
(URIC) to investigate the matter, and an interim management committee was
set up to run FASCOM. URIC reported 6/ in June 1982,but its
recommendations were unacceptable and so another Committee was set up to
review the URIC report itself. According to the report of the Review
Committee the following led to FASCOM's problems:
(a) There was a vaccum in middle level management which adversely
affected the flow of management info and caused suspicion among
junior workers who did not fully appreciate the Company's
objectives and Management's intentions;
(b) the poor performance of almost the enitre management staff
because of a number ofsquare pegs in round holse and the lack of
financial and other procedural policies and manuals;
(c) the composition and performance of the Board of Directors by
comprising of members representing abstract shareholders and not
following up on decisions made;
(d) sectional and self-interest disrespect of authority, indiscipline
and prevailing circumstances influended the works to act
impulsively.
B. Project Organization
5.05      It was recognized at appraisal that successful project implemen-
tation would require changes in the administrative arrangements for agri-
culture and rural development existing in the Region at that time. The
project actions would affect or involve many Government Ministries, depart-
ments and corporations. For the project to succeed, therefore, a high
degree of cooperation wou'ld be required. The greater part of the project
would consist of activities falling within the purview of the Mlinistry of
Agriculture. However, the much-needed cooperation among the agencies
responsible for carrying out the project was not realized. Furthermore,
the Committees established to guide and facilitate the operation of URADEP
did not function effectively during the early stage of the project. The
Director of Agriculture in Accra showed lukewarm attitude towards the
project.
5.06      Commercial banks had earlier been reluctant to invest in the
Farmers Service Company (UR) Ltd. because overseas banks (Barclays and
Standard) were not willing to reinvest surplus funds. Government had
indicated it would not permit payment of dividends. Another factor in the
reluctance of commercial banks to invest was the problems and
6/ Report of the Review Committee on FASCOM, Bolgatanga, August 1982.



- 25 -
uncertainties, e.g., transport, communication and agricultural production,
inherent in the Upper Region. The Bank of Ghana, because of its poor
relationship with the Ministry of Agriculture during the early years of
project implementation had been reluctant to participate or even lead the
discussions on the financing of FASCOM which was essentia:. to its
operations.
5.07      FASCOM as a limited liability company with profit motive and
private equity participation found itself in conflict with the general
posture of URADEP as a service organization. FASCOM, whose function was
regarded as commercial, did not take over the Mechanization and Transport
Department, on the ground that it was not economic to do so. The Loan
Agreement provided that the Programme Manager should be the Chairman of the
Board of FASCOM, but in fact the Regional Administrative Officer was
appointed Chairman of the Board. This did not result in a close working
relationship with URADEP as was originally intended.
5.08      There appears to have been an apparent lack of coordination
between the first Programme Manager, the various Ministries and URADPEC.
Likewise, there was a serious communication gap between management and
heads of departments which resulted in lack of cooperation. URADPEC failed
to resolve the problem that bedeviled URADEP as regards the Ministry of
Agriculture staff absorbed by or seconded to the project.
5.09      No substantial changes have been made to organization structure
as prepared at appraisal. It was believed that structure was effective and
well conceived and problems occurred only due to lack of
understanding/appreciation of the functions and responsibilities of the
various agencies/offices. While efforts had been exerted by those
concerned for an efficient project implementation, obtaining sufficient
experienced management was always a problem, thus falling short of what had
been expected at appraisal. Such performance could also be partly
attributed to the difficult prevailing economic and political conditions in
the country.
5.10      Long-range planning of manpower development was not given
priority in the recent past because of instability in the social and
economic conditions. Management was pre-occupied in solving immediate
problems besetting URADEP, e.g., funds for salaries and other needs of the
project, supply of fuel, lubricants and spare parts and the apparent lack
of enthusiasm and dedication of employees to work. Because of the economic
conditions employees spent much of their time farming to augment their
salaries which were insufficient to buy basic family food requirements.
5.11      Manpower strength increased over the project period.  There had
been a build-up of 500 or from 2,000 to 2,500 for the seconded staff.
There were 1,500 contract staff at the end of the project. Overstaffing
was a problem. The project virtually became an employment agency such that
while manpower strength was estimated at appraisal to reach only about
1,650, at 1984 actual numbers were about 4,000, more than double the
original estimate. URADPEC was not very effective at staff recruitment
I



- 26 -
because of the mass secondment of the Ministry of A, iculture staff to the
project. Additional senior Ghanaian personnel were hired on the basis of
their professional qualifications although it cannot always be said that
the best men were appointed. Although in the initial years, the project
offered competitive and attractive salaries and other emoluments, there
were difficulties in recruiting trained staff due primarily to
non-availability of staff houses in the project area.
C. Other Problems.
5.12      Sector policy reforms were not carried out.  The Government did
not submit the paper setting out proposed agricultural pricing and subsidy
policies as required under the Loan Agreement. The fertilizer subsidy was
eliminated only in the last year of project implementation.
5.13      There were some improvements in project accounts and budgetary
controls. Accounts were audited, and a budgetary control system brought
into operation. Such improvements were initiated following the report of
the investigating committee/committee on inquiry which identified flaws and
weaknesses in the system and recommended necessary measures relative
thereto. The implementation owed much to the persistent efforts of the
expatriate Chief Accountant recruited in 1981.
5.14      On the other hand, plant operations and maintenance deteriorated
due to recurrent lack or unavailability of fuel, lubricants, spare parts
and tires as well as lack of funds and/or delayed release of funds from the
Government. Likewise, project finances (local) were always a problem. The
primary cause was the deteriorating economic conditions and uncertain
political climate in the country.
5.15      The training program of the project was aimed at short-term,
non-academic, intensive courses in Ghana and overseas. Achievements in
staff training were modest.
5.16      The Administration and Personnel Department were not able  to
provide statistics on the officers and staff of the project who benefited
from its training program. Likewise, they were not able to establish the
average annual turn-over of employees. The only changes worth mentioning
are those involved in the industrial unrest In URADEP and graft and
corruption in FASCOM. On the whole, there were no major problems with
staff retention.
5.17      The consultants recognized the technical and managerial skills
available in URADEP in planning the work program.  They placed the project
on a proper footing.  However, no targets were set for transition from
expatriates to local management.  While the skills of Ghanaians were
recognized, local counterparts were not trained/or prepared to take over
eventually from expatriates. This often left a critical void in project
implementation when expatriate staff left.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Conclusions
6.01      Project Design  While most of the problems of the Upper Region
and priorities of the Government were properly identified and assessed, the
project failed to provide for the difficult geographic location of the
Upper Region as well as the deteriorating conditions of the roads and
communication facilities. These conditions could have been foreseen by the
RMWA and Ghanaian staff who prepared the project proposal which was the
basis of appraisal. Such failure was aggravated by the frequent changes of
the government, as noted the project operated and was implemented under
five different governments.
6.02      Based on results of implementation, the project content and
scheduling appear to be overly ambitious, e.g., it expected to construct
too many farmer service centers (90) within a short period of time (3
years). The construction schedule proposed was not realistic. Also dam
construction and rehabilitation targets were too high. The targets
reflected the desire to achieve a predetermined economic rate of return on
investment rather than what was physically feasible based on local
condition and available resources.
6.03      The original project design appears not to be well conceived and
failed to consider the customs of the farmers in the Region where raising
livestock is undertaken mainly for capital accumulation rather than as a
source of income.
6.04      Implementation Capacity. The managemett capacity of the executing
agency was found wanting especially during the initial years of the
project. This is evidenced by the industrial unrest and other management
problems of URADEP and FASCOM. There was a lack of technically capable and
experienced men to implement the project which resulted in heavy dependence
on the service of expatriates.
6.05          The schedule for implementation of administrative policy
measures was not realistic considering the project was the first of its
kind in Ghana and the Government did not have the necessary experience
staff to implement such a broad based project. The required paper setting
out proposed agricultural pricing and subsidy policies was not submitted by
the Government even at the end of the project period.
6.06      Provisions or specifications for carrying out the project were
adequate but implementation was hampered by lack of full appreciation of
the objectives and operational functions of URADEP as very few members of
the senior staff had access to the Appraisal Report which they assumed to
be a secret document.
6.07      World Bank and ODA Requirements  During the implementation of the
project periodic reviews, usually at 5-7 months intervals, were conducted
by IBRD and/or ODA. The project considered such reviews sufficient and



- 28 -
helpful as problems were identified and remedial measures recommended. On
the whole, members of review/supervision were experienced and familiar with
the project.
6.08      Reporting requirements were reasonable.  However, some reports,
e.g., audited financial statements, could not be submitted on time during
1979-1981 due to the lack of a substantive chief accountant, which delayed
the preparation and auditing of such reports.
6.09      Progress reports on the various activities of the project were
submitted to the supervision missions. These reports were helpful in
assessing project status and problems.
B. Lessons Learned
6.10      It is considered unwise to attempt to force adoption of new
technologies, e.g., establishment of ranches and constructing large number
of dams, which have not been adapted or proved effective given the
country's specific conditions, customs and tradition, experience and
capability. New technology often requires more skill and training than is
appreciated.
6.11      Closer cooperation and proper coordination among the various
Ministries, departments, divisions, units and other offices involved in the
implementation are vital for a project requiring concerted and dedicated
efforts like URADEP.
6.12      In merging of various units in an organization, it would be wise
to recruit somebody out of the units involved, preferably one already
higher in rank than any of the unit heads to avoid friction and for better
coordination and cooperation.
C. Recommendations
6.13      Expatriates should have local deputies or local counterparts who
should be trained to take over the job to ensure smooth implementation of
the project.
6.14      The Government and the executing agency should recog-
nize/appreciate the need for implementing an effective project monitoring
and supervision to effectively and accurately evaluate the project. This
would be helpful to the Government in the development of future projects.
6.15      The area of coverage, especially in a region like the Upper
Region, where the districts are far from one another and transport as well
as communication facilities are poor, should be limited to certain and
closely-located districts to have a better control of the project and thus
achieve greater impact.



- 29 -
6.16      As PASCOM has now been re-organized and placed under capable
aJnagement it should be enabled to become a viable institution of URADEP
through the following:
(a) all outstanding/uncompleted activities that URADEP should have
provided/completed for FASCOM by now should still be provided;
(b) the company should be restructured financially to increase
farmers equity and participation and reduce government's
involvement to the barest minimum level necessary;
(c) the Company should benefit from the National Import Programue so
that the needs and input requirements of the Upper Regions are
imported and handled directly by only FASCOM;
(d) the Company should be recognized as the major instruments for
rural and agricultural development and should be supported in
every conceivable way to let it continue to render valuable
services to the Upper Regions because of the difficult
circumstances and enormous constraints prevalent there.
6.17      With such a broad based project, the position for a Deputy
Program Manager should be provided to assume the duties and
responsibilities of the Program Manager when the latter is absent and/or on
official travel.
6.18      Any future proposals for an agricultural development project of
the dimension of URADEP must be fully scrutinized by the Ministry of
Agriculture and other relevant Ministries before any appraisal report is
produced.
6.19      Before the end of any similar project there should be a clear
policy from the Government regarding its future status as well as that of
the staff to ensure a sound continuation of the program.
6.20      On the whole and with the fast deterioration of the cedi in
relation to the U.S. dollar, the project, despite its shortfalls in achie-
ving the desired objectives could be considered a success in the agricul-
tural development of the Upper Region through the establishment of FASCOM,
URADEP, dam construction/rehabilitation and construction of farmer service
centers. It is considered the project improved the condition of the farm
families but the overall impact could be said to be not as promising as was
projected at appraisal because of flaws and problems in implementation and
the difficult social and economic conditions in Ghana during the period of
implementation. Nevertheless, it is believed that URADEP had provided
lesson which should be considered in planning further agricultural
development projects by the Government.

3.   REHABILITATION
Rehabilitation includes such activities as broken damwall
repairs, spillway repairs, excavation of earthen canals and connecting,
fixing of valves, fencing, desilting, etc. The Division has no desilting
machine, so no mechanical desilting of silted dams can be done. Very
little has been done in this respect except in situations where a bulldozer
can be used to increase the capacity of a reservoir by scouping off some of
the silt material when the reservoir is sufficiently dry. To this extent
one cannot say for sure that a particular dam has been desilted in the
Upper East and West Regions. There are instances where villages have been
organized to remove or reduce silt material from dams or dugouts but such
have not been separately recorded as dams or dugouts desilted.
