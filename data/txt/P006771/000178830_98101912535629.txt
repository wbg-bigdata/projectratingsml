1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Colombia½s main indigenous commercial energy resources are hydro-
power, coal, gas and oil. Potential hydropower appears to be the most
promising at some 93 GW of capacity and 400 TWh of annual energy capabil-
ity 1/. Colombia is also endowed with large coal and gas deposits. Since
1970 oil production has declined at an average annual rate of 6%. Over
the same period, consumption of petroleum products increased on average
5.4% annually until 1975 and declined to 3.5% since then. As a result,
Colombia has been a net importer of crude oil since 1976, with petroleum
having become the country-s largest single import. Prospects are for oil
imports to rise sharply in the early 1980s unless additional reserves are
discovered and developed rapidly. Measures are being taken to deal with
this problem and to develop alternative energy sources. In the case of coal,
there have been various obstacles to more adequate utilization of the existing
pot:ential: the competition of lower priced petroleum, fragmentation of
production among a large number of small mines with low output and productivity
levels, and lack of efficient transport infrastructure. However, the Govern-
ment has been taking action to address these problems (1.03).
1.02      Production of primary energy during 1970-80 (Annex 1.1) has not kept
pace with overall economic expansion. It decreased at 2.9%/a during 1970-75,
and then in the period 1976-80 it increased only at 0.6%/a, mainly due to
falling crude oil output. In contrast to the declining energy output, final
energy consumption grew at 3.6%/a during 1970-75, and at 6.1%/a during 1976-80
and has now stabilized at a growth of about 6.0%/a.
1.03      The Government's development strategy is aimed at achieving a more
favorable balance between domestic energy supply and use through increased
utilization of domestic sources which are in abundant supply, i.e., hydropower,
nat:ural gas and coal and by developing high-value energy resources for export
to reduce the growing energy trade deficit. Toward this end, the Government
is planning a large-scale development of high grade coal deposits for export
by state entities in association with foreign investors. For this purpose, a
new enterprise, Carbones de Colombia (CARBOCOL), has recently been created and
has emerged as the Goverrment's chief agency in coal-related matters.  The
Government attaches high priority to developing, primarily for export, the
coal deposits at El Cerrejon (measured reserves in excess of 1 billion tons)
1/   Source:  Electric Energy Sector Study (ESEE) prepared jointly by the
National Planning Department (NPD) and ISA with the full time assistance

near Riohacha in the Department of La Guajira on the Atlantic Coast, under
CARBOCOL's responsibility in cooperation with foreign investment. A portion
of the thermal deposits at El Cerrejon is earmarked for domestic consumption
in power plants and industry in place of natural gas and fuel oil. The
Government also intends to step up surveys of identified coal fields in the
departments of Santander and Antioquia and to study the feasibility of using
low grade coal for firing large thermal plants required in the early 1990s
when potential hydro sites are expected to be increasingly more costly to
develop (1.25). Small private firms which own coal mines are pursuing plans
to expand output and expand operations in order to supply fuel for heat-
intensive industrial processes and both in-plant and public power generation.
Tn order to expand potentially viable mines, a well-coordinated Government
program is needed to provide a rational price structure, improvements in mine
safety, credit facilities and support for marketing and infrastructure. Such
a program would need substantial technical and capital assistance from abroad.
The Bank has been providing guidance to the Government in the preparation of
the proposed El Cerrejon and the Railways Improvement Projects.
1.04      In the hydrocarbon sector, the Government has taken action to
stimulate investment in exploration and field development, which had declined
after 1971 because the prices paid to the producers for domestic sales were
below economic value. Currently, the prices paid for oil produced by increas-
ing yields from existing fields and from new fields have been raised, with the
latter now at world market levels, and the discriminatory exchange rate for
petroleum has been eliminated. Moreover, the Government is encouraging
foreign participation in exploration and development on the basis of joint
venture contracts with Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos (ECOPETROL) (the Govern-
ment oil agency). As a result, interest among foreign petroleumn companies to
expand or start operations in Colombia has been intensified and an upturn in
exploration has taken place. Domestic petroleum product prices have been
increased substantially in line with the Government-s objective of reaching
international levels over a reasonable period of time. A Bank petroleum
project is being considered for secondary oil recovery, surveys and follow-up
discoveries. With respect to natural gas, a previous decline in known reserves
and output has been reversed with the discovery of large deposits 1~ thS
Atlantic Coast region.  These reserves (estimated at over 4.5 x 10   ft ) will
provide energy and petrochemical feedstock to this rapidly industrializing
region. The Government has under consideration several projects for natural
gas utilization, including a fertilizer plant, and the production of methanol
as a fuel for vehicles. Nevertheless, the feasibility of such projects has
not yet been thoroughly assessed.
1.05      Plans are underway to explore the country's uranium potential and
the Government has contracted with the French Minatome group for such explora-
tion. Uranium possibilities seem to exist in the Zapatoca, Caldas and
Santander Departments.  This potential would provide the country with another
long-term energy option.  Although the measures taken by the Government to
achieve a domestically based energy balance have already yielded positive
results, the Government recognizes that its planning and policy efforts have
been insufficiently coordinated among the various energy subsectors.  To
remedy this, in 1980 the Government initiated a study to evaluate the country's
options in developing domestic energy resources. The study will also focus on

the policy measures that can maximize the benefits to be derived from recommended
investments, based on least-cost solutions. The Bank is working closely with
the Government in this endeavor.
Power Sector Organization
1.06      Since 1970, electricity has been the fastest growing form of energy
used in Colombia (8.2%/a); its share in overall energy consumption grew from
6.5% in 1970 to 8.9% in 1978. This process has been assisted by the gradual
consolidation of isolated facilities into regional systems and the intercon-
nection of these systems to facilitate development of Colombia-s low-cost
hydro resources. The main systems are the Central System, covering the
interior and the Pacific coast, and the Atlantic (or Northern) system covering
the northern part of the country. By 1983 a national grid will have been
established with the completion of a 500-kV line interconnecting the Atlantic
and the Central Systems.
1.07      At present, public electricity service is provided by:
(a) municipally owned companies, independent of the National
Government, of which the largest are Empresa de Energia
Electrica de Bogota (EEEB), Empresas Publicas de Medellin,
(EPM), and Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI);
(b)  national enterprises such as Instituto Colombiano de Energia
Electrica (ICEL), and Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca
(CVC), and the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica
(CORELCA);
(c) a large number of local subsidiaries of ICEL, CORELCA and
CVC 1/; and
(d) a generating and transmission company, Interconexion
Electrica S.A. (ISA), the shareholders of which are EEEB,
EPM, CVC, ICEL and CORELCA.
1.08      The Ministry of Mines and Energy owns part of the sector directly
through ICEL and CORELCA. EEEB and EPM, currently the largest utilities, are
controlled by autonomous municipal governments. CVC reports to the National
Planning Department (NPD). ISA was established in 1968 to provide a rational
framework for sector development by interconnecting the systems of its share-
holders, thus creating a national grid capable of transmmitting large amounts
of power and energy between the regions. By pooling their financial resources
(provided in part by Government contributions for ICEL and CORELCA) through
ISA, its shareholders have been able to share the costs and benefits of the
country's large hydropower resources, which are geographically concentrated
principally in the areas of Bogota (EEEB) and Medellin (EPM). One of the
1/   In most cases, the ownership of these subsidiaries is shared with local
governments.



problems that the sector as a whole faces is the relatively low level of
salaries of the top technical and managerial staff when compared with those of
equivalent positions in the private sector, which has resulted in a relatively
high turnover of senior staff. Action to assist the Government in dealing
with this problem would be included under the proposed Guavio project, to
be presented to the Executive Directors shortly.
Regulation, Planning and Coordination
1.09      The Ministry of Mines and Energy is charged with formulating na-
tional policy for the generation, transmission and distribution of elec-
tricity, including coordination and supervision of power sector planning,
although it shares responsibility with NPD in defining investment priorities.
The ministry discharges its functions through its Electric Energy Division
(which is small and does not have the powers for issuance of licenses, regula-
tion of tariffs, or approval of expansion programs to enforce its policies and
programs). Electricity tariffs are regulated by the Junta Nacional de Tarifas
de Servicios Publicos (JNT) which forms part of the NPD. JNT on the basis of
requests from the companies approves rate increases, but utilities are free to
set tariffs at levels lower than those approved by the Junta. Although the
Government cannot enforce its policies directly on the municipally controlled
power companies, a mechanism for reaching agreement on major issues affecting
the sector is provided by ISA, in which the Government has a major although
not controlling interest.
1.10      Sector planning and coordination have improved markedly in recent
years, as illustrated by the following:
(a) ISA defines the generation and transmission expansion program
for the interconnected system. On the basis of studies carried
out by it and its shareholders, ISA determines the least-cost
expansion program. After approval by its Board and NPD, this
becomes the national expansion program. ISA's bylaws specify
that all plants requiring a joint effort of all its
shareholders will be constructed, owned and operated by ISA.
Plants of regional interest may be built by one or several
shareholders, subject to ISA's approval. Under these
arrangements, ISA is, in effect, responsible for an important
part of sector regulation and planning.
(b) In connection with the San Carlos I loan, ISA and its
shareholders agreed to prepare and present to the Governmnt
and the Bank for comments a Power Sector Development Master
Plan, which has been received and reviewed by the Bank. This
plan covers the period 1980-90 in detail and 1991-2000 in
general terms and consolidates the programs for generation and
transmission expansion. Similarly, ISA's shareholders
undertook, under the coordination of the Ministry of Mines and
Energy, to prepare and present, as part of ISA's Master Plan,
to the Government and the Bank for comments by December 1981,
a 20 year Sector Development Master Plan for Distribution;
consolidating all existing and future programs for distribution



and covering the period 1982-87 in detail. l/ Overall, the Master
Plan is expected to provide a valuable framework for long-range
decisions on sector-financing, pricing and rural electrification
which have in the past been based on partial and uncoordinated
information;
(c) as agreed under the San Carlos I loan, a tariff study based on
marginal costing has been completed and received in the Bank.
The study is an important step towards the understanding of
electric power tariffs in Colombia and is the result of a
commendable effort made by ISA and its shareholders. The Bank
has given its comments to ISA and a Bank mission has been
scheduled to discuss what next step should be taken;
(d) also in connection with San Carlos I, a study was carried out
by consultants to assess the extent and causes of excesive
losses in the main power systems down to the level of
distribution to recommend actions to minimize such losses.
The Bank reviewed this study, and recommended that an action
committee be set up, representing all the shareholders, to
prepare a work program. A second phase of the study, which
deals with metering errors, is underway; and
(e) as agreed under the San Carlos II loan, a study on a uniform
system of accounts and financial planning for the sector is
underway by consultants, with participation of professional
from ISA and its shareholders. The results of this study are
expected by June 30, 1981.
Priesent Developments
1.11      Considering the power sector's important role in Colombia's develop-
menrt process, the Government and the main power companies established in the
mid-1970s the "Sochagota" Agreement, for orderly and efficient sector expansion.
The Agreement envisaged that ISA would be responsible for planning, building
and owning all plants of national interest. Since then, ISA has functioned on
this basis. However, in 1979, the shareholders of ISA expressed reservations
about the concentration of almost 70% of planned expansion in generating
facilities through 1987 in the national company and the associated loss of
parity among themselves in relative generating capacity. Another matter of
concern was that ISA-s construction capacity would be nearly fully committed
over the next few years with works in progress (1,910 MW of hydro plant,
1/   The Government has delegated management of the study to ISA.  CVC
has completed a draft report, but no information has reached the Bank
from ICEL. CORELCA is expected to have a draft report available soon.
EPM has a distribution program covering 10 years, which was defined in
cooperation with Westinghouse; this study will be expanded to cover the
period up to the year 2000 with the help of consultants. EEEB will
have the study executed by the same consultants to be engaged under the
recently signed loan 1807-CO.

numerous 230-kV lines and a 500-kV line). These reservations gave rise to
a proposal that the four plants in ISA's 1984-88 Investment Program (Betania
500 MW, Guavio 1,000 MW, Playas 200 MW and Urra 1,050 MW) be constructed,
owned and operated by individual shareholders. Although these plants would
represent less than 1% of the hydroelectric resources that Colombia will
develop over the next 20 to 30 years, the Government and the Bank felt that a
sound pattern of development and use of the country-s electric energy resources
should be maintained. In accordance with this, the Government and ISA's Board
have confirmed that:
(a)  as a long-term objective, ISA will own and have direct ownership
of at least 33% of overall sector capacity and energy. To this
end, plant ownership under the expansion program subsequent to
the current 1984-88 Program (discussed below) will be allocated to
ensure that ISA will have this share. Moreover, ISA will acquire
and maintain ownership of all trunk transmission lines in the
interconnected system. These arrangements will assure ISA a
predominant role in directing sector development and operation,
while avoiding problems attendant upon overconcentration of sector
responsibilities in ISA;
(b)  with respect to ownership of four hydro facilities in the 1984-88
Program, individual ISA shareholders would, subject to presentation
of viable financing plans, build and own the Guavio (1,000 MW),
Betania (500 MW) and Playas (200 MW) plants. 1/ The two Urra plants
(310 MW and 740 MW respectively) would be owned jointly by CORELCA
and ISA. On this basis, ISA-s direct control of the interconnected
system (currently about 20%) would increase to about 30% by 1988.
As stated above, the policy of 33% ownership will determine the
allocation among ISA and its shareholders of plants to be selected
for the 1989-93 Expansion Program and subsequent ones;
(c)  further, ISA will invest in the Guavio and Betania plants in exchange
for absolute rights to 40% of the capacity and energy of the former
and 50% of the latter, which ISA will sell to its other shareholders
under long-term contracts. These rights to plant output represent
an additional 6% of the national system, thus bringing ISA's overall
participation (direct ownership plus sharing in Guavio and Betania
investments) in the sector's generating capacity to 35% by 1988; and
(d)  ISA, as the future national dispatch agency (facilities are being
constructed), will operate the interconnected system at minimum
cost. This objective has been fully endorsed by ISA's Board; the
means by which it would be achieved would be based upon the results
of a dispatch study (under San Carlos II) scheduled for completion
by end-1981.
1/   The proposed Bank loan for Playas was approved by the Board on March 3,
1981.



- 7 -
1.12      Another matter which has been under discussion has been the growth
irt overdue accounts owed to ISA by its shareholders (except EPI) for capital
contributions and energy purchases. The Government and the sector took
actions designed to overcome this problem by the end of 1980 CVC and CORELCA
WE:re up-to-date, and measures are well in hand to erase EEEB's remaining
arrears (for capital contributions) by end-April 1981. The capital contribu-
tions of ICEL (a holding company for 13 mostly rural-based local power com-
panies, "'electrificadoras", which are normally paid by the Government, have
been brought up to date, but its electrificadoras' energy accounts for purchases
from ISA through end-1980 have not yet been settled (1981 accounts are up-to-
date).  The electrificadoras themselves have started taking action to improve
their finances, with some of them having increased rates by 3.3% per month.
Within the context of these objectives, the National Economic and Social
Policy Council (CONPES) has approved proposals formulated by NPD and ISA's
Board, which would eliminate the electrificadoras' arrears. Arrangements
are being made to provide financing to free resources to allow them to pay
their overdue accounts to ISA shortly. Also CONPES has also decided that a
15% surcharge would be added to the electrificadoras' tariffs (as in the
COPELCA system). Finally CONPES has resolved that national budgetary funds
earmarked for public entities that did not settle their accounts with the
power utilities would not receive the amounts equivalent to their outstanding
accounts. For the long term, however, the Government has realized that the
electrificadoras would need to be grouped into larger market companies to
become financially viable and operationally efficient. In November 1980
CONPES approved a number of measures aimed at attaining this, principally:
(i)  redistribution of markets through mergers of two or more
electrificadoras;
(ii)  restructuring of ICEL's financial and operational aspects; and
(iii)  strengthening ICEL's ability to guide the electrificadoras on
financial and technical matters.
In support the Bank has been encouraging the Government and the sector to
consider specific institutional arrangements for these small companies. In
response, some ISA shareholders have already begun to buy, or are contemp-
lating buying ownership of electrificadoras in geographic proximity to them.
For example, EEEB has ratified a proposal to obtain, as a first step, a 25%
share of ownership of the Electrificadoras of Cundinamarca and Meta, and EPM
will study the feasibility of acquiring the Electrificadoras of Antioquia and
Choco, and if study results are favorable, the company will proceed with the
acquisition (Playas hydroelectric project, Loan 1953-CO). It should be
recognized, however, that the reorganization will necessarily be achieved only
gradually over a period of years. The effort would be assisted by the
definition of strategy, coordinated at governmental and sectoral levels to
implement the CONPES decision; this matter is to be addressed comprehensively
in conjunction with the proposed Guavio project which involves all the sector
agencies that will participate in this undertaking.

World Bank Participation in the Sector
1.13      Since 1950, the Bank has made 25 loans to Colombia's power sector,
totalling US$979 million (Annex 1.2). In addition, the Bank is currently
supporting rural electrification under the Integrated Rural Development
Project (1532-CO, 1977), and would continue such efforts under the proposed
Village Electrification Project for the North Atlantic Coast.
1.14      Between 1973 and 1978 the Bank was unable to participate in sector
development through lending because of institutional and financial difficul-
ties including severe financial constraints (because of the Government's
reluctance to press for rate increases under inflationary conditions) which
reduced the sector's internal cash generation. Decisions on system expansion
required protracted negotiations among the shareholders and the Government.
These negotiations were further complicated by the original shareholders'
reluctance to allow the incorporation of CORELCA into ISA. Because of the
time required for resolution of these fundamental issues, the Bank delayed
consideration of San Carlos I, the 500-kV Interconnection and EEEB's Mesitas
hydroelectric project, all of them urgently needed to avoid power rationing in
Colombia. Regrettably, rationing is currently in effect and expected to be
intensified during this year, assuming average hydrological conditions.
The power shortage has also been aggravated by delays in initiating commercial
operation of the Guatape hydroelectric plant as a consequence of difficulties
encountered in implementing the population relocation program associated with
the project. Following satisfactory progress in resolving these problems,
seven loans were made, three in 1978 (San Carlos I, 1582-CO; 500-kV Inter-
connection, 1583-CO; and Mesitas, 1628-CO), one in 1979 (San Carlos II,
1725-CO) two in 1980 (Bogota Distribution, 1807-CO; and Guadalupe IV Hydro
Power Project, 1868-CO) and one in 1981 (Playas Hydro Power Project, 1953-CO).
1.15      Overall Bank operations through 1970 have been reviewed by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in two reports 1/, which concluded that
Bank financing had been successful in assisting the power companies to develop
hydroelectric plants at lower unit cost than otherwise possible. This per-
mitted greater urban coverage as well as cheaper and more reliable electricity
supply to industry. OED also commended Bank efforts in the establishment of
the central interconnected system which facilitsted further power sector
development. In addition, OED identified as important considerations for
possible future loans in the sector: the need to give greater attention to
improving power distribution, financial recording and financial planning
capabilities, and tariff structures; these have been addressed under the
above mentioned loans.
1/   "Operations Evaluation Report:  Electric Power" (Report No. Z-17,
dated March 10, 1972) and "Bank Operations in Colombia - An Evaluation"
(Report No. Z-18 dated May 25, 1972).



- 9 -
1.16      OED additionally reviewed four individual projects 1/.  The most
recent report (575-CO/681-CO), which pertains to ISA, discusses the engineer-
ing, physical, financial and institutional difficulties encountered, particu-
larly in connection with the Chivor Hydro Electric project, ISA's first
generation facility and the largest hydro electric project undertaken in
Colombia until then. The report concluded that the experience gained under
these projects has had a considerable impact on the shaping of Bank policy for
further lending in Colombia. Adequate provisions for price contingencies have
been introduced; local financing is being secured through long-term financial
commitents of the shareholders to ISA; and improved financial planning has
been instituted by ISA and its shareholders, as well as continuous monitoring
of their financial performance.
1.17      Recent developments in the sector indicate that a reasonable
balance between regional and national interest will be maintained, thus
providing a sound basis for continued Bank participation. Further objectives
are, in general: coordinated sector planning, efficient organization and
operation, and sound financial management; within the general scope of these
objectives, specific attention in the short term should be given to: least-
cost operations, stregthening of the operating efficiency and financial
viability of the electrificadoras, rational urban and rural distribution
developments, enhancing financial recording and financial planning capabili-
ties and development of improved tariff structures and levels based on common
concepts throughout the country.

Demand for gross generation and peak capacity are forecast to grow at
average annual rates of 10.2% and 10.3%, respectively, in theperiodl981-1990,
which is reasonable. The system load-factor is expected to remain constant at
61% during the period. The installation of about 6,600 MW is planned between
1981 and 1988 to meet demand (Annex 1.3).
Rural Electrification
1.22      About 34% of the population lives in rural areas.  Even though
access to service is high in urban areas, only an estimated 13% of the rural
population had electricity service. Complete information regarding ongoing
and future rural electrification efforts is not available at present but would
be available upon completion of the Master Plan (1.10).
1.23      Nevertheless, substantial rural electrification programs are currently
underway in a number of regions in the country. Among the most important are:
(a) The ongoing electrification subproject of an Integrated Rural
Development Program supported by IDB, Canadian International
Development Agency and Bank financing (Loan 1352-CO) through
which an estimated 15,000 rural families will acquire electricity
service. At present, DRI II is under preparation, and is expected
to cover substantial further areas;
(b) the electrification program in the department of Choco, financed
by the Netherlands Government;
(c) the electrification program in the coffee- growing areas,
financed by coffee sector resources;
(d) a recently approved IDB rural electrification project for ICEL,
which will provide service to about 130,000 households by
1984, as well as other ICEL projects for similar purposes;
(e) EPM and EEEB programs to extend subtransmission and dis-
tribution facilities to rural areas in proximity to their
own markets; and
(f) finally, CORELCA has prepared a village electrification program
covering the North Atlantic region, the subject of this report.
Sector Investment Program
1.24      The total 1981-90 investment program of ISA and its shareholders
excluding interest during construction, is estimated at about Col$1,519
billion in current prices (about US$15.4 billion in current prices) with a
foreign component of about 54%. Some 81% of currently programmed investments
would be for generation, which is extremely high (a range of some 40-60% would
be the norm). Because the new generating capacity would be or little use
without appropriate investments in sub-transmission and distribution it is
probable that the estimated cost of Col$1,519 billion is understated. The
Master Plan for power development being prepared by ISA and its shareholders
would provide a basis for more complete sector investment estimates (1.10).



- 13 -
1.25      The introduction of large thermal plants later in the century
is expected to play an important role in ISA's planning for the sector in
the next few years (lead time for mine developmnt and power station cons-
trLction may aggregate some 10 years). Even the large hydro potential of
some 93 GW (1.01) would be completely utilized by about year 2020 and the
use of the country½s large coal reserves in thermoelectric plants may be-
come more economic than hydro before that time. The Government is aware of
thils scenario 1/, and the Government agencies involved, together with the
Bank, are addressing it. The use of coal-fired thermal plants and the
substitution of coal for gas and pretroleum would be the primary objectives.
1.26      The generation investment program is imposing a heavy financial
burden on ISA and its shareholders. To ensure that only sound projects are
undertaken, assurances were obtained under the San Carlos loans that, except
for plants in the agreed National Expansion Program, ISA and its shareholders
would not undertake construction of any generating plants of more than 200 MW
(ISA) and 100 MW (shareholders) capacity prior to completion of San Carlos
unless satisfactory evidence has been presented to the Bank that it is eco-
nomically justified and that adequate financing is available to carry it out,
as well as to meet other financial obligations.
Finances and Tariffs
1.27      Except for EEEB and EPM, which have histories of adequate cash
generation, the power sector has relied heavily on borrowings and budgetary
contributions to finance its investments. EEEB and EPM operate low-cost
systems and cover the most affluent markets in the country; they have, there-
fore, been able to finance their investments with an appropriate balance
of borrowings and cash generation while charging relatively low rates.
CVC, previously dependent in part upon Government transfers, has strengthened
its financial position considerably in recent years. Because there has been
no mechanism to obtain financial transfers within the sector from the more
affluent areas to the less affluent ones, ICEL and CORELCA, which operate
high-cost systems in lower income areas than EEEB and EPM, have had to rely on
btudgetary contributions from the Government and fuel subsidies. In recent
years, however, the opportunity of sharing in low-cost investments through ISA
has provided an indirect transfer mechanism. In future, the re-structuring of
ICEL and the interconnection of CORELCA with the central system are expected
to strengthen further the sector's overall financial capability.
1.28      Between 1971-1974, rate adjustments lagged considerably behind
yearly inflation. From 1975 onwards the situation began to improve insofar
that rates were adjusted in line with inflation and starting in 1977 rates
have been adjusted to increase them in real terms. This trend is expected
to continue as the result of the agreements reached under the San Carlos I

and II, Mesitas, Bogota Distribution, Guadalupe IV and Playas loans and
current Government policy, which calls for maintaining tariff levels adequate
to provide reasonable contribution to investment requirements. For 1981 this
policy is expected to result in tariff increases in real terms of 20% through-
out the sector.
1.29      The successful long-term execution of Colombia's power development
is contingent not only upon the availability of sufficient cash generation by
the individual entities but also upon domestic and external sources of finan-
cing. The lag in generation investments during the 1970's together with the
need to accelerate expansion of facilities even further to permit energy
substitution, has resulted in a financial bottleneck that cannot be fully
relieved through tariff action. In recognition of this, during 1980, the
Government reestablished the Electricity Development Fund (Fondo de Desarrollo
Electrico, FDE) in order to overcome the constraint on investments represented
by the insufficient availability of local commercial financing. This Fund has
been made available to the utilities on the condition that their financial
obligations to ISA are duly attended to. Furthermore, in view of the high
priority the Government attached to planned power investments, authorization
for significant foreign borrowings to be monetized was given, even though
Government policy normally precludes this. Moreover, the Government is in the
process of establishing a Permanent Electricity Financing Facility (PEFF) for
the sector. This effort would be promoted under the proposed Guavio project.
2. CORELCA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES
General
2.01      In 1967 the Government of Colombia, by Law No. 59, established
the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica (CORELCA) as a decentralized
entity, under the Instituto de Aprovechamiento de Aguas y Fomento Electrico 1/,
with responsibility for planning, building and operating electricity generation
and transmission facilities in the Atlantic Coast region. CORELCA's statutes
were approved in 1972, by means of Decree No. 963. In 1975, Law No. 57, which
amended the previous provisions, placed CORELCA under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Mines and Energy and provided for the transfer to it of ICEL's
shares in the Atlantic Coast electricity distribution companies known as the
Electrificadoras. The Law establishing CORELCA provides that its equity shall
consist of: (a) the proceeds of a 15% surcharge on electric power consumption
in CORELCA's market area, calculated on the average regional tariff 2/; (b) con-
tributions from the National Budget; (c) any benefits from its operations (bulk

1968.
2/   Exempted are public lighting and consumption below 50 kWh/month.

electricity sales); and (d) any benefits it obtains from its participation in
its subsidiaries. The surcharge is to remain in force until CORELCA attains
sufficient revenues that it would no longer be needed.
2.C2      CORELCA's service area comprises the seven departments of the
Atlantic Coast region and the islands of San Andres and Providencia. Distribu-
tion is the responsibility of the department-level Electrificadoras 1/. At
present CORELCA's share participation in eight Electrificadoras varies between
97% (Cordoba) and 60% (San Andres); based on this, CORELCA has exerted increas-
ing influence over the Electrificadoras' operations and planning. This has
helped to improve the companies' operating efficiency and administration. To
achieve a more economic power supply, CORELCA is responsible for providing the
incremental power requirements of the Electrificadoras, and the latter are
specifically enjoined by law not to undertake new generating facilities.
Further, it has prepared a program of economic generation for the Atlantic
Coast region which is gradually reducing the volume of power generated by the
Electrificadoras themselves, which derives largely from old and fuel-inefficient,
oil-fired steam and diesel units (5.19).
Organization
2.03      CORELCA is administered by a 7-member Board of Directors.  The
Minister of Mines and Energy is ex-officio Chairman of the Board. Of the
other six Board members, three are appointed by the President of the Republic
(including one representing the Electrificadoras) and the other three by the
At:Lantic Coast business and labor organizations 2/. The General Manager, who
is appointed by the President of the Republic, is responsible for CORELCA's
day-to-day management. He oversees directly the work of (a) five managers,
responsible for technical matters, operation, finance, administration, and
susidiaries; (b) the General Secretary, in charge of legal affairs and archives;
and (c) an organization office. Below the managers there are five special
middle-level executives responsible for special projects (Cerrejon thermal
plant, hydroelectric plants, rural electrification, national interconnection
and technological development).
2.04      In order to increase CORELCA-s effectiveness in handling its
rapidly growing operations and responsibilities related to the Electrifi-
cadoras, it agreed under the San Carlos I project (Loan 1582-CO) to strengthen
its management and finances. To this end, it would carry out an organization
study with the assistance of consultants acting under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank. Under San Carlos II (Loan 1725-CO), the scope of the
study was extended to include CORELCA-s three largest subsidiaries, with a
view toward improving the situation of the Electrificadoras. The study
1/   These companies serve the Departments of Atlantico, Bolivar, Cesar,
Cordoba, Guajira, Magdalena and Sucre, and a further company serves
the islands of San Andres and Providencia.
2/   The Board members are distributed geographically so as to represent
the different regions in CORELCA's service area.



- 16 -
carried out by the consultants diagnosed the general performance of CORELCA
and the Electrificadoras of Atlantico, Bolivar and Magdalena; it did not
include specific recommendations for strengthening them. At the request of
the Bank, CORELCA agreed to carry out supplemental studies through consultants
specializing in public utilities but experienced difficulty in recruiting the
consultants because the company did not receive the minimum of three proposals
required by law. New proposals were received at the end of January 1981, and
CORELCA plans to hire the consultants by the end of May, for completion of
the study in August 1981. Implementation of the recommendations will begin in
November 1981 and is expected to be completed by April 1982 for CORELCA and
June 1982 for the three Electrificadoras. During the negotiations, CORELCA
has agreed that those recommendations on administrative and managerial
procedures deriving from the study would be implemented in CORELCA and in the
three Electrificadoras and also extended to the other five, with necessary
modifications to take into account differences in the size of each company.
Personnel
2.05      As of December 1980 CORELCA had a total of 947 employees, of whom
592 were in operations, and an effective installed capacity of 599 MW that
generated 1,852 GWh during the year. The ratios for operating personnel
would be approximately 1 MW/employee and 3.1 GWh/employee; for total personnel
they would be 0.6 MW/employee and 2 GWh/employee. These are regarded as
normal ratios for electricity, generating and transmission enterprises of
CORELCA's type, which in addition to generating and transmitting electricity
provides advisory services to the Electrificadoras and assigns personnel to
participate in national-level projects (Interconnection and Urra). The staff
increases projected for the next few years are connected mainly with the
coming on stream of the Cerrejon Thermal I and II plants. The general level
of salaries appears low: Col$5,500-6,500 (US$374-552) a month for profes-
sionals, ranging up to Col$29,800-47,570 (US$596-951) a month for Section
Chiefs and Assistant Directors. However, additional benefits (bonuses,
transportation and vacation allowances) must be taken into account to get a
picture of actual remuneration; such benefits amount to about 80% of salary.
Even so, CORELCA is not competitive with private industry, which results in a
high turnover of staff (about 13% in 1979 and 7% in 1980) and consequent
losses of skilled personnel, particularly professionals and plant operatives.
Management is trying to remedy this by further increasing the benefits because
as a public establishment under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and
Energy, CORELCA is constrained by central government salary levels (1.08).
2.06      CORELCA's engineering and operations staff is qualified and compe-
tent, with adequate experience in project management acquired. Finance and
management staff are also well qualified and capable. The Village Electrifica-
tion Project will be implemented under the responsibility of CORELCA's Manager
of Subsidiaries through a special unit established for this purpose. Organiza-
tion of this unit has been partly completed, and CORELCA has received prelim-
inary approval from the Government to finalize it (some key staff have already
been assigned informally and are working).

Training
2.07      In view of its own accelerated growth and the need to improve
the capacity of the personnel of its Electrificadoras, CORELCA has decided
to build a training center for its own and the Electrificadoras' personnel.
The center will be operated jointly with Electrificadora of Atlantico (the
largest subsidiary) and will provide training for manual workers and technical
staif. Construction and equipping of the training center forms part of the
project, and the corresponding foreign-exchange requirements will be financed
out of the proposed loan (4.10).
Accounting and Auditing
2.03        CORELCA has an accrual accounting system which is, in general,
apprcopriate, but requires some improvement; tabulations and reporting are
carried out effectively. Quarterly financial statements are available within
two months; apart from some inconsistencies that are expected to be corrected
as a result of the study on a uniform system of accounts for the sector
(1.10), they contain the information necessary for management review. CORELCA
will need to begin preparing budget control reports on a regular basis; these
and other managerial reporting procedures are expected to emerge from the
organization study. The company does not, however, have a suitable internal
auditing system. Because the Internal Control Division does not have the
necessary personnel, the Office of the Controller General of the Republic
performs only day-to-day auditing and budgetary controls. This situation
would be corrected when the recommendations on administrative and managerial
procedures deriving from the study (2.04) would be implemented. At the Bank's
recommendation, CORELCA has contracted external auditing services, for the
year 1980. During negotiations, CORELCA has agreed that audited financial
statements and the corresponding auditors report, prepared by external
auditors acceptable to the Bank, will ba submitted to the Bank not later than
four months after the end of each fiscal year. Also has agreed that external
auditors will audit the financial statements of the eight Electrificadoras.
Insurance
2.09      CORELCA's power assets are adequately insured.  During negotiations,
confirmation has been obtained that CORELCA will maintain sufficient insurance
coverage of its generation and transmission facilities.
Tariff and Rates
2.10      Tariffs have historically been higher in the Atlantic Coast region
than in the rest of the country 1/. However, they have not been sufficient to
cover operating, maintenance and capital costs, and the Government has thus
been subsidizing the prices of the fuel sold to CORELCA and the Electrificadoras
for the generation of electricity (chiefly natural gas since 1978). The
tariff situation in the Atlantic Coast region has been improving since 1977,
when CORELCA began to exert greater influence on the Electrificadoras' finan-
cicl management. In 1980 CORELCA was authorized by JNT to effect a monthly
1/   In this region, power generation is 100% thermal whereas in the rest of
the country it is predominantly (75%) hydroeletric.



- 18 -
increase of 2.5% until December 1981; however, it had to apply lower increase
because the Electrificadoras were authorized by JNT to increase their tariffs
only between 1.5 and 2% (5.03). To ensure that tariff increases in the
Atlantic Coast region evolve in a coordinated fashion, CORELCA has decided
that tariff applications to the JNT shall be submitted jointly, beginning with
the tariff increase for 1981.
2.11      Tariffs in the Atlantic Coast region rose sharply in the period
1973-1980. This can be illustrated by comparing average 1973 and 1980 tariffs,
expressed in USJ per kWh, after inflating 1973 average tariffs by the cost of
living index (using 1973 as a base) and using the average 1980 rate of exchange:
Increase in

CORELCA's block rate            1.85              2.40                29.7
The increases in real terms of the average tariffs of the Electrificadoras
(23%) and of CORELCA (30%) imply a substantial effort, considering that
Atlantic Coast tariffs have been higher than those in the rest of the country
and the market is generally less affluent. It will be noted that commercial
and industrial rates have been increased proportionately more than residential
rates. The means of improving the tariff structure is being addressed in the
national-level tariff study now underway (1.10).
General Outlook for the Electrificadoras
2.12      The Electrificadoras under CORELCA's supervision are departmental
enterprises which provide electricity service in each of the seven departments
of the Atlantic Coast region and the islands of San Andres and Providencia.
They are organized as private stock companies in which CORELCA is the principal
shareholder; the rest of the capital has been contributed by departmental and
municipal governments.
2.13      The Electrificadoras are administered by 5-member Boards of Directors.
The Governor of the department is ex-officio Chairman of the Board. CORELCA-s
General Manager is a member of all Electrificadora Boards. The other four
members are designated by CORELCA's General Manager in consultation with the
1/   Source:  CORELCA.



- 19 -
Governor. A General Manager, who is responsible for the day-to-day manage-
ment in each Electrificadora, is formally appointed by the Board, but nominated
by CORELCA. He directly oversees the work of the two or three managers
responsible for technical and operational, and financial and administrative
matters.
2.:L4     Generally speaking, the capability of the Electrificadoras, par-
ticularly the small ones, is limited in a number of ways that has prevented
proper development of electricity service. Since 1976 CORELCA has been
participating in the administration of these companies by appointing the
managers, and since 1978 through its Subsidiaries Management, which partici-
pates actively in the financial and technical aspects of the Electrificadora.
2.15      The training center, to be built in Barranquilla under the project
(4.10), will address the urgent need to improve the technical level of the
Electrificadoras.
2.16      CORELCA's largest subsidiaries are the Electrificadoras of Atlantico,
Bolivar and Magdalena which, respectively, account for 52%, 24.0% and 7.0% of
energy sales in the Atlantic Coast region and serve the cities of Cartagena,
Barranquilla and Santa Marta, which contain 69.4% of Atlantic Coast elec-
tricity consumers.,
2.17      Generally speaking, the Electrificadoras have high power losses: in
1979 these ranged from 19% (Bolivar and San Andres) to 57% (Magdalena) 1/.
Through the improved controls introduced by CORELCA in Magdalena, 1980 losses
were reduced to a still untenably high 47%. These losses are due to poor
condition of the distribution networks, unbilled consumption by squatter
settlements that make illegal extensions from neighboring areas served by the
companies, other theft from the Electrificadoras  networks, defective meters
and deficient billing systems. During the appraisal mission CORELCA requested
that the project include a study of distribution losses, aimed at determining
their causes and proposing solutions for reducing them, particularly those due
to thefts and to deficient administrative procedures. (Losses at the national
level are being studied under San Carlos I (Loan 1582-CO).
3. CORELCA'S MARKET
Supply Area
3.01      The service area of CORELCA and its subsidiary Electrificadoras
contains 11.6% of the total area of Colombia and, with about 4.4 million
people (1980), 16.5% of its total population. Their electricity consumption
accounts for about 15% of total electric energy sales in Colombia. 2/ CORELCA

chemical plant in Cartagena. The Electrificadoras, which formerly operated
individual systems, generated 63% of their needs in 1979. The San Andres
Electrificadora generates and markets power in two independent subsystems
(the islands of San Andres and Providencia).
Access to Service
3.02      In the Atlantic Coast region an estimated 2.1 million people
have access to electricity service, i.e. 48% of the population, which is
lower than the national average (54%). Access to the service varies widely
from one department to another, from a high of 83% of the population in
Atlantico to a low of 27% in Sucre.
3.03      Availability of electricity service in urban areas 1/ averages
74%, i.e. below the national average of 84%; Atlantico (87%) is the only
department that exceeds the national average. Access in the rural areas
is only 5.9%, well below the national average (13%). Rural electricity is
quite well developed in the departments of Atlantico (26.8%) and Bolivar
(15.7%); in contrast, rural electrification is practically non-existent
in the departments of Sucre (0.3%) and Magdalena (0.7%).
Historic Development
3.04      The area served by CORELCA has suffered from long-standing under-
supply of generation capacity. Normalization of service began at the end of
1972 with the entry into service of CORELCA's first generating and transmis-
sion facilities which interconnected the Atlantico, Bolivar and Magdalena
systems. CORELCA-s fuel-supply restrictions were eliminated at the end of
1977 when liquid fuels were replaced by natural gas. The Sucre, Cordoba and
Bolivar (South) systems were incorporated into the interconnected system early
in 1978 and that of Cesar in mid-1978. Finally, Guajira (Rio Acha) was
connected in late 1979, and Guajira (Maicao) will be interconnected in 1982.
This will complete the interconnection of all the main electricity consumption
and generation centers in the Atlantic Coast region. In parallel, CORELCA has
continued to expand its generating capacity through rapid addition of thermal
power stations. The installed capacities of CORELCA and the Electrificadoras 2/,
and the main transmission lines, are detailed in Annex 3.1 and IBRD Map No.

3.05      Annex 3.2 describes the evolution of consumption in each of the
Electrificadoras (except San Andres) and energy generated by CORELCA.

4/ From 1972 onward all incremental generation has been furnished by CORELCA.
Consumption demand in the various subsystems has risen sharply with the
overcoming of inadequate generating capacity. Constraints affecting distribu-
tion facilities still exist, so that it has not been possible to extend
electricity service to the peripheral areas of the main Atlantic Coast towns.
The inadequacy of the distribution networks, theft and the lack of proper
billing and control systems have resulted in an increase in losses from
18.5% 1/ in 1972 to 34.6% 1/ in 1979. This high level of losses is causing
financial problems for the Electrificadoras and for CORELCA (5.23 and 2.17).
Captive Plants
3.06      The installed self-generating capacity in factories in the Atlantic
Coast is about 65 MW, or 8% of CORELCA's and Electrificadora's installed
capacity. Of this, 23 MW pertains to ECOPETROL (the Government oil agency),
28 MW to three chemical plants, 5 MW to two cement plants, 6 MW to a textile
factory, 1.5 MW to water supply services and the remainder to two factories

located in the departments of Cesar and Guajira, in which the service was in
very poor condition until its integration to the interconnected system. In
many cases, these plants are used as reserve. Also, there are many self-
generating installation in the rural areas for agroindustrial uses, of which
33 MW would be substituted under the proposed project.
Forecasts
3.07      Sales by the Electrificadoras are projected to grow at an average
annual rate of 12.7% over the period 1979-88, and total sales of the CORELCA
system at an average of 14.2% (Annex 3.2 and 3.3).  This greater increase in
total system sales is due to direct supply by CORELCA to a chemical plant 1/,
and the sales to Cerrejon (coal mining) from 1981 onwards and Cerromatoso 2/
(nickel mining) from 1982. Gross energy growth required by the system is
estimated at 13.3% a year, taking into account a gradual reduction of losses.
3.08      CORELCA's forecast was prepared essentially on the basis of historic
trends. CORELCA uses simple exponential models for both energy consumption
and demand, deriving trend curves for forecasting requirements through 1989.
The requirements resulting from the Village Electrification Program (which
includes the Project) were included in each Electrificadora's projections.
Because the historic results generally agreed with forecasts made using these
simple models, CORELCA did not study alternative models. The main differences
in the past were related to CORELCA's generation, which generally was lower
than forecast owing to delays in interconnecting the Electrificadoras' sub-
systems and some Electrificadoras' reluctance to reduce their own generation
in accordance with CORELCA's economic generation program (5.19). The
present forecasts are considered acceptable. The following table summarizes
the results:
1/   Supply to the Soda Plant has been declining since 1977 because pollution
of the water of the Bay of Cartagena has led to partial suspension of the
plant's operations. The forecast assumes increases in consumption from
1981 onward in step with solution of the pollution problem.

4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Generation and Transmission Program
4.01      CORELCA's 1980-88 generation program represents CORELCA-s part
of the National Power Expansion Program (1.11 and Annex 1.3) covering the same
period. The company s program comprises the Cerrejon I and II steam thermal
plants (which will use coal from the Cerrejon coal development and will enter
into service in 1982 and 1984) and the Urra hydroelectric plant, which will
be executed jointly with ISA (1.11). CORELCA is also acquiring, through
investment, rights to a portion of the capacity and energy of the San Carlos I
and II and Jaguas projects, totalling 185 MW (under construction by ISA) and
the Guavio facility (to be built by EEEB) (1.11); taken together, these
investments will enable CORELCA to meet projected demand in its system.
4.02      CORELCA's transmission system, which from 1983 onward 1/ will
be linked to the rest of the national system via the 500-kV San Carlos-
Sabanalarga line (Loan 1583-CO), interconnects the main consumption and
1/   The interconnection will be energized at 220 kV late in 1981.

production centers of the Atlantic Coast region. CORELCA has a detailed
transmission expansion program covering the years 1980-84; for 1985-87
it has been defined in broad terms and includes the transmission facilities
required to handle the growth in demand of the major load centers. During
negotiations has been agreed that CORELCA will submit a more detailed
transmission program for 1985-90 to the Bank by December 31, 1983.
4.03     CORELCA is studying the hydroelectric potential of the Sierra
Nevada which, together with the Alto-Sinu (Urra Project), offers the only
possibilities for hydroelectric development identified on the Atlantic
Coast. In addition, CORELCA's study program envisages other studies with
a view to the planning of future generation and transmission expansion
needed after 1988.
4.04      CORELCA's investment program also includes expansion of capacity
on the island of San Andres (10 MW) and improvement of distribution facilities
in the major towns of the Departments of Cesar and La Guajira, since the
Electrificadoras of these Departments do not have the necessary organization
and resources to undertake works of such size. CORELCA's investments in
these works will be transferred to the corresponding Electrificadora as an
equity contribution.
The Atlantic Coast Village Electrification Program
4.05      Outside the Departments of Atlantico and Bolivar, the rural
population of the Atlantic Coast has very limited access to electricity
services (3.02); CORELCA has therefore assigned high priority to expanding
services in the rural areas. The rural population of the Atlantic Coast
tends to live in small villages instead of being dispersed; this fact
characterizes the program as a rural Village Electrification Program.
4.06      The Village Electrification Program would reach vast rural areas
of Colombia's still underdeveloped Atlantic Coast, the growth of which has
accelerated in recent years. It would facilitate increased farm activity,
agro-industry and rural commerce and also bring electricity to about
162,000 households, representing a population of about 1 million, with an
estimated final coverage in 15 years of about 215,000 households (1.4 million
inhabitants). The cost of the Village Electrification Program has been
estimated at about US$150 million (June 1980 prices). The program includes:
(a) construction of distribution networks in rural villages and small towns
(less than 10,000 inhabitants) that at present lack electricity service,
through extensions of transmission and subtransmission facilities; (b) rehab-
ilitation of old distribution networks in small rural towns with high distribu-
tion losses and poor service; (c) extension of transmission and subtransmission
facilities, and rehabilitation of existing distribution networks in small
rural towns that have a very precarious service (only a few hours per day)
based on local generation (diesel units), and (d) local generation facilities
and distribution networks in small towns that at present lack electricity
service and are too far from the existing and planned transmission and sub-
transmission facilities.



- 25 -
4.0)7     Taking into consideration the size of the program, the funds
available, CORELCA's and the Electrificadoras' execution capacity, and
the need to acquire additional experience through program execution, the
program has been divided into three phases costing about US$50 million
each (June 1980 prices). The program will be executed over a period of
15 years, from 1981 to 1995, with the first phase scheduled for 1981-85,
the second for 1984-88, and the third for 1989-95. The subprojects that
will be included in each phase were selected in light of their Internal
Rate of Return (IRR) ranking together with other factors (6.09).
4.08      The subprojects included in the program take into account the
transformation requirements from the available transmission levels,
subtransmission and primary and secondary distribution lines. Certain
sub-projects located in areas where there are transmission deficiencies
and that will handle large agro-industrial loads additionally require the
installation of transmission lines and substations. It was considered
appropriate to include these transmission facilities in the Village
Electrification Program because the subprojects need to have an adequate
energy supply. These transmission facilities, which form part of CORELCA's
transmission program, will also allow service to be improved in population
centers not included in the program. The transmission facilities included
in the program will be CORELCA's property, and the subtransmission and dis-
tribution facilities will belong to the Electrificadoras, in accordance with
the division of responsibilities between CORELCA and the Electrificadoras.
The Project
4.09      Objectives.  The main objective of the project is to assist CORELCA
and the Electrificadoras in improving and extending the electricity service to
the rural areas of the Atlantic Coast (which will allow replacing costly
and unreliable supply from old and inefficient diesel units) in support of
Government efforts to promote economic activity, employment opportunities and
welfare in this region. The project will also assist CORELCA in establishing
a Training Center and executing the losses study, both needed to improve the
Electrificadora's technical and financial performance. A second objective is
to improve the financial situation of the Atlantic Coast power sector, through
tariff increases, as necessary, to ensure an adequate contribution to the
investment program in the future. Finally, an important objective is to
support CORELCA's institution-building efforts. The project would be the
first stage in the process of extending Bank assistance to the only major
power company (except for ICEL) which has not been a previous recipient of
Bank lending.
4.10      Description.  The project comprises:
(a) The Village Electrification Program which includes: (i) distribution
networks to electrify about 120 rural villages and small towns,
that at present lack electricity service, through extension of
existing transmission and subtransmission facilities; (ii) rehabil-
itation of old distribution networks in six rural towns and
villages; and (iii) extension of existing transmission and
subtransmission facilities to interconnect 25 rural towns which



- 26 -
have a very precarious service based on costly local generation
(13 MW in 47 units) (Annex 4.1), and rehabilitation of their old
distribution networks. To do this it will be necessary to build:
- transmission facilities, mainly for the Magdalena, Cesar and
Bolivar South, subprojects, comprising 220 km of 110 and 66 1/
kV transmission lines, and the following transformer capacity:
(a) 30 MVA 2/ from 220 to 110 kV; (b) 15 MVA 2/ from 220 to
34.5 kV; (c) 41 MVA from 110 to 34.5 kV; (d) 22 MVA from 66 to
34.5/13.8 kV; and (e) 22 MVA from 110 to 13.8 kV;
- subtransmission facilities, consisting of about 1,150 km of
34.5 and 13.8 kV subtransmission lines and 48 MVA transformer
capacity of 34.5/13.8 kV; and
- distribution facilities consisting of about 470 km of distri-
bution lines and about 35 MVA of distribution transformer
capacity, to extend and improve electricity service to about
33,000 initial consumers, designed to serve 47,000 consumers over a
15-year period.
(b) A training center to give courses to the technical personnel of
CORELCA and its Electrificadoras. The following courses will be
given: (i) regular courses to existing staff to improve their
capability; (ii) regular courses for new staff; and (iii) refresher
and higher-level courses for previously trained staff. The training
program will handle about 1,500 participants and occupy 1,800 man/
months per year. The training center project comprises:
- procurement of teaching and laboratory equipment;
- training specialists- fees;
- scholarships.
(c) A losses study to identify distribution losses (technical losses,
billing deficiencies and thefts), and a loss-reduction program.
Location
4.11      The facilities making up the proposed Village Electrification
Project would be constructed in the seven Atlantic Coast Departments and
on San Andres Island, with the main emphasis on areas with low rural
electrification coverage and relatively good possibilities for agricultural
and agro-industrial development.
1/   Bolivar system uses 66 kV as main sub-transmission system and the lines
and transformation are related to subprojects in this department.
There are also some 66 kV transmission lines in the Sucre-Cordoba
system which will be changed to 110 kV in accordance with the demand
growth.

4.1.2     Cost.  T'he total cost of the project is estimated at Col$5,315.8
million (US$68.7 million), with a foreign-exchange component of Col$2,728.6
million (US$35.9 million), i.e. 52%. The project costs are detailed in

4.13     The project cost is based on estimated June 1980 prices readjusted
to December 1980 levels.  Transmission and subtransmission costs are based
on recent contracts and bids for similar projects under construction by
CORELCA and other power companies. Distribution costs are based on the
Electrificadoras' and ICEL's experience with similar works. Training costs
are based on a proposal by Electricite de France, as revised by a Bank special-
ist. Project costs are considered reasonable. CORELCA is exempt from custom
duties on imported goods and any taxes on externally procured goods. Physi-
cal contingencies correspond to the risk intrinsic to the various project
components and is estimated at 15% for village electrification and 10% for
training. These percentages are considered appropriate in view of the design
status (4.19). A price contingency has been added as follows: local-cost
inflation is expected to decrease from 25% in 1981 to 17% in 1985, while
foreign-cost inflation has been taken as 9% in 1981, 8% in 1982 and 7% the
following years.
4.14      Financing.  A Bank loan of US$36 million is proposed.  This will
finance 100% of the total foreign component. Bank financing will represent 2%
of the total cost of CORELCA's 1981-86 development program, and would pertain
to the following items:

Total                            68.7            100.0
The financing plan is based on:
(a)  Bank financing equivalent to 100% of project foreign-currency
requirements. This is appropriate, considering that this type of
project is not suitable for suppliers- credits and taking account
of CORELCA's heavy debt service resulting from foreign-currency
financing from suppliers and commercial banks. In order to maintain
a high level of Bank participation in supervision activities and
in the losses study, the proposed loan would finance 94% (US$34.1
million) of the project foreign expenditure, 100% (US$300,000) of
the losses study and about 50% (US$1.6 million) of construction
supervision.
(b)  The Government contribution of US$13.7 million equivalent (42% of
the local-cost component) is based on the high priority attached
to this project. The Government has allocated similar amounts to
other rural electrification projects in its drive to accelerate
socioeconomic development in rural areas.
(c)  CORELCA-s contribution of US$3.5 million would cover mainly
the administrative costs of the project and the training
facilities.
(d)  The Electrificadoras will contribute US$3.5 million, from
internal cash generation. The Electrificadoras will also
provide the bridge financing required to cover beneficiaries'
deferred payments (4.17).



- 29 -
(e) The beneficiaries' contribution will be US$12 million equivalent
(17.5% of project cost). This contribution will be effected by a
down payment by beneficiaries of about 30% of their contribution
and 7 years' deferred payments covering the remaining 70%. It
will be allocated among the beneficiaries on the basis of income:
their contributions will vary from 10% of cost for low-income
beneficiaires to more than 100% of the cost for agro-industrial
consumers, so that the beneficiaries' contributions average 17.5%
of project cost.
4.16      The critical aspects of the financing plan are the beneficiaries'
and Electrificadoras' contributions and the Electrificadoras' capacity to
provide the bridge financing covering the beneficiaries' deferred payments.
Berneficiaries- financing is based on the usual practice in Colombia, 1/ in
which the beneficiaries of rural electrification projects, and in some cases of
distribution network rehabilitation projects, contribute between 15% - 25% of
cost in low-income rural areas and as much as 100% in higher-income rural
andl/or urban areas, where the investment is effected directly by the benefi-
ciaries or is included in the cost of the property (new urban planning
developments). In rural areas, agro-industrial plants located near transmis-
sion facilities pay up to 100% of the capital cost of connecting them to the
public service system. Capacity to pay has been estimated at Col$173 per
month, which represents 5% of minimum monthly direct income 2/; also, the
beneficiaries will realize an average saving of Col$72 per month through the
replacement of kerosene by electricity for lighting and of Col$16 per month on
the purchase of ice (6.10). The beneficiaries- contribution to the financing
plan is considered to be reasonable.
4.17      The Electrificadoras' contribution and their provision of bridge
financing are feasible because of the proposed increases in their tariffs
(5.32). During negotiations, the Government has agreed to make available to
CORELCA funds totalling at least Col$13.7 million and to make arrangements
that any shortfall in the project financing will be provided on conditions
sat:isfactory to the Bank.
Engineering, Training, Studies
4.18      In 1978 CORELCA completed a preliminary prefeasibility study of
rural electrification needs in the Atlantic Coast region. In November 1979
CORELCA contracted Consultores Unidos Ltda. (Colombia) to execute the feasi-
bility study and final designs. The consultants began by carrying out
a 'Large statistical survey aimed at defining village and rural electrification
needs in the Atlantic Coast more accurately, as the basis for formulation of
the subprojects to be included in the program. That survey resulted in the
1/   A recent example is the rural electrification program of ICEL, with IDB
financing, in which the beneficiary contribution is 18%.
2/   The minimum average income per user-family was estimated as Col$3,559 per
month. This income does not include the non-commercial self-production
of agricultural products estimated to be a 30% income.

identification of nearly 300 areas to be electrified. From these, 116 sub-
projects were defined on a cost-per-beneficiary basis. The consultants
prepared preliminary designs for these subprojects, including cost estimates
and energy requirements. In September 1980 CORELCA submitted a draft of the
feasibility study, which was reviewed with CORELCA and the consultants during
the appraisal. The final version of the feasibility report, taking the Bank's
comments into account, was submitted in mid-January 1981. The feasibility
report includes the entire village electrification program, with detailed
information for phases 1 and 2.
4.19      In November 1980 the consultants presented a report defining
the technical design parameters of the transmission, subtransmission and
distribution components of the program and the unit-cost estimates. The
design parameters are based on the ICEL-s design guidelines for rural areas,
modified to take account of conditions in the Atlantic Coast region (salinity)
and the Electrificadoras experience, including lowering of the quality of
service in the low-consumption areas. At the same time the consultants
started on a topographical survey for the transmission and subtransmission
lines. The status of the completed final designs as of December 1980 was as
follows: distribution 12%, subtransmission lines 18%, transmission lines 20%,
substations 30%. The following program has been drawn up for completion of
the final designs and bidding documents:

4.20      Although the final designs and bidding documents have not been
completed, the characteristics of the project are such that the distribution
and subtransmission components require standardized equipment, and with 40%
of the design work scheduled for April 1981 at least 60% of the distribution
and subtransmission equipment can be put out for bidding, allowing the project
to be executed in accordance with the agreed executio-n timetable (4.25).
4.21      The services of Consultores Unidos have been contracted for the
feasibility study of the Village Electrification Program and the final
designs for phase 1. The cost, estimated at Col$163 million (US$3.3 million),

is being financed in part by a loan from FONADE. Colombian law prescribes
that the construction-supervision consultants must be different from the
consultants that prepared the designs except where supervision calls for
a high degree of expertise available only from the design consultant. This
project does not justify a request by CORELCA for authorization, as an
exception, to continue using the same consultants. Therefore during negotia-
tions CORELCA has agreed that it will contract the services of consultants
satisfactory to the Bank not later than November 30, 1981. The proposed loan
would finance up to 50% of the cost of consultants  services, which has been
estimated on the basis of a monthly cost of US$2,100 for senior staff and
US$700 for support personnel (including social benefits, overhead and fee).
4.22      Training.  A study of the training program was begun by Electrifi-
cadora of Atlantico with the assistance of Electricite de France. Subsequently,
when CORELCA and the Electrificadoras agreed on the establishment of a training
center to meet the needs of the entire Atlantic Coast region, the study was
reviewed by CORELCA with the assistance of a Bank expert. The new training
program, which does not include courses available in other training centers
and focuses particularly on the areas of critical importance to the Electrifi-
cadoras, was judged to be reasonable. The proposed loan would finance the
training foreign component, including equipment and materials (US$1.2 million),
scholarships (US$30,000) and consultant service.s (US$270,000) estimated on the
basis of a monthly cost of US$12,000 (short-term assignments). CORELCA and
Atlantico agreed that the building for the training center will be constructed
by Atlantico on land it owns and that CORELCA will supply all the equipment
and materials required. The operating cost will be shared between CORELCA and
the eight Electrificadoras on a use basis. During negotiations, CORELCA has
agreed that a condition of disbursement for this component of the project
would be that an agreement shall have been signed with Electrificadora of
Atlantico for the construction and operation of the center, that the Training
Center Coordinating Board shall have been set up by agreement between CORELCA
and the Electrificadoras, and that the Director of the Center shall have been
appointed.
4.23      Studies.  The consultants for the losses study (the cost of which is
estimated at US$300,000) should be engaged by CORELCA no later than October 31,
1981, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (4.10).
Project Unit
4.24      Overall supervision, administration and coordination of the project
will be the responsibility of CORELCA-s Subsidiaries Manager. Given the
relatively large scale of the project, both in physical size and in geographi-
cal distribution, an adequate organization for project management is essential
to success. It was agreed that CORELCA will establish a separate unit for
this, under the responsibility of the Subsidiaries Manager. CORELCA-s Board
has already approved the establishment of this Unit and has obtained prelim-
inary Government approval. The Unit has been operating since mid-1980, using
personnel transferred from other departments of CORELCA. The Chief of the Unit
is an engineer with experience in distribution projects, who was previously in
charge of technical assistance to the Electrificadoras in the execution of
programs of rehabilitation of distribution networks and small rural electrifi-
cation projects. The personnel assigned to the Unit is sufficient for the



- 32 -
present task of supervising the work of the consultant. During the negotia-
tions, the Government has confirmed that the establishment of the Project
Execution Unit will be ratified and CORELCA has confirmed that the Chief of
the Unit and the required personnel are already on duty.
Execution
4.25      Implementation Schedule.  The implementation schedule, of which
the key dates are shown in Annex 4.3, will be used to monitor the progress
of the project during the construction period. The Village Electrification
component is expected to be completed by mid-1985; the training center will be
operational by the beginning of 1983.
4.26      Procurement.  Procurement of goods and services to be financed by
the proposed loan (other than consulting services) would be effected through
international competitive bidding under the Bank-s procurement guidelines.
Colombian manufacturers would receive a preference of 15%, or applicable
duties, whichever is lower, for purposes of bid evaluation. Local manufac-
turers are not expected to be able to supply items required for the project
in excess of US$4 million. The ex-factory cost (that is, net of taxes) of
such items would be financed by the loan. Contracts for materials (poles)
and construction contracts (which the Bank would not finance) will be tendered
in accordance with Colombian law (Decree 150) and with CORELCA's normal
procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank.
4.27      Disbursement.  Funds from the proposed loan would be disbursed
against: (a) 100% of the foreign expenditures for the imported materials
and equipment; (b) 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally produced materials
and equipment (excluding poles) in the aggregate up to an amount of US$34.1
million; (c) 100% of expenditures for consultants for the losses study;
(d) 50% of expenditures for consultants for supervision; and (e) 100% of
foreign expenditures for training-consultants and scholarships. All disburse-
ments would be fully documented. Annex 4.4 shows estimated loan disbursements.
The closing date would be June 30, 1986.
Environment
4.28      No environmental problems are anticipated.  CORELCA has carried
out previous transmission projects with due regard to environmental protection.
The transmission lines will cross rural areas with low population density, and
clearing of rights-of-way would be kept to a minimum; people affected would be
compensated for any damage to property or crops. The terrain traversed by the
lines is generally flat, and the natural drainage pattern would not be affected.
In previous transmission line projects, CORELCA did not encounter problems
with rights-of-way since its right to impose them is provided for by law. The
subtransmission lines will generally use the existing rights-of-way of roads;
such use is also provided for in CORELCA's establishment decree. The distribu-
tion networks (extension and rehabilitation) are designed to reduce any
adverse visual impact and will be executed with special attention to safety.

Project Risks
4.29      There are no risks associated with execution of the project works
aside from those normally inherent for construction crews in this type of
work. There is a risk that CORELCA's and the Electrificadoras' revenues
may be less than needed to cover their share of costs, but the tariff measures
provided for are expected to ensure that this would not happen. A condition
of Board presentation is the Government's approval of the 1981 tariff increases
already requested by CORELCA and the Electrificadoras. The main cause of
possible project delays could be the time needed to obtain approvals required
for materials acquisition and construction contracts; however, construction
schedules have been defined on the basis of the normal rate of progress
attained by CORELCA on similar projects.

5. FINANCES
Introduction
5.01      The tariff policies proposed by CORELCA and its subsidiaries,
together with the proposed Government contributions to CORELCA and the funds
expected to accrue to the company from the PEFF (1.29) would provide a sound
basis for the planned investments and operations of the North Atlantic power
sys:-em.
Earnings History
5.02      CORELCA's system depends entirely on thermal generation (mainly
natural gas since L978). Its operating costs are substantially higher than
those of other bulk suppliers in Colombia, which generate almost 85% of their
power in hydroelectric plants. Although tariffs on the Atlantic Coast have
been among the highest in the country, CORELCA's higher operating costs have
not been fully reflected in its tariffs, and its earnings record has, conse-
quently, been poor. The Government has assisted CORELCA by contributing to
its investments and fuel costs and by covering its debt service.
5.03      Under the San Carlos I and II projects (Loans 1582-CO and 1725-CO),
CORELCA as an ISA shareholder agreed to improve its earnings performance
through tariff increases which would result in increasing rates of return on
revalued assets (4% in 1978, 5% in 1979 and 1980, 6% in 1981, 7% in 1982 and
9% in 1983 and thereafter). The rates of return obtained in 1978 and 1979
were in line with those agreed. The return forecast for 1980, however, is
only 2.2%, which is substantially lower than covenanted. This resulted from
factors partly beyond CORELCA's control at the time, in 1980 it requested and
received authorization from the Junta Nacional de Tarifas (JNT) to effect a
monthly increase of 2.5% through December 1981; however, through August 1980
it was only able to charge a monthly increase of 2% because the Electrificadoras
were authorized by JNT to increase their rates by only 1.5 and 2%. However,



- 34 -
CORELCA increased its tariff by 3.5% monthly in September, October and November,
and by 2.5% in December. The consequent danger of CORELCA's jeopardizing the
Electrificadoras' financial situation has led those Electrificadoras that were
applying tariffs below those authorized to at least raise them to the approved
levels. These unbalanced tariff increases between CORELCA and the Electrifica-
doras increased CORELCA's accounts receivable for energy sales to the Electri-
ficadoras from Col$440 million (US$10 million) at December 1979 to an estimated
Col$813 million (US$16 million) at December 1980. This reflects both the
Electrificadoras' insufficient tariff levels and also the increasing accounts
receivable for energy sold by the Electrificadoras themselves (5.23).
Rate Base
5.04      For public accounting purposes, Colombia's regulatory law does not
allow full revaluation of fixed assets but only adjustments to match the
revaluation of outstanding foreign-currency debt. To deal with this situation
the Office of the Comptroller General of Colombia has prescribed, by Resolucion
No. 8345 of July 30, 1980, that commissions shall be set up in the public
establishments, such as CORELCA, to revalue assets more realistically under
the supervision of the Auditor of the Controller General Office. For the
purpose of monitoring financial performance in relation to the San Carlos
loans, a fixed value for CORELCA's assets and accumulated depreciation as of
December 31, 1976 was estimated to take account of domestic and foreign
inflation and agreed on with the Bank; from that date CORELCA has revalued its
assets quarterly on the basis of the Colombian cost of living index. During
negotiations, CORELCA has agreed that by June 30, 1982, CORELCA will submit an
assets revaluation report to the Bank for comments and that an assets revalua-
tion accounting procedure will be included in CORELCA's accounting from
January 1983.
Financial Structure
5.05      The extra-fiscal measures taken since the San Carlos I loan, including
revaluation of assets for monitoring performance, have strengthened CORELCA's
financial structure. As of December 31, 1979, CORELCA's estimated capital
structure CORELCA was as follows:
MCol$         %
Capital                          3,991         24
Accumulated surplus                279          2
Capital revaluation              5,320         31
Total equity               (9,590)       (57)
Long-term debt                   5,666         34
Other liabilities                    37         -
Current liabilities              1,461          9
(7,164)       (43)
Total                      16,754        100



- 35 -
5.06      The capiLtal includes the yearly Government contributions, which
in 1979 amounted to Col$1,286 million. These contributions were used to
cover CORELCA's local currency investment requirements and part of its debt
service, as has been done in previous years. CORELCA's principal creditor is
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), with a debit balance at December 1980 of
Col$4,809 million (US$96 million), equivalent to 47% of total long-term debt.
These KfW loans are on various terms, ranging from concessional to commercial.
Other important creditors are EXIMBANK (9%) and Bank of America (8%). Local
financing amounts to Col$2,051 million (20%), including Government and commer-
cial bank loans denominated in foreign currency. Annex 5.1 shows conditions
and preliminary data for 1980. CORELCA's current liabilities include
Col$ 886 million of payable interest and retention and guarantee payments
to contractors. The current liabilities also include Col$ 426 million in
short-term loans, consisting in part, in letters of credit to cover down-
payments for equipment purchase. Part of these letters of credit once the
operation has been finalized by the Government will be converted to long-term
loans.
Investment and Financing Plans
5.07      CORELCA's 1980-86 investment requirements, including construction,
investments in ISA, interest during construction, and increase in working
capital amounts to Col$92,362 million, of which Col$5,316 million (4% of
total) relates to the proposed project. The future Urra hydroelectric project,
assumed to be owned 50% by CORELCA (and 50% by ISA) in this financial projec-
tion (1.11) is the largest component of CORELCA's investment project, requiring
Col$44,837 million (35% of total). The capital investments in ISA, amounting
to Col$21,233 million (16% of total), cover CORELCA's participation in San
Carlos I and II, Jaguas, Guavio and Betania. The proposed financing plan for
CORELCA-s investment program is summarized on the next page.
5.08      CORELCA's net internal cash generation would finance Col$ 11,577
million (9% of total). This low net internal cash generation results from
CORELCA-s heavy debt service (resulting from past rapid expansion of urgently
needed generation facilities, relatively hard financing terms and past low
internal cash generation) of Col$50,234 million (29% of total and 81% of gross
internal cash generation). The Government contribution would be Col$40,585
million (31% of total), and users' and Electrificadoras' contributions (related
to the rural electrification program) Col$2,268 million (2% of total); the
remaining Col$75,665 million (58% of total) would be covered by loans (Annex
5.3).  Of these borrowings, Col$9,890 million represents undisbursed loans and
loans already negotiated (final government approval is pending). The proposed
Village Electrification loan would amount to Col$2,729 million equivalent.
The balance of Col$63,046 million comprises: Col$29,990 million required to
finance CORELCA's contribution to Urra; Col$9,465 million to finance the
Cerrejon II thermal plant; borrowings for future transmission expansions of
Col$14,091 million; and Col$9,500 million to be borrowed from the proposed
PEFF (1.29).  Working capital needs were estimated on the basis of the
assumptions shown in the pertinent footnotes of Annex 5.4. As shown in the
financing plan for 1980-1986, a working capital increase of Col$ 7,269 mil-
lion is needed over the period.

5 09I     It is reasonable to expect that CORELCA will be able to obtain
the financing required for its own projects (ongoing and programmed transmis-
sionI facilities, Cerrejon II and other minor investments) as in the past,
bearing in mind that CORELCA's borrowings are guaranteed by the Government.
Also, in view of the expected improvement in its financial position (based on
the programmed tariff increases (5.16)), borrowings required to finance the
Urra project, which will be owned jointly with ISA (50%) and executed under
ISA"s aegis, will be defined at the time this project is under serious consid-
eration (1.11).
5.10      The central points of CORELCA's financing plan are the Government
contributions and the proceeds of the PEFF. The Government has already
commited its contribution for 1981 (the financial projection does not show the
contribution for the Interconnection Project (Loan 1583-CO), which is merely
channeled through CORELCA); this is in line with previous years  contributions
and would permit to CORELCA to cover its debt service and part of its invest-
ment requirements.  The following years  Government contributions have been
estimated in light of a governmental guideline according to which the programmed
contribution would not be increased by more than 15% per year, which means a
reduction in real terms. This policy was adopted as a means of inducing
companies dependent upon the national budget to improve their financial perfor-
mance. During negotiations,the Government has confirmed that future contribu-
tions to CORELCA would be in line with this criteria.
5.11      Government contributions are an integral part of financing for
the Village Electrification Project (4.15). During negotiations, the Govern-
ment has agreed to include in its contribution to CORELCA an item corresponding
to the Village Electrification project, the amounts of which are estimated in
current dollars at 1981 ITS$0OO,000, 1982 US$1.3 million, 1983 US$4.5 million,
1984 US$5.5 million and 1985 US$2.3 million (a total of US$13.7 million
equivalent).
5.12      Another basic aspect in CORELCA's financing plan is the loans from
the PEFF, estimated at Col$9,500 million during 1981 to 1986. Estimated
disbursements of Col$1,500 million in 1981 and Col$1,000 million in 1982 are
needed to cover CORELCA-s funds requirements. PEFF proceeds needed in the
following years are partially related to the Urra investment and will be
reviewed at the time that project is considered (1.11 and 5.09). During
negotiations, the Government has agreed that the loan funds from PEFF (or
equivalent financing) would be available for the years 1981 and 1982 in the
above estimated amounts as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan.
5.13      The assumed terms of the proposed Bank loan are interest at 9.6%
per annum, a commitment charge of 3/4 of 1% and repayment over 17 years
including 4 years of grace. The terms of other foreign and local borrowings
are! generally speaking in line with CORELCA-s current foreign and domestic
borrowings (the main change is the consideration of a major participation
by international lending institutions and the financing plan for the Urra
project prepared by ISA with heavy participation by these institutions and
foreign governments). The disbursement, debt service and payment schedules
for existing and future loans are shown in Annexes 5.5 to 5.8.

5.15      The projected revenues provide for the effects of expected local
and external inflation (4.13) and exchange rate devaluation (from Col$50.6
per US$ in 1980 to Col$108.2 in 1986) and are based on the following tariff
program:
(a) rate increase of 13% in early 1981, approved by CORELCA-s
Board and requested of the JNT in December 1980;
(b) continuation of the 2.5% monthly rate increase from March to
December 1981, to achieve a rate of return on revalued assets of
not less than 3.5% in 1981;
(c) continuation of the 2.5% monthly rate increase through 1982 plus
a lump-sum increase necessary to achieve an estimated annual
increase of 45% estimated to achieve a rate of return on revaluated
assets of not less than 7.5% in 1982; and
(d) continuation of the rate increases necessary to achieve rates
of return on revalued assets of not less than 11% in 1983 and
thereafter.
5.16      During negotiations, the Government and CORELCA confirmed that:
(a) CORELCA-s rates had been raised by the lump increase authorized
by JNT, and the monthly increases necessary to obtain a rate of
return of 3.5% in 1981 will continue to be applied; and



- 39 -
(b) tariff adjustments will be made on time to achieve the agreed
rate of return of 7.5% in 1982 and 11% thereafter.
5.17      CORELCA½s net operating income with the above plan is expected
to increase from Col$357 million in 1980 to Col$12,289 million in 1986,
producing rates of return on fully revalued assets ranging from about 4% in
1981 to 11% in 1983 (compared with 6% in 1981, 7% in 1982 and 9% thereafter
covenanted under the San Carlos loans). The increase stems from the need to
cover CORELCA's additional local cash requirements resulting from the assump-
tion that CORELCA will own 50% of the Urra project. This previous rate of
return covenant would be amended for the proposed loan so as to achieve not
less than 3.5% in 1981, 7.5% in 1982 and 11% thereafter (para. 5.15), to meet
the present investment requirements, improve CORELCA"s self-financing from
minus 36% in 1980 to plus 15% in 1986, and improve its debt-service coverage
from 0.3 (times) in 1980 to 1.3 in 1986. During negotiations it has been agreed
that, unless the Bank would otherwise agree, CORELCA would not incur long-term
debt which would result in debt service coverage rates lower than 1.1% in 1982
and 1.3% in 1983 and thereafter. The method of calculating the rate of return
and the basis for revaluing assets, for periodic monitoring and implementating
the required rates adjustment to obtain the covenanted rates agreed under San
Carlos I and II loans, would be repeated under the proposed loan. This basis
and methodology would be subject to review in light of the results of the
asset revaluation study (5.04).
Fuel Prices
5.18      Under the 500-kv Interconnection Project (1583-CO), the Government
agreed that starting in 1978, it would gradually increase the prices of the
fuel purchased by CORELCA so that hy the timw the 500-kv Inteconnection was
commissioned (now expected in 1983) it would be more costly for CORELCA to
generate electricity in its own plants than to purchase it from ISA. The
average fuel price (natural gas) paid by CORELCA in 1979 was Col$0.25 per
kWh, compared with the Col$0.35 projected at the time of the above loan.
The subsidy on natural gas prices shows small decreases from December 1978
to September 1980, and further decreases through April 1982 are authorized
by the Government. The prices included in the financial forecast from 1982
includes an annual increase of 40%, to achieve the objective by the time
CORELCA would be able to purchase electricity through the interconnection,
assuming availability. According to CORELCA's operational planning, the share
of natural gas price in its total operating costs would decrease from 1983
onward as a result of the commissioning of the Cerrejon thermal plant, which
will use coal (the price of which would be based on international prices).
5.19      The Electrificadoras  own generation, as a percentage of total
generation in the Atlantic Coast region, is decreasing but still represents
60% of energy needs. 1/ This energy is in many cases produced in old
_/   From 1972 all generation expansion has been CORELCA-s responsibility.

inefficient steam and diesel plants using fuels priced lower than paid by
CORELCA. To improve the economic efficiency of the system as a whole, as well
as its financial performance, during negotiations has been agreed:
(a)  with the Government, that the fuel prices charged to the
Electrificadoras for use in their generating plants in the
interconnected Atlantic Coast transmission system will be at
least equal to those charged to CORELCA;
(b)  with CORELCA, that the subsidiary agreements with the
Electrificadoras will include a covenant prescribing that the
Electrificadoras will operate their generating plants connected to
the Atlantic Coast system in accordance with CORELCA's economic
dispatch program (2.02).
Investment Limitation
5.20      In addition to the limitation covenanted under San Carlos II on
investments in generating facilities greater than 100 MW (1.26), during
negotiations has been agreed that except as the Bank may otherwise agree,
CORELCA would not: (a) incur expenditures for investments not included in
CORELCA's 1981-85 Investment Program aggregating annually in excess of 1% of
net revalued fixed assets in operation; or (b) incur investments unrelated to
the power sector.
Financial Outlook for CORELCA's Subsidiaries
5.21      To ensure that the Electrificadoras will be able to meet their obliga-
tions to CORELCA for investment contributions to the Village Electrification
project and payments for the energy purchased from CORELCA, the financial
situation of the Electrificadoras (excluding San Andres) over the project
construction period has been reviewed (Annexes 5.9 to 5.15). Because of the
importance of the Electrificadoras- contributions (their own and the users'
contributions) to the project financing plan, each Electrificadora will enter
into a subsidiary loan agreement with CORELCA that will define their responsi-
bilities under the project, including the collecting and transferring to
CORELCA of the users- contributions, and the achievement of financial targets
in line with project requirements and the need to improve their performance
(5.24 to 5.33). Also, these subsidiary agreements will include the conditions
under which CORELCA will transfer the subtransmission and distribution
facilities to be constructed under the Village Electrification project.
CORELCA has agreed that these facilities will be transferred to the Electri-
ficadoras on the following conditions: (a) 50% of the investment as a
CORELCA equity contribution; and (b) the remaining 50% as a loan to the
Electrificadoras on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan.
5.22      The Electrificadoras' financial projections assume a program of rate
increases based on their requirements and possibilities of each utility. The
increases needed for 1981 have been approved by the Electrificadoras and
submitted for approval to the JNT. These increases (and longer-term perfor-
mance targets for 1982 onward) have been translated into estimated rates of



- 41 -
return based on revalued assets, to permit monitoring of the Electrificadoras'
financial performance. Their current asset accounting procedures, which
considerably understate asset values, are expected to improve after the
organizational study and the covenanted rates of return would be adjusted
accordingly at that time. CORELCA has agreed that by June 30, 1982, it will
submit to the Bank a study that would determine the current value of each Elec-
trificadora's fixed assets and would propose procedures for annual revaluation.
5.2$S     Performance among the Electrificadoras varies but is generally poor,
especially from the financial standpoint. The main historical reasons are:
(a) inadequate managerial, technical and administrative systems; (b) lack of
well-trained and experienced personnel; (c) political influence in their
management; (d) tariffs lower than needed for proper financial development;
(e) very high distribution losses (probably including substantial theft);
(f) inadequate billing and collection systems; and (g) increasing accounts
receivable for energy sales, mainly from governmental and municipal agencies.
However, this situation has improved since the take-over of the Electrificadoras
by CORELCA in 1976 (2.01) and the organization in 1978 of CORELCA-s Subsidiaries
Directorate to advise the Electrificadoras on technical and administrative
matl:ers. In addition CORELCA now performs the billing for all the Electrifi-
cadoras with the help of a computer, and is installing systems for controlling
collection.  To reduce accounts receivable from governmental and municipal
agencies the Central Government is putting pressure on its local agencies to
reduce their debts with the Electrificadoras.
Atlantico
5.24      With sales accounting for some 52% of the electricity market of the
Atlantic Coast region, Atlantico's financial situation (Annex 5.9) has been
deteriorating since 1978 because of insufficient tariffs, below those approved
by the JNT. Since Decemher 1980, at CORELCA's request, Atlantico has been
charging the full authorized tariffs, and has requested JNT approval for 1981
tariffs adjustments comprising a 28% increase in early 1981 followed by 2.1%
monthly increases. Tariffs approved by JNT will increase Atlantico's yearly
average tariff by 60%. Nevertheless, Atlantico's finances will remain weak in
1981, with a deficit of Col$215 million anticipated, to be covered by short-
term loans and suppliers' credits (Annex 5.9). However, tariff increases
projected for the next few years, in line with CORELCA's, will produce rapid
improvement. These planned tariffs are reflected in rates of return on
revalued assets ranging from 21% in 1981 to 10% in 1986. 1/ Another cause of
Atlantico-s financial problems has been the high and growing distribution
losses due to system deterioration, and inadequate billing and collection
procedures. During negotiations, CORELCA has agreed that the subsidiary
agreement with Atlantico will include the following covenants: (a) that it
will apply tariffs that enable it to achieve the following rates of return on
net revalued fixed assets:  21% in 1981, 16% in 1982, and 15% in 1983 and
following years; and (b) that it will take the necessary measures to reduce
1/   Although the Atlantico's assets have been partly revalued, they understate
the value of fixed assets in operation. Consequently, the asset values
are low the first years and then increase rapidly as a result of
new works (including the project).

its system losses to the following levels: 1/ 24% in 1981, 19% in 1982, 18%
in 1983 and thereafter; will be implemented promptly.
Bolivar
5.25      Bolivar, with sales representing approximately 24% of total Atlantic
Coast sales, is a long-ago borrower from the Bank (Loan 347-CO, for the instal-
lation of 25 MW of steam thermal capacity). Its financial situation is
acceptable. In 1979 and 1980 the company faced liquidity problems due to the
service of debt contracted in 1977 and 1978 to improve its distribution
system, 2/ which has enabled it to maintain a reasonable level of losses. The
taiiff application submitted to the JNT in December calls for an increase of
28% in February 1981, followed by monthly increases of 2%. Tariffs approved
by JNT will increase Bolivar's yearly average tariff by 43%. In spite of
this, a deficit of Col$125 million is anticipated in 1981, which will be
covered by short-term borrowing (Annex 5.10). The tariff increases projected
for the next few years are in line with CORELCA's and represent increase in
real terms which will produce a rapid recovery in Bolivar's finances. These
tariffs are reflected in rates of return on revalued assets of 13% in 1981,
18% in 1982, and 7% in 1986; these rates are relatively high and decrease over
time for the same reasons as Atlantico's do. During negotiations, CORELCA has
agreed that the subsidiary agreement with Bolivar will include the following
covenants: (a) that it will apply tariffs that enable it to achieve the
following rates of return on revalued fixed assets: 13% in 1981, 18% in 1982,
16% in 1983 and 1984, and 11% in 1985 and following years; and (b) that it
will take action to reduce its system losses to the following levels: 1/ 16%
in 1981 and 1982 and 15% in 1983 and thereafter.
Magdalena
5.26      Magdalena is the third largest Electrificadora, with sales represent-
ing about 7% of total sales in the Atlantic Coast region. It is among the
Electrificadoras in the worst technical and financial shape (Annex 5.11). To
remedy this, CORELCA has replaced its manager with an official of the Electri-
ficadoras Subdirectorate as Supervising Manager, and has introduced a number
of administrative improvements, particularly in the billing and collection of
accounts receivable. Magdalena's losses were of the order of 57% in 1979 (an
estimated 40% of total losses due to theft and administrative deficiencies).
The tariff application submitted to the JNT calls for an increase of 18% in
early 1981, followed by monthly increases of 2.5%. Tariffs approved by JNT
will increase Magdelena's yearly average tariff by 39%. This would not resolve
fully the 1981 financial difficulties (although the administrative improvements
are expected to generate additional income not included in the projections).
The expected deficit of Col$28 million in 1981 derives mainly from investments
to reduce the technical losses in the distribution network, and will be
covered mainly by short-term suppliers' credits and commercial loans. The

2/   These investments include a highly sophisticated load dispatch system
which does not appear to be suited to the requirements of its system or
to the state of its secondary distribution facilities.

estimated tariffs are reflected in rates of return on revalued assets (the
amounts of which do not represent the assets' true value) of 0% in 1981,
10% in 1982, and 19% in 1986, required to improve Magdalena's financial
situation. During negotiations, CORELCA has agreed that the subsidiary
agreement with Magdalena will include the following covenants: (a) that it
will apply tariffs that enable it to achieve the following rates of return on
revalued fixed assets: 1/ 0% in 1981, 10% in 1982, 33% in 1983, 28% in 1984
and 20% in 1985 and 1986, and (b) that it will take the necessary measures to
reduce its system losses to the following levels: 37% in 1981, 28% in 1982,
25% in 1983, 22% in 1984 and 18% in 1985 and thereafter.
Cordoba
5.27       Cordoba accounts for about 5% of Atlantic Coast sales. 2/  The
tariff application submitted to the JNT calls for an increase of 35% in
February, followed by monthly increases of 2.2%. Tariffs approved by JNT
will increase CORDOBA's yearly average tariff by 70%. These tariffs are not
enough to resolve the financial situation for 1981 (Annex 5.12), which shows a
deficit of Col$13 million which will be covered by commercial and suppliers'
credits. The tariff increases are reflected in rates of return on revalued
assets of 1% in 1981, 4% in 1982, and 8% in 1985. Cordoba's accounts record
the value of the assets more satisfactorily, so that the rates of return
obtained are relatively low. During negotiations, CORELCA has agreed that the
subsidiary agreement with Cordoba will include the following covenants: (a)
that it will apply tariffs that enable it to achieve a rate of return on
revalued assets of 1% in 1981, 4% in 1982, and 8% in 1983 and following years;
and (b) that it will take the necessary measures to reduce its system losses
to the following levels: 22% in 1981, 21% in 1982, 19% in 1983, and 16% in
1984 and thereafter.
Suc re
5.28       In Sucre electricity supply was subject to restrictions until inter-
connection with the CORELCA system in 1978. Sucre is one of the Electrifica-
doras with a sounder financial position (Annex 5.13). Its request to JNT
comprises an increase of 15% in February 1981 and 2% monthly. Tariffs
approved by JNT will increase SUCRE's yearly average tariff by 45%. The
program of tariff increases will enable Sucre to obtain rates of return on
revalued fixed assets of 10% in 1981 and 26% in 1984 (here again, the book
values of the fixed assets are understated). During negotiations, CORELCA has
agreed that the subsidiary agreement with Sucre will include the following
1/   Rapid increase in rate of return is result of the tariff increases
required to improve Magdalena's financial situation.
2/   The area served by Cordoba was subject to permanent rationing until
1978, when it was interconnected to CORELCA's system.



- 44 -
covenants:  (a) that it will apply tariffs that enable it to achieve the
following rates of return on revalued assets: 10% in 1981, 15% in 1982, 17%
in 1983 and 25% in 1984 and following years; and (b) that it will take the
necessary measures to reduce its system losses to the following levels: 17%
in 1981, 16% in 1982 and 1983, 15% in 1984 and 14% in 1985 and thereafter.
Cesar
5.29      The area served by the Cesar Electrificadora was subject to rationing
until mid-1978, when it was intetconnected with CORELCA. The tariff increases
requested will enable Cesar to improve its financial situation (Annex 5.14).
Tariffs approved by JNT will increase CESAR-s yearly average tariff by 36%.
During negotiations, CORELCA has agreed that the subsidiary agreement with
Cesar will include the following covenants:  (a) that it will apply tariffs
that enable it to achieve the following rates of return on revalued assets:
0% in 1981, 7% in 1982, and 20% in 1983 and following years; and (b) that it
will take the necessary measures to reduce its system losses to the following
levels: 22% in 1981, 20% in 1982, 18% in 1983 and 15% in 1984 and thereafter.
Guajira
5.30      The Guajira system consists of three independent subsystems:  Rio
Hacha (interconnected with the CORELCA system); Maicao (interconnected with
Venezuela from which it purchases energy); and the isolated southern system
(diesel). Guajira's tariffs are the highest in the Atlantic Coast region
(except for San Andres), and its finances will be sound with the increases
requested of the JNT, of 7% in February followed by monthly increases of 2%
(Annex 5.15). Tariffs approved by JNT will increase Guajira-s yearly average
tariff by 55%. During negotiations, CORELCA has agreed that the subsidiary
agreement with Guajira will include the following covenants: (a) that it will
apply tariffs that enable it to achieve the following rates of return: 8% in
1981 and 11% in 1982 and thereafter; and (b) that it will take the necessary
measures to reduce its system losses to the following levels:  22% in 1981,
19% in 1982, 18% in 1983 and 16% in 1984 and thereafter.
San Andres and Providencia
5.31      The electricity systems of the islands of San Andres and Providencia
are isolated from the CORELCA system and from each other. The price of fuel
for San Andres and Providencia is heavily subsidized to cover the additional
cost of transportation from the mainland. The tariffs are the highest in the
CORELCA system. San Andres is applying rates lower than the authorized
monthly increases of 2.5%. Its financial projections include contributions by
the national and local Governments to improve its distribution facilities in
the tourism area. In addition, CORELCA is expanding its generating capacity
by 10 MW. During negotiations, CORELCA has agreed that subsidiary agreement
with San Andres will include the following covenant: that it will apply
tariffs that yield the following rates of return: 3% in 1981, 7% in 1982 and
8% in 1983 and following years.
5.32      The financial projections for all the Electrificadoras show that
the proposed tariffs will enable each one to make their planned contributions
to the project and to provide their consumers with financing for 70% of their



- 45 -
contributions.  During negotiations, CORELCA has agreed that each subsidiary
ag,reement will include: (a) the amount of each Electrificadora's contribution
to the project, and (b) the corresponding amounts of the users- contributions
that each Electrificadora must transfer to CORELCA.
5.33      The Electrificadoras have high percentages of delinquent accounts
receivable for energy sales, particularly those relating to national, depart-
mental and municipal Government agencies. The largest delinquent accounts
belong to the water supply enterprises and entities. During negotiations
has been agreed that CORELCA, not later than August 31, 1981, will prepare
and submit to the Government and the Bank, for comment, a plan to settle
the outstanding debt to the Electrificadoras for electricity sales and, no
later than October 31, 1981, carry out the plan. The Government has agreed
to take actions on its part to cause the public sector entities to pay their
debts to the Electrificadoras in accordance with the plan. It was also
agreed with CORELCA that the subsidiary agreements with the Electrificadoras
will include targets for accounts receivable for energy sales. The finaliza-
tion of the subsidiary agreements would be a condition of effectiveness.
6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Load Forecast
6.01      The demand projections for the program and the project are based
on the consumption patterns of villages currently having electrical service
(interconnected system and local generation) 1/, taking account of the
relevant characteristics of the various areas to be electrified, a socio-
economic study of the region, plus a survey of 193 villages (some electrified,
some not) to verify the statistical data and to ascertain the attitude of the
population towards electrification. The demand projection is divided into four
categories: residential, commercial, official and agro-industrial consumption.
6.02      Residential demand would include consumption for lighting, ironing,
some ice-making, radio and television, ventilation and cooking. Surveys
show that in a tropical region with average maximum temperatures higher than
24'3 C, ice is used extensively and is necessary for food conservation, whereas
the use of electricity for cooking is very low, being limited to the more
afEluent consumers.
6.03      The basic market-projection parameters used for the various
areas of the Atlantic Coast were number of dwellings (the dwelling being
adopted as the consumption unit) and annual electricity consumption per
dwelling. 2/ The socioeconomic survey identified two clearly differentiated
1/   The electrified villages surveyed were grouped together by age of the
service (3, 5 and 10 years) and type of service (interconnected system
and local generation).
2/   These parameters were based on the existing pertinent information on
rural housing and the available statistical data and census results
on consumption and installed capacity.



- 46 -
areas for which different forecast consumption patterns 1/ were established
for beneficiaries who lack service.  For villages already served, albeit
inadequately (whether from the interconnected system or from local generation
facilities), a consumption profile per dwelling was used for the entire
Atlantic Coast, because the survey indicates that this consumer relies upon
electricity for his basic needs despite quality of service. The consumption
growth per village was estimated on the following basis: (a) during the first
five years projected growth takes into account that only some of the users (an
increasing number each year) who will be connected by the end of the year five
will be connected to the distribution network during these transition years;
(b) annual consumption growth per user is estimated at 6% during the 6th
thlrough 11th year of service; (c) in light of the trend revealed by the
statistical data that from the 12th year onward it falls to 5% until a consump-
tion is reached of 2,000 kWh/year/user, this would be close to saturation
level; and (d) after that an annual growth of only 4% was assumed.
6.04      Commercial and official consumptions (public lighting, government
offices, schools, business centers, etc.) were each estimated at 10% of
residential consumption in the case of townships that at present have elec-
tricity service and at 5% in the case of townships that at present lack
of electricity service. This trend was determined from the available in-
formation. The consumption of artisans was included in business use because
the statistics and surveys did not yield conclusive results.
6.05      Agro-industrial consumption exceeding a demand of 10 kVA were
identified on the basis of a census conducted on the field and among producers'
associations.  Agro-industrial consumption comprises basically the existing
loads served by diesel plants and agro-industries in process of being estab-
lished. No account was taken of the requirements of possible future agro-
industrial developments in the planning stage. Annex 6.1 summarizes some
information on agricultural production in the region, most of which is located
in areas that do not have adequate electricity service.
6.06      The total demand projections for the project are summarized in Annex
6.2. The project is only the first phase of a large-scale program which is
expected to give added impetus to socioeconomic development of one of Colombia's
least developed areas, facilitate employment creation and help improve income
distribution. During negotiations, CORELCA has agreed to evaluate the socio-
economic results of the project so that those results may be taken into
account in future phases of the program.
Least-Cost Solution
6.07      The project is the first phase of a 15-year village electriciation
program. Detailed assessment of the least-cost solution for formulating a
1/   1,083 kWh/year/user in the fifth year of service for the area of greatest
economic development (Atlantico, Northern Bolivar, Northern Magdalena,
Northern Cesar and Guajira), and 969 kWh/year/user in the fourth year
for the area of least economic development (Cordoba, Sucre, Southern
Bolivar, Southern Magdalena and Southern Cesar).

viLlage electrification program involves comparing the cost of connecting each
subproject, or group of villages, to the transmission-subtransmission network
with the cost of installing local generation. Since such a large number of
subprojects are involved, 116, a separate comparison for each to determine the
least-cost solution would have been impractical. Instead, the distance per
user to the transmission system was determined and the investment cost compared
breakeven distance (at which the cost of each alternatives would be equal) was
estimated to be 0.16 km per user, equivalent to 0.027 km per inhabitant. For
a subproject of 167 beneficiaries (about 1,000 inhabitants), the breakeven
distance would be 27 km. The supply system was determined for each subproject
investigated on the basis that if the distance per user exceeds 0.16 km, then
supply by local generation facilities would be least-cost; otherwise the
subproject would be connected to the transmission system. This criterion is
modified to take account of situations in which a longer distance from the
transmission system would still result in connection being the least-cost
solution; this occurs when there are service quality requirements, 1/ a
need to serve important agroindustrial enterprises, or fuel transportation
problems. 2/
6.08      In addition, there were a large group of subprojects included
in the first phase (20% of first-phase investment) which could have been
supplied by two alternative transmission schemes. For each alternative, a
determination was made of. the cost of the investment in transmission and
subtransmission facilities required as part of the Village Electrification
Program, compared with investment required to meet the projected demand over a
period of 15 years. 3/ The solution adopted offers an economic cost (discount
rate 11%) 33% lower than that of the alternative.
Subprojects Ranking
6.09      The survey of rural electrification needs in the region identified
about 300 areas requiring rural electrification. In view of the size of these
needs, and the fact that it would be uneconomic to supply electricity to some
areas, a first selection was made on the basis of the lowest unit cost of
investment. 4/ On this basis, 116 subprojects were defined. These subprojects
comstitute the Atlantic Coast Village Electrification Program.  For these, the
total cost was estimated to be approximately US$150 million, in June 1980
prices and the power and energy requirements and the expected benefits were
1/   Own generation allows service for only a few hours a day (5-12 hours).
2/   Such problems increases fuel cost and thereby lengthen the breakeven
distance.
3/   For analysis purposes, power losses were deemed to be equal under either
alternative; it was later discovered that losses were lower in the
alternative adopted.
4/   The investment cost per beneficiary and per kW of demand where there are
special loads were ascertained for each project.

calculated. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of each project was calculated,
i.e., the discount rate at which the costs (investment, operation and mainte-
nance) and the benefits (energy sales, savings on lighting and the purchase of
ice, and fuel substitution 1/) are equal. Projects with the highest IRR were
included in the first phase, subject to the following supplemental criteria:
(a) subprojects requiring substantial improvements to the transmission
system aside from those included in the program were deferred;
(b) subprojects consisting solely of distribution systems rehabilitation
which otherwise qualified for inclusion in the first phase were
transferred to the second phase to increase the number of new users
in the first stage;
(c) subprojects that complement other planned projects (subprojects
relating to expansions or improvements of the same subtransmission
feeder) were deferred to be executed simultaneously with those
projects;
(d) two subprojects were withdrawn from the program and will be
executed by the users; and
(e) an attempt was made to achieve a proper distribution of the
subprojects among all the Electrificadoras with a view chiefly
to consolidating and increasing CORELCA-s influence on the
Electrificadoras.
The supplemental selection criteria are considered to be appropriate.
Annex 6.3 lists each first phase subproject and its location grouped by
Electrificadora.
Return on Investment
6.10      The return on investment was calculated as the discount rate at
which the present values of the benefit and costs streams associated with
the project are equal. The cost streams comprise (a) the capital cost of
the project; (b) the marginal cost of power delivered with the project
less the marginal cost of the power that would be delivered without the
project; and (c) the incremental operational costs related to the incremental
sales associated with the project. The following were used as proxy for
benefits: (a) income from electricity sales calculated at the 1980 average
rate for the Atlantic Coast region (including the surcharge accruing to
CORELCA), less income from sales without the project; (b) connection charges;
(c) savings to the beneficiaries through replacement of kerosene by electricity
for lighting; (d) savings on the purchase of ice; (e) savings through discon-
tinuing diesel fuel uese in townships that now have local generating facilities
and in agro-industrial plants.
1/   The fuel-substitution savings are included in the subprojects that at
present generate their own electricity and that would be interconnected
to the transmission system and in the agro-industrial loads that would
be connected to it.



- 49 -
6.11      The following benefits were not taken into account:  (a) replacement
of kerosene, by electricity, for heating (since this is a secondary use);
(b) benefits stemming from improvements in service to other villages con-
sequent to improvements to transmission (mainly increases in transformation
capacity); (c) increases in agro-industrial productivity and employment as a
result of availability of electric power; and (d) the social benefits deriving
from enhancing the standard of living of the population.
6.12      On this basis the return of investment is about 7.7% (Annex 6.4).
Taking into account the planned tariff increase of 45% for 1981 (5.16) which
means an increase in real terms of 20%, the rate of return would come to
13.3%, which compares favorably with the estimated opportunity cost of capital
in Colombia of 11%. The low rate of return obtained with the 1980 average
tariff, is of little significance as a measure of the economic worth of the
project; it mainly reflects the fact that past average rates in the Atlantic
Coast are out of line with the marginal cost of supplying future power.
6.13      The internal rate of return was also adjusted to take into account
the effect of the exchange rate and shadow labor prices in the investment
costs. The results are practically the same as in the base case (Annex 6.4).
6.14      A sensitivity analysis was carried out to measure the impact
of the main uncertainties underlying the return calculation. The analysis
shows the following (Annex 6.4):
Change from Base (%) ------
-20    -10   Base      +20      -60
------- Rate of Return (%) -------
Parameters

Combined changes
10% Increase in Investment
10% Reduction in Sales            6.3%
The rate of return is not sensitive to changes in sales. The sensitivity
to capital cost is modest, i.e., about 1% point per 10% change in cost.
The rate of return is more sensitive to changes in the rate, i.e. about
2.8% point per 10% change in tariff.
