THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1   Since Zambia's independence in 1964, copper has consistently remained at the
center of its economy -- even after copper prices collapsed in 1975, leaving the country
heavily indebted and poorer. Several partial attempts at economic reforms during the
1980s not only had little positive impact on growth but also increased the debt burden of
the country. Arrears accumulated, and the Bank and IMF suspended lending operation
between 1987 and November 1991 (except for a brief period in 1991). Following
elections in 1991, and a change in government, these operations resumed. Over the past
five years, Zambia has implemented one of the most ambitious and comprehensive
economic reform programs on the African continent with considerable support from the
donor community. In support of this program, the Bank has implemented five adjustment
operations with the sixth one approved in August 1996. The country is also reorganizing
and reducing its debt. A Commercial Debt Reduction Operation has been concluded.
Zambia also finished a Rights Accumulation Program with the Fund in 1995 and began
an ESAF program.
1.2   Significant success in the policy reform area has not, however, yet put the country
on a growth path which would reduce dependence on external assistance and be
sustainable in the medium to long run. The newly liberalized economic system exposed
the inefficiencies inherent in the Zambian industrial sector which was established with the
purpose of import-substitution and dominated by parastatals. The obsolete equipment
and processing techniques, and outdated product-mix of Zambian firms not only have
prevented them from penetrating export markets but also have put these firms in a
competitively disadvantageous position with the imported products in the domestic
markets.  Thus, a significant job loss occurred in the industrial sector with the
implementation of the economic reform prograrn. Although some contraction of
inefficient operations was inevitable, output and employment losses were exacerbated by
the high degree of dependence of manufacturing activities on purchases by the state-
owned copper company (ZCCM), which also has shrunk considerably.

1.3   Lack of significant supply response has become a major concern for Zambia's
reform program. Delays in supply response threaten the economic reform program by
contributing to serious political and poverty issues especially in the urban areas where
about half of the population live. For a supply response to occur: (i) Zambian firms need
to reinvest in their operations by acquiring new technologies and equipment which could
make them competitive both in Zambia and abroad; and (ii) Zambian entrepreneurs need
to take advantage of the emerging opportunities within the new liberal economic system.
1.4   There are two types of factors accounting for the lack of supply response--
economy-wide and firm-related factors. The economy-wide factors stem from general
economic and social problems and include: (i) unstable macroeconomy; (ii)
underdeveloped physical infrastructure which causes logistical problems; and (iii)
deficiencies in education and in industrial training which constrain labor productivity.
The second type of constraining factors arise from the characteristics of Zambian firms
and Zambian financial sector: (i) Zambian firms which were established under an import-
substitution regime in a highly protective environment have inefficient operations; (ii)
Zambian firms have limited capabilities to pro-actively seek out ways and means of
transforming their business into viable enterprises in a liberal economy; (ii) Zambia's
financial sector does not have sources of funds to provide necessary long term finance for
investments, and working capital needs of exporters; and (iii) institutional underpinnings
of the newly liberalized financial system are weak and the recent bank failures have
undermined public confidence. In addition to these factors, Zambia recently has been hit
with an unusual frequency of droughts with two major and one minor drought in the last
five years.
1.5   There have significant efforts to address economy-wide and sectoral problems on
the part of the donor community. The World Bank/IDA and the IMF have been carrying
out macroeconomic dialogue through a series of operations which are closely
coordinated. The Bank/IDA also have a portfolio of continuing operations involving
infrastructure, agriculture, environment, health and education. The various other donors
have been providing assistance directed towards these purposes as well as to some
specific industrial sectors (e.g. horticulture, tobacco, coffee) and to certain sections of the
society (e.g. micro-scale entrepreneurs). However, there has not been a concerted effort
to address firm-related factors.
1.6   Zambia's macroeconomic reform program thus needs to be complemented with
micro-level focused projects, and the proposed project is specifically designed for this
purpose. It would support firm-level efforts at restructuring by: (i) providing advice
through the use of matching grants; (ii) providing long-term credit facility for investment;
(iii) providing a short-term credit line for exporters; (iv) providing technical assistance to
help strengthen the institutional underpinnings of the financial system--wholesale, retail,
and regulatory; and (v) providing technical assistance to create a common and easily
accessible information and data base with modern tools for Zambian entrepreneurs,
through the Export Board of Zambia.

2. MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
2.1   Inflation. Inflation was unacceptably high during the late 1980s and in the first
half of the 1 990s, averaging 44 percent per annum between 1985 - 1987 and increasing to
55 percent in 1988 following the abandonment of the economic reform program.
Inflation accelerated to 130 percent in 1989 and stayed at around 100 percent until 1992.
In 1992, inflation jumped to 200 percent and continued at these levels until 1994. In
1994, better monetary control was established, and inflation fell to 53 percent in 1994 and
to 40 percent level in 1995. Inflation in 1996 was about 35 percent and is currently
projected to decline to below 20 percent next year.
2.2   Exchange Rate. The official value of Zambia's currency (Kwacha) appreciated
significantly after the mid 1980s when policy focus turned inward. The real exchange rate
remained relatively constant in the early 1990s, after a brief depreciation at the beginning
of the decade, in spite of trade liberalization. The real rate appreciated sharply for a few
months in the late 1993, but that was followed by a sharp depreciation in the same year.
A slight downward trend in the index of real exchange rate which had started in the late
1994 continued throughout 1995. The index of real exchange rate depreciated early in
1996 and appreciated back to its 1995 level towards the end of 1996. The tight
containment of domestic demand, modest recovery in the price of copper and donor
inflows significantly influenced the level of exchange rates.
2.3   Interest Rates.  Until March 1993, lending and borrowing rates were
administratively determined. Although the rates were supposed to reflect underlying
inflation, real interest rates in general were negative. Subsequent to the implementation
of Treasury Bill auctions, the real interest rates turned positive. As a matter of fact, the
real rates increased sharply with nominal rates. The real rates on treasury instruments
which became an important determinant of the interest rates on the other financial
instruments in the economy followed a highly volatile path, including becoming negative
occasionally, until the middle of 1995 when nominal yields stabilized around 50-60
percent range with inflation staying around 40 percent. The nominal interest rates stayed
within the 40 - 55 percent range throughout 1996.
2.4   Privatization. Zambia embarked on a very comprehensive privatization effort
with the establishment of Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) in September 1992. Upon
the approval of PIRC II (Second Privatization and Industrial Reform Credit C25230-ZM)
in June 1993, the privatization policy found a necessary momentum. After a slow start,
the process has really taken off over the twelve months from June 1995 to June 1996
when about 100 companies out of the total 137 were privatized during this period. The
remaining 98 companies/units in the total portfolio of 235 in the program have mostly
been prepared for sale or liquidation (see Annex D for a detailed list of these companies).
Zambia also showed its determination for privatization program by starting the process
for privatization of ZCCM. A separate program for ZCCM privatization aided by the
Bank's ERIP TA (Economic Recovery and Investment Promotion Technical Assistance,



4
C28750-ZM) credit is well underway and on schedule. Since the bulk of the privatization
occurred very recently, it is difficult to pass a judgment on the current situation of these
firms. However, the World Bank findings on the companies that were privatized at the
earlier stage (in 1994 and early 1995) indicate that there was a rationalizing of the
products and product lines and improvement in the product quality and financial position
of these firms. Some of these firms, especially those sold to the foreign investors, also
engaged in considerable investments. Based on the World Bank staff interviews,
Zambian business people are also happy with the newly privatized companies and they
indicated that these companies shifted their procurement to domestic companies where
possible and thus created additional business volume for them.
2.5   Trade Policies. Although tariff levels were reduced in the early 1990s, trade
policies by and large remained discriminatory for exporters who import substantial
amount of inputs until very recently. There were also substantial duties imposed on
capital goods. The 1996 reforms addressed these problems by introducing much lower
duties on capital goods and inputs. The duty ranges decreased to 5 - 25 percent from 20 -
40 percent, with many raw materials and most capital goods subject to tariff levels 0 and
5 percent, respectively.
2.6   Investment Performance. Investment in Zambia which averaged about 25% of
GDP during 1964-1975 era, became stagnant around 14 % of GDP after the collapse of
copper prices in 1975, and declined further after 1991. It fell to 9.5% of GDP in 1994. In
1995, investment showed some signs of recovery and increased to 12.5% of GDP which
is about the average level of investment in the 1990s. An increased investment demand
was observed from recent firm visits and interviews with the commercial banks. It
appears that this increase in investment demand is due to three factors: a, investors have
begun to discover their competitive edge (especially in activities which add value to local
raw materials); b) increased privatization activity (a total of 137 companies were
privatized, including some very big parastatals such as Chilanga Cement and Zambia
Breweries) and the desire of new owners and potential owners to rehabilitate these
companies; and c) the excellent harvest in 1996.
2.7   Recent Performance Under Reform Program. Although Zambia's economic
reform program has enjoyed an exceptional level of international support, the events of
the last year related to the elections, on top of long-standing good governance concerns,
have resulted in a deterioration of relations between Zambia and its bilateral partners.
This led to a suspension in June of bilateral balance of payments support.
2.8   Meanwhile, Zambia's performance in meeting the IMF ESAF benchmarks has
been by and large satisfactory though, at times, implementation has been uneven. For
example, six of the end December 1995 benchmarks were not met due in large part to the
poor financial performance of ZCCM. Corrective actions were taken, however, and
Zambia has met the revised targets for end-March, end-June and end-September targets.
The Bank's newly approved adjustment loan disbursed its first tranche ($45 million) in
October, after a joint IMF/Bank mission confirmed that the September targets have also



5
been met. Based on the performance through 1996, the IMF mid-term review of the
current ESAF program was approved by the IMF Board on February 28, 1997. The
bilateral donors and the Government have also resumed a constructive dialog on
governance and economic policy issues. The next Consultative Group meeting is
scheduled for July 1997.
3. THE PRIVATE SECTOR
A.    Origin and Evolution of The Private Sector
3.1    Origin and Early Developments.  The presence of private entrepreneurs in
Zambia dates back to the pre-independence period. After Independence this private
sector, which had extensive foreign interests, was viewed with suspicion -- resulting in
the 1968 "Mulungushi Reforms" which nationalized large scale non-mining operations.
The "Matero Reforms" of 1969 extended the nationalization process to mines. The
private activity which survived was either in the form of minority shareholding in the
nationalized companies (e.g. Lonrho, Anglo-American, Tate&Lyle, Dunlop, Duncan
Gilbey & Matheson, Shell, etc.) or as multinational corporations (e.g. Coca-Cola,
Colgate, Bata Shoe, Barclays, Standard Chartered) or as small/medium enterprises.
3.2    Recent Developments.  The recent liberalization program created two major
trends in the private sector. First, there is increased activity in informal sector, mainly by
small traders and street vendors. Second, there is increased activity in the formation of
new companies. Table I below shows that total company registrations averaged about
2250 per year in the 1990s, with a total of over 11,000 new companies created (details are
presented in Annex A). Trading sectors (import/export, wholesale and retail grocers) have
the biggest share in the newly formed companies. Some new companies have also been
created in the sectors where there had not been any significant activity prior to
liberalization, such as financial services.

B.    Basic Characteristics of the Entrepreneurs
3.3    The ongoing RPED (Regional Programme for Enterprise Development) Surveyl
offers some very valuable insights as to the characteristics of Zambian manufacturing
firms as well as perceived handicaps for further business development. As Tables 2 and 3
show, some important conclusions of this survey regarding the basic characteristics of the
Zambian firms are that:
*  Ethnic Africans are very new to the business scene, they are younger than European
and Asian origin entrepreneurs, and the vast majority of them have established the
businesses they owned;
*  Even though the general level of education is fairly low, entrepreneurs are typically
better educated than the average Zambian and have considerable industry experience.
While 66.5 percent of entrepreneurs have no more than high school education, 15.6
percent reached university level while 3.2 percent had undertaken some sort of
technical/polytechnical or professional training;
*  Firms that are established at a small scale, stay small. This is particularly true for
firms owned by ethnic Africans. Thus, of the 76 firms in the survey which employed
fewer than five people at start up, after a subsequent average 11.7 years in business,
only 27.6 percent (21 firms) had more than 10 employees;
* Lack of funds appears to be an obstacle both to the establishment and the
development of firms.
RPED is an ongoing research program in six African Countries (Cote d'lvoire, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe) directed by the World Bank and sponsored by eleven other bi-lateral donor
institutions.

C.    The Scope of the Private Sector
3.4    It is very difficult to estimate the aggregate size of Zambia's private sector, as the
country's national accounts do not decompose changes in output into their public and
private components. Employment statistics are, thus, often used as an indication of the
size of and the trends in the sector. The most recent available figures (see Annex B)
indicate that the total employment loss is about 10 percent since 1991. The parastatal
sector has the highest ratio of job loss, with about 15 percent during this period while the
private sector employment decreased about 5 percent.
3.5    Composition of Manufacturing Activities. Zambia's portfolio of manufacturing
activities has had substantial structural shifts since 1975. However the nature of these
shifts are quite different in the pre-1990 era and the post-1990 era. The former is mainly



8
due to stagnant demand, while the latter is attributable to the changes in macroeconomic
environment.

The above table needs to be further disaggregated in order to grasp the dynamics of the
impact of the recent economic policies. For example, although textiles show a significant
decline in the index value, manufacturing of cotton yarn -- which yields significant
portion of non-traditional exports -- has been a boom sector for Zambia. The decline in
the index is mainly due to closures of the manufacturers of higher end products (such as
woven textiles and garments) which could not compete with imports. Similarly, there are
significant signs of growth in certain segments of wood related industries even though the
index is showing a continuos decline
D.    Enterprise Development Constraints
3.6   In the RPED survey, Zambian firms of all sizes identified lack of access to credit,
competition from imports, insufficient demand, and infra-structural weaknesses as their
most difficult constraints -- although there is some variation in perceptions by sector of
activity and by firm size. The summary results of these perceived constraints are
presented in Table 5. Access to finance is more difficult for smaller firms, while
competition from imports threatens more the larger firms. It is interesting to note that
Zambian firms do not consider government restrictions to be a handicap for business
growth. On the other hand, inflation is perceived to be a significant burden.

E.     Export Potential and Constraints
3.7    Aggregate Exports.  Zambian exports are dominated by traditional mining
products -- copper, lead, zinc, and cobalt. However, reserves in the existing mines of
these metals are rapidly being depleted. Some of these mines are no longer economically
viable to operate and have closed--such as Kabwe lead mines--and others are facing
closures. Despite increases in non-traditional exports (see below) total exports have
declined in tandem with the decline in traditional exports.

3.8    Non- Traditional Exports (NTE).  Zambia's NTEs exports, according to
preliminary data, has reached to US$215 million in 1996. This figure marks an increase



10
of about 100% since 1990, corresponding to an annual growth rate of about 12%. Their
share in total exports has thus continually risen -- reaching about 22% in 1996 from about
10% in 1990. Most of this increase has, however, come from a select few sectors (i.e.
textiles, floricultural, processed food).

3.9    The recent Bank study on growth prospects for Zambia projects that NTEs will
grow at an annual rate of 14.5%, to reach to US$575 million by 2004. By that time,
traditional exports are expected to be US$910.2 million. The share of NTEs in total
exports is projected to increase to more than one third of total exports in 2004 of
estimated US$1.485 billion. The 1996 performance of exports, with about a 30%
increase over 1995 level, suggest that these projections are well on target.
3.10   The projected increase in NTE  is mainly due to the opening up of new
opportunities for Zambia's farmers as a result of the recent liberalization in agriculture.
The Growth Prospects study projects significant increases in the production of cotton,
soya beans, groundnuts, and sorghum. These industrial crops are likely to encourage
down-stream processing. There are already signs: cotton yarn exports have doubled
almost every year since 1991; and multinational companies are already targeting oil-seed
processing and organizing outgrower schemes to supply their industrial operations.

3.11   Comparative Advantages and Disadvantages. Zambia's major roadways,
power, communication facilities, and financial services are in quite good shape when
compared to most of the countries in the region. Moreover, Zambian utility prices
(excluding international telephone charges) are among the lowest in the region.

Zambia also compares favorably to other countries in terms of wages, and utility costs.
Although the current productivity levels are far from levels which would make these cost
advantages really attractive, Zambia has a core-industrial culture, especially around the
Copperbelt. With the appropriate training and modern management techniques, existing
industrial labor force could in time become an asset for foot-loose industries, such as
garments -- especially if South Africa's market becomes more open to the subregion.
3.12  Zambia's geographical position is, however, a major constraining factor. In
addition to being land-locked, Zambian exporters have to deal with time delays in ground
transportation to and from major ports. Significant delays in border crossings create



12
additional financial and logistical problems. The impact of geography is not, however, all
negative. Any improvement in South Africa's trade practices will certainly create new
opportunities for Zambian manufacturers in the region's single most important market.
Zambia also has some potential markets in the North. These markets could in time be
attractive, especially for Zambia's engineering product sectors and heavier industries.
Some multinationals in the Copperbelt are already trying to establish themselves in
countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Zaire. This Northern development is, however,
constrained by political uncertainties and the pace of economic growth in these countries
F.    Business Support Services
3.13   Types of Business Support Organizations.  Zambia has two categories of
business support organizations: public, and private.  All public organizations were
established by a parliamentary act with a legal mandate.  These organizations are
intended to serve specific business segments. Some of them were also given a regulatory
authority in the sectors in which they operate. The Small Industries Development
Organization (SIDO), the Investment Center (IC), and the Export Board of Zambia (EBZ)
are among the most prominent of these organizations (A complete list of these
organizations is provided in Annex C). These organizations are financed by budget
allocations, by fees generated, and through support from some donor funded initiatives.
3.14  Effectiveness of Public Institutions. The effectiveness of the public business
support services is quite questionable. SIDO currently employs about 1000 people, but
the recovery rate on its lending activity is below 1%. It also operates some industrial
estates with tenants paying very low rents. Although the purpose of these estates was to
provide facilities for emerging small enterprises, most of the tenants are well established
businesses which have occupied the premises for a long time. GRZ recognized these
problems and has been trying to restructure SIDO through new legislation.
3.15   The Investment Center was established through donor funded initiatives as an
investment promotion agency. However, it also was granted the authority to issue
investment licenses with special investment incentives, such as exemptions from customs
and duties.  In practice, the organization has thus far been pre-occupied with
administering the incentive mechanisms, with very little focus on promotion aspects.
Recently, in response to a loss of revenues from other sources, the Investment Center
increased the fees for processing incentives to very high levels. In the light of the newly
announced trade regime, the Center's ability to generate fees from issuing incentive
certificates will be severely restricted.
3.16  The Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) is one of the most successful public
organizations. EBZ is actively involved in the European Union Export Development
Program which targets four sectors: tobacco, coffee, textiles and floricultural products. It



13
is also trying to establish a data base with market information, accessible to Zambian
firms.
3.17  Nature of Private Organizations.  Most of the private business support
organizations are subsidiaries/affiliates of the international audit and consultancy
companies. There are also a few local consultancy firms, active mainly in donor funded
projects. Some of these firms are also active in providing advisory services for foreign
investors and act as an interface between local entrepreneurs and governmental bodies.
There are a number of business associations; however, their primary focus has been on
political lobbying on behalf of its members, not providing services to promote business
restructuring to their members.
4. FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THEIR REGULATION
A.    Structure of the Financial Sector
4.1   Zambia's financial sector is a shrinking sector with highly conservative and very
short-term focused banks. The sector also has a number of new entrants with inadequate
capitalization and staffing. The shrinkage and the short-term focus is the direct result of
macroeconomic instability over the last few years and large domestic public debt.
4.2   The Size of the Financial Sector. The total size of the financial sector in relation
to the size of the economy and the country's population suggests a low level of financial
activity. Moreover, a significant demonetization has occurred in Zambia as the ratio of
M2 to GDP has decreased to around 12 percent level in 1996 from 22 percent in 1991.
The relative size of the financial sector assets to the rest of the economy also declined, as
the ratio of total assets of the banking sector to GDP declined to 20 percent in 1995 from
44 percent in 1991. Decline in total assets of the banking sector over the last four years is
58 percent in real terms. (A detailed overview of the financial sector is presented in
Annex L).
4.3   Commercial Banks. Zambia's financial sector is dominated by commercial
banks, of which the three largest hold more than 10% each of total banking-sector assets.
These are the Government- owned Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZNCB) and the
foreign-owned Barclays Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. Three medium-size banks
hold assets ranging between 5% and 9% each, of the sector total; one is foreign-owned,
Stanbic, and two are locally owned, Finance Bank and Union Bank. Out of eleven
smaller banks, most are locally owned.



14
4.4   Non-Bank Financial Institutions. Non-bank financial institutions play a small
role in the Zambian economy. The Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) is technically
operational but relatively inactive as it awaits listing by companies. Leasing activity is
largely confined to commercial banks and their leasing subsidiaries. The only building
society operating in Zambia, while collecting deposits which by March 31, 1995
amounted to K 10 billion, placed about half of that amount in commercial bank time
deposits. New mortgage loans have virtually disappeared because of high nominal
interest rates and interest on existing mortgages was capitalized.
4.5   The Securities Market.  The securities market is at an early stage of
development. Government is issuing Treasury Bills of 28 days or longer and bonds up to
18 months. These GRZ instruments are auctioned weekly by the Bank of Zambia. In
volume and impact they dominate the financial sector, having reached 62% of M2 by the
end of 1992, reduced to a more manageable 36% over the last 3 years, but were up again
to 50% in late 1995. At end-November 1995 Treasury bills outstanding amounted to K
215 billion against total broad money supply of K415 billion and approximately 12% of
GDP. As of October 1996, outstanding treasury bills were K248 billion against the total
broad money supply of K541 billion.
4.6   Deposits. Total deposits of the banking sector decreased in real terms by 48
percent during the last six years. The composition of these deposits stayed fairly stable
over the same period. The new commercial banks started offering higher interest rates
and despite the recent bank failures, as explained below, and considerable flight of
deposits to bigger banks smaller banks continue to hold a higher share of total deposits
than their share in the total assets of the banking sector.
4.7   Lending. Total credit to private sector and parastatals, which is about 29 percent
of total banking assets, declined by about 50 percent in real terms since 1990. The
composition of the lending portfolio has also changed. Credit to mining decreased by
about 90 percent in the same period while decrease in credit to the manufacturing sector
is about 73 percent.
4.8   Zambia's commercial banks have been heavily investing in government securities.
Current treasury bill holdings of commercial banks are about 44 percent of total deposits.
Thus, Government has been the major borrower of the financial markets in the recent
years at the expense of the private and parastatal sector.
4.9   Recent Trends. The failure of Meridien Bank in 1995 (and two more smaller
banks after that) has precipitated a trend toward concentration of market shares of bigger
banks. Depositors moved to the larger, foreign-owned banks for safety, and ZNCB
suffered a withdrawal of deposits during the period when a proposal to merge it with
Meridien was being aired. The longer-term effects of the Meridien collapse on the
structure of the banking market are still unclear. Moreover, the episode has not ended,
with two small banks failing shortly after Meridien and several others currently not



15
complying with BOZ minimum-capital requirements. The liquidation of Meridien is still
in process.
4.10  After years of realizing losses, state-owned specialized financial intermediaries
are being restructured or liquidated. None has played a significant intermediation role
over the last two years. These include the Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ), Lima
Bank and Exim Bank.
4.11   There is also a significant effort going on to reorganize ZNCB which holds the
biggest share of the total banking assets needs to improve its operational guidelines and
management information systems. The new management developed a reorganization plan
with the help of international consulting companies. The reorganization plan aims to
modernize the bank in every respect but requires substantial expenditures. The ultimate
objective of the plan is to be able to privatize the bank. The implementation of this plan
has already been started. The workforce has been reduced by 30 percent by the end of
1996. GRZ is supporting the management's reorganization efforts and it makes the
proceeds from the privatization of parastatal companies available to ZNCB to close
and/or to service the outstanding loans to these companies. ZNCB and the government
requested the World Bank/IDA support for this plan. Recognizing the importance of
ZNCB to the well-being of the financial system and after extensive consultations with the
management of ZNCB, BOZ and MOF, the project team decided to support these efforts
by incorporating a technical assistance component in the proposed project.
4.12  Disincentives for banks to lend to local businesses can be traced to treasury bill
policy, inflation and other symptoms of macroeconomic instability. Since the foreign
exchange regime is fully liberalized, commercial banks have been keeping significant
deposits with foreign banks offshore. Treasury bills are considered liquid assets for
meeting the liquidity requirements of commercial banks. At year-end 1995, total lending
to private and parastatal sectors amounted to K237 billion, representing 25% of
commercial bank assets. GRZ debt held by banks nearly matched this level, amounting
to KI 89 billion. During 1996, a healthier trend was observed with the relative increase in
the share of lending to productive sectors in total assets of the banking sector and a
decrease in the share of banking sector's claim on GRZ. As of October 1996, total loans
and advances to private and parastatal sectors was K390 billion representing about 34%
of the total assets of the banking sector and GRZ debt held by banks were about K192
billion.
4.13  All banking activities center on very short-term transactions with interest rates
adjusted weekly and subject to large fluctuations. Foreign exchange deposits constitute
18% of all deposits. Commercial bank deposits abroad amount to 130% of the forex
deposits of their clients. Loans in forex tend to originate with special sources and
amounted to less than 25% of forex deposits, or K 21.7 billion at year-end 1995. The
reasons for banks' reluctance to use forex deposits for lending lie mainly in the attitude of
the forex deposit holders. Commercial banks indicated that their forex deposit holders



16
frequently instruct them to keep or to transfer their funds overseas for various reasons
including suspicions to the continuation of liberal capital account regime.
4.14  Credit Market Failures. Zambia's financial sector offers no reliable long-term
finance. Lack of long-term financial resources, and high inflation and interest rates are
two reasons for the lack of long-term lending activity. The larger insurance companies
and pension funds, traditional sources of long-term funds elsewhere, are illiquid and/or
technically insolvent.
4.15  Crowding out by 28-day treasury bill activity in financial markets along with high
inflation which raises nominal and real interest rates, are also effecting the financial
sector's ability to finance working capital needs for an emerging group of agriculture-
based exporters. These exporters which are trying to take advantage of the liberalized
economy are transforming Zambia's agriculture scene by organizing outgrower schemes
in cash-crops. But, these activities are constrained by the typical need for six to nine
months--almost medium-term credit in the Zambian context--financing in line with the
crop cycle and on terms approximate to the prevailing interest rates in major financial
markets. The kwacha denominated loans are well above world interest rates in real terms
and the only solution for these exporters is to borrow in foreign exchange. Zambia's
financial system has no access to fixed-term forex for fixed-term lending.
B.    Economic Regulation and Monetary Policy
4.16 Principles of Monetary Policy. Zambia's economic reform policies relied on
tight fiscal and monetary policies. BOZ refrained from financing fiscal needs through
money supply expansion and reduced lending to parastatals. GRZ has had to rely on
selling treasury bills without BOZ fiscal support. This created significant demand and
caused higher interest rates which in turn caused heavier domestic debt service
requirements.
4.17  Liquidity Management. BOZ's preference using statutory reserves and core
liquidity ratios to manage the liquidity caused further distortions in the financial markets
by creating a large spread between deposit and lending rates. BOZ now intends to switch
to open market operations as a means to manage liquidity. Some important elements of
successful open market operations are far from desired levels. First, accurate and timely
financial data is needed. Second, a reliable model of forecasting liquidity requirements
needs to be in place. Third, shocks to the system, such as injecting liquidity to the failing
financial institutions (in the case of the recent bank failures) must be avoided. BOZ is
currently assisted in some of these areas by IMF.
4.18    Foreign Exchange and Capital Account Regulations.  Liberal foreign
exchange transactions and no restrictions on the capital account transactions create a
favorable environment for business development especially in attracting foreign



17
investment. However, Zambia still needs to convince all the economic agents that the
changes are permanent.  Keeping liberal foreign exchange policies becomes very
important to maintain the stability and confidence in the system. Both BOZ and GRZ are
committed to this.
C.   Prudential Regulation and Supervision
4.19  Current Legislation.  Under current law, BOZ has the authority to issue
prudential regulations for banking institutions. The new Banking and Financial Services
Bill has led to introduction of additional regulations. The BOZ is also now able to
monitor interim developments in the banking system through monthly and quarterly bank
reports, as well as conduct on-site inspections.
4.20  Capacity Building Efforts.  Efforts to strengthen the Bank of Zambia's
supervisory capacity continue under a comprehensive project to modernize the Bank of
Zambia, which is funded by the IMF, UNDP, SIDA, CIDA, and other donors. This
project began in 1994 and has included funding for a coordinator, short-term experts, as
well as in-country and external training. In November 1995, a tripartite review was
completed during which funding was reallocated to reflect changing priorities.
4.21  Among the priorities currently being assigned to this project are capacity building,
strengthening off-site and on-site inspection and developing the regulatory framework for
implementing the Financial Institutions Act. In view of the failure of Meridien Bank and
other banks in 1995, however, the BOZ's enforcement capacity and, equally important,
the political will to enforce prudential regulations remain foremost among the constraints
impeding effective bank supervision in Zambia.
4.22  With respect to capacity building, under a staff training program managed through
the BOZ Personnel Department, courses are being provided by Bank of England staff in
Zambia and by South African commercial bank staff in Harare, where a regional training
center has been established. Frequent rotation of BOZ staff at all levels and, in some
instances, the departure of critical BOZ staff, however, have constrained the effectiveness
of long-range planning and have contributed to the currently weak state of bank
supervisory capacity.
4.23  The improvement of bank-reporting forms is in process under the BOZ
modernization project, as is the drafting of new inspection manuals and reporting forms
for non-bank financial intermediaries falling under the BOZ's supervisory authority
(notably merchant banks, leasing operations and operations of banks in the securities
market). A short-term adviser has reviewed inspection manuals, advised BOZ staff how
to prepare for inspection, and is scheduled to train BOZ staff this year in implementing
on-site inspection procedures. The improvement in bank reporting forms will also need
to take into account information to assess liquidity, interest and currency risk, as well as
risks stemming from other operations.



18
4.24  Additional Needs. BOZ will also have to develop procedures for assessing
banks' capacity to manage their own financial risks. Such risk management is important
in the areas of liquidity, interest rates, currency and other operations, and will be a key
criterion in the selection of qualified financial intermediaries to access credit lines under
the proposed Enterprise Development Project (EDP). There is also an urgent need to
upgrade on-site inspection capabilities of BOZ. It is envisaged that amendments in
legislation and the promulgation of regulations will become necessary in due course
5. THE PROJECT
A.   Origin and Relation with CAS
5.1   CAS Objectives. The Bank's 1994 Poverty Assessment outlined an action plan
which was adopted by the government as a focus for Zambia's development objectives.
The Bank's CAS is supporting a three-pronged strategy to assist the government in
implementing this action plan, specifically: (i) helping to create a stable macroeconomic
environment as a prerequisite for growth and employment; (ii) promoting private sector
development and greater public sector efficiency to stimulate more rapid and inclusive
growth; and (iii) targeting assistance to poor and vulnerable groups directly. The Bank
has supported the formulation and implementation of Zambia's economic reform program
through a combination of adjustment and project lending, and economic and sector work.
Zambia is now moving to a second stage characterized by continued strong support for
liberalization and structural policy reform, but with a focus on resuming sustainable
growth by putting additional emphasis on stimulating investment, improving efficiency,
and increasing direct poverty reduction efforts.
5.2   CAS, Ongoing Programs and the Project.  The proposed project would
complement both adjustment operations and sectoral investment programs in promoting
private sector development. Higher investment levels would also support macro
stabilization efforts, and would complement the privatization program by providing
assistance to privatized companies. The project would also complement ASIP
(Agricultural Sector Integrated Investment Program C26980-ZM)) by supporting agro-
businesses.
5.3   Origin of the Project. This project has its origins in work carried out while
preparing the Growth Prospects study. An extensive review of the real and monetary
sectors was conducted, and the results were used as background papers for that study.
Recognizing several significant market failures, the recent Growth Prospects Study by the
World Bank recommended "pro-active" initiatives to help Zambian firms reorient their
business operations and to enhance their access to finance.



19
B.    Project Objectives
5.4   Overall Objective. This project aims to complement and support the ongoing
economic reform program by aiding and facilitating investment in internationally
competitive economic activities. The current reforms cannot be sustained without the
Zambian private sector becoming the locomotive of the economic growth. In order for
Zambian firms to assume such a role they need to adapt to the changing macroeconomic
environment. For that adaptation to occur, Zambian firms must acquire new technologies
and equipment and invest into emerging new opportunities. The project is intended to
remove existing obstacles for Zambian firms to accomplish this. It is not, however,
intended to prescribe to Zambian firms how to reorient and where to invest. Great care
was given to make the project a demand-driven project, with credit priced at market rates
and without any implicit subsidies.
5.5   Specific Objectives. The project would support firm-level efforts at restructuring
by: (i) enhancing Zambian firms' technical know-how by providing demand-driven
technical assistance to Zambian firms in the form of matching grants; (ii) enhancing
Zambian firms' access to finance by providing a long-term credit facility for investments
and a short-term credit line for exporters; and (iii) strengthening the financial system and
availability of information resources in Zambia by providing technical assistance to help
strengthen the institutional underpinnings of the financial system--wholesale, retail, and
regulatory-- and by providing technical assistance to create a common and easily
accessible information and data base with modem tools for Zambian entrepreneurs,
through the Export Board of Zambia.
C.    Lessons Learned
5.6   The project aims to draw on the results of projects, in Zambia and elsewhere, that
have sought to support on-lending and to strengthen business services. On-lending
projects have often had limited results because: (i) distortionary terms and conditions of
onlending led to targeted misallocations of resources; (ii) subsidized credit mechanisms
did not have the desired real sector impact; (iii) economic reforms did not precede the
supply support programs; and (iv) projects did not provide adequate support for
institutional underpinnings of the financial system. The key lessons learned with respect
to matching grants and technical assistance are: (i) provision of information and
management should be specialized and tailored to the needs of firms -- generalized
training and technical assistance should be avoided: (ii) grants to targeted sectors ignored
some productive sectors--thus, economy wide coverage is desirable; and (iii)
administering the matching grant schemes through independent executors is more
efficient and effective. The proposed project design incorporates these lessons.



20
D.   Project Description
5.7   Project Components.  The proposed project would have the following
components. First, the project would have a broad Matching Grant Scheme (MGS)
which would be used to stimulate the use of support services to assist firms in their
reorientation. Second, a Multi-purpose Credit Facility (MCF) would be provided through
the commercial banks to finance investments as well as to stimulate exports. Third,
institutional development would be supported through technical assistance for financial
institutions and the Export Board of Zambia.
5.8   Project Design Features. The overall project design has the following features:
*  simple project components so that: (i) they could be easily understood by all the
private sector firms: (ii) they could easily be utilized; and (iii) they could be delivered
effectively and quickly;
*  independently manageable project components so that each component can be
delivered without being effected negatively by any adverse developments in the other
components;
*  a decentralized implementation structure so that the management of the project
components are not burdened with a bureaucracy;
*  a quick start-up with the only condition of effectiveness requiring the completion of
the process of hiring of service contractors for MGS and MCF which was started
immediately after the appraisal and was well advanced by negotiations. Disbursement
conditions are few, simple, straightforward, and follows automatically from the
project implementation; and
easy monitoring of a few, key important performance measures which are generated
automatically as the project advances and can provide valuable feed-back to policy
dialogue and complement other operations.
1.    Matching Grant Scheme
5.9   Matching grant schemes have been instrumental and quite effective to induce
firms to use specialized services to enhance their capabilities. These schemes were
successfully implemented in various countries including: India, Indonesia, Kenya, and
Mauritius. Following the success of those projects, projects with similar schemes in
Uganda and Zimbabwe have recently been approved. A project with a similar matching
grant scheme is being prepared for South Africa.



21
5.10   Purpose and Scope. A Matching Grant Scheme (MGS) will be made available
to Zambian firms to promote international competitiveness. MGS is intended to motivate
firms to use specialized support services to inject technical and managerial know-how
into their operations. It would do so using a combination of three instruments:
First, so long as a firm had a written basic development plan, showing the business it
wished to become, and the steps in getting there, essentially any use it then made
within this plan of external support services would be eligible for 50% grant support
towards all fees and travel expenses incurred.
* Second, firms would be given free hand-holding assistance on how to go about
utilising support services, in order to incorporate skills, know-how and information
quickly into their operations [e.g. how to define the tasks, how to find the best
supplier for the task, how to use the results].
* Third, although most grants would be "demand-side" grants, as described above, in
addition and as a way of reaching very small firms, the scheme would assist private
commercial service providers, private-sector associations, and NGOs to develop their
capacity to deliver effective services to private firms. It would extend "supply-side"
matching grants to any such private or NGO operation wishing to use outside help to
develop its service-supply capacity.
The grant support would be deliberately temporary. If successful, users of services would
have become so convinced of their value that they would continue to utilise them, as
appropriate, at full unsupported market prices.
5.11   Design Features. In addition, the MGS will have the following specific design
features:
* The Scheme would accept applications for the whole project period. With simple and
clear eligibility criteria, the available funds would be disbursed on a first-come first-
served basis.
. The total grant funding available under the proposed project would be US$2.5
million. However, discussions have already been initiated on the possibility of
adding to this a further separate fund, under the recently begun Agricultural Sector
Investment Program (ASIP). This second fund would be allocated specifically for
agricultural/agribusiness activities, but would operate under virtually identical
eligibility criteria, with the two funds administered jointly. Further work on this pos-
sibility will be undertaken with the ASIP team.
* Given the importance of a few larger firms to the impact of such instruments on the
Zambian economy, the cap on the maximum grant per firm should be set high. The
MGS is intended to motivate even big firms to use more support services, and use
them faster than they would without the incentive. This is equally true of firms



22
judged to "be able to afford to do without this help." There would be a cap per firm
for grant payment of US$75,000. Each firm is eligible only once and the grants will
be given on "first-come first-serve" basis (see Annex E for operational guidelines of
the scheme)
*  The scheme would be run under term contract by a management contractor, providing
the services of an internationally-recruited management team capable of gaining the
confidence of chief executives in even Zambia's largest private firms. The contract
would probably be let to a joint operation, consisting of a local partner able to provide
local know-how and contacts, plus office and administrative support, working with a
foreign partner providing the services of one full-time internationally-recruited
Scheme manager.
*  Since eligibility criteria would be set deliberately to be simple and transparent, and
since the scheme operates first-come first-serve, approvals would not be dependent on
"technical evaluation". The approval authority would therefore be delegated to the
contractor.
The independent management contractor and the economy wide coverage aspects of the
design incorporate the lessons of the previous experience elsewhere in the world where
some productive sectors were ignored and/or the scheme's efficiency undermined by
political and bureaucratic process. The proposed grant instrument for NGOs is the first
such instrument included in matching grant schemes.
5.12  Management. The Scheme, and the management contract, would be supervised,
on behalf of GRZ, by a specially constituted Matching Grant Supervisory Committee
(MGSC), comprised of six representatives from private sector organizations and one
representative from the government. This committee has already been appointed by
GRZ. GRZ and MGSC would follow the operational guidelines outlined in Annex E.
The management contractor would be hired by MCTI on the recommendation of MGSC
according to IDA rules prior to the project effectiveness.
5.13  Reaching Very Small Firms. Special efforts have been made in developing the
scheme, so as to reach down to very small firms. Such firms would mainly be potential
users of standardised or group-oriented services. Usage of such services would be
supported. Also, the contractor would be expected to extend promotion and outreach
activities to include NGOs, local groupings of very small firms, and localised service
suppliers. In addition, NGOs and associations serving such firms would be encouraged to
take up "supply-side" grants, to help develop their delivery of support services to very
small firms. The scheme would extend "supply-side" matching grants to any private or
NGO operation wishing to use outside help to develop its service-supply capacity. The
eligibility criteria would be similar to those for demand-side grants, but here the
maximum grant per recipient would be set at US$25,000.



23
2.    The Credit Component
5.14 Lines of Credit. The project will finance a Multi-Purpose Credit Facility (MCF)
which includes two lines of credit - the Investment Credit Facility (ICF) for long- and
medium-term loans to finance investments, and the Export Preshipment Credit Facility
(EPF) for short-term loans to finance production for exports. MCF funds, denominated
in foreign exchange, will be channeled through an Apex (wholesale financial institution)
organization to qualified commercial banks and to other financial intermediaries for on-
lending. The financial intermediaries will assume the credit risk of all loans. The credit
lines will be managed in accordance with the guidelines outlined in Annex F.
5.15  The project proposes an ICF of US$30 million and an EPF of US$10 million.
These amounts were estimated on the basis of demand expressed in extensive interviews
with the potential participating financial intermediaries (PFI) for credit lines and the
potential borrowers from the credit lines. Since the proposed ICF corresponds to only
about 2% of the total gross investment over the next three years, it is intended to
introduce long-term resources into Zambia. The proposed EPF corresponds to about 6%
of NTEs, provided that the facility recycles one and a half times per year. Given the
relative size of the credit lines vis a vis existing demand for such credit in Zambia, it is
expected that other donors and aid agencies would introduce similar instruments in
Zambia.  In this respect, KfW  of Germany has already agreed to utilize the
implementation framework of the project to provide an investment credit line of about
US$10 million with terms and conditions identical to the credit lines proposed under this
project.
5.16  Eligible Borrowers.  The lines of credit will be provided to viable private
enterprises by commercial banks and other licensed financial intermediaries. All sectors
in the Zambian economy will be eligible to borrow from MCF lines of credit excluding
real estate transactions, and pure trading activities. The participating intermediaries will
lend the funds to borrowers meeting their own risk criteria and they will be fully
responsible for repayment to the Apex lender independent of the final borrowers'
performance.
5.17  Eligible Financial Intermediaries. The Apex lending institution will evaluate
applications for participation in the program from licensed commercial banks and other
financial intermediaries. The Apex will seek IDA's approval for the eligibility of a
financial intermediary to participate in the credit lines. An important condition for
participation by commercial banks will be compliance with all Bank of Zambia
prudential regulations, as well as with the minimum capital requirements which becarne
effective at year-end 1996 (see Annex F). For other financial intermediaries (such as
investment banks and leasing companies) similar minimum capital requirement and
eligibility criteria will be established by the Apex institution.



24
5.18  Limits for Financial Intermediaries.  For each participating intermediary
maximum amounts from both lines of credit will be established as a percentage of the
intermediary's capital as a means to minimize the aggregate financial institution's risk to
the Apex. No participating intermediary will be allowed to intermediate more than 25%
of the total amount of each line of credit even if qualified for a higher share because of
the size of its capital. Limits will be set, nevertheless, so as to generate an aggregate level
of eligibility which is much larger than the size of the lines of credit. This excess is
intended to promote competition among intermediaries for eligible borrowers. The limits
will be revised periodically to reflect the participating intermediaries' performance and
capital. During the periodic reviews, additional intermediaries may be approved (new
institutions, institutions that now meet criteria for participation which they previously
failed), and participating institution will be removed from the list if their performance has
deteriorated below the qualifying criteria. For evaluating participating intermediaries the
Apex institution will use, to the largest extent possible, the data and analysis of the BOZ
Department of Banking Supervision.
5.19   Limits for Final Borrowers. No single borrower (a firm or group of companies)
will be allowed to borrow more than 3 million US dollars under ICF and 1 million US
dollars under EPF in total from all of the participating intermediaries. These limits on
single borrowers are set to facilitate the broader participation in these facilities. No lower
limit will be established for loan size, but we expect the banks to set their individual
minimum size based on their assessment of administration costs. The interviews with
commercial banks indicate a lower limit between US$25,000 - 100,000 for EPF and
US$50,000 - 200, 000 for ICF.
5.20 General Terms and Conditions for Final Borrowers. IDA funds for MCF will
be provided to the PFIs denominated in US Dollars at a rate of interest which reflects the
international rates for US Dollars. The Rate will be equal to 12 month LIBOR plus 2%.
This rate will be adjusted annually to the prevailing 12 month LIBOR rate. The PFIs are
expected to charge the final borrowers a rate equal to their cost of funds plus a spread to
cover their administration costs and credit risk. IDA or the Apex will not dictate or limit
their spread, nor is their spread expected to be the same for all their borrowers, as the on-
lending rates for each class of borrowers should reflect the PFIs risk in lending to them.
The commercial banks interviewed by the mission indicated that their spread will be
between 2 - 4 percent. Although all the loans from the Apex to the PFIs and from the
PFIs to the final borrowers will be denominated in US Dollars, final borrowers and PFIs
will be allowed to make repayments in US Dollars or in Kwacha at the prevailing
exchange rate on the day of each payment. This will enable financial intermediaries and
final borrowers to assume the exchange rate risk without assuming a foreign exchange
availability risk. ICF loans will have a maturity of three to seven years with a grace
period of up to 18 months.  EPF will have a maturity of up to nine months.
Disbursement, and repayment schedules of PFIs to the final borrowers will be exactly
reflected into the agreement between the Apex and PFIs.



25
5.21  Sinking Fund. Given the maturity of the IDA credit, the maturity of the loans
provided from the MCF allows the MCF to be recycled several times until the IDA credit
matures. However, as IDA interest charges are much below international interest rates, it
is the intention of IDA and GRZ to make the MCF a perpetual facility of long-term funds
for the Zambian private sector by allocating each year part of the Apex interest income to
a sinking fund, invested in international debt instruments, which will be sufficient to
service the IDA loan repayments. With current international rates, and accounting for the
MGS of the EDP credit and for possible depreciation of the US Dollar against the SDRs
provided by IDA, the initial annual allocation to the sinking fund will be 3.25% of the
amounts disbursed. The sinking fund will be managed by the Apex with BOZ acting as a
trustee for the investment portfolio. This sinking fund arrangement would relieve GRZ
from any financial burden, provided that the Apex would take the risks of only the viable
financial intermediaries and constantly monitor the relation between each PFI's exposure
and its financial strength.
3.    Institutional Development
5.22  Scope and Components.  The project will include technical assistance
components which aim to increase institutional capacity in the financial sector and
enhance the access and quality of market related information in Zambia. This technical
assistance comprises six components:
* training for commercial banks for project evaluation and export transactions (EDP-
BANK TA);
- matching grants to commercial banks to modernize their operations (MGS-BANK);
* technical assistance to ZNCB to restructure its operations (EDP-ZNCB TA);
* technical assistance to the Apex (EDP-Apex TA)
* technical assistance for implementation of MGS (EDP-MGS TA)
* technical assistance to BOZ to enhance its supervision capabilities (EDP-BOZ TA)
and;
* technical assistance to EBZ (EDP-EBZ TA)to establish a global information data base
with modern tools.
5.23 Training Courses in Financial Sector (EDP-BANK TA). EDP-BANK TA will
be offered in the form of two one-semester training courses, one in investment evaluation
and long and medium-term lending, and the other in export financing (for more detail and



26
the framework of terms of reference see Annex G). Each program will be conducted over
one three-month period, partly full time (with a component of several residential one
week intensive study periods) and partly evening classes. Such courses will be open to
all financial institutions to send senior and middle level managers; each of the 2 courses
will train between 20 and 30 participants. EDP-BANK TA program will finance the
participation of three teachers, with relevant expertise and training experience; one trainer
for each course will be a specialist in the specific area of the course, and will be
responsible for the course curriculum. The third trainer will teach more general high-
level banking subjects in both courses.  Local trainers and bankers will provide
additional, locally relevant, lectures. The Zambia Institute of Bankers has agreed to take
the responsibility for organizing and managing the training program. The local costs of
the training program will be financed by tuition fees per participant and paid by the
banks.
5.24 Matching Grant Scheme for Commercial Banks (MGS-BANK). A matching
grant scheme will be offered to support development efforts of Zambia's locally owned
commercial banks (for more detail and the framework of terms of reference see Annex G).
Zambia's commercial banking scene has a dualistic nature. On the one hand there are
commercial banks owned by multinational banks and on the other there are smaller banks
with local ownership. The first set of banks have access to their parents' facilities such as
training, expert help, operational manuals , etc. The second set of banks do not have
access to such facilities. MGS - BANK is intended to assist the locally owned banks to
modernize their operations. MGS - BANK will operate on the same basic principles as
the MGS. It will be demand-driven and the interested commercial banks will share the
costs. Total funds for MGS would be US$300,000 and the limit per grant is US$75,000.
5.25  Technical Assistance to ZNBC (EDP-ZNCB TA). The project would comply
with the request of GRZ and ZNCB management and, by providing technical assistance
to this vitally important institution for the Zambian financial markets (for more detail and
the framework of terms of reference see Annex G). This technical assistance will be in
support of the ongoing reorganization efforts. The project will finance two resident
advisors for a year to help the management in their efforts of modernizing and
restructuring the bank.
5.26  Technical Assistance to the Apex (EDP-APEX TA). The credit component of
the project requires an apex financial institution. At the moment, there is no credible
government owned institution to perform as an apex and BOZ rightly considers that
executing credit lines creates conflict of interest with its central responsibilities. GRZ is
currently trying to establish a new financial institution in Zambia to mobilize
concessionary funds and act as a wholesale bank dealing only with eligible financial
intermediaries. While GRZ is establishing the new institution which would become a
permanent apex, MCF credit lines will be executed by a private contractor who would
perform the functions of the Apex (for more detail and the framework of terms of
reference see Annex F and G). EDP -APEX TA is intended to cover the cost of such



27
administration should the pace of disbursements and the fee structure of the selected
contractor necessitate additional funds. Any remaining funds could be used to assist the
new Apex organization at its start-up. The details of costing and limits explained in
Annex F and G.
5.27 Technical Assistance for MGS Implementation (EDP-MGS TA). EDP-MGS
TA will cover the costs of implementation of MGS and MGS-BANK(for more detail and
the framework of terms of reference see Annex E and G). Thus, the costs of MGS
Executor and "free hand-holding advice" feature will be covered by this component.
5.28 Technical Assistance for BOZ (EDP - BOZ TA). BOZ requested technical
assistance to finance three external advisors to support its institutional strengthening in
the areas of regulation and supervision of financial institutions as well as training courses
for its own bank supervision staff (for more detail and the framework of terms of
reference see Annex G). This technical assistance would provide support for on-site and
off-site analysis of information on banks and for the development of regulations and
circulars to support the existing prudential legislation and to enforce the existing
regulations.
5.29  Technical Assistance to Export Board of Zambia (EDP-EBZ TA). The project
will help EBZ to establish an information brokering service to serve all Zambian
businesses (for more detail and the framework of terms of reference see Annex G). This
service will be provided on a cost-recovery fee-paying basis. EBZ already provides
library access and information search services. It is planning the natural extension into
information brokering, but has so far lacked the financial resources to fund the required
investment in equipment and training. EDP-EBZ TA will support a short-program of
specialized training for a new EBZ staff member in a developed country where such
services are widely available. The EU has already pledged to provide the hardware which
can be used for the planned services.
E.    Project Cost and Financing Plan
5.30  The proposed IDA credit of US$45 million equivalent would finance about 86%
of the total project cost. This figure includes a contingency of US$250,000 --for both
IDA and non-IDA funded portions-- in order to accommodate unexpected total project
costs for technical assistance and administration of MGS. These cost estimates are based
on the figures provided in Section D above and in Annexes E, F, and G.
5.31  Table 9 below provides the project cost financial plan. Private firms are expected
to contribute US$7.25 million to the project. Almost all of this contribution would be for
the matching grants and credit components of the project. These contributions are
estimated based on the ten percent minimum required contribution by the participating
enterprises. Potential PFIs expressed that they would normally ask at least 20 percent
equity participation for investment projects and finance about 70 percent of export orders.



28
However, they indicated that they would go as low as 10 percent for equity requirement
and finance about 90 percent of export orders depending on the borrower and on the
project.

F.    Project Implementation
5.32   The project will be implemented in a de-centralized fashion, with each set of
beneficiaries responsible for the relevant project component:
  Matching Grant Supervisory Committee (MGSC), which is already appointed, would
have responsibility for oversight of the Matching Grant Scheme -- including demand-
driven technical assistance to commercial banks, which will operate on the same
principles as other matching grants to the private sector. MCTI would appoint an
independent executor for MGS on the recommendation of MGSC and supervise the
contractor within the agreed operational guidelines (as outlined in Annex D).
Announcement of the short-list (in accordance with the IDA procurement rules) for
the hiring of the contractor was a condition for negotiation. The contractor will be
hired prior to the project effectiveness.
*  A private contractor will manage the credit component until a permanent Apex is
established. A temporary Apex Committee (which is already appointed) will assume
the responsibility of overseeing the activities of the private contractor. The Apex unit
(both temporary and the permanent entities) would have the responsibilities for
ensuring the efficient onlending of funds to solvent, well-managed financial
intermediaries with capacity for onlending to private companies and exporters. The
details of the agreed Apex arrangement are presented in Annex F. Announcement of
the short-list (in accordance with the IDA procurement rules) for the hiring of the
contractor was a condition for negotiations. The contractor will be hired prior to the



29
project effectiveness. Technical assistance components will be channeled directly to
the relevant recipient organizations (i.e. BOZ, Zambia Institute of Bankers, Zambia
National Commercial Bank, and the Export Board of Zambia).
The Permanent Secretary of MCTI will coordinate the implementation of the project.
IDA support for implementation is critical. A significant amount of supervision will be
required especially in the start-up phase of the project.
5.33 Financial Apex. MCF will be managed by a financial apex (Apex). The Apex
will provide lines of credit to eligible financial intermediaries. Funds will be on-lent to
final beneficiaries by these intermediaries at the intermediaries' own risk. The Apex will
not assume any risk other than the risk of failures of financial intermediaries. The Apex
will determine the eligibility of financial intermediaries and their credit line limits. It will
also constantly monitor the performance of the intermediaries. In addition to this, the
Apex will be responsible for: a) managing undisbursed funds in a prudent way with
maximum income feasible; b) disbursing funds when due, without delay; and c)
collecting promptly amounts due from the participating intermediaries. The Apex will
also be responsible for updating participating intermediaries on availability of funds, and
for promoting the lines of credit when funds are available. Once the permanent Apex is
in place it will be available for managing additional lines of credit from other sources.
5.34  The Apex will provide periodic performance reports which include detailed
disbursement data, data on eligible institutions and their limits on the credit lines and
availability of funds within those limits and other related data (as explained in the annex).
These reports will officially be forwarded to the Permanent Secretary of MCTI.
5.35  Matching Grant Supervisory Committee.  rhe overall supervision and
management responsibility of the MGS will lie in the Matching Grant Supervisory
Committee (MGSC). This Committee is already appointed by the MCTI and consists of
six representatives from the private sector organizations and a member representing the
government.
5.36  MGSC will recommend the selection of independent executors, supervise them
and evaluate and submit documents to the Government.
5.37  Procurement. Procurement arrangements are summarized  in Table  10.
Procurement under sub-loans will be carried out in accordance with commercial practices
of the private sector beneficiaries, which are acceptable as per Section 3.12 of
Procurement Guidelines under IBRD Loan and IDA Credits (January 1995, Revised
January and August 1996).

NIF-Not IDA-financed. Amounts in parenthesis are the amounts IDA financed.
5.38   Technical services under matching grants expecting to cost a maximum  of
US$75,000 per grant will also be procured by the beneficiaries on competitive basis
according to the principles and guidelines outlined in Annex E (Statement of Operating
Policies and Procedures (SPOP) for MGS).
5.39   Selection and employment of consultants for the technical assistance components
will be in accordance with the guidelines on the Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997. Specifically, Quality-and-Cost-
based Selection (QCBS) guidelines will be observed for EDP - ZNCB TA and Individual
Consultant guidelines will apply for EDP- BOZ TA and EDP BANK -TA. IDA's
standard "Requests for Proposals" will be used. However, the selection process for the
MGS executor and the Apex Contractor was started under the previous IDA guidelines
(see para. 5.41 below). Nonetheless, QCBS guidelines will be followed for the remainder
of the process. A general procurement notice (GPN) was advertised in Development
Business (DB) on December 16, 1996. Selection and employment of consultants by the
final borrowers of the subloans will be in accordance with the commercial practices of the
private sector beneficiaries. For consulting contracts exceeding US$200,000 each, if any,
competitive procedures will be used.
5.40 Prior Bank/IDA review of consulting services contracts awarded by MGSC, Apex
Committee, and hiring of consultants to deliver all technical assistance financed by the
project will be required.
5.41   During the post-appraisal mission, it was agreed that the GRZ will start the
process of hiring the MGS executor and the Apex Contractor in accordance with the IDA
rules effective at the time. It was further agreed that the negotiations will take place only



31
after reaching to short-list level. Following this agreement, GRZ has started the process
for hiring the MGS executor and the Apex Contractor through MGSC and the Apex
Committee. After the announcement of General Procurement Notice on December 16,
1996 issue of Development News, GRZ through the appointed committees advertised
these positions. During this process, the committees solicited the IDA comments on the
content of the advertisements and related material.  These committees evaluated
expressions of interest and concluded on the short-lists. These lists submitted to IDA for
a "no-objection" on February 18, 1997 were revised on March 4, 1997. A no-objection
note was issued on March 4, 1997. All throughout the process a procurement specialist
from the resident mission in Zambia assisted these committees to ensure the compliance
with the IDA rules.
5.42   Disbursement.  D)isbursemcnt categories and projected disbursements are
indicated in Annex 1. 1)isbursement anid withdrawal procedures are detailed in the World
Bank Disbursement Handbook (1992 edition). All disbursements are subject to the
conditions of the Development Credit Agreement and the procedures defined in the
disbursement letter. All applications to withdraw proceeds from the Credit account will
be fully docurmented. The relevant documentation for withdrawal is: (i) for matching
grants, MGS executor approved Statement of Expenditures according to policies and
procedures outlined in SPOP; (ii) for subloans under MCF, according to the contract
between the Apex and PFIs which also reflects the disbursement and repayment
schedules of the contract between PFIs and the final beneficiaries; and (iii) all other
expenditures will need a certified Statement of Expenditures by the corresponding
implementing agency except on contracts with ani estimated value of $100,000 or less for
consulting firms and $50,000 for individuals.
5.43  Special Account. A special account to be opened by GRZ will be utilized to
facilitate disbursements of eligible expenditures for goods and services. The authorized
allocation for the special account will be US$4.5 million, covering an estimated four
months of eligible expenditures financed by IDA. Upon credit effectiveness or as needed,
an amount of US$2 million would be deposited in the special account. Subsequent
deposits may be requested as needed not exceeding the total authorized amount of
US$4.5 million. Replenishment applications should be submitted regularly, preferably
monthly, after monthly bank statements are received and reconciled, with appropriate
supporting documents for eligible expenditures as required. To the extent possible, all of
IDA's share of eligible expenditures should be paid through the special account.
5.44  Audit and Reporting Requirements. All project accounts, the Special Accounts
Statement of Expenditures and financial accounts of participating financial intermediaries
will be audited at the end of each fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.
Copies of such audit reports will be forwarded to IDA within six months at the end of
each reporting period. MGSC, and the Apex will be responsible to maintain. and to cause
to maintain, adequate records and a project information system that would provide
quarterly information on disbursements satisfactory to IDA.



32
5.45   Quarterly progress reports under the project will be sent to the Permanent
Secretary of MCTI and to IDA by MGSC, the Apex Committee and the implementing
agencies for the technical assistance.  These progress reports follow the guidelines
detailed in technical annexes with respect to each project component
5.46  Project Implementation Support. This project will require significant IDA
resources to support for its implementation. Implementation support missions will work
closely with implementation institutions (MGSC, independent executors, the Apex,
MCTI, technical assistance beneficiaries, financial intermediaries, final beneficiaries of
the grants and credit lines). Implementation support will be particularly extensive during
the start-up phase. A detailed implementation support plan is provided in Annex K.
5.47   Mid-Term Review. An extensive review is expected to be completed by June 30,
1999 when the estimated first cycle (first cycle is the period when all the project
components are disbursed and the loans will be recovered from the final beneficiaries
within the loan maturity) comes to mid-point. The purpose of the review would be to
assess: (i) whether the project is being implemented satisfactorily; (ii) how its design and
functions can be improved; (iii) whether and how it is achieving its objectives as
discerned through monitorable indicators; and (iv) what factors beyond the scope of the
project have affected it in achieving its objectives. Prior to the review, MCTI will be
expected to prepare a detailed report, covering areas to be agreed upon with IDA. The
particulars of the mid-term review with respect to each project component are outlined in
respective technical annexes.
5.48  Project Completion. Since the MCF facility will continue to be recycled, the
project will effectively come to close at the end of the IDA maturity. However, for all
practical purposes the project will have a closure on June, 30, 2002. At this date a
detailed Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be written and the future
reporting and monitoring requirements with respect to the sinking fund arrangement will
be decided upon.
G.    Environment.
5.49  Zambia currently has three legislations in effect with respect to environmental
protection; Water Pollution Regulations, Waste Management Law, and Pesticides and
Toxic Substances Regulations. These legislations are enforced by the Environmental
Council of Zambia (ECZ). Mining operations also require various licenses under the
Mining Act which is enforced by the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Development.
Under the Water Pollution regulations all enterprises which discharge effluents need to
obtain license from ECZ.
5.50  Zambia does not have air and soil pollution regulations. There is currently a draft
of an air pollution regulation which aims at controlling emissions from stationary sources.



33
This regulation is expected to be in effect soon. There is also a draft of EIA guidelines
which are expected to be in effect within a year. EIA regulation, when becoming
effective, will strengthen and formalize project screening for environmental impact.
5.51  This project is not expected to present any specific environmental risks, and is
therefore rated B. Sub-projects financed under the project would be required to fully meet
existing health, safety and environmental guidelines in effect at a national or a local level,
and sub-borrowers would bear the responsibility for failure to comply with such
guidelines.
H.   Project Benefits and Risks
5.52  Project Benefits. There are four main benefits from the proposed project. First,
there will be a higher level of investment. Second, ongoing reorientation efforts by
Zambian firms will be aided and facilitated. Third, Zambia's financial institutions will be
strengthened. Four, Zambian firms will be able to access world-wide business data bases
and market intelligence. These benefits will have a secondary wave of benefits through
higher levels of employment and income. The project will address directly the urban
poverty issues by creating and preserving industrial jobs. It will indirectly address the
rural poverty issues by creating demand for various agricultural crops and by supporting
entrepreneurs in agri-businesses.
5.53  Many of the project benefits are difficult to measure in advance in quantitative
terms. Nevertheless the following table give the best estimates of the economic activity
that would be generated by the project.
Table 11: Summary Benefits in Terms of Economic Activity
Project Component                      Benefit
MGS, MGS-BANK                          Injection of US$7 million- know-how in
approximately 100 firms and six
commercial banks
ICF                                    Financing estimated total of US$40 million
of sixty investment projects for each cycle
of five years
EPF                                    Financing approximately 100 export orders
with an estimated value of US$15 million
per year.
According to a net present value estimation, based on the methodology described in
Annex L, the project would generate a net present value of US$12.60 million, with 17%
economic rate of return and at 13 % discount rate.



34
5.54  Project Risks. The project's principal risks are: (i) keeping the reform policies
on track and preserving a stable macroeconomic environment; (ii) MGSC and the Apex
Committee may fail to meet their responsibilities; (iii) private contractors for the
temporary Apex and MGS may fail to function properly; (iv) the bank supervision system
may not provide timely and reliable data; and (v) alternative funding at below market
rates could be provided by the Government or from other sources which undercuts the
support of the credit component.
5.55  Mitigating Factors. The above risks were assessed by the task team and
concluded that the risks involved are acceptable based on the following mitigating
factors:
*  ongoing economic policy dialogue through the IDA adjustment operations and the
IMF program provide sufficient technical advice and financial resources; the
Government has renewed its commitment to these programs after the elections;
*  MGSC is designed to have representatives from a wide spectrum of private sector
activities. Six out of seven members of MGSC are from private sector. An MCTI
representative is also a member of the committee. Furthermore, GRZ is required: (i)
to maintain this committee throughout the implementation of MGS; (ii) to seek
mutual agreement of IDA on any change in the membership of the committee; (iii) to
cause MGSC to have periodic mandatory meetings; and (iv) to cause MGSC to
coordinate closely with the IDA implementation support missions;
*  the Apex Committee is designed to have all the involved parties in the credit lines
represented. Among these members, three key government entities for the credit line
operation are represented at a very high level: (i) Deputy Governor of BOZ, whose
supervision department is also responsible to provide data to the Apex; (ii) Director of
Loans and Investments Department of MOF, who also maintains special accounts for
this project and other IDA operations; (iii) Permanent Secretary of MCTI. In addition
to these government members three key members represent the other stakeholders,
including Deputy Chairman of Banks' Association of Zambia, Chairman of Zambia
Associations of Chambers of Commerce and Industry and one other private sector
representative. GRZ is required: (i) to maintain this committee throughout the
implementation of the credit lines; (ii) to obtain approval of IDA for any change in
the membership of the committee; (iii) to cause Apex Committee to have periodic
mandatory meetings; and (iv) to cause Apex Committee to coordinate closely with the
IDA implementation support missions;
*  both private contractors are going to be selected with IDA prior review, which
includes IDA's approval of the contract contents clearly specifying performance
criteria and operational parameters. Contracts with these contractors may be canceled
due to non-performance by MGSC and the Apex Committee with IDA's consent;



35
* a technical assistance component (EDP-BOZ TA) is specifically designed to improve
the Bank Supervision Department of BOZ. This component will help to improve the
quality and timeliness of the supervision data. This component will also enable the
IDA implementation support missions to maintain effective dialogue with BOZ.
Furthermore, the presence of the Deputy Governor in the Apex Committee will
increase the attention of BOZ management to the supervision related issues and the
information needs of the Apex;
. ongoing dialogue within the donor community, increased cooperation, and
converging views on market determined interest rates will ensure that donor funded
subsidized credit will not enter into Zambia. The Task team has met and discussed
this issue with officials and representatives of the bilateral and multilateral donors.
These meetings concluded that excluding efforts to reach micro-scale entrepreneurs
occurrence of subsidized credit is not likely.
6. AGREEMENTS, ASSURANCES, CONDITIONS AND
RECOMMENDATION
A.    Assurances Received During Negotiations
6.39  The following assurances were obtained at negotiations:
* MGSC, which has already adopted the SPOP (Annex E) for MGS as its operational
guidelines, will not alter the SPOP without IDA's consent;
* The Apex Committee, which has already adopted the SPOP for credit lines (Annex F)
as its operational guidelines, will not alter the SPOP without IDA's consent;
* GRZ will maintain MGSC and the Apex Committee throughout the implementation
of the related project components and obtain the IDA's consent for any change in the
already appointed committees;
* The contracts between the Apex Committee and the contractor and the PFIs will
explicitly specify that the Apex Committee is acting as an agent on behalf of MOF;
* The contract between MGSC and the MGS contractor will explicitly specify that
MGSC is acting as an agent on behalf of MCTI;
. A detailed mid-term review will be undertaken within 30 months of project
effectiveness, but no later than June 30, 2000, with significant Government and
private sector participation, and analytical inputs, and actions agreed during the
review would be implemented expeditiously, in consultation with IDA; and
. A time table, consistent with Annex J, for hiring the consultants for technical
assistance components was agreed.



36
B.   Condition of Effectiveness
6.40 The following would be a condition of effectiveness: MGSC and the Apex
Committee will have entered into agreements with the contractors in accordance with the
IDA rules and procedures.
C.   Condition of Disbursement
6.41  The following would be the condition for disbursement for Credit Lines: no funds
will be disbursed from the credit line component of the project unless the Apex contractor
has evaluated interested financial intermediaries and certified at least one of those
institutions as PFI with IDA's consent. Disbursement for each PFI will take place when:
(i) PFI and the Apex Contractor have signed the PFI agreement which is outlined in the
IDA approved contract between the Apex Committee and the contractor; (ii) PFI has
agreed to make a sub-loan out of MCF according to the guidelines outlined in Annex F
and adopted as the official guidelines by the contractor; and (iii) PFI has applied to the
Contractor for the sub-loan according to the principles outlined in the PFI agreement.
D.   Recommendation
6.42  On the basis of the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would
be suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 32.6 million (US$45 million equivalent).

Matching Grant Scheme
ZAMBIA
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Matching Grant Scheme
Statement of Policies & Operating Procedures
1.    Objective & Essential Concepts
1.    Objective. The Matching Grant Scheme is a component of the Enterprise De-
velopment Project, funded by the World Bank/IDA. The overall objective of the project is
assist the Government of Zambia in its efforts to develop private enterprises. The specific
objective of the Matching Grant Scheme [MGS] is to help kickstart a supply response
within private enterprises to Zambia's program of economic reforms.
2.    Three Instruments. Experience elsewhere indicates that this firm-level supply
response depends on the speed at which each firm is able to build within itself the
different skills, know-how, expertise, and market understanding required by the fast-
changing economic realities external to the firm. An effective method for building these
capacities within the firm is to buy in external business development services. The
scheme will encourage an active market in business development services by means of a
combination of three instruments.
3.    The first instrument, the core of the scheme, consists of the provisions of service
user grants. Private enterprises will receive grants to cover half the costs of using
business development services. A broad range of services is covered, including market-
ing, production and general business strategy.
4.    The second instrument consists of providing to firms free hand-holding assistance
on how to go about making the best possible use of business development services, in
order to inject the skills, know-how, etc. that will build competitiveness in the changed
and liberalised economic environment they face. This complements the first instrument. It
is intended to build confidence in entering what is for many firms the new and unknown
activity of buying business development services.
5.     The third instrument further encourages an active Zambian market in business
development services by the provision of service developer grants. Local organisations
wishing to build their capacity to supply such services to the Zambian market will receive
grants to cover half the costs of developing such services. This is intended to match the
increased demand for services with a local response on the supply side of this market.

Matching Grant Scheme
6. This Statement of Policies and Operating Procedures [SPOP] specifies agreements
reached under the project on exactly how the MGS is to operate.
2.    Basic Structure of the Scheme
7.    Resources. The Scheme will have available under the project a total grant fund of
US$2.5m. Grants under the scheme are to be committed within the three-year operational
period of the project. After the available grant fund under this project has been fully
disbursed, or at the time of the mid-term review, whichever is sooner, a decision will be
taken as to possible further funding for the scheme.
8.    Additional Special-Purpose Sub-Funds. The $300,000 sub-fund for assistance
to banks is described separately in para. 5.23 of the SAR. IDA-funded projects in
agriculture and construction, plus others, may at a later date provide special-purpose
sub-funds, to be administered within the scheme, but to target specific groups of private
enterprises [ea. farmers, construction contractors], and to motivate specific activities [ea.
rehabilitation of construction equipment]. Special policies and operating procedures will
be developed for these sub-funds, as needed. However, these will be consistent with the
objectives and essential concepts described in this document.
9.    Level. Each individual grant to a recipient firm must be matched 50/50 by an
equal contribution by the firm itself. No preferential rates of support will be given to
particular sectors, types of service, firm size, firm category, or region. However, since the
scheme is deliberately designed to be demand-driven, the actual demand at the 50%
support level is, by its very nature, uncertain. This 50% level will therefore be reviewed
regularly, and may be reduced by recommendation of the Supervisory Committee, subject
to IDA approval.
10.   Supervisory Committee. The scheme will be supervised, on behalf of the
Government of Zambia, by a specially-constituted supervisory committee, consisting of
seven members. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Trade, acting for the
Government, has already appointed this committee. The committee consists of seven
members with six members of the committee representing the private sector and one
member representing the government.  The Government agreed to maintain this
composition within the committee so as to allow a wide ownership of the project by the
private sector. The representatives of the private sector nominated by the various private
sector organizations. However, these members will act in their individual capacities and
have the fudiciary responsibility to all the sectors. The current members were nominated
by ZACCI, ZAM, SIAZ, TAZ, ZEGA and Lusaka Chambers of Commerce.
11.   Initial Committee Responsibility. The first task of the supervisory board will be
to approve this SPOP. Once then endorsed by the IDA, this SPOP will then direct the
operation of the scheme.

Matching Grant Scheme
12.   Management Contract. The whole scheme, including its three instruments, will
be run under a term contract by a management contractor, providing the services of one
internationally-recruited scheme manager, to be backed up by local office support,
providing local contacts, office facilities plus accounting and treasury services. It is
expected that the contractor would also be able to provide linkages to overseas
organizations useful for sourcing specialist service providers.  The Government of
Zambia, as recipient of IDA funding, will be responsible for selecting and appointing the
contractor, by means of competitive tender. The contract will specify, amongst other
details, the arrangements to be made by the contractor for dealing with an expected lag of
disbursements after approvals of around six months.
13.   Supervisory Arrangements. The scheme manager will submit to the supervisory
board annual work plans, followed by quarterly progress reports detailing achievement of
these work plans. The initial work plan will detail specific activities aimed at achieving
wide publicity and exposure for the scheme, to make its benefits known to as many
potential users as possible. The supervisory board meeting schedule will link into the
IDA project implementation support schedule, as defined in Annex K of the SAR.
Normally, the board will meet once each calendar quarter.
3.    Eligibility Criteria for Grant Support
14.   This section of the SPOP defines "eligible firm," "eligible business development
plan," "eligible activity," and "eligible expenditures.""
15.   The Eligible Firm. For service user grants, only private firms are eligible.
Parastatals, government entities and other firms where the government or its agencies
have effective management control, by means of being the largest shareholder, or by
means of having a board majority, are not eligible. Firms in all manufacturing and
services sectors of the economy are eligible, with the following restrictions. Private firms
that undertake farming are eligible, so long as they are involved in activities that add
value beyond the farm gate [ea. packing of flowers for export, processing of coffee].
16.   For service development grants, any legal entity not receiving government
funding towards its regular operating costs is eligible. This is intended to include business
and industry associations, developing services to sell to their members, and to include
NGO's, developing services to sell to their target groups of businesses.
17.   For commercial bank grants, any commercial bank established in Zambia with
full compliance to all prudential laws and regulations and has no affiliation to any
international bank is eligible.

Matching Grant Scheme
18.   The Eligible Business Development Plan. To be eligible for grant support, the
essential criterion is that the applicant firm must have written down a realistic plan for the
development of its business activities, taking it from its present situation to some planned
future situation, representing a positive development for the firm and its economic health.
Except in the case of MGS-BANK, there is no requirement that the specifics of the plan
are to be "approved" or vetted by any expert or committee. However, the plan must
demonstrate that the firm has properly considered the following essential planning issues:
* why one particular development direction was chosen instead of others; on what
assumptions this direction depends; and why this development direction can be
considered realistic and achievable;
*  what steps are required for that development;
*  what resources are likely to be needed within these steps, and where will they
come from;
*  how long will the process take; and what benefits are to be expected.
The degree of detail required in a particular application will depend on the size and
complexity of the application. A small firm applying for a $50 grant to send an employee
on a short technical course would, for instance, only be expected to submit a one-page
plan, explaining how such an activity could reasonably be expected to benefit the planned
development of the business. In contrast, a large firm applying for a grant of $50,000
would be expected to address all the above points in considerable detail.
19.   Plans for Service Development Grants. In the particular case of grants for
service development, the scheme will support the development of new or existing
services aimed at assisting client firms in areas relevant to business development. In this
context, a plan should, in addition to the general requirements, demonstrate that the
services to be developed are likely to be saleable, and are likely to assist the target group
of firms in developing their businesses. (For instance, an NGO developing knitting
courses for rural women would probably not be supported, unless it could be
demonstrated that it was targeting women who intended to undertake this activity on a
commercial basis, and that it was addressing their needs in basic business skills. An
NGO developing a service to assist village businesses in applying for loans probably
would be eligible, once it could be demonstrated that this was indeed a binding constraint
on the present development of these target businesses).
20.   Pre-investment Studies. In the particular case of support for pre-investment
work, the requirement that the plan be realistic will mean that, additionally, the applicant
should demonstrate a capacity to raise the level of funding likely to be required. So, for
instance, a promoter of a multi-million investment proposal, having resources for equity
capital of only a few thousand would not be supported with a grant. The proportion of



-45-                              Annex E
Matching Grant Scheme
funds being utilised for pre-investment studies will be carefully monitored (see para. 42.).
If over-usage of funds for pre-investment studies becomes a concern, this SPOP may be
modified to curb, or even eliminiate, further approvals for this purpose (see para. 51. on
amending this SPOP).
21.   One Plan per Firm. Grants are intended to motivate new behaviours. They are
therefore deliberately temporary. Once one eligible plan had been implemented, the firm
concerned would thereafter receive no further grant support. Any further usage made by
the firm of support services would have to be paid for at full market prices. However, free
hand-holding advice could continue assisting such firms throughout the duration of the
scheme.
22.   The Eligible Activity. Any usage of an external service which is charged for, and
which can reasonably be expected to contribute to the achievement of an eligible business
development plan, itself will constitute an eligible activity. The following examples of
service activities that would normally be eligible under this definition are provided purely
for guidance. The list is not intended to be exhaustive.
-  In-factory consultancy and short-term contract management services, say up to
six months in duration per introduced expert, would normally be eligible, but new
permanent staff appointments would not. The length of time for which temporary
contract management could be supported would depend on a case being made as
to how long the required transfer of know-how, skills, etc. could reasonably be
expected to take.
-  Consultancy or short-term contract management assistance directed specifically
at improving labour productivity or yields on raw materials would normally be
eligible.
*  Assistance in improving in-house capabilities in design-related techniques such
as pattern-making, prototyping, grading, sizing, counter-sampling, etc., would
normally be eligible. Buying in a set of designs for one season only, with no
longer-term enhancements aimed for, would normally not.
* The expenses of exposure tours for factory personnel, to view alternative techniques
and technologies in factories elsewhere would normally be eligible, as would market
exploration tours by marketing personnel, to explore new export market
opportunities.
23.   The Three Typical Stages of a Plan. Typically, a plan aimed at, say, expanding
sales might take a firm through these three stages: (This is provided for guidance, but is
not a requirement for eligibility)



-46-                                Annex E
Matching Grant Scheme
* investigation of the target market, be it domestic or foreign, typically starting with
desk research or limited phone research, followed then by field interviewing, either
carried out by the firm's staff or by an outside service supplier;
* supply package adaptation, on the basis of information collected from the market, in
order to bring what is being supplied presently into line with customer preferences,
and to meet existing competition; for instance through changes in product design,
rationalising production to reduce costs, or through improved quality assurance;
* active selling' with the adaptation completed, of the improved supply package.
24.   Reaching  the Very  Small Firms. Very small firms can usually  only
economically justify very small usages of business development services. Usually, the
simpler and smaller the business, the less it can economically benefit from buying in
specialist know-how, skills, etc. Under the scheme, very small firms are expected to make
use primarily of standardised and group-targeted services [e.g. open training courses],
rather than bespoke services [e.g. in-factory consultancy]. It is expected that the scheme
will reach them primarily through the efforts of business associations and NGO's. These
efforts will be supported directly by means of service development grants to such
associations and NGO's, and indirectly by means of service user grants to the buyers of
their services.
25.   Defined Deliverables from an Eligible Activity. For each eligible activity for
which grant support is being sought, the firm concerned will be expected to define at least
one "deliverable," the sight of which will verify that the activity had indeed taken place,
as described. Depending on the circumstance, a defined deliverable might consist, for
instance, of a detailed engineering drawing, or a prototype, incorporating quality
improvements; a set of standard times developed for a production process, against which
productivity could be assessed; or an externally commissioned market report. Normally, a
deliverable would consist of an output produced for good reasons anyhow under the
contract between buyer and seller of services, rather than an output produced solely for
verification purposes.
4.    Eligible Expenditures.
26.   Service Usage Costs. Expenditures on service fees, and expenditures on travel
and incidental expenses charged at cost, incurred wholly and exclusively on an eligible
activity, will be eligible for 50% grant support. Salaries for staff employed by the
supported firm are not eligible, nor are recurrent costs such as royalty fees. No expendi-
tures on hardware can be supported, even in cases where equipment or instrumentation
purchases constitute a significant expenditure within a firm-level plan. (Note that
subsidies on hardware purchases tend to be more sensitive to countervailing action by
trading partners than is cost-sharing on business development services)



-47-                              Annex E
Matching Grant Scheme
27.   Limits per Recipient. No single recipient firm may receive total service user
grants in excess of a cumulative limit of US$75,000. No single recipient entity may
receive total service development grants in excess of a cumulative limit of US$25,000. In
case of commercial banks the limit per bank is set at US$50,000. These limits would be
reviewed were additional resources to become available to the scheme over and above the
initial US$2.5m for general MGS and US$300,000 for MGS-BANK.
28.   Exclusion. Expenditures on services provided by the firm  undertaking the
management contract to run the MGS, or by associated firms, will not be eligible for
support.
29.   Supplier Selection. The choice of service supplier will be made by the recipient
firm, and will not be restricted to suppliers on any central register. However, the
management unit will seek to satisfy themselves as to the supplier's competence for the
task intended, and that there is a genuine arms-length commercial relationship between
supplier and user.
30.   Over-Charging and Collusion. The MGS management unit will also seek to
satisfy themselves that fee rates being charged for services are broadly in line with market
realities, particularly in a case where the service supplier is not previously known to the
management unit. In exceptional cases, where the management unit has real grounds for
suspecting over-charging or collusion, grant support can be made conditional on an
acceptable process of competitive bidding between at least three technically qualified
contenders.
S.    The Recipient's Contribution
31.   Applications for grant support are accepted on the explicit understanding that the
recipient entity will match the 50% grant contribution from the scheme with an equal
50% contribution from its own resources. This is to ensure a strong sense of ownership
remains with the recipient, and a strong motivation to obtain value for money in the
recipient's own terms from the activity supported.
32.   Group Activities. Group service-using activities covering more than one firm, for
instance those sponsored by trade associations or suppliers of services, will be supported.
But applications will be evaluated separately for each individual firm. In particular, in
order to ensure commitment by each supported firm, grant support will have to be
matched by a direct 50% contributions by each participating firm to the costs of
providing group-based services to that particular firm. Service user grants could not be
provided to match contributions from association funds or public funds.



-48-                              Annex E
Matching Grant Scheme
33.   Avoiding Double Subsidies. Similarly, usage of non-commercial service
suppliers will be on the basis that double subsidising of activities is to be avoided. In such
cases, grants will be calculated so that the total subsidy element from all sources external
to the firm does not exceed 50%.
6.    Processing the Individual Grant
34.   Approval of Applications. The scheme manager will be delegated the authority
to approve all applications (except for MGS-BANK) for grant support that meet the
eligibility criteria specified in this SPOP. The Scheme manager will seek IDA's no-
objection for grants to commercial banks funded under MGS-BANK.
35.   Rejections. Since virtually no technical evaluation is required in the approvals
process, and since all eligibility criteria are designed to involve straightforward yes-or-no
decisions, outright rejections are expected to be rare. However, any rejections of
proposals are to be delivered in person to the firm concerned by the scheme manager, to
give an opportunity for discussion of possible next steps. The intention is that every
applicant will be given the maximum opportunity and assistance required to enable it to
benefit from the scheme.
36.   Role of Supervisory Committee. All approvals and rejections by the scheme
manager will be considered by the next meeting of the supervisory board ex-post, to
allow it to give guidance on future approvals policy, where needed. The board may only
revoke an approval already granted by the scheme manager in the event that false or
misleading information is determined by the board to have been provided within an
application. Any such case is to be reported in detail to the IDA within one week of the
board decision.
7.    Monitoring Compliance
37.   Letter of Agreement. On receiving approval for grant support, each recipient will
be required to sign a letter of agreement. This will bind the recipient to present defined
deliverables for viewing by the management unit. The unit will have the right to view
deliverables, but not to take them off the client firm's premises, nor to take copies or
photographs. All outputs from supported activities will remain the exclusive property of
the supported firm, with commercial confidentiality fully preserved. Contractor staff will
respect the commercial confidentiality of all deliverables, outputs and information
supplied during contact with the firm.
38.   Supporting Documentation. The letter of agreement will also bind the recipient
to back up all claims for the reimbursement of half of eligible expenditures with receipted
invoices/vouchers for all fees and incidental expenses covered, so as to enable the



-49-                              Annex E
Matching Grant Scheme
management unit to verify that the expenditures had indeed been made. This
documentation, plus the agreed deliverables, must be retained for possible inspection by
auditors or IDA supervision missions for three years after each receipt of a grant.
39.   Impact Data. The letter of agreement will also bind the recipient to provide
continuing sales revenue data, sufficient to track the direct impact of the grant support on
the enhanced competitiveness of the firm, and thus to monitor the achievement by the
scheme of its impact target. The letter will also commit the recipient to co-operate fully
with the annual financial and operational audits and the sample surveys to be conducted
later to evaluate impact. Each recipient will also be obliged to complete, after each
supported activity, a brief one-page "feedback form," indicating the level of client satis-
faction achieved by the service supplier.
8.    Grant Payment
40.   Basis of Payment.  Payment of grants will be on a re-imbursement basis,
conditional on sight of defined deliverables, and of receipted invoices/vouchers for
eligible expenditures, certified by a legal representative of the firm.
41.   Authorization. Payments of grants out of the MGS Special Account to be set up
for the purpose will require three signatures: that of the scheme manager, plus those of
two supervisory board members.
9.    Monitoring Scheme & Contractor Performance
42.   Indicators. Scheme and contractor performance during the period will be
evaluated primarily with respect to activities carried out, based on annual work plans
approved in advance by the supervisory board. Scheme impact will be evaluated
primarily with respect to eventual incremental annual sales revenue achieved per unit of
grant. The target set for the scheme is that, for every US$1 spent on grants, supported
firms achieve incremental and continuing annual sales revenues, directly attributable to
scheme support, of US$2/year, and that this impact be discemable within one year of
grant receipt. In other words, the scheme aims for a 200% p.a. return on grants in terms
of revenue.
43.   Contractor Performance. As part of the contract, the management contractor
will be committed to develop, and obtain board approval of, an annual work plan for each
twelve-month period of operation of the contract. This will specify in detail the activities
to be carried out in order to launch and promote the scheme, and to manage it under the
terms of this manual. The work plan will specify the man-day inputs for each activity,
and the individual responsibilities within the contractor's team. It will also specify the
number of approvals and disbursements expected for each quarter, and will specify what



-50-                              Annex E
Matching Grant Scheme
is to be done, in each quarter, to assess the ongoing impact of the scheme. It will
elaborate in addition how the contractor intends to reach smaller firms and firms in
outlying areas [see para. 45]. Progress made in achieving this plan, plus modifications
proposed to the plan, would be reported to the board for each operational quarter, to be
submitted within 10 days of the end of each operational quarter. Modifications would
then have to be agreed with the board. The quarterly report will elaborate in detail on all
planned activities and indicators, giving variances and reasons.  It would analyse
approvals for the period, and cummulatively, by industry, by region, by type of activity
supported, and by firm size.
44.   Contractor Financial Standing. The contractor will be expected to present to
the Supervisory Committee, ahead of each twelve-month operating period, evidence of
continuing good financial standing as a company, usually in the form of an auditor's
opinion on annual business accounts. This evidence will also be required ahead of
contract signing.
45.   Contract Termination. In the event that the contractor fails to perform to the
satisfaction of the Supervisory Committee and/or IDA, the contract may be terminated by
the Supervisory Committee at any time, giving one month's notice, and subject to the
prior approval for the move by IDA. In addition, the contract may be terminated if, after
two years of full operation, the demand for scheme support is substantially less than an-
ticipated. Specifically, if approvals in the first two years of full operation fail to reach
50% of the funds available in the scheme, the contract and the scheme itself may be
terminated, again subject to IDA approval.
46.   Final Impact Survey. The comprehensive evaluation of scheme impact will be
carried out by means of a sample survey of recipient firms, one year after the final grant
disbursement, but to be completed no later than five months after project closing date.
This timing would enable the results to be incorporated into the Implementation
Completion Report for the project. The survey will be contracted out by the board to an
independent specialist, this choice to be approved in advance by the IDA. The survey will
include comprehensive site visits to a minimum of 10% of recipients, and will seek not
only to evaluate direct incremental impact on sales revenue, but also to gather
information on indirect impact, such as on customer orientation, quality assurance,
continuing product development, employee motivation, company image. It will also
specifically seek to evaluate the level of satisfaction firms express with respect to the
service quality provided by the contractor, and will also seek to evaluate the willingness
of firms to continue using specialist services after scheme support, at full market prices.
47.   Interim Impact Survey. Although the final impact survey will allow all stake-
holders to evaluate properly the eventual impact of the scheme, these stake-holders will
also require an interim evaluation somewhat earlier. A project-wide mid-term review is
planned for latest June 30, 1999. At least one month prior to the review, the supervisory
board is to furnish a detailed report on the progress to date with the scheme. The board



-51-                              Annex E
Matching Grant Scheme
will therefore conduct a smaller representative interim sample survey, to achieve an
interim evaluation of impact within this report. This, too, will be carried out by an
independent specialist, but will be based on only around ten site visits.
48.   Outreach & Promotion. Contractor performance in meeting one of the key
challenges of the scheme, namely reaching out effectively to the smaller potential client
firms, and those in outlying areas, will be monitored particularly carefully by the board.
(It is anticipated that the contractor will mount several launch workshops in business
centres around the country, followed by regular follow-up workshops around the country
targeting NGO's and local associations or groupings of firms).
10.   Accounts & Audit Procedures
49.   Project Account. MGSC will open a project account which will receive funds
from project's special account for the expenditures authorized under MGS and MGS-
BANK. The payments for the executor's fee will also be made out of this account.
50.   Auditing.  The MGS scheme will require an annual financial audit by
independent auditors acceptable to the IDA, with certified copies of audited accounts to
be submitted within six months of each fiscal year. In addition to their normal financial
verification work, the auditors will be required to verify that the quarterly operational
reports provided by the contractor represent a true and fair representation of activities
undertaken and results so far achieved. The scheme will also require an annual opera-
tional audit, to assess whether objectives are being met, and procedures respected.
Appointment of contractors for these operational audits, plus the form and Terms of
Reference are again to be satisfactory to the IDA. The supervisory committee will
therefore propose, ahead of scheme start-up, these audit details, and submit them to the
IDA, for approval.
51.   Management Accounts and Records. Administration of the scheme by the
management unit will require detailed internal record-keeping for management purposes.
However, internal record-keeping arrangements will need to be approved as acceptable to
both the appointed financial and operational audit contractors. To allow the management
unit to function effectively, these arrangements will be submitted to the audit contractors
within three months after scheme start-up, with agreement on acceptable arrangements to
be concluded at the latest one month after submission. In the event of delays, or failure to
agree, the supervisory committee will have the authority to approve record-keeping
arrangements as being acceptable for audit purposes.

11.   Amendments to this Manual
52.   This manual may be modified as required, so as to achieve the objective of the
scheme, but only by recommendation of the supervisory board, with subsequent endorse-
ment by the IDA. The manual should seek to preserve a balance between achieving the
objectives of the scheme and minimising leakage on the one hand, and preserving
simplicity, automaticity and transparency in the approvals and supervision process on the
other.

Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
ZAMBIA
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
Statement of Policies and Operating Procedures
1.    Introduction. The Credit lines of the Multi-Purpose Credit Facility (MCF) are to
provide financing through commercial banks and other licensed private financial
institutions to enterprises in the form of medium- and long-term credit for investment as
well as a short-term credit line for the production of exports. The expectation is that by
alleviating the financial constraint to enterprises, many can grow on a sustainable basis
and thus generate exports and employment. This Statement of Policies and Operating
Policies (SPOP) specifies agreements reached under the project on exactly how MCF is
to operate.
1.    Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
2.    Objective. Any form of term finance is severely limited in Zambia. More
specifically, uncertainty and the term structure of interest rates denominated in Kwacha
have led to limited and prohibitively priced credit options for financial institutions to
fund the investment and permanent working capital needs of their customers. The
commercial banks have also refrained from using foreign exchange denominated deposits
for lending purposes (such as against export orders) due to uncertainty of the permanence
of such funds. Foreign exchange deposits have been interest insensitive in terms of
maturity structure and the deposit holders have been anxious to ask the banks to transfer
these amounts to overseas on any development that might erode the confidence in the
openness of capital and current account transactions. Other factors beyond this project's
scope that have contributed to constraints on institutional finance include a decline in
financial institution lending to the private sector reflecting limited aggregate demand for
credit due to high interest rates and higher risk free returns on GRZ Treasury Bills.
3.    This component would provide two credit facilities aggregating US$40 million to
an Apex institution which would on-lend the funds to qualifying retail intermediaries.
The line of credit for terms loans would aggregate US$30 million whereas the other line
for export production would aggregate US$10 million.  The Apex institution's
assumption of credit risk would be confined to the retail intermediaries, whose eligibility
and participation would be monitored according to guidelines established in the Project
and in cooperation with the Bank of Zambia's Department of Bank Supervision. The
retail intermediaries, in turn, would assume the credit risk associated with enterprises
accessing the sub-loans.



-54-                              Annex F
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
4.    Apex Institution.   An Apex Financial Institution would be needed to manage
MCF. The Government is currently in the process of creating such an institution. In
order to expedite the project's implementation, a temporary arrangement was agreed to as
explained in Section II of this SPOP. The temporary arrangement will transfer all of its
portfolio and operations and cease to exist when the permanent apex whose
capitalization, organizational structure, and staffing were found to be satisfactory by IDA
is established.
5.    The organization and terms of reference of the Apex would ensure adequate
internal capacity to appraise commercial banks and other financial institutions in order to
determine their creditworthiness, and hence their eligibility to borrow funds from the
Facility. The Apex would ensure such capacity by accessing on a periodic basis data
collected by the regulatory authorities as well as published data. The Apex would
evaluate applications for participation in the Facility from all licensed commercial banks
and other licensed financial intermediaries. In the case of commercial banks, compliance
with BOZ prudential regulations as well as meeting the minimum capital requirements
scheduled to become effective at year-end 1996 would be minimum conditions for
participation. In the case of other financial intermediaries, including investment banks
and leasing companies, similar minimum capital requirements and additional criteria for
participation would be established by the Apex. To avoid un-prudent risks, the Apex will
limit the maximum exposure to any PFI to one time the PFI's capital (first plus second
tier). The standard loan agreements between the Apex and the PFIs will also include (i)
repayment by the PFIs of all amounts due, without reference to the final borrower actual
repayment; and (ii) the Apex right to the commitments and collateral of the all the final
borrowers in case the PFIs fails to make repayments as scheduled.
6.    Operational Guidelines. Chart 1 below summarizes operational guidelines of
the credit lines. The general operational guidelines involving PFIs are explained in detail
in Section II (Institutional Arrangements and Guidelines)

enterprises
Application Requirements  Application by the PFIs to the Apex would be a summary form providing data
for sub-loans             on the name, size and sector of the enterprise and nature of the sub-loan,
including percentage of total investment of activity financed, disbursement
schedule, loans duration, grace periods granted and the repayment schedule.
Detailed financial loan application data and analysis would not be included.
Applications from the borrowing enterprise to the PFI would be at the
discretion of the PFI, subject to BOZ and other prudential regulations.
Applications of PFIs will also contain a consent letter to BOZ which indicates
that they forego any confidentiality requirement imposed on BOZ with respect
to releasing any information about their financial position to Apex as long as
the loan was not fully repaid or PFI maintains an operational credit line with
the Apex.
Eligible Sectors          All sectors excluding pure agricultural activities for which there exists current
IDA financed facilities and pure trading and speculative real estate
transactions.   Purchase or take-over of existing businesses, including
privatization of parastatals will also be excluded.
Eligible Expenditures    The Apex would not finance the refinancing of existing loans by the borrowers
to the PFIs. Enterprises with non-performing loans in any PFI could not be
granted loans under the Facility.
Audit Requirements        *  Apex accounts audited an-nually by CPAs acceptable to IDA, subject to
additional random checks;
*  Random ex-post reviews of individual sub-loans to assess compliance
with procurement and disbursement requirements
PFIs must submit their audited annual reports and quarterly reports to the
Apex.
Procurement              Procurement according to IDA guidelines as per para. 5.37 and 5.39.
Disbursement              In order to ensure that the Apex will have funds to disburse promptly, the
Apex will submit a cash-flow projection to IDA, after review by GRZ not
later than the middle of each month for the next month. The government
will request from IDA that the Special Account be replenished accordingly.
Interest Rate Charged by  PFIs would be fully free to charge a rate commensurate with the costs and
PFIs to sub-borrowers    risks of sub-loans.

Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
A. Investment Line of Credit
Maturity of Sub-loans    Enterprises are expected to borrow for investment in fixed assets. The PFI
would be required to borrow from the Apex at the same maturity as the
funds to be on-lent to firms. The maturity of individual sub-loans would
range between 3 and 7 years, at the discretion of the PFIs.
Grace period             6-17 months, to be limited to one fifth of the duration of the sub-loan.
Accrued interest may be charged during the grace period or be added to the
principal during the grace period. The granting of the grace period, and the
treatment of interest is left to the discretion of the PFIs.
Maximum Sub-loan Size    US$3 million, subject to periodic change as prescribed by the Apex in
consultation with IDA. This limit applies to a loan to either one enterprise
or to one group of enterprises. This limit applies to a loan intermediated by
one PFI or by a syndicate of PFIs as well as to total borrowing by one group
from all PFIs. One enterprise or one gorup of enterprises may borrow for
differrent purposes provided that their outstanding loan balance with the
facility does not exceed US$3 million.
Minimum Contribution by  At the discretion of the financial intermediary, but, at a minimum, at least
Sub-Borrower             10% of the investment financed.
Sub-Loan Documentation   Each sub-loan would require a project summary to be submitted by the PFI
to the Apex containing, at a minimum, the following information: (i) Name
and address of borrower; (ii) sector of enterprise; (iii) number of employees;
(iv) description of financing and sub-project; and (v) the maturity and term
of financing; (vi) disbursement and repayment schedules. The Apex will not
conduct any feasibility analysis of the sub-projects and will accept the PFI's
assessment.
Environmental Impact     Sub-loans to finance green-field projects will be made only after securing
necessary licenses required by the existing laws and regulations. Sub-loans
which will finance activities of existing manufacturing companies will be
made subject to the sub-borrower's representation that the company is
currently in compliance with the existing environmental regulations.
B. Export Pre-Shipment Line of Credit
Maturity of Sub-loans    Enterprises could use funds for working capital to expand production to
meet firm export orders. The PF1 would be required to on-lend at the same
maturity as the funds it borrowed from the Apex. The maturity of individual
sub-loans would range between 3 and 9 months and would be repaid lump-
sum from the export revenue.
Grace Period             None
Maximum Sub-loan Size    US$1 million, subject to periodic change as prescribed by the Apex in
consultation with IDA. This limit applies to a loan to either one enterprise
or to a group of enterprises. This limit applies to a loan intermediated by one
PFI or by a syndicate of PFIs as well as to total borrowing by one group
from all PFIs. One enterprise or one group of enterprises may borrow to
finance different export transactions provided that their outstanding loan
balance with the facility does not exceed US$1 million.

Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
Minimum Contribution by  As determnined by the financial intermediary, but, at a minimum, at least
Sub-Borrower             10% of the cost of producing the financed export order.
Sub-Loan Documentation   Each sub-loan would require a summary of the export order to be submitted
by the PFI to the Apex containing, at a minimum, the following information:
(i) Name and address of borrower; (ii) sector of enterprise; (iii) number of
employees; and (vi) a maturity of the sub-loan. The Apex will not conduct
any feasibility analysis of the sub-projects and will accept the PFI's
assessment.
C. Revolving Fund Arranger-ent
Sinking Fund             From the Interest charged by the Apex to the PFIs an amount will be
allocated to create a sinking fund. The sinking fund will be managed by the
Apex, with BOZ acting as trustee in such a way that the annual allocations
and the interest earned on the investments in the international capital
markets will be sufficient to cover all payments due to IDA on the EDP loan
(including the grant element). With current interest rates at around 5%, a
sinking fund allocation of 3.25% will cover all payments to IDA, including a
reserve for Dollar/SDR rate of exchange reserve and the grant element. The
residual interest income of the Apex after allocations to the sinking fund and
the allocation for Apex administration will be recycled for additional
lending at the same terms and conditions as above.
Repayment of Principal To be financed from the Sinking Fund
and Service Charges on
IDA Credit
Use of Excess Balance, if To be recycled by the Apex for additional on-lending
any, in the Sinking Fund
upon full repayment of the
IDA Credit
2      Institutional Arrangements and Guidelines
5.     Introduction. The purpose of the institutional arrangements and guidelines detailed
below is to ensure as far as possible that resources in the Project are intermediated through
only those participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) which can be reasonably determined
to be solvent and well-managed in accordance with sound financial practices and which
operate in a way in which they will allocate funds productively to the private sector. The
Apex in consultation with IDA would be responsible for qualifying institutions based on an
evaluation of the solvency, financial position and intermediation capacity of each
prospective PFI. To avoid duplication the support of the BOZ's Department of Bank
Supervision will be used to maximum degree possible.



-58-                             Annex F
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
A.   The Apex Institution
6.    Functional Responsibilities. The Multiple-purpose Credit Facility (MCF) will be
managed by an apex institution (Apex).  The Apex will have the following
responsibilities:
(a) Request and obtain initial funds from the MCF account, opened by the Government of
Zambia which contains funds forwarded from project's special account, when initial
disbursements commence, and when additional disbursements are required due to
disbursements to granting of sub-loans, request and obtain additional disbursements.
(b) Approve the eligibility of Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs) and set limits
for total exposure to each based on the PFIs' capital. Update periodically the list and
exposure limits of PFIs
(c) Receive, process and approve applications from PFIs for sub-loans from the MCF.
(d) Disburse MCF funds to the PFIs in accordance with the disbursement schedule of the
approved sub-loans.
(e) Collect from the PFIs the amounts due from the sub-loans.
(f) Manage the amounts un-disbursed, from the original IDA disbursements and from
repayments of sub-loans by PFIs, for safety and maximum return.
(g) Promote the lines of credits with the PFIs and other financial institutions that are
eligible to be PFIs, and the private sector in general as potential final borrowers.
(h) Collect from PFIs, process and provide GRZ and IDA with the periodic reports
requested by them.
(i) Manage the sinking fund, in collaboration with BOZ as a trustee to secure the amounts
for repayment to IDA of principal and interest on the loan as due according to the IDA
loan agreement.
7.    Principles of Apex Operations. The following is a brief outline of the basic
principles of execution of the above mentioned primary functional responsibilities of the
Apex:
(a) Request and obtain funds from the MCF special account in accordance with
its disbursement schedule against the sub-loans approved by PFIs: With the EDP project
becoming effective, GRZ will open a project account for the MCF component of the
project and deposit any withdrawal for MCF purposes from the Special Account
mentioned in para. 5.42 of SAR to this account for the use of Apex. When the amounts



-59-                              Annex F
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
available in the project account is not sufficient for meeting next month's disbursement
schedule to the PFIs, the Apex will request replenishment of the project account.
Subsequent to the Apex's request, the government will either replenish the project
account by accessing the special account or in the case of lack of funds in the special
account, apply to IDA for the replenishment of the special account with the required
documentation under the development credit agreement.
(b) Approve the eligibility of Participating Financial Intermediaries (PF1s) and
set limits for total exposure to each, based on the PFIs' capital. Update periodically the
list and exposure limits of PFIs: GRZ and IDA intend to allow as many banks and other
financial institutions as possible to become PFIs, as long as they qualify for participation
based on their financial strength. As a rule, all commercial banks licensed, to operate in
Zambia will be eligible--excluding those specialized state owned banks such as DBZ,
Exim--as long as they meet BOZ prudential regulation requirements, namely minimum
capital requirements, capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratios, and as long as BOZ is
satisfied with their portfolio standing, their procedures for evaluating loan applications
and with their allocations to bad-debt provisions and their accounting policies for
suspension of recording interest as income when loan repayments are in arrears. For each
approved PFI, a limit of total exposure will be set, based on its net-worth (capital and
reserves). To allow for competition between the banks, the limits will be set in a way that
will allow the total exposure limit to be significantly higher than the MCF amount. For
the initial limit, an amount equal to 100% of total first and second tier capital is
suggested. The eligibility of the PFIs and additional financial institutions will be
reviewed and adjusted periodically, at least once a year when the PFIs publish their
annual audited financial statements. Immediate changes in eligibility for new loans will
be implemented when BOZ provides indications of changes in the financial standing of
PFIs. To facilitate prompt adjustments in eligibility and limits, without elaborate data
collection and analysis by the Apex, it will rely on data collected and analyzed by BOZ
bank supervision department. As banks filings with BOZ are confidential information,
all institutions applying for participation in the intermediation of the MCF will be
required to submit a waiver of confidentiality to BOZ, authorizing BOZ to provide the
Apex with all information, off-site and on-site inspection data and reports pertaining to
them without any need for additional permission or consent. This waiver will be
effective and irrevocable for as long as the PFI remains indebted to the Apex or maintain
an operational credit line with the Apex. Non-bank financial institutions will also be
eligible to be qualified as PFIs, as long as they meet identical requirements. For these
institutions, the Apex will depend on BOZ data and analysis when these are available, or
collect data and do its own analysis when BOZ data and analysis is not available. Close
liaison between the Apex and BOZ will secure prompt transfer of information to allow
immediate action on behalf of the Apex when the financial standing of PFIs change:
(c) Receive, process and approve applications from PFIs for sub-loans from the
MCF: PFIs will submit requests for sub-loans to the Apex. Such applications will
contain the following information:



-60-                              Annex F
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
*  Name of borrower, and any group the borrower belongs to (to allow the Apex
to prevent any borrower or group exceeding the maximum set for each facility
for single borrower or group)
*  Short description of the borrowing company, including its main activities and
products, annual sales and total employment, and of the investment or export
activity financed (to establish that the loan is for eligible purposes)
*  Amounts approved and the projected disbursement schedule.
*  Terms of repayments (duration, interest charged, grace period granted for
principal and interest, if any) and repayment schedule. The Apex will not
evaluate or assess the sub-loans for their economic and financial viability, as
this is the responsibility of the PFIs, which in turn take upon themselves all
the risks
(d) Disburse MCF funds to the PFIs in accordance with the disbursement
schedule of the approved sub-loans:    PFIs will receive the amounts due for
disbursements an agreed number of days before they are due to the borrowers but no
longer than one week. With each sub-loan application a preliminary disbursement
schedule will be submitted, and towards the end of each month each PFI will submit an
updated list of all disbursements due in the coming month with a report on all actual
disbursements to borrowers in the current month. Weekly disbursements will then be
provided to meet the disbursement needs of the PFIs. A penalty interest rate, being a rate
double that of the MCF regular rate of interest will be charged to the PFIs for amounts
disbursed to them and not disbursed to final borrowers and not returned within one week
of the scheduled disbursements;
(e) Collect from the PFIs the amounts due from the sub-loans. For all sub-loans
the repayment schedule will be submitted with the sub-loan application and updated
when disbursements are complete, to allow for delays in actual loan disbursements. Once
the final repayment schedule is established, all amounts due will be paid by the PFIs to
the Apex within one week after repayments by final borrower are due, independent of the
actual repayment by the final borrower. Repayments will be made in US dollars or in
Kwacha at the exchange rate effective at the day of transfer. When repayment is made in
Kwacha, the Apex will convert the amount repaid into dollars for sinking fund
investment and recycling.
(f) Manage the amounts un-disbursed, from the original IDA disbursements and
from repayments of sub-loans by PFIs, for safety and maximum return: Amounts with the
Apex will originate from the IDA disbursements and from repayment of sub-loans. The
sinking fund arrangement described below will ensure the continuation of the availability
of the funds for the Apex for an unlimited period, with the amount growing from interest
income above the Apex administrative costs and the amounts required for allocations to
the sinking fund. At any time, such amounts at the disposal of the Apex will be managed
as deposits with first-class international banks, under the best terms and conditions
obtainable in the international financial market. Funds beyond the amounts required for



-61-                             Annex F
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
disbursement in the coming month may also be invested in short-term financial
instruments issued by governments of countries with the highest financial rating.
(g) Promote the lines of credits with the PFIs and other financial institutions that
are eligible to be PFIs, and the private sector in general as potential final borrowers:
The Apex is expected to actively promote the lines of credit with all PFIs, as well as
promote the applications of additional financial intermediaries that meet the prudential
requirements. The Apex will keep the PFIs informed on availability of funds for new
applications. The Apex will also actively advertise the lines of credit to the private sector
businesses that constitute the potential final borrowers.
(h) Collect from PFIs, process and provide GRZ and IDA with the periodic
reports requested by them. The Apex will provide GRZ and IDA with all the reports
required by them.. Such reports will include Quarterly reports on financial data regarding
the Apex balance sheet and income statements, outstanding loans for each facility by
sector of the final borrowers and by PFIs. Ad hoc reports for GRZ and IDA (such as for
example for the mid-term review and for the Project Completion Report) will be prepared
upon request. The Apex accounts will be audited by external auditors acceptable to IDA
and auditors' reports submitted to GRZ and IDA not later than three months after the
financial year end.
(i) Manage the sinking fund, in collaboration with BOZ as trustee to secure the
amounts for repayment to IDA of principal and interest on the loan as due according to
the IDA loan agreement: GRZ and IDA intend to make the MCF a perpetual fund that
will continuously provide new loans when the original loans are repaid. As the terms and
conditions of the IDA loan are more favorable than financial market conditions, it will be
feasible to generate enough funds to repay IDA both interest and principal by allocating
part of the interest collected by Apex to a sinking fund invested in interest-bearing AAA
international debt securities. The sinking fund will be calculated to accumulate enough
funds to repay, in addition to the MCF amount all other components of the EDP loan
which will be in the form of grants and will not generate repayments. The annual
allocation to the sinking fund will depend on the international financial market interest
rates on AAA debt securities. The amount required will also depend on exchange-rates
development between the US dollar, in which the MCF will be managed, and the
currencies basket in which the IDA loan is provided. The management of the fund and
the determination of the annual allocation will be the responsibility of the Apex, with the
funds allocated and the securities held in trust for GRZ by BOZ. The details of the
formula for fixing the annual allocation will be prepared by the Apex and approved by
IDA. In principle, the formula will provide for the present value of the annual allocations
to the sinking fund to equal the present value of all future payments to IDA at the market
interest rates, with reserves for potential future reduction in interest rates and changes in
the exchange rates between the US dollar and the IDA currency basket. Base on the
assumption that the market interest rate is around 5 % and there is a need to provide an
exchange rate fluctuations and interest rates fluctuations reserve of 20 %, the annual
allocation to the sinking fund is 3.25%. The Apex lending interest rate will be 12 month



-62-                              Annex F
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
LIBOR plus 1% (after consultations with IDA, this rate may be fixed in the range of
between LIBOR and LIBOR plus 2%). Out of the interest earned, the amount for the
sinking fund will be invested as described above; The amount required to cover the Apex
administration costs, as described below, will be paid to the Apex management company
(and at a later stage to DBZ). All interest income above the allocations to the sinking
fund and the administrative fee to the Apex will belong to GRZ and will be added to the
MCF fund for new lending.
8.    Permanent Apex Residence. A financial apex organization will be responsible
to manage MCF. This apex will be established by the government. Until the
establishment of such an apex, a temporary arrangement mentioned in paragraph 8 below
will be responsible for managing the credit lines of MCF. Provided that IDA finds the
permanent apex organization satisfactory in terms of its capitalization, organizational
structure and staffing, the responsibility to manage MCF along with the existing portfolio
of MCF funds will be transferred to the permanent apex from the temporary arrangement.
9.    Temporary Arrangement. In order to provide an early activation of MCF, an
interim solution until such time as DBZ is restructured to the satisfaction of IDA is
proposed. For this purpose the following interim arrangements were requested by GRZ
and agreed by IDA Management:
*  The official agency to perform the role of the Apex will be the Ministry Of
Finance (MOF). By the Ministry being the agency, there will be no need to
find an institution with adequate capital for the interim solution;
*  To actively manage and perform the Apex activities on behalf of MOF, a
private sector company, an investment bank or financial services company,
will be hired by the Apex Supervisory Committee (see below) in accordance
with IDA prior review. The initial contract with the management company
will be for one year with an option to extend the contract for an additional one
to two years. The contract will specify all the operational parameters of the
contractor;
*  The Apex management company will be authorized by MOF to act on its
behalf on all matters that relate to the operations of the Apex and be
supervised by a board with representatives from the MOF, MCTI, the bankers
association and private sector; and
*  The Apex Management Company will seek the approval of IDA for the initial
round of eligible banks and their respective limits. Furthermore, the Apex
management Company will not increase the set limits for these institutions
without IDA's approval. Any new qualifications will also need the IDA
approval. Disqualification and decrease in limits due to urgent circumstances
may be exercised by the Apex with a prompt notice to IDA.
10.   Costs of Apex Arrangement. The operational and administration costs of the
Apex will be covered from a spread between the interest charged to the PFIs and the



-63-                             Annex F
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
interest to be placed in the sinking fund. Remainder of the funds will be added to funds
available for lending. When the MCF total amount will be placed with the PFIs, a 1%
administration charge will provide US $ 400,000 per year, and will be sufficient to cover
the Apex operational cost. As the permanent Apex starts executing other credit lines, it
will have the opportunity to spread its costs to a larger volume of business and will
decrease the cost-spread that it charges. For the initial phase, until 80% of the MCF
amounts are placed, the Apex management company will be allowed to charge 2%
administration charge up to a limit of US $ 400,000. For the first two years of operations
a special contingency budget of US$400,000 will be provided by the TA component of
EDP to cover costs during the two-year period to pay for the Contractor if it is needed.
The need for these funds obviously will be determined by the pace of disbursements and
on the fee structure of selected contractor.
11.   Contractor Performance. As part of the contract, the Apex Contractor will be
committed to develop, and obtain board approval of, an annual work plan for each
twelve-month period of operation of the contract. This will specify in detail the activities
to be carried out in order to launch and promote the credit-lines, and to manage it under
the terms of this SPOP. It will also specify the number of approvals and disbursements
expected for each quarter, and will specify what is to be done, in each quarter, to assess
the ongoing impact of the credit-lines. Progress made in achieving this plan, plus
modifications proposed to the plan, would be reported to the board for each operational
quarter, to be submitted within 10 days of the end of each operational quarter.
Modifications would then have to be agreed with the board. The quarterly report will
elaborate in detail on all planned activities and indicators, giving variances and reasons.
It would analyse approvals for the period, and cummulatively, by industry, by region, by
type of activity supported, and by firm size.
12.   Contractor Financial Standing. The contractor will be expected to present to
the Supervisory Committee, ahead of each twelve-month operating period, evidence of
continuing good financial standing as a company, usually in the form of an auditor's
opinion on annual business accounts. This evidence will also be required ahead of
contract signing.
13.   Contract Termination. In the event that the contractor fails to perform to the
satisfaction of the Supervisory Committee and/or IDA, the contract may be terminated by
the Supervisory Committee at any time, giving one month's notice, and subject to the
prior approval for the move by IDA.
14.   Final Impact Survey. The comprehensive evaluation of scheme impact will be
carried out by means of a sample survey of recipient firms, one year after the completion
of disbursement of all the funds allocated for credit lines, but to be completed no later
than five months after project closing date. This timing would enable the results to be
incorporated into the Implementation Completion Report for the project. The survey will
be contracted out by either the Apex Committee, in case of the temporary arrangement, or



-64-                               Annex F
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
by the Apex to an independent specialist, this choice to be approved in advance by the
IDA. The survey will include comprehensive site visits to a minimum of 10% of
recipients, and will seek not only to evaluate direct incremental impact on sales revenue,
profitability, export levels, employment impact, but also to gather information on indirect
impact, such as on customer orientation, quality assurance, continuing product
development, employee motivation, company image. It will also specifically seek to
evaluate the level of satisfaction firms express with respect to the operation of the credit-
lines.
15.   Interim Impact Survey. Although the final impact survey will allow all stake-
holders to evaluate properly the eventual impact of the credit lines, these stake-holders
will also require an interim evaluation somewhat earlier. A project-wide mid-term review
is planned for latest June 30, 1999. At least one month prior to the review, the Apex
Committee is to furnish a detailed report on the progress to date with the scheme. The
Committee will therefore conduct a smaller representative interim sample survey, to
achieve an interim evaluation of impact within this report. This, too, will be carried out
by an independent specialist, but will be based on only around ten site visits.
B.    Information Required About Eligible Participating Financial Institutions
(PFIs)
16.   Participation in the Multi-Purpose Credit Facility would, in principle, be open to all
licensed financial institutions in good standing. The evaluation of financial institutions
(FIs) to participate in the Project would be determined on the basis of information and
criteria set out below.
17.   Financial institutions applying for participation in the Facility or wishing to
maintain eligibility to participate would be required to provide to the Apex and IDA a
written consent that all information that is or will be available to the Bank of Zambia's
Department of Bank Supervision would also be made available to the Apex and IDA
without delay. Such consent would release BOZ from any obligations to maintain
confidentiality with respect to bank supervision reports, preliminary assessments about a
Financial Institution's adherence to prudential regulation, or any other information related
to the financial institution's financial position and its soundness. In addition, financial
institutions would be required to furnish any other information which the Apex, BOZ or
IDA may consider necessary for purposes of conducting an assessment.  Financial
institutions may ask BOZ not release any customer specific information and information on
the maturity structure of its treasury bill holdings to the temporary Apex Contractor. Any
other information that the financial instititions do not want to be released to the Contractor
requires IDA's approval.
18.   The Bank of Zambia would furnish periodically to the Apex, and in addition upon
request of the Apex or IDA, supervision reports, both routine and special, for the purpose of



-65-                              Annex F
Multi-Purpose Credit Facility
supporting the Apex's evaluation of the PFIs. BOZ will also inform the Apex as to any
substantial change in its own opinion as to the changes in the financial position of all PFIs.
C.    Accounts & Audit Procedures
19.   Project Account. Apex Committee will open a project account which will
receive funds from project's special account for the expenditures authorized under MCF.
The payments for the contractor's fee will also be made out of this account.
20.   Auditing.  The MCF will require an annual financial audit by independent
auditors acceptable to the IDA, with certified copies of audited accounts to be submitted
within six months of each fiscal year. In addition to their normal financial verification
work, the auditors will be required to verify that the quarterly operational reports
provided by the contractor represent a true and fair representation of activities undertaken
and results so far achieved. MCF will also require an annual operational audit, to assess
whether objectives are being met, and procedures respected. Appointment of contractors
for these operational audits, plus the form and Terms of Reference are again to be
satisfactory to the IDA. The Apex Committee will therefore propose, upon hiring of the
contractor, these audit details, and submit them to the IDA, for approval.
21.   Management Accounts and Records. Administration of MCF by the contractor
will require detailed internal record-keeping for management purposes. However, internal
record-keeping arrangements will need to be approved as acceptable to both the
appointed financial and operational audit contractors. To allow the management unit to
function effectively, these arrangements will be submitted to the audit contractors within
three months after hiring of the contractor, with agreement on acceptable arrangements to
be concluded at the latest one month after submission. In the event of delays, or failure to
agree, the Apex Committee will have the authority to approve record-keeping
arrangements as being acceptable for audit purposes.

Institutional Development Component
ZAMBIA
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Institutional Development Component
1.    The Institutional Development component of the project has two objectives. First,
it aims at enhancing capabilities of financial institutions. Second, it aims at creating a
platform from which market information could be delivered to entrepreneurs. The project
would finance four initiatives to upgrade capabilities of commercial banks and BOZ's
bank supervision. The project would also finance a technical assistance to Export Board
of Zambia (EBZ) to establish an information base easily accessible to all Zambian
entrepreneurs and private firms with links to major information sources. The project
would also finance a matching grant scheme for individual banks which would be
administered according to the same principles as MGS.
1.    Financial Sector Technical Assistance
A     EDP - BANK TA.
2.    Objective. The focus of EDP- BANK TA will be improving Zambian banks'
ability to evaluate medium-to-long term projects and their familiarity with international
trade transactions. The Zambia Institute of Bankers (ZIB) agreed to host a three-course
program aimed at providing theory and practical knowledge. Subjects of the coursses will
be project evaluation, trade related transactions and principles of modem bank
management.
3.    Rationale. As a result of macroeconomic and financial market conditions, the
commercial banks in Zambia have been intermediating mainly short-term local currency
funds and many of them have had little exposure to long-term lending or the economic
and financial evaluation of investment projects. Likewise, Zambian banks have had little
exposure to foreign exchange lending for exports, and only limited exposure to other
aspects of export related financial services. Whereas several banks, subsidiaries of
foreign banking groups, have access to the know-how at their parent banks in the form of
experience and training facilities, local banks with no foreign affiliation will greatly
benefit from in-depth training.
4.    Delivery Structure.  The three-course program will be intensive and last
approximately three-months. Courses will be offered in the form of evening classes with
some residential fulf-time periods of about two-three weeks for intensive study. The
overall management will be done by ZIB. Expected attendance will be around 20- 30
students nominated by banks and non-bank financial intermediaries.

Institutional Development Component
5.    Delivery Instruments. The three courses will be delivered:
*  Course I: Project Evaluations: This course will deal with theoretical and
practical aspects of evaluating investment proposals. It will also deal with
practical aspects of executing and administering long-term loans and
monitoring the performance of investment projects.
* Course II: Export Finance: This course will focus on banking transactions
related to export finance including trade documentation, lending to exporters,
executing and administering export finance loans, legal aspects of
international obligations, monitoring performance, and dealing with different
currencies.
*  Course III: Management of Long-term and Export Portfolio: This course is
intended for the managers of commercial banks. Lending policies and
procedures, risk management, portfolio management and monitoring, bank
organization and structure, bank internal controls will be among the topics to
be addressed.
6.    Preliminary Terms of Reference for Instructors and Qualifications.  In
addition to conducting courses, the instructors will:
v  Prepare a curriculum for a one-semester course in their subject area, in
consultation with the Zambia Bankers Association (ZBA) and Zambia
Institute of Bankers (ZIB).
*  Assist ZBA and ZIB in establishing acceptance criteria for the course
participants, interviewing candidates and assessing their eligibility.
v  Coordinate the course bibliography and prepare reading material lists for ZIB
to procure before the course starts.
*  Initiate and participate in seminars and discussions with local bankers and
other officials, and with visiting experts.
*  Support ZBA and ZIB in the preparation and implementation of continuos
training and education in banking and financial services.
Instructors are expected to have an advanced degree in finance with proven experience
with training bankers, as academics and practitioners.  Experience in training in

7.    Objective. EDP - ZNCB TA will assist ZNCB to upgrade its policies, procedures
and management information systems.
8.    Rationale.  ZNCB is the largest commercial bank in Zambia, with assets
exceeding K 200 billion as of the end of 1995. ZNCB is in urgent need of restructuring.
A new management team was appointed in mid -1995. This team is actively working to
restructure the bank and requested IDA's assistance to help them. A major improvement



-68-                             Annex G
Institutional Development Component
is necessary in their internal information systems and in analytical capacity in decision
making procedures.
9.    Delivery Mechanism. The proposed technical assistance would be delivered by
providing two resident advisors for one-year. One advisor will be a specialist on
commercial bank management. The other will be a specialist in management information
systems (MIS).
10.   Qualifications of Advisors. The management specialist is expected to have had
higher education in finance and experience of at least ten years in commercial banking
including a high level management position. The MIS specialist is expected to have
higher education in finance and/or system analysis as well as data processing related
subjects, with experience of at least ten years in the design and managemenet of
commercial banks information systems at a senior level. Experience in the management
of commercial banks in developing countries will also be desirable.
11.   Preliminary Terms of Reference. The management specialist will:
* Support the management of ZNCB in defining its mission, goals and
practices, restructuring and adjusting the bank staff level and composition and
the branch network to support the bank's mission, and define qualifications
for key officers.
* Assist ZNCB in establishing and implemeting appropriate policies and
procedures, for all banking activities, including credit policy, treatment of
non-performing borrowers and treasury activities, with emphasis on risk
management.
* Participate in ZNCB management team meetings and support the managing
director and senior management in efficient and prudent management of the
institution, based on his international experience.
The MIS specialist will:
* Evaluate ZNCB operating information systems and identify the areas that
need change and improvement. Support the management of ZNCB in
defining the bank requirements for a modern management information system,
and deciding on new systems and/or improvements to existing systems.
. Assist ZNCB in establishing and implementing the modernization of the
information systems for all banking activities, with special emphasis on risk
management and loan portfolio management.

Institutional Development Component
C.    EDP-BOZTA
12.   Objective. The focus of EDP -Bank Supervision TA will be to enhance BOZ's
capacity to generate information and risk analysis about all financial institutions under its
supervision, on the basis of which the apex can qualify and monitor the broadest possible
base of participating financial institutions (PFIs).
13.   Rationale. As a financial-intermediation loan, the EDP seeks to grant access to
funding to as many sound financial institutions as possible while ensuring that the risk
exposure of each PFI remains consistent with its capacity to assume risk on a sustained
basis. By enhancing BOZ's capability in collecting data and generating financial reports
that can be effectively used for off-site analysis, the EDP will improve not only the
apex's results but also the utility of resources available to other users of bank supervision.
In light of the scarcity of human resources in Zambia to assess and monitor banks' risk
profile and performance on the basis of reliable financial reports, the deployment of
technical assistance to enhance BOZ's capacity to perform this function is more efficient
than technical assistance supporting the establishment of a new and separate unit within
the apex with a mandate to conduct virtually the same function.
14.   Scope of Technical Assistance. To support the accuracy and timeliness of BOZ
generated financial reports, four areas require improvement:
(a)  establishing rules and guidelines for banks and their auditors regarding treatment of
assets and liabilities for financial statements, including annual audited statements and
monthly unaudited reports. Rules and guidelines must be prepared in consultation with
licensed banks and the major auditing firms and/or professional associations on a host of
variables which will include, but are not limited to: (i) portfolio classification, (ii)
provisioning against bad and doubtful assets and allocation to loan-loss reserves; (iii)
placing in suspense interest earned but not collected on doubtful loans or loans in arrears
loans, and recording such interest as income only when actually collected; (iv) the
revaluation of fixed assets under inflationary conditions and the treatment of the
revaluation reserve; (v) connected lending; (vi) capital adequacy (non-weighted as well
risk-weighted); (vii) exposure to risk resulting from open foreign exchange positions,
mismatched interest rates for assets and liabilities; (viii) reporting requirements for off-
balance-sheet assets and liabilities (including guarantees, lines of credit, forward
transactions, options and derivatives), (ix) deviations, if any, from International
Accounting Standards; (x) financial results presented on a consolidated basis; and (xi)
corrective action in process due to non-compliance with BOZ regulations;
(b)    enhancing on-site supervision capabilities;
(c)    establishing a computerized data collection system which will enable all licensed
banks to file data with BOZ on a monthly basis via computer link or diskette, thus cutting



-70-                              Annex G
Institutional Development Component
to the minimum both data entry errors and the time between filing by the banks and the
availability of tabulated data; and
(d)   procuring and tailoring to BOZ requirements a computer program that presents
bank data according to a pre-determined report format, computes ratios, displays graphs
and evaluates the results both against standards and against historical results; the purpose
will be to flag any aberrations from BOZ regulations or any deterioration in the banks
financial position. The World Bank's bank-evaluation package will be used as the starting
point for establishing the reporting and analysis system.
15.   Delivery Mechanism. The proposed technical assistance would be centered
around enhancing accounting skills, report generation on-site and off-site analysis. It
would be delivered by providing three advisors, as well as financing for the purchase of
appropriate software package(s). The first adviser will be a certified public accountant
with experience and knowledge in off-site bank supervision and/or bank auditing and/or
bank accounting systems where internationally accepted standards are applied. The
second adviser will have the same background but with an experience in on-site bank
inspection and evaluation. Developing country experience is also desirable. These
advisers are expected to spend two-to-three months in Zambia for about three times over
an eighteen-month period. The third adviser will be a specialist in bank information
systems familiar with bank reporting requirements in a developed financial system. This
adviser is expected to spend at least six-months in Zambia.
16.   Preliminary Terms of Reference. The bank accounting specialist will:
-  consult with major accounting firms, the banking community, their professional
associations and staff of the Department of Bank Supervision, and reach consensus
with BOZ management about the financial variables to be monitored for the purpose
of financial reporting, taking due account of the various forms of risk exposure and
risk management;
*  provide definitions and accounting treatment of all items in the financial statements of
licensed banks (assets, liabilities, income, expenses, reserves and capital);
*  develop accounting directives and guidelines for the recording of bank assets,
liabilities, capital, reserves, income and expenditures in the banks' accounts, and for
banks' periodic and annual reports issued to the public and/or submitted to BOZ;
issues to be covered will include, but are not limited to, those listed in para.14(a)
above;
*  provide standards for disclosure to public and to all the regulatory agencies, including
BOZ;
*  assume a lead facilitator role for continuous dialogue among licensed financial
institutions, major accounting firms and staff of the Department of Bank Supervision
and hold periodic meetings with these institutions to establish a mutual understanding
of issues related to the scope of the technical assistance program;



-71-                             Annex G
Institutional Development Component
* cooperate with BOZ officials and their advisers in the preparation of new regulations
and circulars and in the modification of existing regulations, if and when so requested
by BOZ senior management;
* cooperate with the ongoing donor-supported programs for the improvement of bank-
supervision issues;
* coach staff of the Department of Bank Supervision in implementing accounting
guidelines and directives, with a view to enabling them to apply Internationally
Accepted Standards to their work;
* prepare progress reports to IDA and to BOZ management on the technical assistance
program, including assessments of the quality of accounting entries that are inputted
by BOZ into computer systems and transformed into financial reports;
* organize and teach courses in bank accounting related courses; and
* support BOZ management in evaluating the quality of bank reports on the basis of
analysis and evaluation.
The on-site inspection specialist will:
* review BOZ procedures and formats for on-site inspection;
* update these procedures in line with current international practice;
* conduct courses for BOZ supervision department staff involved in on-site inspections
* participate in BOZ on-site inspection to provide on-the-job-training; and
* use experience from such inspection as cases which will be analyzed with BOZ staff
to improve performance.
The specialist in management information systems will:
*  develop a system that will monitor and evaluate commercial banks by working in
colloboration with Zambian banking sector, professional associations and staff of
Bank Supervison Department of BOZ.
*  make use of existing bank monitor and evaluation systems to the extent possible
including adapting the World Bank's diskette "Analysis of Bank System" to
Zambian needs, incorporating the comments of the banking sector, auditors and staff
of the Department of Bank Supervision with the objectives of (a) tailoring and
improving the quality and relevance of output and reflecting emerging regional
standards and (b) facilitating the writing of reports that can be used as inputs into a
system of on-site examination;
*  add any tables necessary to monitor compliance with regulations that are not directly
related to risk management, for example the calculation of cash reserve requirements,
liquid asset requirements, investment limits, etc.to the system that will be adapted;
*  in the case of adapting the World Bank's diskette: (i) simplify the model by
delinking currently linked workbooks, while maintaining the ability to produce
graphs; (ii) produce an error report, clearly identifying items that should but do not
agree arithmetically; and (iii) write a macro-routine to enable the consolidation of



-72-                              Annex G
Institutional Development Component
reports for the banking system, while maintaining the capability of producing graphs,
both for the banking system as a whole and for individual banks;
*  if necessary, identify and arrange for the purchase of a software package that can best
generate financial reports and supporting graphs and summary statistics, along the
lines outlined above in conformity with internationally accepted standards, cost
efficiency and emerging regional trends;
*  work with staff of the Department of Bank Supervision, in consultation with the
World Bank, to ensure that the resulting reporting system is based on formats that are
consistent, to the extent feasible, with systems available in the African sub-region in
order to facilitate the consolidation of cross-border data; and
*  assist staff within BOZ and commercial banks, through training and technical
support, in the implementation of the bank information systems.
D.    EDP - APEX TA
16.   Objective. EDP- APEX TA is intended to be a contingency fund for the Apex
operation. Although the cost of Apex operation will be covered through the interest
charges on credit lines, the initial disbursement levels might not be enough to cover the
cost of the private contractor or its fee structure. In this case, EDP - APEX TA funds will
be used to make up the difference. In addition to these, any remaining funds could be
used to help the permanent Apex during its start-up phase.
2.    Technical Assistance to Export Board of Zambia
17.   Information Brokering. Information brokers intermediate between businesses
requiring information and electronically stored databases of such information around the
world. Information brokers add value by knowing where to locate difficult-to-find
information, and by having the specialized skills of accessing distant databases.
18.   Objective. EDP- EBZ TA will assist EBZ to establish an information brokering
service in Zambia to provide a vast spectrum of market related data from around the
world to Zambian firms and entrepreneurs. This service will access to on-line data
including collections of patents and trade-marks; published market research reports;
stockbroker reports; trade statistics from many countries; news clipping services covering
tens of thousands of newspapers, journals and newsletters around the world; and trade
directories for many countries, listing companies by specialization or location; listing of
importers.
19.   Rationale. The current advances in information technology have made it possible
to access vast networks of data from around the world. The bulk of such data was located
traditionally in the specialized libraries scattered around the world.  Businesses in
developing countries had very little opportunity of finding or utilizing such information.



-73-                               Annex G
Institutional Development Component
The project is intended to stimulate efforts of Zambian firms to enhance their
competitiveness. Such efforts will require access to global market intelligence.
20.   Delivery Mechanism.  EDP - EBZ TA will support a short program  of
specialized training for an EBZ staff member, designed to equip him/her to operate
quickly an effective business information brokering service on completion of this
training. This staff member in turn is expected to conduct similar training within the
Export Board of Zambia so that the knowledge and skills gained by this staff can be
passed onto others within the institution. Training will take place overseas where such
training is pertinent.
21.   Delivery Structure. The delivery of the training program will be contracted out
to an information brokering firm. The contractor would then lay on a structured program
of work for the trainee, lasting two to three months. This would probably be split
between periods spent with two firms, to give exposure to different operating styles. As
well as providing internal on-the-job training, the contractor would arrange for the trainee
to attend a number of external training courses, such as those run by on-line service hosts.
Upon the conclusion of the training, the staff member will develop a plan for in-house
training of the other relevant EBZ staff. EBZ will submit a copy of the proposed plan to
IDA for comments. The in-house training should take place no later than three-months
after the return of overseas trained EBZ staff back to Zambia.

Project Implementation Plan
I.    Critical Issues. The most critical issue related to the project implementation has
already been achieved by appointing the Apex and Matching Grant Supervisory
Committees.  These boards have already started the process of hiring the private
executors for MCF and MGS. Choosing of a qualified executors in a timely manner is
the single most important element for the successful implementation of the project. It is
the intention of these boards to go ahead with the tendering process prior to the project's
approval so that the key executors of the project could be in place once the project is
approved and became effective. Ongoing tendering process is being done using IDA
Guidelines. The Commitees which carry out the tendering process are in constant touch
with the Task Team and the procurement specialist in the resident mission in Zambia.
2.    Critical Dates.  Since the project executors will be appointed prior to the
approval of the project by the Board, the critical item remains to be launching the project.
The following tables outlines timing of the key activities assuming the selection of
private executors for MCF and MGS appointed prior to the effectiveness. The auditors
for the project accounts will be appointed within a two month-period after effectiveness.

ZAMBIA
ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Analysis and Performance Monitoring Indicators
1.    Although it is very difficult to quantify benefits from this project, ultimately
financing of US$40 million in investments in the industrial sector provides a signal of the
order of magnitude of benefits to the economy, as does the financing of US$15 million in
exports per year. MGS would provide know-how of about US$7 million to be injected
into Zambian firms. The difficulty in measuring benefits lies in the fact that the project
would be supporting the acceleration of a process leading to an outcome rather than
supporting concrete outcome directly. In addition, it is impossible to identify in advance
the investments or exports to be financed out of the MCF. Nevertheless, the project
would generate an estimated Net Present Value (NPV) of US$12.60 million discounted at
13%, and an economic rate of return of approximately 17%. Table Kl presents a
summary of NPV estimates for the project.

Total       51.44        12.60       0.17
2.    Methodology. A series of assumptions has been made to compute the NPVs.
These assumptions are as follows:
* For ICF, a separate loan approval and a withdrawal process were assumed under three
different scenarios (base, medium, and fast) on a quarterly basis. It was further
assumed that the investments to be financed under this facility would be typically 10-
year projects, and would require 5-year loans with a one-year grace period and an
interest rate of about LIBOR plus 3 percentage points (approximated to 9%).
Investor's equity contribution assumed to be 25% of the total project, would also take
place during the first year. The project was assumed to have no negative cash-flows
at any time. During the first year, expenditures would be financed either from a
withdrawal from the credit line or from equity or both. An accelerated net output-
flow was assumed to yield a value equivalent of initial investment in 10 years. This
corresponds to an annual compounded growth rate of approximately 7%. Output
increase due to equity participation in the project was omitted to compensate for any
diversion from other activities on the part of investors. The Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) was assumed to be 13 %.



-82-                            Annex L
Economic Analysis and Performance Monitoring Indicators
*  For EPF, a similar methodology was applied. In this case a typical loan was assumed
to have a six month maturity with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3% (again
approximately at 9%). It was also assumed that the banks are willing to finance up to
70% of export orders. Since there are substantial reflows vis a vis the size of new
disbursements through the repayments before the entire facility is disbursed, re-
lending of these loans was also taken into account until the entire facility is fully
disbursed. The facility was treated as an investment into the working capital of the
firms that would also generate a corresponding increase in the level of output. The
impact of the firm's contribution was omitted to account for diversion of the
resources from other activities.
*  For MGS (including MGS-BANK), a methodology was adapted from Levy, Berry
and Nugent which, based on the empirical evidence in similar schemes, assumes an
output increase of about 15 times of the matching grant for East Asian countries. For
this project the multiple was assumed to be 10. Since matching grants would
basically inject new technical know-how in companies to stay competitive, the ERR
on the increase in output due to MGS was assumed to be 42%.
*  Measurement of the economic benefits of institutional development support is the
most subject to estimation error. For the sake of consistency, it was assumed that the
support provided would increase the efficiency of the support recipients and would
yield an increase in the economic outputs at a multiple of two times the amount of
support. It was also assumed that the benefits would be realized with a lag of one
year. The ERR was assumed to be 16%.
3.    Sensitivity Analysis. Three scenarios based on different disbursement profiles
were considered (except for the institutional development where a uniform disbursement
was applied for all three scenarios), the results, which were discounted at various rates,
provide an indication of sensitivity. The following tables supplement Table Kl, which
summarizes the medium case with a discount rate of 13%.

The above analysis highlights the benefits of fast implementation of the project.
Applications including other discount rates and background calculations are available in
the project files. Some of these calculations are also presented at the end of this annex.
4.    Other Benefits. There are additional benefits from the project. Among them are:
-  Improved awareness of economic opportunities which do not directly result in
increases in output and employment by the firms supported.
* Secondary and tertiary effects of increases in output.
* Development of know-how put to use beyond the enterprises supported.
.  Inducing smaller banks to become better capitalized so that they can qualify for
participation in the credit lines.
Improved bank supervision which would reduce the cost of bank failures.
5.    Main Beneficiaries. The main beneficiaries of the project would be Zambian
firms and the Zambian financial sector. It is estimated that about 100 firms would
participate in MGS and about 60 firms would borrow from ICF. EPF is expected to
finance about 100 export transactions per year.

Economic Analysis and Performance Monitoring Indicators
6.    Project Performance Indicators. The most critical aspects of the project are: (i)
establishment of the Matching Matching Grant Supervisory Committee (MGSC) and the
Apex Supervisory Committee; and ii) hiring of the the management contractor for the
Matching Grant Scheme (MGS), and the Apex Management Company. The former has
already been accomplished. The latter will be resolved prior to the effectiveness of the
the Development Credit Agreement to this Credit. Therefore, the most significant
performance indicators during the implementation phase of the project would be: (i) the
actual disbursement from the project and its impact: and (ii) the quality of technical
assistance provided and its impact.
In order to measure the impact of the performance of the Project on the Zambian
economy, a close monitoring of the subprojects in the aggregate would be needed.
Increased levels of investments and exports would serve as good indicators of project
performance. In order to measure the impact the data collected during supervision
missions will be used to estimate:
-  revenue generated by MGS in terms of a multiple of the grant element;
3  rate of return on the investment projects that were financed by the
Investment Credit Facility (ICF);
-  export revenue generated through Export Preshipment Facility (ECF);
and
*  employment impact on project components;
The impact of the Apex on financial intermediaries would be measured by the level of
participation among the commercial banks. This participation will be measured by:
  number of intermediaries participating in the scheme;
*  average loan size, maturity, sector and customer profile for each
participating financial intermediary (PFI), (i.e. to see if PFIs start
specializing in certain market segments);
*  independent development of similar lending instruments by PFIs;
*  development of similar schemes by other concessionary resources; and
*  collection performance of the Apex
The impact of technical assistance will be assessed through qualitative observations of the
relevant operations of recipient organizations.

Financial Sector Overview

Financial Sector Overviewl
7.     Zambia's financial sector is small in relation to the size of its economy and to its
population, and it has been steadily shrinking in recent years. Demonetization is evident in the
ratio of M2 to GDP, which decreased from .22 in 1991 to .11 in May 1995. Similarly, the ratio
of total bank assets to GDP declined to .20 in May 1995 from .44 in 1991, or 58 percent in real
terms. While the banking sector's role in the economy is thus becoming marginalized, Treasury
Bill activity has aggravated bank lending to private enterprises, with substantial evidence of
crowding out. Treasury Bills held by commercial banks rose from 19 percent of deposits in 1990
to 42 percent in 1992 and 26 percent in May 1996. Overall, credit to private and parastatal
enterprises decreased by about 60 percent in real terms during the period 1990 - May 1995,
including a decline of about 73 percent in the manufacturing sector.
8.     Nevertheless, most commercial banks in Zambia appear to be functioning profitably and
to be providing a variety of products and services. The substantial demand for long-term credit
could in principle be met by a number of banks with sufficient human and capital resources to
evaluate, appraise and administer long term investment projects. Current indications by bank
managers point to a capacity to disburse about US$ 50- 60 million in the aggregate over the next
three years and at their owIn risk, should long-term funds be made available to tlhem.
9.    In tlis Annex the composition and activities of financial institutions are surveyed. The
declining role of financial activity is reviewed in Section 1, followed by an overview of recent
developments in capital markets in Section 11, non-bank financial institutions in Section III and
specialized financial intermediaries in Section IV. As the financial sector is dominated by
commercial banks, particular emphasis is placed on their activities and performance - an
overview of their aggregate structure and performance is presented in Section V, while a review
of individual banks is presented in Section VI. Issues related to the provision of long-term
finance are reviewed in Section VII.
I.     Size and Structure of thie Financial Sector
10.    The banking sector's total assets at Year-end 1995 aggregated K 801.5 billion (US$0.7
billion), or 20% of GDP. This is less than half the level in 1991.
This section is based on the sector work carried out by A. Soylemezoglu and Dan Mozes in June 1995.
Figures in this work is updated where available.

Zambia's commercial banking sector's difficulties come from two sources. The first one is the
declining economy and the second is the very sho.1-term nature of the term-structure of its
sources of funds. The decline in business volume is critical for newly established and fragile
banks as they have just entered into a declining industry without sufficient resources.
11.   The financial sector suffered from violent swings in interest rates both in real and in
nominal terms while the horizon for investors shrunk to the 28-day Treasury Bill cycle. During
the last four years inflation rates fluctuated between almost 200% in 1991 to 28 percent in mid-
1994. Inflation returned to 60 percent at end-1994, declined again to 38 percent by mid-1995,
and stood at around 45 % at end-1995. Volatility in the real interest rate resulted from the lags in
inflationary expectations as well as from fluctuations in GRZ demand for funds. The table below
shows that real interest rates (expressed as the compounded annual effective rates) fluctuated
between 66 percent positive and 47 percent negative within the last five years.

2.     Capital Markets
12.   Capital markets are at an early stage of development. There are no corporate debt
instruments. Government Treasury Bills with maturities ranging between 28 days and 18 months
are auctioned by the Bank of Zambia (BOZ) weekly, and are eligible for meeting the liquidity



-98-                                 Annex M
Financial Sector Overview
requirements of commercial banks. All interest rates of the Bank of Zambia (BOZ) are adjusted
weekly to the yields on Treasury Bills, and most financial transactions have terms no longer than
28 days. The magnitude of outstanding Treasury Bills reached 63% of M2 by the end of 1992,
and went down to a more manageable 38% in mid-1995, rising again to more than 50 % of M2
by late 1995.

3.    Non-Bank Institutions
13.   Commensurate with the level of capital-market development, non-bank financial
institutions play only a small role in the Zambian economy. The Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE)
has opened for business, but companies are yet to be listed on the exchange. The first officially
listed company on the LuSE resulted from a public offering of Chilanga Cement shares by the
Zambia Privatization Trust Fund in April 1995. All offered shares (27.4% of the company
shares) were sold for K 3.5 billion to approximately 4,000 buyers.
14.    Leasing activity is also limited, and most of it is conducted by commercial banks and
their leasing subsidiaries.
15.    The Building Society's depositsstood at K 10 billion at March 31, 1995. Most resources
have been reinvested in large negotiated time deposits with commercial banks -more than K 5
billion at March 31, 1995. The provision of mortgage loans became non-viable, and some
interest had to be capitalized on existing mortgage loans because of the persistence of high
nominal and real interest rates.
4.    Specialized Intermediaries
16.    State-owned specialized financial intermediaries are dominated by Lima Bank, Exim
Bank and the Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ). All realized significant losses historically
and are now being considered for liquidation or restructuring.
17.   Lima Bank's financial results are typical of the Zambian system of agricultural credit.
Agricultural seasonal credit was traditionally intermediated with GRZ funds by Lima Bank,



-99-                                 Annex M
Financial Sector Overview
CUSA and ZCF-FS. When additional funds from GRZ ceased to be forthcoming, they stopped
to function because of the very small collection rate oii existing loans. GRZ is now channeling its
revolving funds for agricultural inputs and  for agricultural produce marketing through
commercial banks, which lend to merchants, stockists and outgrowers. They in turn provide
small farmers with seasonal inputs or pay for produce with the funds borrowed from the
commercial banks. Lima Bank is slated for privatization or liquidation, pending the results of
ongoing studies.
18.    DBZ, the traditional source of long-term funds, has proved to be financially non-viable.
Its loan portfolio has been non-performing and few  loans are properly serviced.  Its
administrative costs exceeded total disbursements of new loans in 1995. DBZ currently has no
significant source of funds, which are limited to two small credit lines from the Bank and AfDB.
With its present portfolio, DBZ is unlikely to qualify for any new credit line from multilateral
financial institutions. In the framework of the 1995/6 Bank adjustment loan GRZ committed
itself to restructuring DBZ as an apex organization, which would on-lend concessional funds
exclusively to financial institutions.
19.    The Exim Bank historically failed to reach its intended clientele or to intermediate a
significant volume of funds. A privatization effort is underway; failing which procedures for
liquidation are planned for application.
5.     Overview of the Commercial Banking Sector
20.    Zambia's financial sector is dominated by commercial banking. Nevertheless, since
1990 total bank deposits have decreased by 48 percent in real terms despite the establishment de
novo of 15 banks. Most of these new banks are small and have a capital base below US$3
million. The increase in the number of banks was a market response to liberalized economic
policies and licensing policy. With the enactment of the Banking and Financial Services Bill in
December 1994 and the introduction of new BOZ regulations, control over bank entry has
improved. MOF's authority to grant licenses was transferred to BOZ. Against the background
of the failure of Meridien Bank in 1995, these newly established small banks are finding it
extremely difficult to stay in the business with their limited capital base. When BOZ's new
capital requirement becomes effective in at year-end 1996 the number of banks operating in
Zambia is likely to decrease from 17 to around 12.
21.    Foreign owned and locally owned banks exhibit different attitudes which is reflected in
the structure of their balance sheets. In general, foreign owned banks are more conservative in
lending and the ratio of their loans to deposits is lower than for local banks. Whereas foreign
owned banks are more liquid and have a larger capital base, locally owned banks have less
liquidity and less capital base.
22.    Market Concentration. Two commercial banks have market shares each exceeding 20
percent of total bank assets. The largest six banks control over 80 percent of total bank assets.
Of the bigger banks, Barclays is foreign owned (from the United Kingdom) while Zambia
National Commercial Bank (ZNCB) is a parastatal. The next four largest banks have market
shares ranging between 6 and 10 percent of total bank assets. Two are foreign owned - Standard
Chartered (from the United Kingdom) and Stanbic (from South Africa); the other two are locally



-100-                                Annex M
Financial Sector Overview
owned - Finance and Union Banks. The remaining eleven banks are quite small in size, several
accounting for less than one percent of total bank assets. Some of these banks are also foreign
owned.

23.    The banking market was shaken by the collapse in 1995 of the then fourth largest bank,
Meridien BIAO Bank, which had a 17 percent market share. Meridien's failure was precipitated
mainly by the collapse of its foreign-registered holding company, to which the Zambian bank
had channeled substantial resources.  Notwithstanding information available to the bank
supervisory authorities prior to the crisis, they demonstrated a lack of capacity to act on it
decisively and promptly. Meridien BIAO is now under liquidation. Its collapse and the losses to
depositors caused further concentration in the banking market as depositors moved to larger,
foreign-owned banks for safety.
24.   Bank failures have played an important role in determining market structure and in
explaining the dominance of four banks (ZNCB, Barclays, Standard Chartered and Grindlays-
now Stanbic). While the failures of Meridien BIAO and previously BCCI led to greater market
concentration, the emergence of new, smaller banks has more recently led to market pressure on
the bigger banks to behave more competitively. Some smaller banks are establishing a wider
area of coverage through additional branches. The biggest threat to the smaller banks is likely to
arise from their own size and limited capital base. The public appears unwilling to go through
another bank failure, as Meridien's failure considerably shook public confidence in both small
and domestic banks.
25.   A number of new, smaller banks are in a way the legacy of the failed BCCI. The ex-
patriate managers of the BCCI, facing uncertain prospects elsewhere, teamed up with local
investors to establish these banks, which include Finance Bank, Union, Commerce, Credit Africa
and Africa Commerce Banks. Commerce and Credit Africa have failed and are in liquidation.
Managers have invested in and/or been given shares by the principal investors in the banks that
they manage.
26.   BOZ has recently issued guidelines which require commercial banks to have at least two
billion Kwachas in capital by year-end 1996. There are eight banks which currently comply with
this requirement (ZNCB, Barclays, Standard Chartered, Stanbic, Finance, Indo-Zambia, Citi, and
Union). As of January 1997, BOZ has not acted on enforcing this regulation and those banks
with capital less than the required level are being allowed to operate.
27.   The banking community estimates that the total number of banks in the near future will
be smaller than today, and may reach a number closer to 12 banks. Given the size of the
economy, the extensive branch network of both the large and the medium size banks, and the



-101-                                Annex M
Financial Sector Overview
limitations on availability of trained bankers and on supervision capacity, such a development
would be a positive step in the direction of a stronger banking sector. There appears to be no
other impetus to bank consolidation, other than a well functioning apex with short and long term
facilities. An apex institution could prescribe minimum size and capital as a condition for
intermediating its funds.
28.    Aggregate Balance Sheet. The consolidated balance sheet of the commercial banking
sector as of Dec 31, 1995 was structured as follows:

29.    Total Assets. Total assets of the banking sector have declined about 25 percent in dollar
terms and more than 50 percent in real terms since 1990.

31.    The composition of deposits remained fairly stable over the same five-year period with
some sizable fluctuations - up to 10% of total deposits - during the interim. Savings accounts are
payable on demand and their maturity ranges from one to six months. The market share of
savings deposits increased until 1994 in response to the enhanced competition generated by a
growing number of banks offering higher rates of interest.

32.    An examination of deposits with individual banks shows that some of the smaller banks
have more deposits than their proportionate share of total assets of the banking sector. This
discrepancy may be due to ZNCB's debt to the BOZ, as well as the importance of other liabilities
in the balance sheets of ZNCB, Barclay's and other larger banks.

33.    Lending.  Zambia's commercial banks have been heavily investing in government
securities.  This has occurred at the expense of lending to the private sector. Total bank
investments in Treasury bills rose from 19 percent of total deposits in 1990 to 42 percent in 1992
and 1993. At year-end 1995 the share of Treasury bills had declined somewhat, but investment
in Treasury bills, at K147 billion, nevertheless corresponded to 70 percent of the outstanding
balance of loans to private and parastatal enterprises (K 211 billion), and total investment in
GRZ debt (loans, Treasury bills and bonds) at K183 billion, represented 87 percent of business
sector debt.

34.    A significant portion of private deposits go to finance government activities while the
private sector faces a significant credit squeeze. Bank loans to the private sector and parastatals
constitute about 26 percent of total bank assets. This amount corresponds to 56 percent of
deposits made by these entities. In contrast, the banking sector's investment and lending to
government is about 23 percent of total assets while deposits by the government are only nine
percent.

35.   In real terms credit to private and parastatal enterprises declined by about 50 percent
during the period 1990 - May 1995. This decrease is even more dramatic in light of the
incidence of rescheduled loans in the agriculture portfolio rather than new credit activity.
Moreover, credit to mining and manufacturing lost in absolute terms and its share in total lending
also declined considerably. Specifically, credit to the mining sector is about 11 percent of 1990
levels in 1995. Credit to the manufacturing sector decreased by 73 percent during the period
1990 - 1995.

36.    Zambian banks started holding significant deposit abroad with the liberalization foreign
exchange.

The very high volume of deposits abroad in 1992 and 1993 suggests that the Bank of Zambia on
the one hand may not have implemented prudent currency risk criteria and the banks on the other
hand may not have had serious concerns about a possible appreciation of the Kwacha. At 24
percent of total deposits, deposits abroad at year-end 1995 remains significant and it is about five
times the level of total foreign currency lending. Foreign exchange lending is less than 30
percent of foreign exchange deposits.
37.    The portion of deposits loaned out varies significantly from one bank to another. It
appears that the foreign-ownied banks are lending less than local banks relative to their deposits.
This situation further limits the available credit as about fifty percent of total deposits are with
these banks.

Foreign-owned banks appear to practice an exceptionally conservative lending policy. Only
Barclays' loans-to-deposit ratio is above the banking system's average of 52 percent.
38.    Terms and Collateralization of Loans.  Bank loans are confined to short-term
maturities and represent working capital and trade finance. This portfolio tends to be backed
fully with collateral. The only open-account customers are multinationals. A significant part of
ZNCB's parastatal portfolio is backed by explicit government guarantees. Collateral generally
involves real estate and is often valued well above the value of the principal and interest. In the
case of trade finance requiring the issuance of letters of credit, the banks often block equivalent
amounts of cash or liquid assets (almost always Treasury Bills) throughout the duration of the
letter of credit.
39.    Liquidity and Capital Adequacy. Zambian banks have generally satisfactory levels of
liquidity, as measured by the ratio of liquid assets (cash, deposits with other banks and treasury
securities) to total liabilities. Most have liquidity levels above the BOZ-prescribed level as a
result of heavy investment in Treasury bills. Foreign owned banks have a higher liquidity ratio
than local banks. The system average stands at 47 percent.

40.    The capital structure of banks likewise reveals a significantly higher level of net worth
relative to total liabilities among foreign-owned bank subsidiaries than among locally owned
banks. Aggregate net worth is ten percent of the total liabilities of the sector.

Although there are smaller banks with a ratio of net worth to total deposits substantially higher
than the largest banks, their size would render a comparison insignificant.
41.    Products and Services. Commercial banks in Zambia offer an assortment of products.
These include traditional deposit instruments (i.e. checking, savings, and time deposits),
commercial lending mainly in the form of short-term working capital finance, various types of
letters of credit and money transfer facilities.
42.    The five largest banks (ZNCB, Barclays, Standard Chartered, Stanbic and Finance) have
a network of branches. The smaller banks generally have one branch in Lusaka and another in
the Copperbelt (generally in Ndola). The foreign banks have started to operate specialized
branches for commercial customers in the Copperbelt.
43.    Due mainly to shortcomings in existing communication facilities, banks are confined in
their efforts to further modernize operations by employing electronic media in their network of
operations. There is an extensive usage of micro-size business computers at the headquarters of
almost every bank and significant utilization of stand-alone personal computers. The servicing
of individual accounts is still done through paper-based traditional account files.
