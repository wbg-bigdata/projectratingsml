IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Republic of Senegal
Development Management Project (Credit 1910-SE)
Preface
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Development
Management Project in the Republic of Senegal, for which Credit 1910-SE in the amount
of SDR 12.5 million was approved on May 24, 1988 and made effective on March 6,
1989. The credit was closed on June 30, 1997, 36 months after the original closing date
of June 30, 1994. Final disbursement will take place on December 22, 1997, at which
time a balance of SDR 793,159 will be cancelled. Of $2.0 million in co-financing
provided by C'IDA, $1.67 million was disbursed and $326,000 was cancelled.
2.    The ICR was prepared by Ellen Cohen from the Institutional Development and
Social Policy Division of the Africa Region and reviewed by Mahmood Ayub, Country
Director, AFC14. Neither the Borrower nor co-financier CIDA provided comments.
3.    The completion mission took place in April 1996. On June 30, 1996, project
activities closed, except for procurement and training under the civil service component.
For their completion, the Bank agreed to extend the closing date a third time to June 30,
1997. Preparation of the ICR was done at HQ and is based on material in the project file.
The Borrower did not prepare a contribution to the ICR.



EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.  The Development Management Project (PAGD) was designed in response to a
request by the Government of Senegal: (a) to extend to a second phase the Technical
Assistance Project for Economic and Financial Planning (Cr. 1061-SE), approved in
1980, which had laid the base and initiated reforms in several key areas; (b) to help
implement recommendations arising from the Administrative Assessment carried out in
1985; and (c) to incorporate the social dimension in the design and implementation of its
structural adjustment program.
Project Objectives
2. The primary objective of the project was to assist the Government to build up the
internal capabilities for strategic planning, financial management and personnel
management in the relevant agencies within the Ministries of Plan and Cooperation,
Economy and Finance, and Civil Service and Labor. In particular, the project was to
support action programs prepared by these agencies to carry out the tasks related to the
implementation of the on-going structural adjustment program (para 1).
3.   The project's primary objective was not met. The objective was over-ambitious
and based neither upon a long-term Government strategy nor a constituency for reform in
the administration. The objective was also unrealistic given the institutional environment,
in particular the flight of qualified staff with difficulty to recruit new ones, due to low
salaries and lack of incentives. A condition of effectiveness was that a system of
administering performance incentives to project staff, acceptable to IDA, be adopted by
Government. But it was never implemented (paras 2, 5).
Implementation Experience and Results
4. Institutional development under the PAGD was negligible. Lack of an incentive
system was raised several times by concerned Senegalese staff involved in the PAGD, but
IDA supervision missions did not follow-up adequately. In a weak effort to address the
issue, 15 months before the original closing date, the Bank proposed that staff working on
PAGD-financed activities receive salary supplements "according to the same norms as
other projects". Revision of Government's training policy, envisaged under the project,
did not take place. About 450 staff were trained in human resource management and
others received computerized instruction (customs, tax collection, debt, civil service, data
processing and survey methods). Yet training was ad hoc, taking place without a link to
job effectiveness. PAGD components were revised often, usually upon change in Bank
task manager or Government minister, and not carried out within a strategic framework
(paras 5-9).
5.   Given the Government's absorptive capacity, the credit amount was too high.
While the SAR estimated six years from signature to project completion, actual
supervision time was nine years. Of the original IDA amount of SDR 12.5 million, SDR
i



11.7 million was disbursed and SDR 793,159 cancelled. Of the $2.0 million Canadian
grant, $1.67 million was disbursed and $326,000 was cancelled (para 14).
6.  Borrower performance. Factors not subject to Government control which affected
implementation included a weak macroeconomic environment and Bank performance.
Supervision was characterized by turnover in task managers (six), each with his/her own
vision of how the project should be implemented. Four factors subject to Government
control that affected achievement of objectives were commitment, macroeconomic
policies, appointment of key staff and administrative procedures (paras 10-14).
7.   Government commitment to the project was absent from the very beginning. The
interministerial committee set up to oversee project implementation met only once, and
other decision-making groups were either dysfunctional or not operational. The PAGD-
financed activities in support of economic policies were implemented partially or not at
all, which led to cancellation of the third tranche of SAL IV. In addition, the attention of
Senegalese authorities was diverted from medium-term development progress under the
PAGD to the availability of quick-disbursing budgetary assistance. Lack of motivation
and performance of key staff affected implementation. Factors which adversely affected
implementation were: (a) frequent turnover of ministers and staff in the beneficiary
executing departments; and (b) weak project management, which was unable to
effectively monitor and supervise project implementation.  Slow and cumbersome
administrative procedures often produced long delays in procurement of goods and
services and in disbursements (paras 13, 28-34).
8.   Bank performance was deficient, from identification through supervision. The
project was supply-driven and did not reflect Government's macroeconomic strategy
because there was none. During identification, the stated project objective was "to install
a commitment and develop a capacity to propose a reform strategy and carry it out." At
preparation, the Bank had recognized the Government's institutional weaknesses,
insufficient political will, reticence to seek Bank advice on politically sensitive economic
reform issues and lack of demand for policy analysis. Yet it designed an operation that
was too ambitious, a project to formulate a strategy to address issues each of which was
sufficiently complex to warrant a TA project of its own. There is no evidence that
lessons were learned from previous TA operations, where a pervasive issue was the role
and responsibilities of TA. The SDA component was added at the end of appraisal,
without explanation for its sudden inclusion. Lack of Government commitment was
signaled by Bank staff, from identification through appraisal (paras 20-23).
9.   Supervision was mostly deficient.  There were lack of continuity in task
management and insufficient supervision of this labor-intensive operation, with an
average of a single macroeconomic and SDA mission per year. As administrator for the
CIDA funds, the Bank was at fault for not resolving more quickly the obstacle to using
them.  Supervision missions identified implementation problems, but Forms 590
consistently rated Satisfactory the DO and IP. Complementary donor collaboration was
hardly mentioned, although SDA Bank staff usually undertook joint missions with CIDA,
the co-financier of this component. During turnover in task managers and Bank
management, no manager queried the disconnect between Form 590 ratings and aide-
.i.



memoires or took responsibility to close the project that was clearly not meeting
objectives (paras 24-7).
Summary of Findings
10. Assessment of the project outcome is highly unsatisfactory. After nine years, it
failed to achieve its major objectives. There is no centralized personnel roster to link
personnel and payroll management. There is no system to report on household standards
of living to monitor the most vulnerable population. On-the-job training took place and
some technical skills were upgraded. But there were no performance indicators by which
to judge skills transfer so one cannot judge the outcome of this objective. With the
benefit of hindsight, it would have been preferable to close the PAGD credit earlier, by
not extending the closing date three times (paras 35-6).
11. Project sustainability is unlikely. Borrower commitment, political will and broad-
based support did not exist during PAGD preparation and implementation. And the
Borrower did not prepare an operational plan. A performance-based incentive system was
never put in place to motivate administration personnel responsible for PAGD-financed
activities, and it is highly unlikely that any project activity would continue. Nevertheless,
authorities have demonstrated growing interest in the area of capacity-building and public
adminstration reform, as confirmed by several recent Government actions, supported by
UJNDP, the Bank and other donors (paras 17-19).
12. There is still an unfinished reform agenda. Should the Bank design a future
institutional development operation, it should do so when there exists an environment
conducive to change, switching from "business as usual" to earnest capacity-building,
with clear political will on the side of the Borrower. A future operation needs to address
up-front the unresolved issue of staff motivation, which severely affects performance in
the Senegalese administration (para 37).
13. Lessons Leaned. An important lesson learned for the Bank is that ownership is a
sine qua non for project success. A second lesson for the Bank is to recognize that lack of
motivation cannot be addressed with an agreement that has not benefited from open
debate and wide support, involving the civil service and its clients. A third lesson for the
Bank and the Government is that institutional stability and continuity are essential to
ensure responsibility for project outcome. A fourth lesson learned is for the Bank to
adjust to realities. The Senegalese institutional reality was staff turnover and lack of
incentives. The political reality was lack of Government ownership and commitment.
When these realities became clear, Bank management should have closed the PAGD.
Instead, by encouraging a disinterested government to request three extensions of the
closing date, the Bank demonstrated indecisiveness and undermined its own credibility
with the Borrower (paras 38-41).

A.   STATEMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Credit Objectives
1.   The primary objective of the project was to assist Government to build up the
internal capabilities for strategic planning, financial management and personnel
management in the relevant agencies within the Ministries of Plan and Cooperation,
Economy and Finance, and Civil Service and Labor. In particular, the project was to
support action programs prepared by these agencies to carry out the tasks related to the
implementation of the on-going structural adjustment program.
Assessment of Objectives
2.   The project's primary objective was not met. The objective was over-ambitious,
formulated unilaterally by the Bank team and based neither upon a long-term
Government strategy nor a constituency for reform in the administration. At the project
brief stage, several reviewers expressed skepticism about the lack of political will, which
was manifested throughout the lengthy preparation-appraisal process and during
implementation. The objective was also unrealistic given the institutional environment.
Lessons learned indicate that early reforms did not address behavioral aspects, even
though key problems with the Senegalese administration lie less with formal structures
than with well-entrenched habits and attitudes of people within the structures: centralized,
fragmented decision-making; compartmentalization, with overlapping responsibilities and
little coordination among ministries; and flight of qualified staff with difficulty to recruit
new ones, due to low salaries and lack of incentives.
B.   ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
3.   The degree to which the project may be judged concerning achievement of
objectives is evaluated in two categories: macroeconomic policies and institutional
development.
Macroeconomic Policies
4.   The PAGD had no impact on implementation of the Third Structural Adjustment
Loan (SAL III, Cr. 1802-SE), which closed in June, 1989, three months after the PAGD
was declared effective. The PAGD had no favorable effect on implementation of the
Fourth Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL IV, Credit 2090-SE), w}ich was approved by
IDA on February 8, 1990. The first two tranches of SAL IV were fully disbursed by
January 1992 and the third tranche was cancelled. Overall, the achievements of SAL IV
fell short of the required objectives: the PCR noted that some progress was made in
public enterprise reform, but in the area of civil service reform and wage bill restraint, the
Government's performance was most disappointing. An upward trend continued in the
size of the civil service and wage bill, with the Government unable to restrain new
recruitment, and by 1994 civil service size was larger than before the program began.
1



Furthermore, the macroeconomic environment deteriorated significantly in 1992-93 and
the repeated slippage on tranche release conditions and the failure to tackle the more
difficult reform components of the program indicated the almost non-existent
commitment of the Government to the adjustment program. OED rated the SAL IV
outcome as unsatisfactory and sustainability as unlikely.
Institutional Development
5.  In the above context, it is not surprising that institutional development achieved in
the PAGD was negligible. Moreover, project design was too complex for the weak
administrative and coordination capacity of the Borrower, which was to implement four
main components in 3 ministries (MPC, MEF, MFPT) covering eight beneficiary
departments (DP, DPFC, DGD, DGID, DDI, DS, SCS, DFP). In addition, the adoption
of a system for administering performance incentives, a condition of effectiveness, was
not implemented. A proposed performance system was approved by IDA but never
implemented. Although lack of an incentive system was raised several times by
concerned Senegalese staff involved in the PAGD, IDA supervision missions did not
follow-up  adequately  with  Government.   Consequently, staff responsible for
implementing PAGD activities were less than committed to their work. In a weak effort
to address the issue, fifteen months before the original closing date, the Bank proposed
that staff working on PAGD-financed activities receive salary supplements "according to
the same norms as other projects".
6.   Revision of Government's training policy, envisaged under the project, did not take
place. Under the civil service component, about 450 staff were trained in human resource
management.  Many staff received computerized instruction to monitor customs
clearance procedures, tax collection, debt and the civil service data base. Under the SDA
component, about 15 staff were trained in data processing and analysis and survey
methods. Yet training took place in an ad hoc manner, in the absence of a needs
assessment and a coherent policy to link training to job effectiveness.
7.   Results were uneven. On the one hand, it is unknown if the 450 trained persons in
the MFPT are managing staff. It is not known whether the 6-7 MFPT staff who benefited
from training abroad in human resources management have trained other staff, which was
part of their mandate. And while MPC staff were trained to use the debt data base to
monitor transactions, file reports indicate a limited capacity to use computers in the Debt
Department (DDI).
8.   During preparation, it was pointed out that experience with TA in Senegal had not
been entirely favorable, but the SAR did not mention any lessons learned. Yet the PAGD
funded several years of consultant services and training, for national and international
consultants, in three of four components. For the fourth component, Social Dimensions of
Adjustment (SDA), CIDA co-financing provided a long-term statistics advisor. A
separate UNDP project was to finance TA to support the Ministry of Plan in long-term
perspectives, forecasting and simulation tools; on-going French TA worked in statistics,
2



project evaluation and monitoring; and USAID provided TA in tax administration.
However, project files contain no performance evaluation or knowledge transfer to
nationals of the IDA or CIDA-financed TA. And it is not clear if the UNDP project ever
materialized or what was the outcome of the complementary French or USAID TA.
9.  The specific objective of the SDA component was to incorporate the social
dimension into the adjustment process through introduction of a system for regular
production of standard of living and household budget data.  Achievement was
negligible. A standard of living (priority) survey was carried out and production of its
statistics on living conditions were used for several reports, inter alia, the World Bank
study on living conditions in Senegal (1995) and a UNICEF report on the situation of
women and children in Senegal (1994). An integrated household survey was carried out,
with extreme delays, and data were never analyzed and published. No socio-economic
studies were finalized. As a result, there is no permanent system for monitoring
household living standards or for reporting on socio-economic conditions of the most
vulnerable groups.
C.   MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
10. Affecting achievement of project objectives were: (a) factors not generally subject
to government control; and (b) factors generally subject to government control.
Factors Not Subject to Government Control
11. Two factors fall under this category:  economic environment and Bank
performance. As stated above, the macroeconomic environment had progressively
worsened, with the real economy experiencing a serious decline in key sectors since
1990. Senegal's competitive position weakened during the SAL IV adjustment period,
due to deterioration of its terms of trade and the appreciation of its currency, the CFA
Franc, against Senegal's trading partners and competitors outside the Franc Zone. Real
GDP growth during 1988-93 averaged 1.7 percent annually, against the population
growth rate of 2.9 percent p.a. Investment levels were low in 1991 and the budget deficit
deteriorated further during the election year of 1993. The country's fiscal situation was
precarious as arrears had reached record levels and production costs were extremely high.
12. Regarding Bank performance, the turnover in Bank task managers (six), each with
his/her own vision of how the project should be implemented, adversely affected
achievement of objectives. This complaint was registered in correspondence by PAGD
management. On the management side, IDA sent the wrong message by extending the
PAGD closing date three times when it was clear that project objectives were not being
met and Government was not making a serious effort to attain them.
3



Factors Subject to Government Control
13. Government commitment, macroeconomic policies, appointment of key staff and
administrative procedures were four factors subject to Government control that affected
achievement of objectives. Government ownership of the project was absent from the
very beginning. This was aggravated by lack of commitment to project objectives and to
the reform agenda. Macroeconomic policies, designed to restore Senegal's competitive
position and achieve growth, were implemented partially or not at all. Failure to
implement the intended reforms led to the third tranche of SAL IV being postponed and
then cancelled. Key staff appointments were made, but their lack of motivation and
performance affected implementation. Among the factors which adversely affected
implementation were: (a) frequent turnover of ministers and staff in the beneficiary
executing departments; (b) weak project management, which was unable to effectively
monitor and supervise project implementation, lacked expertise to adequately manage
administrative aspects or to judge usefulness of outputs contracted for by participating
departments. Finally, slow and cumbersome administrative procedures often produced
long delays in procurement of goods and services and in disbursements.
14. All of the above factors contributed substantially to implementation delays in
project execution.  While the SAR estimated six years from signature to project
completion, actual supervision time was nine years. Of the original SDR 12.5 million,
SDR 11.7 million was disbursed and SDR 793,159 cancelled. Of the $2.0 million
Canadian grant, $1.67 million was disbursed and $326,000 was cancelled.
Other
15. Although PAGD objectives were never amended, project components were revised
often. Each time, changes focused on fewer activities in hopes that a reduced program
would produce results. Revisions were usually made upon change in Bank task manager
or Government minister but were not carried out within a strategic framework. Although
no formal mid-term evaluation took place, in 1990 project scope was first reduced to
target four areas: civil service reform, expenditure analysis and control, the treasury
function and SDA. Some components did not seem to require project support, since they
benefitted from prior or overlapping support from donor agencies (investment
programming, modernization of statistics system, computerization of customs
procedures). Other components (income tax department and customs) no longer required
funds but policy decisions:  to revise the tax code, to reorganize the income tax
department, to operate agreed-upon customs reforms in a consistent and transparent
fashion.
16. A second revision of project scope occurred in 1991, when the Bank narrowed the
focus of the civil service component, and a third was in 1992, when the Government
reoriented the same component. Again in 1994 and 1995, limited work programs formed
the basis of requests by Government for two one-year extensions of the closing date
which the Bank granted. And finally, in 1996, the Bank agreed to a third one-year
4



extension of the closing date to carry out only procurement and training under the civil
service component. AGETIP was contracted to do this procurement, since PAGD
management had proven incapable of doing so. It was unfortunate that during appraisal,
the Bank agreed to drop a proposed procurement component, since no preparatory work
had been undertaken and since the national commission for contract administration
lacked the capacity to design and execute the component. Procurement proved to be very
problematic during PAGD implementation, suffering from long delays and non-respect of
IDA procedures.
D.   PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
17. Project sustainability is unlikely. Strong Borrower commitment, political will and
broad-based support did not exist during PAGD preparation and implementation, yet
these are essential to attaining and maintaining achievements. Moreover, the Borrower
did not prepare an operational plan. A performance-based incentive system was never put
in place to motivate administration personnel responsible for PAGD-fmanced activities,
and it is highly unlikely that any project activity would continue.
18. On the positive side, there are some elements of institution-building which could be
sustained if proper incentives were put in place: (a) More than 450 persons benefited
from short-term training in human resource management and others in computer use,
statistical analysis and methods. Even if transferred elsewhere in the administration, they
should be productive. (b) National consultants, recruited to carry out several studies and
provide facilitation for seminars and training, have acquired experience that should earn
them future contracts and help develop the local consulting profession.
19. While there is no follow-on project that continues or expands activities of the
PAGD, the Bank may consider an IDF grant to support a consultative process to address
administrative reform issues. In fact, there is a growing interest by the Senegalese
authorities in the area of capacity-building and administrative reform, as confirmed by
several recent Government actions, supported by UNDP, the Bank and other donors. A
focal point for capacity-building has been established in the Ministry of Finance, in the
context of the Partnership for Capacity-building in Africa initiative.
E.   BANK PERFORMANCE
20. The Bank's performance was deficient, from identification through supervision. At
the outset, the project was a supply-driven vehicle, lacked Government ownership and did
not reflect Government's strategy because there was none. Identification was based on
the 1985 administrative assessment report, which reviewed the Senegalese
administration's organization and activities and found much centralization and
compartmentalization. The Bank decided the assessment could serve as an agenda for
determining efficiency issues that could be supported by a project. The Initial Project
Brief (IPB) stated that the project objective was "to install a commitment and develop a
capacity to propose a reform  strategy and carry it out."  The IPB also noted
5



"Government's limited receptivity to discussing needed but politically sensitive and far-
reaching changes in its institutional framework." It was naive of the Bank team to
assume that a project could indeed install commitment and that the project as designed
could succeed in an unreceptive environment.
21. Although the Bank team skill mix for the components was appropriate, preparation
was deficient. The Bank had recognized the Government's institutional weaknesses,
insufficient political will, reticence to seek Bank advice on politically sensitive
[economic reform] issues and lack of demand for policy analysis. Yet it designed an
operation that was too ambitious, a project to formulate a strategy to address issues each
of which was sufficiently complex to warrant a TA project of its own. Other than the
civil service component, which was prepared in a timely manner, Government authorities
showed little interest in preparation of the economic and financial management
component, which was finalized with a delay of nine months.
22. Bank performance in appraisal was mostly deficient. On the one hand, there is no
evidence that lessons were learned from previous TA operations, especially the First TA
credit to the parapublic sector, where a pervasive issue was the role and responsibilities of
TA. The Borrower's implementing capacity was weak: PPF experience underscored
problems in setting up procedures for each component, budgeting counterpart funds and
establishing a mechanism to monitor disbursements. Because the MPC, which had the
overall coordination mandate, tended to favor its own requests, a project administration
unit was set up outside regular Government structures. The SDA component was added
at the end of appraisal, without explanation for its sudden inclusion. Lack of Government
commitment was signaled by several Bank staff, from identification through appraisal.
23. On the other hand, the appraisal team noted project risks, took into account on-
going and proposed donor contributions and prepared a matrix with indicators of project
success, although they were not quantifiable. The Bank had only a partial plan to offset
project risks. Given the Government's absorptive capacity, the credit amount was too
high.
24.  Supervision was mostly deficient.  There was lack of continuity in task
management, with each of six task managers interpreting differently the project
objectives. There was insufficient supervision of this labor-intensive operation, with an
average of a single macroeconomic and SDA mission per year. As administrator for the
CIDA funds, the Bank was at fault for not resolving more quickly the obstacle to using
them. Several progress reports, from both the SDA and macroeconomic missions, were
missing from files. In fact, there are many gaps in the regional files, the two worst being
no documentation at all (1988-89) and only SDA correspondence in files (1993-95).
25. Supervision missions continued to identify implementation problems; nevertheless,
Forms 590 consistently rated Satisfactory the DO and IP, with only one occurrence, in
June 1994, of an Unsatisfactory IP rating. There appeared to be lack of collaboration
among staff responsible for the macroeconomic components and the SDA component,
6



moreover their missions were rarely timed to coincide. Collaboration with donors other
than CIDA was hardly mentioned. However, SDA Bank staff worked well with CIDA,
the co-financier of this component, and usually joint missions took place. Field office
staff always participated in macroeconomic supervision. In fact, a field staff became task
manager for one year.
26. In 1993, the Bank expressed concern with the level of project expenditures on non-
essential items and project management's internal controls over costs to ensure that
procurement was done in a cost-efficient manner. But no IDA mission was sent to
investigate and the situation worsened. In 1996 and 1997, the Bark criticized both the
laxism in project financial management (unreimbursed personal loans, missing
procurement documents, etc.) and the auditor's unqualified opinion on the PAGD
accounts (despite lack of reconciliation between project records and commercial bank
statements, lack of physical inventory, etc.).
27. Cognizant of all the above problems, Bank management did nlot close the project.
In fact, the Bank seemed more interested than the Government in keeping the project
open. The credit closing date was extended three times for a total of 36 months. With the
turnover in task managers and Bank management, no manager wanted to query the
disconnect between Form 590 ratings and aide-memoires or to take responsibility to close
a project that was clearly not meeting objectives.
F.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
28. Overall Borrower performance was mostly deficient. Implementation of the PAGD
was characterized on the Government side by lack of ownership and political will, little
coordination among government structures and frequent turnover of ministers and
demotivated staff. While the Minister of Civil Service showed commitment during
preparation, his successors and the other two ministers concerned indicated lack of
ownership or interest in project objectives during most of the implementation period,
which took place in a climate of economic distress, elections and stalled decision-making.
29. Project orientation was vulnerable to each ministerial reshuffle, which often
resulted in interference in project autonomy. There was lack of coordination between the
Statistics Department (DPS), which does statistical work and analysis, and the Planning
Department (DP), which is responsible for carrying out socio-economic studies and
defining an anti-poverty strategy. The project management team was weak, resulting in
lack of leadership and coordination of project activities, non-compliance with IDA
procurement procedures regarding consultant contracts, long delays in the procurement
process, confusion in use of the Canadian grant funds and insufficient internal control
mechanisms in the accounting function. Some PAGD component directors thought the
project was supposed to fund office renovation and purchase of equipment and vehicles.
Unfortunately, the PAGD management was never able to change this perception.
7



30. The interministerial committee (CICS), set up to oversee project implementation,
met only once. Other decision-making groups were either dysfunctional or not
operational: (a) the technical committee to coordinate and monitor the PAGD; (b) the
consultative group for civil service reform; (c) the committee of users of SDA surveys;
and (d) the committee to study computerization policy for the administration. The
Government was constantly prodded by the Bank to transmit overdue work programs,
finalize decrees, approve TORs and prepare requests for credit reallocation and closing
date extensions. An incentive system for staff working under the PAGD was a condition
of credit effectiveness but was never implemented.
31. The short-term priorities not envisaged in the PAGD but imposed by the SAL IV
agenda (e.g., organizational audit and voluntary departure program) had a detrimental
effect on the medium-term development progress under the project. PAGD work
programs were not followed and most of their activities were rolled over, from one year
to the next. The attention of Senegalese authorities was diverted to the availability of
quick-disbursing budgetary assistance. Furthermore, the voluntary departure program
resulted in loss of employees, which affected particularly the SDA component, when
seven trained statisticians left the DPS.
32. Under the SDA component, the priority survey to collect staendard of living data
was carried out and its findings were published and used. But the integrated household
survey (ESAM) was launched several years late, and data analysis was not completed.
DPS staff thought the proposed ESAM questionnaire was lengthy and the methodology
too complex to administer. In addition, lack of Government interest in this component,
lack of sound and solid technical leadership of the survey team and fledgling experience
of the local survey team managers exacerbated difficulties to prepare the survey.
33. Of the original seven studies identified in the SAR, few were actually completed,
and there was little follow-up by Government (see Table 7). In 1993, the Bank wrote to
express concern about the amount of financing spent on studies whose recommendations
were not implemented. Follow-up would have given credibility to Government's wish to
pursue more studies.
34. Files indicate that lack of coordination between the Ministries of Civil Service and
of Finance had been a problem for more than 12 years, with parallel systems in place and
little sharing of infornation. Even after three extensions of the credit closing date to
complete work on a centralized personnel roster to be shared between the two ministries
for personnel and payroll management, the situation has not improved. At June 30, 1997,
computer equipment had been procured and delivered and staff trained, but software
compatibility is a problem and there is no central computerized roster of staff for
personnel and payroll management.
8



G.   ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
35. Assessment of the project outcome is highly unsatisfactory. After nine years, it
failed to achieve its major objectives and has not yielded and is not expected to yield
worthwhile development results. Regarding civil service reform, the law on merit-based
promotion for the civil service was only voted by Parliament in June 1997, so it is too
early to note any changes in efficiency or culture in the administration. And there is no
centralized personnel roster to link personnel and payroll management. Regarding social
dimensions of adjustment, the data from the integrated household survey has not been
analyzed and there is no system to report on household standards of living to monitor the
most vulnerable population. However, concerning strengthening of economic and
financial management, the outcome on the ground is not as pessimistic, but not
necessarily due to this project. Between 1994 and 1996, there has been a clear
improvement in government tax revenue collection, most noticeably recovery in customs
tax revenue. In addition, Senegal has implemented a prudent debt management policy,
with recourse only to concessional financing.
36. On-the-job training took place and some technical skills were upgraded. But there
were no performance indicators by which to judge skills transfer so one cannot judge the
outcome of this objective. With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been preferable to
close the PAGD credit earlier, by not extending the closing date three times.
H.   FUTURE OPERATIONS
37. There is still an unfinished reform agenda. Should the Bank design a future
institutional development operation, it should do so when there exists an environment
conducive to change, switching from "business as usual" to earnest capacity-building,
with clear political will on the side of the Borrower. A future operation needs to address
up-front the unresolved issue of staff motivation, which severely affects performance in
the Senegalese administration.
I.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
38. The most important lesson learned for the Bank is that ownership is a sine qua non
for project success. When the PAGD was prepared, it was expected that "the project
would help install a commitment to change", in spite of a non-receptive government.
Commitment never materialized, and the Bank should realize that it cannot be put in
place with a project.
39. The Bank team acknowledged that lack of motivation was a severe problem in the
Senegalese administration and attempted to address it. As a condition of effectiveness,
the Borrower was required to adopt a system for granting performance incentives for
PAGD-beneficiary personnel. Although IDA approved a proposed system, it was never
implemented. A lesson for the Bank is to recognize that such a sensitive problem cannot
be solved with an agreement which has not benefited from open debate and wide support,
9



involving the civil service and its clients. Only when a proposed incentive system
receives broad support by users and providers will it have a chance to be successfully
implemented.
40. A third lesson for both the Bank and the Government is that institutional stability
and continuity are essential to ensure responsibility for project outcome. In Senegal,
there were several ministerial shuffles and merging of some ministries, plus turnover of
administration personnel.  Bank supervision was characterized by change in task
managers (six) and management. Bank personnel changes resulted in successive
managers avoiding to take a decision to close the credit.
41. A fourth lesson learned is for the Bank to adjust to realities. The Senegalese
institutional reality was staff turnover and lack of incentives, which discouraged
execution of work programs. The political reality was lack of Government ownership
and commitment to implement the PAGD-financed program. When these realities
became clear, Bank management should have closed the PAGD, or at the very least, not
extended the closing date three times.  Instead, by encouraging a disinterested
government to request three extensions, the Bank demonstrated indecisiveness and
undermined its own credibility with the Borrower.
