MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO TEE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A 1988 FLOOD DAMAGE RESTORATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (GOP) for SDR 30.6 million (US$40.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard terms, with 35 years maturity, and would help finance the priority
requirements for emergency restoration of designated public irrigation,
drainage, flood protection and road infrastructure damaged during the 1988
floods.
2.        Background. The Islamic Republic of Pakistan has an area of about
780,000 sq km subdivided into four Provinces - Baluchistan, North West
Frontier (NWFP), Punjab and Sind. Pakistan's population is estimated at 103
million (1987) and is growing at an annual rate of 3X. The average per capita
income is about US$360, with about 30X of the population having an income
below the absolute poverty level.
3.        The climate of Pakistan is arid to subtropical.  The mean annual
precipitation is about 600 mm. However, rainfall is erratic and much of the
Indus Plain, where crop cultivation is concentrated, receives an average of
less than 150 mm per annum. Hence, irrigation is essential for most
agricultural production. About 9O0 of the value of agricultural production
comes from the 16 million ha of irrigated land.
4.        Floods in Pakistan are mainly caused by spillage from rivers during
high flows generated in the upper catchment areas of the Himalayas and
Koh-Hindu-Kush as a result of intense monsoon rainfall (June to October),
snow-melt, steep gradients and limited valley storage. A considerable part of
these upper catchments is outside Pakistan's national boundaries. Since 1948,
"exceptionally high" flood flows (in excess of 800,000 cuseco) have been
recorded seven times (including 1988) at three or more of the gauging stations
at the five major barrages on the Indus river. To minimise flood damage, GOP
has constructed over 5,000 km of bunds, spurs and training structures and has
established an extensive flood warning network. Even so, serious damage from
exceptionally high flows still occurs, due to overtopping and/or breaching of
protective works. Damage from the 1973 and 1976 floods was estimated to have
exceeded US$1.8 billion.
5.        Pakistan experienced two separate and devastating floods in 1988.
In July and August, heavy rains fell in the upper catchment areas. This
resulted in high flows in the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which coincided
with heavy rains in Sind. Flows of over 1.1 million cusecs were recorded in
August at the Guddu and Sukkur barrages on the lower Indus river. Serious
flood damage occurred in Sind at this time. Also in August, extremely intense
rainfall occurred in NWFP and Baluchistan causing flash floods and resulting
in heavy damage. The secend flood, which occurred in September and October,
was caused by heavy rain in the upper catcbments in India of the Chenab, Rayi



12100
-2-
and Sutlej rivers where flows approached or exceeded historic levels at most
gauging stations. Damge from this flood was extremely heavy but fortunately
was limited to Punjab. Even though an assessment of flood damage to the
private sector is still to be completed, it is reported that over 400 lives
were lost, and three million people were made homeless. About one million ha
of irrigated crop land was inundated. with large losses to the cotton, rice,
and sugarcane crops, and major losses were experienced in the large industrial
area along the Ravi river in the Lahore suburbs. A comprehensive inventory of
damage to public infrastructure (irrigation, drainage, flood protection,
roads, railways, telephone and telegraph, schools, health facilities, etc) has
been completed, which indicates damage to:
(a) about 1,500 km of canals, drainage channels and flood protection
works in Punjab, three major canal conands in Sind, the Pat Feeder
canal in Baluchistan, and Warsak Lift and Mama Khil Jaded Canals in
NWFP;
(b) about 500 km of major flood protection works;
(c) over 3,000 km of roads and related structures;
(d) 15 sections of railways totaling over 100 breaches of embankments;
(e) 2,150 public buildings; and
(f) a major telephone and telegraph coaxial cable between Multan and
Bahawalpur, and telephone excbange facilities in Lahore.
6.       Undoubtedly, the level of economic activity in 1989 will be
adversely affected by the floods due to crop damage (mainly cotton and rice),
livestock losses, delays in sowing of wheat and pulses, and to disruption of
production due to inundated factories and damaged machinery, as well as to
disruption of the transport and communica:ions, service and trade sectors.
Although it is too early to ascertain accurately the effect of the floods on
output, GOP is considering a downward revision by almost 1S of the projected
GDP growth rate for FY89. Damage to infrastructure and fixed capital
investment will also have a negative impact on output growth in subsequent
years.
7.       Immediately following the floods, GOP and the Provincial governments
(GOProvinces) mobilized relief programs and undertook restoration measures
with their own funds. Even though recently GOP allocated Rs 150.0 million
(US$8.1 million equivalent) of its own funds for flood damage restoration, a
serious shortage of funds has slowed this work and is preventing full
restoration of public services. It was the magnitude of restoration work
required and the concurrent shortage of funds that resulted in GOP's urgent
request in early October 1988 for IDA assistance in this emergency. IDA
responded immediately by instructing a water sector mission which was visiting
Pakistan at the time to assess the damage and need for assistance. Subse-
quently, GOP requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and
Islamic Development Bank (IDB) in financing restoration of flood damaged
public infrastructure. Coordinating external assistance from various sources
slowed and complicated GOP's decision making process which in turn delayed
preparation of the proposed emergency Project.



1aloc
-3-
8.        The inventory of flood damage to public infrastructure (para 5)
indicates that about Rs 3.1 billion (about US$167.5 million) will be required
to restore these facilities to preflood condition. Out of this total, damage
to public irrigation, drainage, flood protection and road infrastructure
amounts to about Rs 2,215 million (about US$119.7 million). In addition to
the proposed IDA credit (US$40.0 million equivalent), ADB is preparing a
US$44.0 million loan and IDB a US$10.0 million loan, which leaves a gap of
about US$73.5 million to be financed by GOP, GOProvinces and possibly other
yet unannounced external sources. The IDA and ADB assistance is limited to
restoration of irrigation, drainage, flood protection and road facilities and
would, along with local funding by GOP, restore almost all of these damaged
works to preflood condition.  The IDB loan would be mainly for the rebtoration
of health, education, railway and telecommunications facilities.
9.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Histc_Acally, the Bank has provided
financial and technical support in response to major emergencies such as
natural disasters, war or civil disturbances, which cause major damage to
infrastructure and serious disruptions to a country's economy. Even though
remedial work after the 1988 floods has generally restored some level of
service (e.g. slow traffic over temporary bridges and non-metalled road
surfaces, and canals operating at less than full capacity), full restoration
of facilities to preflood condition awaits additional funding. GOP has severe
financial constraints. As part of its recently adopted adjustment program, it
is reducing its fiscal deficit from 8.61 of GDP in FY88 to 6.52 in FY89, and
its external current account deficit correspondingly. This situation had
already necessitated a 25% reduction in the initially approved FY89 Annual
Development Program (ADP) for the water sector. GOP's financial situation
will be further worsened by the depressing effects of the 1988 floods. GOP
needs emergency assistance now to restore the flood damaged infrastructure as
quickly as possible in order to revive economic activities. Otherwise, it
will have to divert scarce resources from other planned priority projects and
programs. GOP proposed that IDA's assistance be limited to identified public
irrigation, drainage, flood protection and road infrastructure, as these
sectors are critical to the revival of economic activity and are an area of
long-standing IDA involvement in Pakistan. The critical importance of this
type of emergency assistance is demonstrated by the results of a similar
project, the 1976 Flood Damage Restoration Project (Cr. 683-PAK), which
assisted GOP in restoring irrigation and road infrastructure damaged by a
comparable flood.
10.       The Project fully meets IDA's main criteria for emergency lending in
that:
(a)  It focuses directly on economic reconstruction and recovery rather
than relief.
(b) -The economic benefit is expected to be high although it has not been
calculated.  This expectation is based on similar projects in the
past. For example, the Project Performance Audit Report (No. 3273,
December 31, 1980) for the 1976 Flood Damage Restoration Project
(Cr. 683-PAK, US$40.0 million) recorded (pages iii, 3): The economic
benefits of the project to date have been considerable. It has been
estimated that the flood damage prevented by the restored system in
1978 amounted to more than twice the total cost of the project.

(c)  The 1988 floods were of a devastating scale, causing heavy  amage and
disruption of the country's economic activities. The last comparable
floods occurred in 1976. Hence the emergency can be regarded as
infrequent, although severe.
(     he Project is urgently needed to restore the irrigation and road
sectors which are most vital for reviving the country's economic
activity. Agriculture and commercial activities will suffer heavily
if damaged works in these sectors are not quickly restored.
(e)  Although most of the damaged structures and facilities will be
restored to their preflood condition, in some cases provision will be
made to reduce damage from future floo-is, e.g., by reducing the
number but increasing the capacity of individual openings in bridges,
and by enlarging drainage outlets to allow passage of larger flows.
11.      Project Obiectives.  The Project would assist GOP and GOProvinces in
the restoration of selected flood damaged irrigation, drainage, flood
protection, and road infrastructure.
12.      Project Description.  The Project would be carried out in a¶l four
Provinces (Map IBRD 21301) at an estimated cost of US$55.6 million. Generally,
it would be limited to the restoration to preflood condition of selected
public infrastructure. GOP and GOProvinces have selected the schemes to be
restored, by designated governmental administration units (see Appendix II to
the Technical Annex for the administrative units covered). Generally, the
Project is modelled after the 1976 Flood Damage Restoration Project
(Cr. 683-PAK).
13.      The project would provide funds for: (i) restoration (civil works) of
selected irrigation, drainage, flood protection and road infrastructure,
including bridges, culverts and other related structures; (ii) technical
assistance (supervisory consultancy services) for implementing the project;
and (iii) supervision and administration. Only In appropriate cases would
rehabilitation involve improvement, for instance, providing more vents in
bridges or enlarging drains for passing lar-ger future floods. In such cases
clearance by IDA would be required before initiating work. The civil works
restoration involves about 1.1 b llion cubic feet of earthwork, in addition to
stonework, masonry work, bituminous surfacing and structures. The table below
shows the cost of civil works (US$54.5 million), which represents 98% of total
Project cost.

14.      Proiect Implementation.  This is a multi-Provincial and multi-agency
Project and coordination at the Federal level has been assigned to the Federal
Flood Cell in the Ministry of Water and Power, and at the Provincial level to
the Departments of Irrigation (PIDs) through Provincial Flood Damage
Restoration Cells (PFDRCs). The Project would be implemented by line agencies,
employing existing staff, equipment and office facilities. The PIDs would be
responsible for restoring irrigation, drainage and flood protection works.
The Provincial Communications and Works Departments (PCWDs) would be
responsible for restoring provincial roads, as well as portions of the
National Highways in Baluchistan and NWFP. These National Highways are under
the jurisdiction of the National Highway Board (NHB), consequently project
funds for these highways will be channelled through NHB. GOP has appointed
the National Engineering Services Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd. (NESPAK) as supervisory
consultants to assist in preparing and implementing the project. NESPAK has
already assisted GOP in collecting and reviewing the flood damage information,
and preparing the project planning report. During the implementation of the
Project, NESPAK will (i) review designs and tender documents; (ii) check and
verify completed work as to quality and quantity; and (iii) assist in
preparing reimbursement applications, progress reports and the project
completion report. Specifications for civil works construetion would be thoae
of the implementing agencies, which are satisfactory to IDA.
15.      Since the restoration works are of an emergency nature, technically
simple, individually of limited size, and widely scattered in all four
Provinces, they are not suitable for ICB. The majority of these works (about
70X) would be carried out using LCB procedures and tender documents approved
by IDA. LCB proved tc, be efficient and cost effective under the 1976 Flood
Damage Restoration Projecc (Cr. 683-PAK), as well as the Irrigaticn Systems
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1239-PAK). The remaining civil works would be
undertaken by force account by the PIDs and PCWDs, as they can quickly
mobilize their large equipment pools and regularized staff to carry out this
work efficiently.
16.      The Project would be implemented over a 27-month period (October 1,
1988 to December 31, 1990). The credit closing date for the Project would be
June 30, 1991.
17.      Financing and Disbursement.  The IDA Credit of SDR 30.6 million
(US$40 million equivalent) would finance 721 of eligible expenditures for



1210c
-6-
civil works and 90X for technical assistance. Disbursement for LCB contracts
in excess of US$25,000 equivalent and for technical assistance would be
against full documentation. For LCB contracts of less than US$25.o00 and for
force account, disbursement would be against statements of expenditure (SOE)
certified by GOP officials and verfied by the supervisory consultants. To
facilitate project disbursements, Special Accounts would be established in
each of the four PIDs and in NEB.
18.      Agreed Actions.  Recognizing the urgency of restoring certain critical
flood damaged public infrastructure, e.g. to allow provision of irrigation
service for tlhe planting of rabi crops in November/December, the Provinces
initiated remedial action in late September and early October 1988.
Originally, it was envisaged that credit signing would be by February 1989, at
the latest. Because of discussions and processes associated with multi-donor
coordination, GOP and GOProvinces encountered delays in project preparation
and designation of restoration work to be included under the proposed
externally-assisted projects. Notwithstanding these delays, because of the
emergency nature of the work and the critical need for IDA assistance,
retroactive financing would be provided on an exceptional basis for
expenditures incurred on authorized project activities since October 1, 1988.
Not more than 201 (about US$8 million equivalent) of the credit would be
applied towards retroactive financing. No special conditions ror Credit
effectiveness are envisaged for the Project.
19.      Benefits.  Economic benefits will be derived from crop production and
commercial activity, which would have been lost or reduced without the
restoration of services by the Project. Bank Group experience on rehabili-
tating and restoring comparable public irrigation and road infrastructure in
such projects as the Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1239-PAK)
shows a high rate of return (in excess of 30X). Also the recorded benefits of
the 1976 Flood Damage Restoration Project (Cr. 683-PAK) have been reported to
be significant (para 10). An economic rate of return for this Project has not
been calculated, but it is expected to be substantial.
20.      Risks.  The Project is highly divisible and very similar to the 1976
Flood Damage Restoration Project (Cr. 683-PAR), which was successfully
completed within two years. Lessons learned and the organization employed in
that project have been utilized in the design of this project. The only risk
would be related to a delay in project implementation. However, GOP and
GOProvinces have already made a significant headstart and have given the
highest priority to restoring flood damaged infrastructure. Hence, project
risks are considered to be small.
21.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

at an estimated cost of US$55.6 million (see Tables 1 to 4, Appendix I for
more detail on costs; a complete set of cost tables is included in the Project
File). Generally, it would be limited to the restoration to preflood
condition of selected public irrigation, drainage, flood protection and road
infrastructure. GOP and GOProvinces have selected the schemes to be restored,
by designated governmental administration units (see Appendix II for the
administrative units covered). The Project would provide civil works
(restoration), technical assistance, and supervision and administration.
Generally, it is modelled after the 1976 Flood Damage Restoration Project (Cr.
683-PAK).
2.       Civil Works.  A complete list of the schemes to be restored under the
Project is included in the Project File. The estimated total cost of civil
works restoration is US$54.5 million (98! of Project costs), with US$40.0
million for the irrigation sector, and US$14.5 million for the road sector.
Included in these civil works costs are related miscellaneous items of
supplies, advertising, petrol, transportation expenses, and casual personnel
directly involved in civil works restoration, estimated at about 3.52 of
construction costs. The selected works to be executed are described below.
3.       Irrigation. Drainage and Flood Protection Sector.  Required works
would involve the following:
(a) Irrigation System - repair of breaches and canal banks; removal of
silt deposited by flood water; repair/reconstruction of control
structures, bridges, outlets and irrigation buildings, such as gauge
huts, resthouses, and offices.
(b) Drainage System - desilting of drainage channels,
repair/reconstruction of inlet structures, repair of breaches and
other ancillary works.
(c) Flood Protection Works - repair of breaches and restoration of
eroded embankments; repair of hydraulic structures; and restoration
of river control spurs.



- 13 -
(d) Dams and Weirs - these structures which are located in damaged
irrigation schemes of Baluchistan will require restoration of
embankments, aprons, spillways and outlet control structures, and
stone pitching.
(e) Barrages - repair of control gate and operating mechanism;
reinstatement of stonework protection on guide bunds and in
downstream aprons; and restoration of earthworks on guide and
marginal bunds.

5.       Road Sector.  The damage to roads involved breaches; washing away of
culverts and bridges; settlement of road embankments; damage to pavements; and
erosion of road shoulders. The civil works restoration includes the following:
(a)   reconstruction of portions of flood damaged roads;
(b)   repairing of breaches and damaged roads;
(c)   providing additional culverts and/or drainage vents needed for
passing larger flood flows in reconstructed road embankments;
and
(d)   reconstruction of bridges and culverts.

6.       Technical Assistance.  The Project would provide about 500 man-months
(at about US$2,000/man-month) for supervisory consultants services (para 13)
with a total estimated cost of US$1.0 million.
7.       Supervision and Administration.  Project funding for this category
would be limited to additional personnel and related costs of the coordination
units in the Federal Flood Cell (FFC) (para 9) and Provincial Flood Damage
Restoration Cells (para 11), with a total estimated cost of US$0.1 million.
The implementing agencies (para 8) would utilize existing staff, facilities
and equipment. The only Project funds provided to these agencies for managing
the Project are for miscellaneous items related to civil works (para 2).
I.  UNS TIONAL ARRANGEMENT
8.       The sectors covered by this Project, i.e. irrigation (including
drainage and flood protection) and roads, are managed at the Federal level by
the Ministries of Water and Power (MinW&P), and Communications and Works
(MinCW) respectively. Also at the Federal level a National Highway Board
(NM), a semi-autonomous organization within the MinCW, is responsible for
national highways. At the Provincial level, irrigation projects are managed
by the Provincial Irrigation Departments (PIDs), and roads, except rural
roads, by the Provincial Communications and Works Departments (PCWDs). Flood
damage restoration work will be carried out in all four Provinces. The PIDs,
PCWDs and NEB would be the implementing agencies. Hence, the project is
multi-Provincial as well as multi-agency, which requires coordination at the
Federal and Provincial levels. Coordination responsibility at the Federal
level has been assigned to the MinW&P, and at the Provinciax level to
Provincial Irrigation Departments (PIDs). The MinW&P has appointed National
Engineering Services Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd. (NESPAK) to provide supervisory
consulting services.



- 15 -
9.       Federal Flood Cell.  A Federal Flood Cell (FFC) in the MinW&P has
responsibility for managing Federal flood control activities.   The MinW&P has
designated FFC as the Federal coordinating unit for this Project. A Project
coordinator has been posted with required support staff. The unit's major
responsibilities would include: (a) coordinating and monitoring Project
activities; (b) reviewing Provincial Quarterly and Annual Progress Reports and
preparing consolidated progress reports for submission to IDA within 60 days of
each reporting period; (c) monitoring project disbursements and audits, and
facilitating compliance with IDA agreements; and (d) preparing the Project
Completion Report within six months of the closing date of the Credit.
10.      National Highway Board.  Five national highways (i.e. N-5, N-25, N-50,
N-55 and N-65), which are the responsibility of NHB, were significantly damaged
during the 1988 floods. Project funds for restoration of national highways in
Baluchistan and NIFP will be administered by NMB, even though most of the
restoration work will be carried out by the PCWDs.
11.      Provincial Flood Damage Restoration Cells.  A Provincial Flood Damage
Restoration Cell (PFDRC) has been established in each of the four PIDs. These
PFDRCs are headed by a full-time coordinator, assisted by support staff.  The
cells' intra-Provincial responsibilities would include: (a) coordinating and
monitoring Project activities; (b) operating the special accounts and
submitting IDA disbursement applications; (c) monitoring Project disburse-
ments and audits, and facilitating compliance with IDA agreements; (d) pre-
paring Quarterly and Annual Progress Reports for submission to FFC within 30
days of the end of each reporting period; and (e) making appropriate inputs to
the Project Completion Report.
12.      Provincial Irrigation, and Communications and Works Departments.
Except for a limited number of large contracts which would be administered by
NUB, the PIDs and PCWDs would implement the Project. All assigned project
work would be carried out by existing staff using available facilities and
equipment. PIDs and PCWDs responsibilities would include: (a) preparing plans,
designs and tender documents for schemes to be restored in line with agreed
specifications and procedures; (b) restoring designated schemes; (c)
maintaining separate accounts for the Project; (d) certifying quantity and
quality of completed works; (e) preparing IDA reimbursement applications for
PFDRCs; and (f) making required inputs for the Quarterly and Annual Progress
Reports, and the Project Completion Report.
13.      Supervisory Consultants.  The Project would provide about 500
man-months of supervisory consultants services including the necessary support
staff, to be supplied by NESPAK as follows:
Profession                   No.           Man-months
Project Manager               1                8
Resident Engineer             4               54
Planning Engineer             3                9
Field Engineer               10              200
Office Engineer               2               60
Sub-Engr./Inspector           8              169
Total                 500



- 16 -
The consultants would report to the Project Coordinator in the FFC and would
assist the FFC, NfB, PFDRCs, PIDs and PCWDs in carrying out their responsibi-
lities. Services to be performed by consultants would include: (a) reviewing
plans, designs and tender documents for works to ensure compliance with agreed
criteria and specifications; (b) checking works during construction to ensure
their quality meets agreed specifications, and certifying the quantities for
reimbursement applications; (c) monitoring progress to determine compliance
with the Implementation Schedule; (d) assisting in the preparation of IDA
reimbursement applications; and (e) assisting in the preparation of Quarterly
and Annual Reports and the Project Completion Report.
14.      Implementation Schedule.  The Project would be implemented over a
27-month period, with disbursements extending another six months. The Credit
closing date would be June 30, 1991. Approximately 331 of the works would be
completed during FY89, 501 during FY90 and 17% during FY91. The institutional
arrangements, including supervisory consultants, would remain in place until
the closing date.
C. PROJECT COSTS. FINANCING, AND PROCUREMENT
Cost Estimates
15.      Total project cost is estimated to be about US$55.6 million equi-
valent, with a foreign exchange component of about US$3.8 million.   Estimates
are based on FY89 prices and include about US$5.6 million taxes and duties.
Since the Government has made a detailed estimate of the costs of restoring
flood damaged infrastructure, physical contingencies for civil works are
estimated at only 5S and no physical contingencies have been included for
technical assistance, and supervision and administration. Price contingencies
are estimated as follows (1):
FY89          FY90             FY91
Foreign Costs         3.1            3.0             3.0

Financing
16.      The IDA Credit of SDR 30.6 million (US$40.0 million equivalent) would
finance all foreign exchange cost, and about 701 of local cost, or 72S of
total project cost (801 of cost net of taxes and duties). GOP would finance
the remaining US$15.6 million equivalent, including taxes and duties, or 281
of total project cost. A maximum 20% of the IDA credit (about US$8.0 million
equivalent) would be provided for retroactive financing of eligible
expenditures incurred from October 1, 1988. Table 5 shows the financial
arrangements for the Project.

Disbursements
17.      The IDA credit would be disbursed for:
(a) 721 of the cost of civil works; and
(b) 901 of the cost of local supervisory consultants.
18.      Disbursements for item (a) above would be made against statements of
expenditure (SOB) for all force account work and contracts below Rs 500,000.
Supporting documents would be retained by the implementing agencies for review
by IDA. For civil works contracts of Rs 500,000 or more, and for item (b)
above, disbursements would be made against full documentation. It is
anticipated that the final disbursement for the project will be made by June



- 18 -
30, 1991, about six months after the end of project implementation. The
estimated IDA disbursement schedule is in Appendix III. This schedule is
patterned after the disbursement profile of the 1976 Flood Damage Restoration
Project (Cr. 683-PAK) with modification to reflect the up-front disbursement
impact of Special Accounts.
19.      To facilitate project disbursements GOP would establish five Special
Accounts in the National Bank of Pakistan into which IDA would advance funds
according to standard IDA procedures for operating such accounts. These five
accounts would be operated by the PFDRCs of Baluchistan, NWFP, Punjab, and
Sind and by NHB. The total initial deposit in these accounts would be US$7.0
million and would be allocated among the individual accounts based on the
share of civil works to be undertaken. Subsequent replenishment would be made
on the basis of applications submitted by the account managers based on data
from the implementating agencies as verified by the supervisory consultants.
Assurance has been obtained from GOP that the Special Accounts would be
operated on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
Procurement

21.      Civil Works.  Civil works construction, consisting of about 700
schemes, would be carried out in all four Provinces. Since the schemes are
small and widely scattered, it is impractical to group them into packages that
would be large enough to attract international bidders. Local competitive
bidding (LCB) and force account are the only practicable approach for civil
works procurement under this Project because of its emergency nature (as much
as 20S of the value will have been started prior to anticipated signing of the
credit agreement). All such works are scheduled to be completed within a
short period of time (about 27 months). LCB procedures and related sample
tender documents have been reviewed and found acceptable to IDA. Force
account work would amount to about US$12.0 million equivalent. Force account
is necessary to fully mobilize resources within the country, including heavy
earth-moving equipment operated by public agencies such as the PIDs.
Following signing of the credit agreement, bid documents for all contracts
costing over Rs 4.0 million (about US$200,000 equivalent) would be reviewed by
IDA prior to invitation of bids. Such contracts awarded prior to credit
signing would be reviewed ex post facto by IDA to ensure they were awarded in
accordance with agreed procedures.  Where payment for such contacts is to be
made out of a Special Account, two conformed copies of the contract shall be
furnished to IDA prior to making the first payment out of such Special
Account. Force account rates for the use of government equipment would be
checked by the supervisory consultants and reviewed by IDA. These rates would
be based on estimated actual operating costs, which would exclude depreciation
of equipment and spares since most equipment and spares have been procured
under projects with external assistance.
22.      Consultants.  GOP has appointed NESPAK in accordance with Bank guide-
lines to provide supervisory consultancy services to assist in preparing and
implementing the project. NESPAK has expertise and experience with projects
of this nature. The firm performed very well under the 1976 Flood Damage
Restoration Project (Cr. 683-PAK) and was able to mobilize quickly when the
1988 emergency occurred.
Accounts and Audits
23.      PIDs, PCWDs, PFDRCs, NHB and FCC would be subject to normal GOP and
GOProvincial expenditure control and auditing procedures. Project accounts
would be kept separately by these agencies in a readily identifiable form in
accordance with sound accounting practices to reflect the expenditures
thereof.  All Project accounts would be audited by an independent auditor on a
timely basis. Assurances have been obtained from GOP and GOProvinces that:
(a) Project accounts would be audited annually and separately for the PIDs,
PCWDs, PFDRCs, NHB and FCC by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA; (b)
copies of the audit reports would be sent to IDA not later than six months
after the end of each fiscal year; and (c) the audit reports would include an
opinion as to whether IDA funds withdrawn on the basis of SOEs have been used
for the purpose for which they were provided. For all withdrawals from the
Credit made on the basis of SOEs, GOP and GOProvinces will ensure that all
records evidencing such expenditures are retained until at least one year
after IDA has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last
withdrawal was made. GOP and GOProvinces have been informed that audit
reports should be submitted to IDA on a timely basis.
